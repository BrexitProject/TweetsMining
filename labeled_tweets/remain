we can save all this wasted time  effort   money chris  simply by giving the ppl another vote  a binding #finalsay in 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu there s no way 37  of voters backing leave in a non binding ref can be the final will of the ppl  sos
in any case @keir starmer  do you think your voters are hoping when you get hold of hard evidence #brexit is a bad idea @labour can then justify a u turn towards #remain 
a little noted feature of the #euref was the asymmetry of the consequences  a narrow #remain win would have left open the chance to push for another referendum  but  #brexit once implemented would have irreversible consequences a super majority clause was necessary #stopbrexit
had the #euref electoral franchise included eu 27 nationals   16 17 year olds as in the scottish 2014 referendum  #remain would have won  so far from being based on the  will of the people  #brexit is based on the government s choice of who was allowed to vote #stopbrexit  1
i am getting increasingly frustrated with #remain voters who now accept #brexit as inevitable  taking bad policy and pretending it can be made into good policy when all the evidence points the other way is wrong  weak and dangerous  bad policy must always be called out

if there’s an election in the next year an anti #brexit alliance could win it  but political tribalism would destroy the #remain cause  we must put normal politics aside to win this battle otherwise britain will be damaged for generations to come

if there is a general election the best thing for remainers to do is to aim for a hung parliament with a larger number of libdem   green mps than now  and the way to do that will be to follow the suggestions made by #remain tactical voting organisers #stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit
the ft today  uk output is now about 0 9  lower than if the country had voted to #remain in the eu  that s almost exactly £350m a week lost to the economy  it s what #leavers promised would be available to the #nhs if we went for #brexit  it s time to #stopbrexit

i discovered today that some generally well informed anti #brexit #labour voters were unaware that even in #leave voting lab seats  majority of lab voters chose #remain  i shared this    
on behalf of #remain i would like to apologise for many warnings we made  saying #brexit would be an omnishambles clusterfuck even we didn t go far enough in saying just what a total shitshow run by 3rd rate cretins it would befor not screaming louder   constantly  i apologise
govt #tories   #labour have been in thrall 2 37  voters who voted leave in a non binding opinion poll i sense growing anger amongst the ignored #remain camp who ve always known   those who r coming to know #brexit s a con   parl better listen  we re the real majority #stopbrexit
this is what pisses me off more than anything about #brexit   there was no consensus on what #voteleave actually meant  still isn’t   these options should have been on ballot paper for clarity  uk being pushed off a cliff when the majority was actually for #remain  #stopbrexit
our #remain movement keeps growing  it s not backed by big money or the two main parties  it s formed of 10s of thousands of activists giving their time   energy  it s a huge   growing popular movement of people who care deeply about their country #stopbrexit #brexit #fbpe
sinn féin advocated for a #remain vote despite the fact that many argued #brexit would strengthen #irishunity argument  we put people first  time unionist reps did the same  an opportunity to remain in the sm   cu is a no brainer 
the #pm @theresa may worked to undermine #brexit from the start  delayed #article50 for months  paying the #eu #billions when the #uk owes nothing  now pushing #brexit deal so bad  it is encouraging calls to #remain  her ultimate goal  #bbc #sky @conservatives #tory @cchqpress
irish govt would be mad to let it through   there s no way the #brexit the uk govt espouses can avoid a harder border somewhere  whether roi ni or ni gb   fom on one side alone means passport checks somewhere  it s a tory con   just #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu 
oh  the sweet irony   is there no beginning to the govt s competence  easier  simpler  helluva lot cheaper   less damaging just to halt #brexit   #remain in the eu with friends neighbours   our european family   revoke a50   #stopbrexit
i voted #remain at #brexit but i had a change of mind after result looking at both sides of balance sheet over 50 years cost to taxpayers leaving eu £50bcost to taxpayers staying eu £450bi personally struggle seeing £450b as value for money 
1 corbyn   labour struggle with a false unity  waiting for a tory collapse to gain power whilst backing #brexit  wanting out of the sm cu ecj same as the tories   preventing a #finalsay  #remain grows by the day  they may also find they re on the wrong side of history #stopbrexit
so agree with this   the need for a binding #finalsay to #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu with our true friends   it ll save huge amounts of time  treasure   lost influence   #brexit can t be made to workwe face a bad pay   obey no say deal ora worse than bad no deal wto cliff

the majority of people in the #uk don t want #brexit or it s negative consequences it s being forced by a gov t who care not of the consequences  the ppl should have the #finalsay wth the option 2 #remain we appreciate your kind words   will do what we can to #stopbrexit #fbpe

odd considering that there is now no maj in parl for such a scenario  though there s no way any form of #brexit let alone a #tory one can leave us anything other than worse than were we to #remain in the eu  binding #finalsay in 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit

an excellent take down by @jolyonmaugham of the brexiters’ argument that having a referendum on the #brexit deal v #remain will weaken uk’s negotiating position with eu it’s clear uk needs to find a way to #exitfrombrexit

1  read in full   rtsee the message not the messenger   this encapsulates the case perfectly   rightly seeks a #finalsay in 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit  of course he s for #remain   it s easy to see why  i have one small caviat     
as someone who voted #leave i regret it massively and would vote #remain if we got another vote but i also think we need to stop blaming #corbyn for #brexit  heres why 
great if so but #remain supporters need to send a strong msg by not voting for leave backing parties   this is the last real chance to make a protest that really hurts them where it matters binding #finalsay 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit   save rights   controls 
in light of misleading information exposed  accurate information obtained  a deeper realisation   understanding of the complexities   consequences   because it affects the destiny of millions  it is wise   our duty to reconsider brexit #stopbrexit #brexit #remain #leave #fbpe

4  there s no compromise possible if a party s policy remains pro #brexit of any sort   continues to deny a #finalsay 4 all the ppl  a chance to either confirm they want it or now wish to #stopbrexit   #remain  the denial of a rethink shows a disregard 4 the will of the ppl 
dear @uklabour and @jeremycorbyn  there is no upside to #brexit for the poor and the vulnerable  there is no upside for business  the majority of people now want to #remain in the #eu  base your strategy on that for that is the view of the vast majority of @uklabour members

a message to all #leavers that claim it s unreasonable for the #remain camp to want a vote on on the final deal  including an option to exit from #brexit the uk holds general elections every five years so the public can change its mind on who runs the country  #democracy
the problem with many brexiters   is they do not understand the difference between patriotism and nationalism #stopbrexitsavebritain #fbpe #remain #brexit #stopfundinghate
why has #brexit opinion polling stopped  8 10 december #remain had a 10 point lead  one more poll released a week later  also showing uk doesn t want to #leave  then nothing for 2 months what don t they want you to know    #fbpe#stopbrexit
fantastic straw man  as ever from #remain bed wetters  coincidentally however  humans share 60  of their dna with bananas  so how about we give every banana a british passport  and the eu can have all our whingers who can t distinguish a continent with political union  #brexit 
if #brexit alone doesn t kill the #nhs  the scramble for trade deals afterwards certainly will   it s not what people voted for   we need a #finalsay #stopbrexit #toriesout #remain #brexitshambles #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #finalsayforall
#remain means the same thing to all  it is clear  it is concise  it is unequivocal #brexit means many different things to many different people even the government s mps have opposing views on its final implementation a vote on a fractured concept cannot be a valid mandate 
a warning to #brexit politicians  demographic change alone will produce a growing #remain majority  that majority feels ignored by the present political elite  and will not look kindly on the politicians who have foisted brexit on them  #stopbrexit #fbpe #waton
most of the #remain vote in 2016 came from @uklabour supporters  yet the party is avoiding discussing #brexit  the party is supposed to be democratic   policy should be determined by its members  mps   affiliates  demand labour debates brexit by emailing policyforum@labour org uk 
claire  i m a former @uklabour party member  i cannot understand why people would vote for the #labourparty again when your #brexit policy is the same as @ukip and the @conservatives #followbackproeu or #fbpe means #stopbrexit   #remain @jeremycorbyn wants #hardbrexit 
so   #remain was right about the costs  but #leave decided they wanted out anyway say  can you guys be the  ones who pay for  #brexit then all of it for starters  #markcarney has the  estimated financial cost   it ll be billions cheers 
new evidence that illegitimate russian pro #brexit influence on #euref dwarfed that of #leave campaign  surely no uk government or true british  patriot can stand behind a result engineered by a foreign power intent in weakening our country  #fbpe #waton #remain #stopbrexit
#brexit   it s a monster  that s how germany is depicting theresa today  and they are right  it is a monster and we have to fight it to #remain in the eu 
at some point this week the govt will give us a picture of the #brexit future  theresa may will pull excalibur from a stone and announce a golden age harking back to britain s ancient past  we ll then all die of bubonic plague  #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain #eu
tell me again how there was a lot of dishonesty on  both sides  of the #brexit debate for real  where s the #remain equivalent of these  
i m wondering how many real #brexit supporters there r  so many fake accounts   often far right usa  being thrown at an ever growing number of real ppl supporting #remain that i guess the only way to find out wld be to hold an actual ref in 2018   let the real voters vote #fbpe
establishment #remain campaign threatens #brexit in name only  please help show support to save #britain s fish by flying the flag  get one here      show we won t capitulate to being a #vassalstate in a  transition  obeying all #eu laws after we leave 
don t mistake my support for #remain as an ex #brexit voter as meaning to ignore the vote  i want a #2ndreferendum after we have the facts and yes i would now vote remain and hope it wins #fbpe
#brexit in a nutshell    #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #brexitshambles #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton
time for @uklabour to stop playing #brexit games  sending mixed messages   engaging in political manoeuvring  this is about the future of britain not about short term political gain  if you’re for brexit say so clearly so #remain voters know where they stand 
labour  tory  libdem  green  renew  capitalist  socialist  liberal  working class  professional  urban elite  country  woman  man  old  young  gay  straight  christian  muslim  jew  hindu  atheist  irish  welsh  scottish  english   we are #remain #fbpe #waton #brexit #finalsay
the majority opinion  will has shifted solidly to #remain  the problem is both main parties refuse to allow the will of 37  of voters to be changed   nor providevthe means to exercise that right   binding #finalsay 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit 
spot on from @vincecable the public argument for a referendum on the #brexit deal vs #remain is being won  he s also right  that corbyn is crucial on this  and  by ignoring the wishes of labour members   voters  is currently the biggest obstacle to an #exitfrombrexit@libdems
mogg should be sacked for attempting to pull such a stunt  it was a corrupt and fraudulent attempt to undermine facts  it s time everyone knew exactly what sort of person lies behind mogg s  gentleman facade #brexit #remain #fbpe
if @uklabour came out for #remain i would campaign for them 24hrs a day 7 days a week  defeating #brexit is more important than any policy differences i might have  if they also committed to #pr i would campaign even harder for them  @labour4eu
even if we get a bespoke deal better than a free trade deal which would cost 5  of gdp on the governments figures the impact is huge   4  reduction in gdp is approximately  1 trillion   where is your £35ln a week gain now  #brexit #remain @conservatives
sorry but #corbyn might have gone to loads of places but that was to keep #labour members onside and no other reason   he never showed even a tenth of the passion he showed during the ge campaign and i don t believe he even voted #remain  i really don t#brexit

1  utter madness  offering the ppl a binding #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option doesn t thwart the will nor disrespect the ref it merely confirms if the ppl still want #brexit or now to #stopbrexitsavebritain  it s the only way any #brexit can be morally legitimate
in light of evidence to suggest #leave only won #eureferendum as a result of cheating   breaking the rules pressing forward regardless with #brexit wound be deeply divisive  fundamentally undemocratic   destroy the trust of the british people #fbpe #remain #brexitgate #fairplay

#brexit  britons now back #remain over leave by 10 points  exclusive poll shows
excellent  i reckon every time #blair opens his mouth another 100 000 people at least who voted #remain become committed brexiteers  keep going @bbcnewsnight  #brexit 
yep   well aware of this   the fact they are still able to con voters into thinking their version of #brexit is going to lead to a utopian future   not the reality which is that it will become a tory brexit over time if we don t get a #finalsayforall with a #remain option  #abtv
if @keir starmer or any other #remain mp thinks there is nothing s he or anyone else can do to stop #brexit they are in the wrong job  resign as an mp now  let someone with a backbone come in and take your worthless spaceps   party is not worth saving if it ignores country pic twitter com ug1o8gpp3j

add to that the €160m paid by the #eu to various pro #remain lobby groups in the years leading up to the #referendum   you begin to see just how big a feat it was to beat the #europhile #propaganda machine   #bbc #lbc #sky #uk #tory @conhome #brexit #leave
2  oh   brussels has always been relatively immune to corporate   billionaire lobbying   possibly real reason behind #brexit  #remain #remainernow
it will take #remain voters turning away from @uklabour  and for many like me  that is not an easy choice  but to stop #brexit it s worth it  3 5 18 #toriesout2018 #theresistance #resist #rejointheeu2027
#brexit   deception  denial   democratic deficit binding #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option confirm the will of the ppl don t impose the will of far right   left ideologues 
i voted #remain   however  i have blocked many fbpe  follow back pro europe  tweeters who followed me because it is clear to me their agenda is more about unfairly trying 2 use #brexit to damage labour than about remain  remain or leave #istandwithjeremycorbyn#saturdaymorning
this is the moment even loyal moderate labour #remain voters need to place a tactical vote against party policy on #brexit   it can t undermine the parl balance but it wld send a clear message  votes can t be taken for granted by pro #brexit parties #finalsayforall #abtv
i too joined @uklabour to weaken @conservatives call for a hard #brexit  ditched them in january and joined @libdems as it became clear @jeremycorbyn is an isolationist and eurosceptic  #remain 
anyone out there who still believes corbyn is playing some clever long game on #brexit   will swing behind a referendum   #remain at the last minute  your choice is clear  vote labour tories for a catastrophic brexitvote @libdems for #finalsay referendum   an #exitfrombrexit
no you re not  it s all lies  the best deal is #remain   you know it  we ve seen your own analysis that #brexit leaves 99  of us poorer you have no mandate for this  you promised us sunlit uplands  the exact same benefits as now   even that we d be better off  lies  all of it  
so ukthis is the face of #brexitfuckwit fascist farright farage flinging fish into the river thamesfucking ridiculousshame on you you bunch of malign odious halfwit freaks#remain #fbpe pic twitter com rf1ym28gs0
the polling companies stopped asking how we would vote in a second referendum in december  after 11 12 polls showed a #remain majority and the last but one showed a ten point lead  now why would that be #fbpe#stopbrexit#cambridgeanalytica#russia#leavelies#brexit
when you think that remain campaigning was led by cameron and corbyn backed by tories who ve almost all transmogrified into rabid brexiters  while leave had the support of 80  of the press by circulation it s amazing that #remain even got 48  of the vote  #stopbrexit #brexit
unfortunately #brexit has been made easier for may and her merry band of ministers  because #jcorbyn and his pathetic archaic ideology has given brexit a shoe   in   #labour ar3  behind the worst gov in history  won’t have my vote #remain #centralist #abtv
often accused by those backing pcpeu that as #fbpe i m anti corbyn  which is bs btw  i m anti corbyn s support for #brexit   denial of a binding #finalsayforall with a #remain option my question is why do many add the  peu  when seemingly not wanting to #stopbrexitsavebritain 
scotland voted #remain  i d happily move to an independent scotland in eu  if #brexit gets ruined  bonus  #may promises a fairer society whilst riding roughshod over the nations  48     eu citizens  #stopbrexit
my respect 4 her grows with each passing week   each statement  we need many more mps to do their homework  appreciate the dire consequences of this flawed #brexit   to get behind a #finalsayforall with a #remain option  play the get out of jail free card   #stopbrexitsavebritain
your daily reminder that #brexit is built on a tissue of lies that are unravelling  the british people were sold a false prospectus  we must have a #finalsay with an option to #exitfrombrexit and #remain  anything else would be undemocratic and a danger to the national interest 
i voted for #brexit and was a committed brexit voter  but facts have changed and with another vote  i would vote #remain @campbellclaret @davidlammy @chukaumunna
more starting to say it as it is but goodness why has it taken so long to get here when it was blindingly obvious any form of #brexit must leave us poorer  weaker with fewer rights and less control binding #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option #stopbrexitsavebritain
in october there will be a meaningful parliamentary vote on the govt’s #brexit deal  on april 23rd there will be a debate on ensuring that vote includes an option to #remain if the deal does not match #brexit promises i’ve just written to my mp about it  why not do the same  
1  lord price trde mnster on @bbcr4today asked if he d still vote #remain in a ref  yes we face more imp global challenges   #brexit s a distraction  but the ppl voted 4 it   we have to do it me  26 5  of the ppl gave a non binding opinion  if it s wrong give us a #finalsay

remind me again why we are pressing on with a #brexit that can only leave us poorer  weaker  with fewer rights   less control at this time  based on the non binding opinion of a minority of the ppl   the electorate binding #finalsayforall   #remain option
in a free society  people should also be able to criticise #brexit without being called traitors  enemies of the people or being against democracy  but you don t like people criticising brexit do you nigel  #justsaying#stopbrexit2018 #finalsayforall #fbpe #remain #waton
there s a definite swing in the attitudes of #brexiters  they now blame the downsides of #brexit on the #remain camp and the eu  they won t accept the consequences of their own actions  they say they knew what they were voting for  so they need to grow up and own the downsides 
if there is no #brexit deal  brexit is so so so far from what was promised from boris et al art 50 must be revoked #waton #exitfrombrexit #stopbrexit #finalsay #remain petition if no agreement to leave the european union is reached  art 50 be withdrawn

polling shows a gradual but small shift from #leave to #remain since the referendum that we might exit the eu with a majority against  let alone the supermajority in favour required in most countries  is an affront to democracy #stopbrexit #brexit
france jumps ahead of uk in signing trade deals with india  whilst not leaving the benefits of the eu  haven t seen too many brexiters commenting on this story the only rational course for the uk is a #finalsay referendum on #brexit deal vs #remain to secure an #exitfrombrexit
excellent article by @acgrayling comprehensively explaining why there’s no rational case for there not being a referendum on the #brexit deal vs #remain problem is tory government   their labour leadership allies aren’t acting rationally at present 
govt s whole approach to a #brexit that can only leave us poorer  weaker with fewer rights and less control whilst denying the ppl a binding #finalsay on the deal with a #remain option is sinister you re only interested in imposing your will on the ppl not the will of the ppl 
far too many in the #fbpe camp want to use the next general election as a single issue campaign  voting @libdems as some kind of #remain protest will only help the tories  it is a folly as bad as the #brexit we would all like to see stopped 
#brexit is the only political issue i am passionate about  once it s over and we #remain #stopbrexit we can deal with the issues that sparked the referendum result  after all  we are called the  united  kingdom  i will only vote for those parties on this issue 
#remainer  name me a benefit of #brexit   any benefit #brexitter  it s about the principle so there aren t any benefits   but plenty of costs    #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #brexitshambles #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #reunion
so they lie to us  cheat us  ignore us and conspire to take away our rights   then they tell us to  come together  and  get behind #brexit    sorry  but no #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #brexitshambles #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #reunion
great call in to @mrjamesob on @lbc by @marcusfysh re the reasons to be cheerful about #brexit i think marcus has probably added a few thousand more to the already majority that now wish to #remain well done 
astounding the level of disassociation between #brexit causation   reality   cognitive dissonance abounds    mps need to get a grip on this debacle   if they can t #stopbrexit alone then give it back to the ppl in a #finalsayforall   we ll vote #remain

george here has some issues with eu governance    i believe he voted leave  but he is happy to campaign for #remain in a #finalsayforall  with a condition  @gfkw47 many people accept eu needs reform  but that must be done from within as #brexit is too harmful to uk’s prosperity

most sensible thing to do now is not abandon red lines but to abandon #brexit which a clear majority now want  the most democratic way to achieve it is to give the ppl a #finalsay with a #remain option which a majority of the ppl also want why do u deny the ppl the choice 
#leave won  they claim #remain lost#remain are campaigning hard because #brexit will damage jobs  the economy and people s lives why are #leave still trying to sell #brexit to the public  if it was going to be a huge success  just sit back and gloat     unless            
sorry @emilythornberry  it simply isn t true that no @uklabour mps want the chance to stop #brexit  dozens have already called for a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain  the majority of members want it and we are determined to deliver it  #marr
why does he oppose offering the ppl a #finalsay when the eu27 get one  to confirm if the will is still to #brexit or now to #stopbrexit   #remain  this merely checks if the majority still want it or not     if not what right do #brexiters have to deny that majority will 
if you re one of the millions who voted #brexit in the referendum  and had been promised it would be beneficial  do you now understand that they wilfully lie to you #stopbrexit2018 #peoplesvote #remain #finalsayforall
just to remove any uncertainty  i am hard #remain  i am marching with like minded friends on 23rd june in london who are also hard remain  hard remain means no #brexit  no may brexit and no fucking corbyn brexit  fuck brexit and what it is doing to my country #stopbrexit

#ids   during the course of the whole #brexit debate it was made categorically clear by #remain that if you vote to #leave you will have to leave the #customsunion      you will have to leave the #singlemarket   therefore you will not be members of those  
real proud of all you beutiful people out in london for the #remainathon  tonight and tomorrow  y all keep safe and create some kinda merry hell for those #brexit fans  with you in spirit  keep on keepin on to #stopbrexit  #fbpe #remain #peoplesvote 
been obvious from day 1 #brexit may happen but in no way can it work   certainly not in the country s best interest nor that of its citizens this #brexitshambles needs to be stopped  vital to #stopbrexitsavebritain to avoid more lasting damage #reject #revoke #remain #reform
poll  polling companies now consistently showing a 7 point swing towards #remain which would translate into a 55 45 result once don t knows are removed  do you think this is a sufficient mandate for a #peoplesvote on #brexit  please rt far and wide  particularly #leavers

#myengland @bbcr4today   i m british   european   a cit of the human condition  this to me represents inclusivity not exclusivity   togethering not othering #brexit represents the latter   all the hate   intolerance that goes with this #brexitshambles#finalsay #remain #reform
this shld be the true voice of labour   not the complicit fudge which ll help the tories deliver a #brexit that can only leave us poorer  weaker with fewer rights   less control  it s not bloody working out as promised so #reject #revoke #remain   #reform #finalsay #peoplesvote
we buy and sell oil on the international markets  we refine oil products  we distribute fuel  there is no question of running out of such products  pure unadulterated #remain propaganda designed to “terrorise”  think about that word ppl  #fbpe #brexit #leave #remain #lordhawhaw
the same way disgraceful @skynews can get away with spurious poll that has 2 questions to split the #brexit answers   lower voting result numbers   only 1 question for the #remain    resulting in a rigged vote
1  time 4 those mps who ve sat on their supine arses or backed this farce to get off them #brexit s failed before it s happened  a majority no longer want it   only a #peoplesvote can validate the end game we must have the #finalsay with a #remain option 
public mood continues to shift against #brexit  #remain has clear lead the numbers are now reaching point where supporting a #peoplesvote should be considered as a career saver by may or corbyn it vindicates @vincecable  s call for an #exitfrombrexit
so let s see   the eu will collapse if we vote leavenogerman car manufacturers wiil save us nowe ll get a great deal from the usanoour commonwealth will back us nowto will be fineno#brexit will be easy peasy   we ll all be better offno#finalsay #remain anyone 
we should have demolished all the #brexit lies by now  says @jon danzig in his wake up call to the #remain movement  we’ve squandered two years since the #eureferendum by not tackling head on the lies that led to brexit winning  please share his blog 
of course we mustn t panic the ppl into realising that this #brexitshambles is a total disaster   that politicians   charlatans deceived them  lied   cheated  mean to say they might start wanting a #finalsay which might mean their #brexit coup will fail #peoplesvote #remain 
in greece  italy  france   others  anti eu politicans are dropping calls to leave eu  support for membership grows only in uk  do the anti eu elite pursue their #brexit fantasythey don t want a #peoplesvotethey fear #remain will win  via @financialtimes
there’s fake news  electoral fraud  rule breaking  all ‘cheating’   whether you voted #remain or #leave  don’t let the privileged british establishment duck the blame for their mess  demand a vote on whether to accept or reject their poor deal no deal #brexit  
important to understand crux of #brexit is that #uk voted in #euref for the #magnacarta narrative identity it shares with #canzuk  not #eu’s charlemagnian alternative  it was a choice between two possible futures  #leave won   #remain lost  it’s time to #respecttheresult #ukpoli
barnier   the eu reject the uk s customs plan  tariff collection   state ni border backstop not sorted no surprises there then chequers is dead   no deal looking likely unless concessions made  erg won t accept #brexit is #fubar so #peoplesvote with a #remain option it is 
dear anti brit anti britain anti #brexit #bbcnews #skynews and #channel4news following your wall to wall coverage about referendum payment irregularities last week where is your coverage of this story impartial total #remain propaganda channels more like

so jc you back a #brexit that leaves us poorer with less control   fewer rights   deny a #peoplesvote  you ve lost a chunk of scotland   alienated a swathe of #remain  face disadvantageous boundary changes   now an angry jewish community   anything else  maybe change your stance 
1  ffs   if i hear another commentator who knows #brexit will be bad  stating we shouldn t have a #finalsay with a #remain option before we leave   have to go through with it because we have to respect the existing vote i shall be looking to buy a new tv 
‘we still haven t won the arguments we lost in the #eureferendum ’ read and share @jon danzig’s commentary on the ineffectiveness of the pro #remain  anti #brexit movement since may 2015  link  
in a #peoplesvote   a huge 77  of #labour voters would vote to #remain  we need a change in direction  we need @uklabour policy on #brexit to represent the many  not the few

so  an incentive to ditch the govt   rump of erg  on the basis of giving the ppl a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit option #brexit can t be decided in a multi issue ge unlesslabour stands for #remain so come on let s do it  but let s just #revoke not extend
ok i’m going to make this simple for you  if you don’t support food stockpiling  medical shortages  generators in the irish sea or military on the streets after a no deal #brexit then sign  now  we have run out of time  if you want to #remain you can’t just sit back  #peoplesvote
#nadinedorries @daily politics confirms the ppl can t have a #finalsay   do not have the right to change their minds  given that 26 5  of the ppl have decided we must go ahead with the erg version of #brexit #peoplesvote #remain optionlet s thwart the will of the erg

a £9 3m pro #eu publicity blitz by david cameron s government in the run up to the #brexit referendum gave the #remain side an unfair advantage  the like of which should be outlawed in future votes  an independent commission has suggested 
if you were given a #finalsayforall #peoplesvote   how would you vote   #leave #remain #eu #brexitplease rt after you vote for a larger sample 
there was speculation that boris would deliver the killer punch against pm in his resignation speechjust as geoffrey howe did to maggieit turned out to be a damp squibit was left to tory backbencher @andreajenkyns  to deliver the killer punch when did #brexit become #remain  
and no transition period    not looking good   what a stubborn disingenuous pm we have  a great leader would be able to say #brexit ain t working  it can t be made to work   here s why  we need to ak the ppl if they still want it or are prepared to #remain with the best deal 
#nadinedorries   #number10 were led by the nose by the elite #remain  establishment  they were battered by them     @dominicraab has one job and that is to prepare for a #nodeal #brexit   @juliahb1 @nadinedorries  @conhome @andreajenkyns @dcbmep #uk
 @uklabour doesn t need to help the government on #brexit  but it does need to help the country we can t sit on our hands at a time of crisis  supporting a #peoplesvote and campaigning to #remain is in the national interest and the party interest 
fraudulent  #remain was backed by government funding  plenty of working class people voted for #leave  you all said the uk economy would fall apart once #brexit was announced  here we are with the best unemployment figures for 43 years and 21 consecutive quarters of gdp growth 
as i have told you  i will not commit  as an ex #brexit voter  to voting #labour unless you support a #peoplesvote in which i would now vote #remain we need to escape this brexit madness   i live in a labour held marginal 
 @andreajenkyns asked the key question at #pmqs today  ‘when did #brexit come to mean #remain ’ the @conservatives will rue the day @theresa may allowed this to happen  fate will not be kind to them  #maymustgo #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #theresamay @dcbmep #tory
don t dismiss the danger from the populist right bigots   charlatans who have cowed moderates 4 fear of backlash oppose them   this #brexit it has 2b put back for a #finalsay   #remain option to stop them some will protest violently  so arrest them 
it s not been a good week for the bbc  has it     #cliffrichard #sircliffrichard #brexit #stopbrexit #remain #brexitshambles #fbpe #abtv #waton #peoplesvote #finalsay #bbcbias
no one seems to be reporting this  but the look on #corbyn’s face when the #remain amendment fell  was incredible proper #brexit and no general election  he then skunk out of the chamber looking a broken man 
here are six of the most ridiculous claims from #projectfear about the impact of a clean #brexit on businesses  prices and jobs  i’m paraphrasing to make my points  but all are staples of the #remain camp   1 8 
so says @andrealeadsom  the lady from the previous @conservatives leadership contest who talked the #brexit talk  but then stepped aside at last minute to give #remain er @theresa may an uncontested victory  what price was paid then  what price now  another 30 pieces of silver 
watch #borisjohnson come out for  a #softbrexit  whatever that is  or even go back to #remain   which he once was  he knows that #trump   #stevebannon   have killed  #brexit as we know it    except for hardcore  who will shelter  in #ukip the #tories rightwing  holding party 
a clear and consistent 10 point swing from #leave to #remain giving remain a 5 point lead @theresa may  at what point do we get a #peoplesvote   or are referendums only held to settle arguments within the #tory party #brexit
this is what i don t get  giving the ppl a #peoples vote to allow a #finalsay doesn t overturn #brexit unless the majority of the ppl now wish to #remain in which case it is the ppl who overturn it it s a false reason used as an excuse to avoid them forcing their will on the ppl
this invalid #brexit represents the antithesis of our core values shared with 27 other eu countries our rights are being removed w o our consent   we must be given a #peoplesvote   a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit option to confirm it if a majority now wish to #remain we must 
please listen whether you voted #leave or #remain  this gave me goosebumps  of total fear  who is going to answer that question  what happens the day after  #brexit 
in 24 hours #trump has insulted the mayor of london  humiliated the government and praised boris johnson over #brexitwe must stand up to him  the single best way to do it is to #remain in the eu  help us make it happen  help us fight back 
dear mps #brexit has hamstrung our country   you re flogging a dead horse   give it up   move on   get over it   #stopbrexit put country 1st    #peoplesvote #finalsayforall#reject #revoke #remain #reform
all so obvious to #remain   stated at the start of this #brexit farce  most mps know it but have remained shamelessly compliant to a false advisory plebiscite the only logical solution  to #revoke #remain #reform   only party self interest prevents it 
2  and if you re now backing #brexit under the labour banner then at least own up to it   stop pretending you support #remain   then ppl can at least see you for what you   the party really stand for   
i live in a #labour #conservative marginal  i will never vote tory  cameron turned this country from a decent  pleasant land to a rabid  racist  nasty place to live  i will also not vote #labour unless they offer a #peoplesvote with #remain option  my red line  ex #brexit voter

1  chris philp mp  we ve had a ref   we can t keep on having refs until we get the result the eu wants me  that s odd i would think mps would be considering what the majority of uk cits want  if a maj now want to stop #brexit   #remain then this #brexitshambles must be stopped 
 she said she was going to do it properly  and then decided to have a #remain approach to negotiations  #jacobreesmogg on @theresa may s #brexit betrayal  time to put country before party and evict her from #downingstreet   #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome
there was no mandate for no deal  therefore if that even looks like a possibility there must be a #peoplesvote with choice #nodeal or #remain in #eui can t believe we ve let the #brexit extremists lead us to this utter chaos  we need to put an end to it #stopbrexit
#brexit is a foundation of sand “rain came downstreams rosewinds blew   beat against that houseit fell with a great crash ” the nation’s courage to reverse that collective eu referendum mistake would be the first bucket of concrete #stopbrexitnow #remain #leave #ukpolitics

#brexit stopped being about the will of the ppl from the point the pm chose to press ahead   circumvent parl on the basis of a non binding opinion of only 37  voters this s all all about imposing party wills on the ppl hence the denial of a #peoplesvote   #remain option 
1  do #lexiters not understand that offering the ppl a #finalsay ref is not the same as opposing #brexit   it simply allows the ppl to confirm if they still want this #brexitshambles or now to #stopbrexit   #remain  it neither thwarts nor betrays anything   is entirely democratic
you re having a laugh aren t you   there are so many reasons why millions of us will never accept this flawed #brexit coup which is more to do with the imposition of political ideologies   party wills than the will of the ppl  denial of a#finalsay   #remain option   autocracy 
accurate   damning indictment of the damned but if she were to fall   an election follow  labour must stand with an option to #revoke  #remain   #reform to offer the ppl a fair choice  or the country may yet be damned to a #brexit that leaves us poorer  weaker   with fewer rights 
penny mordaunt @bbcr4today  i remain optimistic we will get a good deal me  which good deal would that be  and why are we going through this #brexit hell which can only leave us poorer  weaker with less control   fewer rights unless you can get a better deal   #remain #reform
on @daviddavismp and his work ethic    #brexit #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #brexitshambles #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #reunion #peoplesvote #finalsay
#brexit #leave #remain #chequersplan #selloutin a nutshell 
and a bigger platform needs to be given to the #remain activists who have the personality   character to engage the apathetic and communicate the importance of stopping #brexit  we have such talent in our community that needs to be supported not constantly criticised   undermined
our latest win comes from @winch labour brilliant to hear they have passed their version of the @remain labour   @labour4eu motion for #lab18  it calls on the party to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu #brexit is not inevitable 
 @rafaelbehr eviscerates the claim that #brexit will make britain more open to the world in just two paragraphs eu membership is a springboard to global trade  not a barrier to it if we value a global britain  we need a #peoplesvote and we need to #remain in the eu 
macron rejects may s plea for help to rescue her #brexit plan another day  another nail in the #brexit coffin  there is no  good deal   bring it to a head asap   no fudging  no transition  no extensions  just give us the #peoplesvote   a #remain option  
may   corbyn both supported #remain  both are now desperately working for leave   despite the woeful  illegal campaign  the narrow margin of the result   the warnings about the uk s world standing post #brexit i do not trust either of them  i will never vote for either of them 
#canzuk is not a #brexiteer idea  sure  it finds favour with a lot of pro #brexit folks and they have their own reasons  however  you can and  in my view  should support a free trade and movement area across canada  australia  new zealand  and the u k  if you voted #remain   
if @uklabour commits to backing a #peoplesvote and campaigns to #remain in the eu  we stand to win 4 million more votes  it s in the national interest to stop #brexit and the party interest to stop brexit join @remain labour and let s make it happen 
#brexit has a tipping point  we are almost there  don’t give up  don’t get off the #remain side of the see saw  we can only do this together  united  knowing we are on the right side of history and democracy  have a fab weekend #fbpe peeps#saturdaymorning #bankholidayweekend
is it me or has the #remain cause grown exponentially whilst the #brexit one deflates by the day  it s now only the govt  the opposition   an army of fakes sustaining it   preventing its collapse they ve nothing new to offer to justify this #brexitshambles #finalsay #stopbrexit
this #map shows that since #brexit turned out to be more complex and difficult than many might’ve assumed the public opinion has shifted and now favors #remain  source   pic twitter com 0y4gbgaixa
 @francesogrady is right  #brexit will be devastating for working people there is only one deal that will restore confidence  boost economic growth and restore the value of the pound in your pocket  that is the deal that sees britain #remain in the eu  leading  not leaving 
this two years ago i voted #remain  i hadn’t thought much about the eu but leave had no plan and farage and boris were embarrassing  i now know from my time on social media #brexit is an orchestrated concerted attempt on our democracy  we must #standup2brexit  together
i think it s the responsibility of the #brexit team to find its own comedians  rather than blaming the #remain side for not providing any god this conversation feels familiar   
believe strongly that if twitter   facebook lived up to their promises   purged every fake account #brexit would stop tomorrow   #remain would win this hands down  it s all #brexiters have to offer  fakes  delusionists   charlatans   lies #peoplesvote   a #finalsay to prove it 
obviously as a maj of members   voters back #remain  to win corbyn must gain non labour votes  unlikely while he denies a #peoplesvote   #stopbrexit option corbynites just don t get that #remainers r more committed to stopping #brexit than electing him  
if there is a ge the #remain vote goes only to remain parties  not soft brexit or fudges  you fooled us once but not again  so who wants our votes  there are millions of us  we are the makers of kings  but we are no ones fools  #peoplesvote #brexit 
#labour voter or party member opposed to #brexit  one of the 77  of lab supporters who  believe our party should back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu sign up to our grassroots campaign and take us past 7000 twitter  followers today 
i haven t had a #poll yet on the #bigissue of the day         so here goes #poll #brexitpoll #remainpoll if there were another vote how would you vote #brexit  #leave #remain #ivevotedonce #inevervote  #europeanunion #eu #ukvotes
my constituency #richmondpark is now 74  #remain  @zacgoldsmith how can you justify backing #brexit when the vast majority of your constituents clearly don t want it  
the bad news for #brexiters just keeps coming   just in case you missed it  you are the minority   tbh you always were   the uk is a #remain nation   any mp forcing this invalid #brexit upon us will not be forgiven #peoplesvote#remain optionnow 
even e  anglia   the heart of brexitland has changed its mind on #brexit only autocrats would ignore this shift   still deny the ppl their #finalsayforall #peoplesvote nowwith a #remain option may   corbyn don t you dare delay it until it s to late 
people are exhausted  no one asked for this and no one expected to be catapulted into twitter land visibility  im in awe of all the #fbpe and #remain counts who every day fight #brexit  we are all different but ultimately united  group hug and huge respect to all  thank you x
this story could not be more important  the country is turning against #brexit and the shift is biggest in #labour heartlands it is time for @uklabour to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu  it is in the party interest  it is in the national interest 
another leave voter changes to #remain  noting the #brexit that’s pursued is ‘trick against the masses for private gain’ many leave voters won’t admit they’re victims of a scam by a wealthy elite  those voters are as much victims of brexit as others are 
most popular  it s the only way out now  if a maj still want to accept a #brexit that leaves us poorer   removes rights then i guess at least it will confirm it but if a maj now wants to#revoke #remain #reform then mps must now vote to #stopbrexit #fbpe
the #remain campaign was lost by an arrogant pm who failed to understand his policies had peed off much of the country  the #brexit negotiations are being lost by an arrogant pm who fails to understand how the eu works  what a bloody shambles#peoplesvote
i often come accross tweets from #brexit accounts bemoaning the fact that #remain ers don’t “get behind it”out of interest  what do the brexiters do to “get behind it”and how’s that working out so far  
on #brexit   britain’s youth  looking to their future  want to #remain in the eu   
#brexit is all about the removal of rights   a disgrace that nearly 70 million eu  incl all 65 m uk  citizens will have rights removed without consent   in many cases without having been given a vote #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option#finalsayforall #fbpe #abtv
a little recap on the #brexit  options  and the extent to which each scenario will damage our public finances and public services  we must reject a choice between pain and more pain we must earn a #peoplesvote and win the right to #remain in the eu 
a reminder that @patel4witham s claims that #remain cheated have been dismissed by the electoral commission  just more #leavelies to add to the mountain of mendacity perverting our politics  defend democracy #stopbrexit and #jailtheleaveliars #brexit
 absolutely no way  demands for people s vote on brexit deal can be ignored  says senior momentum sourcecome on #remain   interesting bedfellows but let s give momentum our support to get a change of labour policy   thwart the erg #brexitlive poll too    
mr @jeremycorbyn you promised  no jobs lost #brexit  in #ge2017why are you not supporting #remain every type pf #brexit loses jobs71  of @uklabour voted remain in 2016youngsters supported #labour in #ge2017because you dissembledif you commit to remain  labour might win
#brexit news  sky news opinion poll shows 50  of uk citizens wishes a second referendum and 59  would vote #remain in the eu please retweet to inform   #peoplesvote #bexitshamble #fbpe #finalsay #stopbrexit
we are fighting to stop #brexit  but not for the status quo  we need to #remain in the eu  but we need reform and renewal as well  the @andrew adonis   @williamnhutton book makes the case brilliantly  
if brexit leaves you poorer who will you blame  #brexit #eu #poll #retweet #peoplesvote #remain #retweet
i voted #remain i voted for @jeremycorbyn in the 2nd leadership election after the #brexit ref i voted labour in the ge after the #brexit ref i would vote labour again tomorrow  brexit belongs entirely to the tories i stand with jeremy corbyn #wearecorbyn

this is great news   well done sarah no #brexit can now be deemed valid w o a #peoplesvote giving all voters a chance to confirm if they still want to accept a deal no deal or now to#reject #revoke #remain #reform let s #stopbrexitsavebritain together 
are we heading for ‘blind #brexit’ ie  leaving the eu but not knowing what it entails until after we have left  this is a real danger for the #remain campaign  stopping it will be like trying to capture the invisible man  we must have a strategy for this 
1  oh no you don t @michelbarnier @guyverhofstadt @donaldtusk   don t  you dare sell out the majority of brits who want to #stopbrexit   #remain whether in the uk or in the eu  a #brexit fudge won t be worth the paper its written on stop pandering to may  she has no mandate  
dear jeremy corbyn   #brexit s on the slide     you are silent   even if it happens it will fail   you ll find yourself held equally responsible for this #brexitshambles  time s running out for the uk   you back a #peoplesvote now   give us a #finalsay with a #remain option 
i ve followed this story and nearly all of the critics who argue against the welsh language are brexit fanatics  it goes to show that  for many  #brexit was about re establishing britain s supremacy  is it any wonder that the vast majority of welsh speakers voted #remain 
no kidding   the closer we get to #brexit  the more polls show britain wants to #remain in europe #peoplesvotesent via @updayuk
if you ever wondered what you’d do in 1930’ s germany   you’re doing it now   if you’re not terrified   you’re not paying attention  #brexit #remain #peoplesvote
exactly like edward heath  @theresa may is trying to deceive us over chequers deal  pretending we will be free   arrant treachery  @borisjohnson explains   #borisjohnson #boris johnson #brexit #remain #leave
1  #brexit  how likely a 2nd eu ref i d dispute the labour position  my sense is of a membership   voters   starmer wanting it but corbyn et cabal anti a #peoplesvote   esp a #remain option disgraceful mps accept 51 8  to leave but not 54  to #stopbrexit 
dear mrs may @theresa may  here is your periodic reminder that you said we are better  safer  stronger in  i think so too  any #brexit is going to be a national disaster  give the people a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
that would be cos he is a statesman with great political integrity   unlike most of the charlatans from right   left who are forcing this invalid #brexit upon an increasingly unwilling majority w o gaining confirmatory consent #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
the majority of voters never voted for it in the 1st place   a clear majority now want to stop #brexit   remain   it simply the minority of #brexiters in govt   #lexiters in opposition who are standing in the way of a democratic #peoplesvote with a #remain option #finalsayforall
a food minister  a fucking food minister   appointed to make sure we don t all starve to death after #brexit  alternatively  we could just #remain and not starve   http so   www theguardian com business 2018 sep 26 uk appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no deal brexit
in summary then  mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn wants a general election so he can push through his dream #brexit  failing that then perhaps maybe a #peoplesvote with possibly perhaps an option to #remain  full steam ahead with respecting a vote achieved by cheating   breaking the law 
dear mrs may @theresa may  you seem to have changed your mind  why can t the people the country deserves a better future than any #brexit can deliver the people deserve a democratic #peoplesvote with the option to #remain 
do you think @uklabour should back a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  #brexitplease rt after you vote for a larger sample 
jeez labour try to understand if u force a ge you alienate tory rebelsif u offer a tale of two #brexit s you lose millions of #remain votes   the ge if u give the ppl a #peoplesvote with a chance to #remain   #brexit fails  the govt falls   #remain votes return   its win win 
the majority of people wanted #brexit  you’ve had 2 years to get the best possible deal  you told us it would be easy if the majority of people would now vote to #remain  that only reflects your failure #labconf18 #lab2018
keir starmer gets a standing ovation from #labourconference2018 when he says option to #remain should be available in place of a bad #brexit 
keir starmer said it  if #brexit deal fails  nobody s ruling out a public vote   #remain must be an option  not in approved script apparently standing ovation dennis skinner s face a pictureno doubt corbyn  mcdonnell  gardiner mccluskey will do their damnedest to thwart it 
excellent speech from @keir starmer strong   clear @uklabour will oppose no deal  blind #brexit    a reckless tory #brexit   that we want election   but if that not possible   we will campaign for a  public vote  where #remain an option  @labpeoplesvote @peoplesvote uk #lab18
a direct appeal to delegates to the @uklabour conference #lab18  the british people deserve an opportunity to deliver their verdict on #brexit  the lies have been exposed  vote for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  thank you 
the money s there#remain is angry#brexit has aroused the centreparty loyalty lowvoters disillusioned with 2 party fixsocial media opens accesslibdems offer base organisationcentrist tory labour mps cometh a leader it s not 1981   the ground is fertile 
keir starmer  new #brexit ref under labour could include option to #remain  me  fine but if it ain t policy   in writing it ain t worth the paper it won t be written on #peoplesvote   remain option or no labour govt 
1  ok ge ahead  not if govt can avoid it before gerrymandering the boundaries but let s say we have 1tories  tory fubar #brexitdup  duh brexit   united irelandlabour  tory brexit at some pointsnp  brexit   indy2   sod ukwhat a choice what if all #remain voted libdem 
labour members in favour of a #peoplesvote   wanting to #remain in the eu have been sold a pig in a poke for the labour leadership #brexit will happen in contrast @libdems want a #finalsay referendum   an #exitfrombrexit time for labour mps   members to vote with their feet 
so labour nudging towards norway option while tories sliding over to canada option   hobson’s choice #brexit then  not what we want @labour4eu @remain labour @women 4 europe and many other #remain groups  we fight on  
dear @uklabour members who want to #remain  a ge before march 2019 may get you a labour government but it will also get you a labour #brexit  you have a leadership that does not want us to have a #peoplesvote 
leave mean leave spokesman stating a #peoplesvote would disenfranchise those who voted for #brexit disenfranchise   deny a vote  like happened to c  5m uk eu citizens directly affected  in the euref all voters including #brexiters would get a #finalsay u      #remain #fbpe
so no change   no commitment   no #remain option   more #brexit fudge   less time left  not bloody good enough simple majority  binding #peoplesvote for a binary #finalsayaccept the #brexitshambles or#reject #revoke #remain #reform#fbpe #abtv
#brexit  100s of young labour activists flock to newly created app to push party to back new ref don t let #corbyn  mcdonnell  gardiner   mcclusky misappropriate the #peoplesvote  it s not theirs  it s the peoples   it has a #remain option at its heart 
in the event a snap general election is called  will you lend @uklabour your vote if their policy is still for a  jobs first  #brexit and they do not support a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain please vote and retweet for the best sample  thank you 
come on peeps this is vital   jo   team have won the referral to the ecj to consider our unilateral ability to #revokea50  stop #brexit   #remain in the eu with rebate etc intact please give what you can to the battle fundyou country needs you lets also get that #peoplesvote
#nigelfarage  we need to send a clear message to #remain #mps  if you betray #brexit  we will never vote for you again   #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc @conservatives @conhome @labourleave @standup4brexit @leavemnsleave @cchqpress @theresa may #tory #conservativeparty
if they decide  not  to include #remain as a voting option in a #peoplesvote then the whole exercise will be rejected by the @peoplesvote uk movement the whole point of a #finalsay referendum is for the british people to be given an opportunity to reject #brexit#endthechaos
hang on  jeremy corbyn admits #brexit was a protest vote against policies in this country  he admits it is damaging our country and the most vulnerable  yet he has supported it from the day after  what am i missing here  oh yea an opposition  #waton #remain #stopbrexit
2  #brexit can t be decided legitimately in a ge unless #labour stands clearly on a platform to #revokea50   #remain in the eu 
don t hold your breath  if this is 2b valid he ll have to back asimple maj #peoplesvote 4 a binding #finalsay with a #remain option   a binary choice accept #brexit deal no deal or#reject #revoke #remain #reformanything else will merely be a tale of two brexits tory or labour
@bbcradio4 how dare @jeremy hunt claim that remainers will now want to speed up #brexit because the #eu is threatening to break up the uk  one of the many reasons to #remain is that we knew all along that brexit  not our #eu partners  brought this very threat  #r4today
quick poll  please rt  fbpe welcome to vote as long as you can kept it civil in the thread  rare  #brexit #voteleave #remain #theresamay #downingstreet #brexitcastlive do you want to 
1  fgs what s wrong with us i was surprised by saltzburg  not that it happened but that it happened now i thought they d let may get away with it as she hoped   kick her invalid harmful #brexit down the road judgement day sooner no more tory con#peoplesvote #remain asap
#brexit was the choice    of the #english people     in #scotland  62  voted #remain and 38  voted #brexit  in #england  54  voted #brexit and 46  #remain if london centralizes all powers sent back from the eu to westminster  a 2nd independence referendum will be justified 
only 1 q you need to answer  bearing in mind #brexit at best represents the disparate wills of only 26 5  of the ppl  if a maj of voters now wish to #remain after seeing your #brexitshambles y is it undemocratic to allow them to express that yet democratic to deny a #peoplesvote 
#brexitshambles#nhsrailwayssocial careeducationprisonsall failing   but its never the fault of ministers tory britain isn t working #brexit will make it worse #brexitislocal#peoplesvote is an urgent necessity    the #finalsayforallmust have a #remain option #fbpe
thanks tom   but no one mentions the removal of our rights  neither mps nor in the media  it is never discussed as an issue yet an entire level of protection is being stripped away w o consent #peoplesvote#finalsaysimple majbindingbinaryaccept #brexit or#remain #reform
#peoplesvote says  multiple opportunities  for #brexit ref i so hope this is the case   if #remain gets to #stopbrexit in the face of the full weight of govt   opposition trying to deny a #peoplesvote  it will have been an astounding feat against the odds
more than 8 in 10 people aged 18 20 want to #remain in the eu by offering the country a #peoplesvote @uklabour can prove we are on their side we can only stand up for young people if we stand against #brexit
1  i wonder how many of the mps in the 100 constituencies now showing a majority in favour of stopping #brexit   wishing to #remain in the eu   or those shifting close to switching are reading the runes   starting to question openly the decision to leave   backing a #peoplesvote 
she most likely can claim her constituents have changed their minds too in any case this #brexit has lost its mandate 26 5  of the ppl is not the peopletories lost their mandate in 2017labour falied to win onea maj want a #peoplesvoteif a maj want to #remain  #stopbrexit

superb to see @sadiqkhan call for #labour to embrace a #peoplesvote  on the eve of #lab18  all the momentum is with our campaign to change party policy nothing in politics is inevitable  we can stop #brexit and #remain in the eu 
now that #brexit is going so badly   #brexiters are losing the argument terminally i honestly think the term #remoaner needs 2b superceded by #bremoaner  poor dears really are struggling to see their debased brexit invalidated by reality   a majority in favour of #remain 
because incompetent @jeremycorbyn’s a dyed in the wool #brexiteer   believes the dire consequences of #brexit will drive voters to his hard left policies in desperation but he   @peoplesmomentum miscalculated as moderate #remain #labour voters like me will never vote for #corbyn
oh and btw i voted #brexit and because of people like @albawhitewolf i have changed my mind to #remain and want a #peoplesvote without people like her  i may never have changed my mind  you see i was open to reason 
more good news for the @remain labour   @labour4eu campaign thank you to members in @richmondclp for becoming the latest local party to call on the party to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu #brexit is not inevitable 
to any #queensofremain out there  thank you  this isn’t a love in  it’s a battle for what’s right  and sometimes a group hug is necessary  just to say i appreciate your efforts  #brexit is shit  stay strong and let’s support each other as we fight for #remain 
we’ve worked for two years to build this case to #prosecuteboris  this is about fighting #fakenews and dishonesty in politics  focussing on #leave or #remain with #brexit is a mistake  we need to deal with the misconduct that divided us first  #boris
this is the #brexitreality some of us have been warning about for a long time  there are 2 solutions single market   a customs union or #remain only one way to get ourselves out of this growing chaotic   economically ruinous #brexit that’s @peoplesvote uk #peoplesvote
2 yrs on from a non binding test of public opinion  based on proven lies  illegalities  absence of due diligence  lost mandates   backed by only 26 5  of the ppl various types of #brexit we do not have to respect it #peoplesvote 4 a binding #finalsay   a #remain optionrt pls

 @femi sorry is absolutely right #brexit in any form will sharpen austerity and hit hardest those who have least @uklabour must have the courage to argue for a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu  we need to commit to it at #lab18  not for it be a last resort 
more encouraging news ahead of @the tuc conference  #brexit in any form will sharpen austerity  cost jobs and hit hardest those who have least to stand up for union members  we need @uklabour to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu  
an inquiry takes time which is limited  labour must take the initiative   back a #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option now  pls don t wait for a no deal  there s enough evidence already to invalidate the ref  no more stalling #brexit removes rights   makes us poorer 
without a #finalsayforall no version of #brexit can be deemed valid   rights are to be removed w o consent too   #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain #reform option#stopbrexitsavebritain
new @kthopkins video  i asked anti #brexit campaigner femi oluwole this question — and the interview fell apart       #uk #remain #politics
how could anyone have known what #brexit meant 2 years ago when even now  2 years later  the government cannot agree on what brexit means  i voted #remain  i didn t know what brexit meant    neither did  the people   now we know it isn t going to be good  time for a #peoplesvote 
there s v  little direct action uk can do on our own to counter russian aggression but here s 2 damn good responses that would really stick in putin s craw   avoid retaliation1  increase uk s military capacity 2  stop #brexit   #remain in the eu 
dear @theresa may there was a vote two years ago that split the country roughly down the middle  at the time nobody knew what the ramifications of #brexit would be  the public are now far better informed and polling suggests they re now strongly #remain why no #peoplesvote  
#poll #peoplesvote i know there isn t yet a #finaldeal yet but i suspect everyone knows except @theresa may what it will be so when the time comes how will you vote in the #peoplesvote #thedeal #nodeal #remainineu  #remain #leave #brexit #brexitmeansbrexit #brexiter #remainer
1   a ref won t stop #brexit unless a maj want 2 #stopbrexit2  if a maj now wish to #remain it s the will of the ppl3  those denying a #finalsay r autocrats4  those forcing thru an invalid #brexitshambles r tyrants5  a #peoplesvote doesn t subvert democracy it reinforces it 
how would a #finalsay  vote  be undemocratic  the #brexit ref was  even ignoring the meddling  too close for a hard cliff edge brexit mandate to be read from it  imagine #remain had won 52 48 and that had been taken as a mandate for the euro  schengen  and full federalism 
#brexit is lose lose   it s that simple   #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
uk is not a homogenous blob  only 37  voted for #brexit  half the country want to #remain  we do not want to lose our eu citizenship   are fighting desperately to #stopbrexit  we are the first people to have to fight fork eu citizenship so we know how precious it is 
many jokes about #brexitcoin today  but issuing this at this stage of negotiations shows the utter contempt the govt have shown to #remain and the majority of the country for two and a half years  #brexit isn’t even agreed by the cabinet so why would be celebrate  #shameful
there s only 1 #budget2018 announcement that can guarantee growth   it s that #brexit will be stopped   we ll be #remain ing in the eu with the best possible deal any sovereign country has ever been able to secure it s a no brainer  all versions leave us worse off#stopbrexit
#poll in your opinion is the @bbc @bbcnews biased in favour of the #torygovernment   #brexit against those wishing to argue the case to #remain in #europeanunion #yes #no  #please #voteandretweet
our petition calling for the next #labour manifesto to pledge a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain is only 7 days old  we are already at nearly at 7 000 signatures #brexit could collapse this govt at any time  we need to be ready for all scenarios 
why all the angst about a ‘second referendum’  we want a 1st legal  fact based #brexit referendum that treats the uk electorate with a modicum of intelligence  the electorate of the united kingdom  #leave and #remain  deserved better than the 2016 debacle  we still do  #finalsay
scrutiny  accountability  transparency  honesty  integrity  disingenuity  deniabilty  illegality #brexit fantasy #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit #remain option hold these charlatans to account
it’s clear the only brexit possible is #badbrexit  be that no deal or be that a fudge  so it’s not surprising to see tweets attacking #fbpe  as it’s the only pro #remain movement there is  there are no sunlit uplands  no jobs first brexit  you either support #brexit or you don’t
come on mrs may  wipe the grins off the faces of your backstabbers  knock the wind out of the #brexiters   #lexiters   just for once put uk 1st  forget the stubborn technocrat fess up  admit the #brexit bs   offer a #peoplesvote with a #remain option reputation win people win 
#afterthemarch i knew i wasn’t alone in my passion to #remain  millions shared my belief #brexit is not the answer  yet as the week’s gone on  i realised many people hadn’t a clue about the march  we have to work harder to break out of our bubbles  to talk and debate locally
#brexit shafts our country  our people and our fellow eu citizens  on every level  we don’t have to do it  #remain is still an option and i will support everyone who is fighting to keep that on the table  it’s that simple  i will do all i can to #stopbrexit 
why do i think mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn has some responsibility for #brexit  for not opposing #brexit not saying he doesn t think it s in the best interests of our country suggesting that his idea of #brexit will be not supporting a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
john mcdonnell @bbcradio4 stating we have to respect the ref but keep all options on the table   would not clearly state  yes  to allowing a stop #brexit #remain option  me  you can t state you re respecting the ref result w o ruling out a chance to reverse it he backs #brexit
fine speech by @thesnp northern ireland spokesperson @gavnewlandssnp reminding uk govt to listen to the people of the north the majority of whom voted #remain but whose voice is not heard in @houseofcommons #northernirelandbill #brexit
we think the claim that 45 #labour mps will bail out @theresa may and back her #brexit deal is baseless but we need to send a strong message sign   share our petition  calling for a labour manifesto pledge to a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain 
despite the pathetic   somewhat unpleasant tweets over the last 48 hrs  i will reiterate that my vote is not yours to take for granted  you have to #earnmyvote  it is contingent on #brexit   supporting a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain  insults   intimidation don t work 
over   over again remoaners cling on to the “bus lie” in the hope they can derail #brexitnever do they accept the incessant lies  deceit   propaganda of the euthe #remain campaignthe £9m government ‘info leaflet’the rapidly pro remain media  establishment   institutions
they are not on our side     have done everything they can to further #brexit     really why they have done that   doeesn t matter to most #remain ers #finalsayforall #optiontoremain #finalsay 26 26   ends
so let s commit natl suicide to save the faces of the worst bunch of politicians in decades it resolves nothing a #peoplesvote at least salvages our democratic credentials if we vote #remain   #reform we ll repair   renew  if not #brexit happens   we re still in the     
anything is possible with #brexit  including a snap general election  we must be ready   sign our new @remain labour petition  calling on @jeremycorbyn to guarantee that a #labour ge manifesto would pledge a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain  
#honestpoll in your honest view  do you think that the #peoplesvote is a democratic exercise  please #vote  #retweet and let us know why  comments encouraged  debate expected #peoplesvotemarch #brexit #leave #remain #remainernow #leavernow #uk
v good to see @keir starmer say how “significant” the @peoplesvote uk march was yesterday   reconfirm @uklabour commitment to a public vote on the #brexit deal   including option to #remain if deal voted down and can’t get ge @labpeoplesvote @remain labour #peoplesvotemarch #marr
i voted #remain there shouldn t be a second vote on #brexit because that would make a mockery of #democracy but if there is a second vote i ll be voting #leave #euhaveyoursay
i’m a member of @uklabour  i voted #remain i voted for @jeremycorbyn in the 2nd leadership election after the #brexit ref i voted labour in the ge after the #brexit ref i would vote labour again tomorrow  brexit belongs entirely to the tories i stand with jeremy corbyn 
complete silence from @uklabour while at least 700 000 people march against #brexit   this could have been an election winning shoe in but you ve just lost a lot of support   it s quite simple  if you re not supporting #remain you re supporting #brexit 
#peoplesvotemarch      700 000nigel farage   harrowgate 1 200#brexit is now well past itsuse by date #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
inspired by the 700 000 on #peoplesvotemarch and want to join our campaign to ensure #labour backs a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain please take 60 seconds to sign up to our mailing list and join our movement #brexit is not inevitable 
and it has shown that there is more passionate will for the uk to #remain in the #eu than there is for #brexit  #leave simply cannot  and have not  motivated this level of public support  #farage may bribe a few into a scruffy pub with the offer of a free beer  but that s it 
waiting for the off the shropshire contingent on the #peoplesvotemarch gathers outside the dorchester  to halt the #brexit mess  we need a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with option to #remain leading to an #exitfrombrexit
the pro brexit march attracted 12 supporters this week  the #peoplesvotemarch will attract hundreds of thousands  do you see @theresa may  the will of the people is not to #brexit at any cost  the people want a vote on the #deal with an option to #remain 
i am so excited  i am seeing people beginning their travels to london  ii am buzzing with excitement we all need a vote on the final say  a democratic #peoplesvote with an option to #remain if the #brexit deal is a shitshow  pic twitter com t2bcfsdc6f
many saw this 2  yrs ago #brexit was lost when may backed by corbyn invoked a50 w o a clue or due diligence  an act ofgross negligence whether there s a fudge or no deal all versions of this #brexitshambles threaten rights jobs   our future #peoplesvote #remain option now 
from all over uk ppl of all ages  backgrounds and political views including former #leave voters will march tomorrow for a #peoplesvote deal or no deal w #remain on the ballot paper you can take back control of #brexit   end the chaos @peoplesvote uk see you there 
the govt is after forcing through a blind #brexit   to get us out of the eu w o any honesty about our final destination     that film didnt end well   #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
if you insist on being so tedious  yougov   co founded   co owned by a #brexit bonking mp   has been running a tracker for years  oldest  respected  consistent  shows a clear shift to #remain  especially amongst women we re not too proud to admit it when we make a mistake 
 we will make a success of it  no deal #brexit looks increasingly likely not going so well is it mrs may @theresa may get yourself off the hook  why not give the people a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
no to an extension of a transition period   it s a #brexit conyes to #revokea50 to allow for a #peoplesvote for a binding #finalsay with a #remain option 
yet another survey out showing a majority for #remain if a new #referendum on #brexit were held tomorrow – this time with a lead of 17 points     can we please stop treating #willofthepeople as somehow static on this issue  #endthechaos #letthepeopledecide
this filthy rag does not respect the fact that many of the 17 4m have changed their minds   in any event didn t vote for a no deal #brexit  they also think there will only be 100 000 marching on saturday for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  let s prove them wrong  bigly 
red brexit or blue brexit#labour  or tory  same #brexit same policy of leaving eu single market that wil kill jobs fight to #remain join or support the #libdems #finalsay
together  we can make the top tweets about #brexit become #remain tweets  week in  week out   as #remain ers   it is a choice that we have now  one of the few that we do have   9 9 #peoplesvotemarch #stopbrexit #fbpe
in the blue corner we have @conservatives offering singapore on sea #brexitin the red corner we have @uklabour offering venezuelalite #brexitpersonally i d rather a sunny yellow #remain @libdems#finalsayforall
#corbyn not one word about #remain or #peoplesvote#labour want their own #brexit their very own cliff edge  
fifteen minutes to go till theresa may finally admits #brexit will break our country  and so she is withdrawing article 50  #remain  right 
the co operative party  several of whom sit on #labour s front bench  have voted “almost unanimously” in support of a new referendum on #brexit – with an option to #remain  the pressure on jeremy #corbyn is growing steadily on this    #endthechaos
75  of doctors and nurses now say they would vote to #remain in any new vote on #brexit – up from 66  in 2016 – with 83  saying the famous £350m for the #nhs was a deliberate lie  is an injection of chaos really what the #health service needs  #endthechaos
i am gutted that my #brexit vote may come to pass  i want to hit myself on the head and shout  stupid  stupid  stupid  most of all i want a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain to reverse my foolishness 
as the prospect of a possible ge comes nearer  so does the inevitability of another hung parliament  i for one will not be lending @uklabour my vote while a corbyn #brexit is still on the table  rule it out  support a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain   my vote is yours 
hilarious yet chilling take on #brexit by australia’s abc insiders program  boris as you have never seen him before #stopbrexit #peoplesvote #stopbrexitsavebritain #brexitnightmare #remain #peoplesvotemarch
sick to death of #brexiters whingeing on about how #remain backers seek to  thwart reverse #stopbrexit listen you wazzocks a #peoplesvote can t thwart #brexit unless a maj of voters want it stopped  if that s so then democratically we must #revokea50 no are you brain dead  
dear @bbc  what a treat it would be if you were to give at least the same coverage to the march in london on 20th october  it s a mass rally against the far right #brexitand for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  how about it 
happy weekend everyone  this time next week we’ll be on our way to the #peoplesvotemarch  millions of us making huge efforts and sacrifices to be seen and heard  each in our own unique way  #remain is a broad  church  inclusive  supportive  our fight is #brexit  not each other
ok  #remainers  #remain british #fbpe  #peoplesvote   #stopbrexit be nice so many people are considering their choice  don t make it emotional  make it a reasonable the forces for #brexit are mobilising inane nationalism  be nice to potential #remainernow folks  safe place 
i do hate this picture  very disingenuous  for the sake of balance voted to #remain  16 141 241did not vote to remain  48 858 759 #brexit #uk
enjoying a bit of a break from 24 7 #brexit   but please can we just stop this #brexitshambles  get rid of the far right   left   get back to being the country i used to feel proud of we can you know  just #revokea50  #remain in the eu   #reform the uk #peoplesvote asap
i m a #brexit moderate who voted #remain  but since we re going to #leave we must make it work for us  i can t therefore see that either parliament or i would vote for britain to be locked into a permanent open ended customs union arrangement 
glad to hear my good buddy john major still fightin the good fight against #brexit and all who still believe in it  gotta be time for a #peoplesvote surely  #fbpe #remain 
as ken says  there is no majority for various iterations of #brexit in the hoc the uk is the same  there are so many versions of #brexit those who want to #remain far outweigh any version  particularly as so many leave voters become #remainernow
 @theresa may said in #pmqs  she has duty to deliver #brexit maybe for ukip   erg but she utterly ignores  16 1m that voted #remain 1m @britishineurope @the3million eu citizens 1 5m of @generation vote   millions that still want  @efta4uk approx 3m #remainernow
this is brilliant   sums it all up perfectly  #brexit #leave #remain #remoaners
with brexit negotiations entering their final stretch and just 5 months until brexit day  if there was a second referendum  what would be your vote now  #brexit #remain #leave
eea doesn t resolve the irish border which would also require customs union membership   in which case it s a pay   obey no say #brexit why give up the control we have to be worse off   lose rights better to #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu #peoplesvote   a #finalsayforall 
rt if you believe you have been lied to by the #leave campaign    the entire #brexit process  and also if you would vote #remain if you were given a #finalsayforall #peoplesvote if you want a #peoplesvote please continue to spread the message   
this is what #labour leadership on #brexit looks like thank you @sadiqkhan a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain in the eu  #yeswekhan
a #peoplesvote   a #remain option must be offered whether or not there s a deal any deal that leaves uk cits worse off   removes rights is wholly invalid @uklabour better back it   join the tory rebs euref   #brexit betray he people nothing to respect 
just think if govt   opposition allow this debased invalid #brexit to proceed   we lose the oversight of the ecj supported by 27 sovereign democracies   these con artists gain majority control of our legal system what s in store for us #peoplesvote #remain #stopbrexitsavebritain
unilever  one of the largest corporations in the world  has now abandoned its plan to move its hq from london to rotterdam  it will #remain in #london after #brexit along with the banks and other major companies 
nadine  think  the eu have been consistent from day 1  honest fair transparent  what is happening is the realisation brexit can’t deliver anything it promised  no one is forcing us into no deal  the choice now is #brexit or #remain  and i know which is winning  #peoplesvote 
may  asking for party unity to avoid her deal being derailed   the #brexiters risking ending up with no #brexit me  she s just admitted she knows a maj of the ppl cld vote #remain in a #peoplesvotethis woman doesn t believe in the real will of the ppl 1 person1 vote 1 time 
just be aware even if it goes ahead neither the tories nor a complicit labour leadership can ever take #remain votes for granted we will neither forgive nor forget this #brexit betrayal you ve awakened a quiet element of the electorate   forged a new alliance cometh the leader
uk ministers  #brexit plans must be stopped and @plaid cymru will campaign  hard  to keep the #uk in the #eu  the party s new leader @adamprice has said  #notmybrexit #nideinbrexit #peoplesvote #pleidlaisybobl #remain @peoplesvote hq
the insanity of #brexit grows with each passing day  had it not happened deficit cld ve been cleared there can be no good outcome given the irreversible damage but at least it can be mitigated if we get a #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
consent is indeed being manufactured  but not for may’s deal but for #remain with a combination of dangling carrots across the channel   predictions of doom should we refuse to eat them #brexit
i’ve huge sympathy with this @j amesp but i can think of something worse    that’s losing the best opportunity of stoppping #brexit that’s why i support a #peoplesvote #finalsay so we can #exitfrombrexit   #remain then i hope we don’t have any referendum for a very long time 
this is quite a development  @uklabour s shadow chancellor says a #peoplesvote on #brexit “might be an option we seize upon”  saying for the first time that #remain should be on the ballot and that ‘no deal’ should not more as we get it   #endthechaos
govt  finally admits #brexit will make us all poorer he’s going through the motions but there’s little doubt philip hammond privately is hoping may’s deal gets voted down   we have a #peoplesvote #finalsay   #exitfrombrexit   #remain no sane chancellor would want otherwise 
okay people  get on this now  send an email to your mp easily to point out that #article50 is revokable now that the european commission have confirmed it article 50 case   the good law project  rt rt rt #brexit #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain #notbuyingit #eu
waterloo may have been won on the playing fields of eton   but it is fair to say re #brexit britain has been lost on them too    #peoplesvote #stopbrexit #remain in control within the eu#brexitchaos#stopbrexitsavebritain
he speaks for millions   be warned #labour   time to abandon the #brexit ship or you ll go down with her #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit #remain in control   sort the country out  
there is no #brexit dividend  the #nhs won t be getting any extra money tell your mp this is #notmybrexit and demand a #peoplesvote on the final deal  with #remain on the ballot 
labour to block #peoplesvote taking part in #brexit debateif corbyn s allowed to dictate the terms of a #brexit related debate  denying access to a #remainer there shld be no debate utter disgrace  every step of the way he s shut down a #remain option 
govt admits to court that it s been covering up the fact it s been lying about covering up the fact it s covering up the fact it s been lying about parl not being able to #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu i think i get that  so let s stop #brexit #peoplesvote 
dear god   please just stop this effing #brexit nightmare   #stopbrexit   #remain a decent country  togethering not othering within the eu so i can get back to posting stuff on history  archaeology  art  philosophy  science  writing  poetry  nature etc  give us a #peoplesvote now
the perfect opportunity for jeremy to tell the country that #brexit in any form will hurt those who have least and he will   a  call for an immediate #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu orb  run in a snap election with a manifesto pledge to a #peoplesvote
it needs to be made clear may has signed away control to 27  separate eu vetoes before any trade deal will be signed   each of the eu27 seeking their pound of flesh whilst we re stuck in perpetual #brexit limbo #peoplesvote #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control
my lovely peeps  i need to just go some catch up work stuff  this weekend has been intense but it has shown me #brexit can not work and that #remain is so close  will be back tomorrow but please keep pushing and most of all supporting each other  #waton #fbpe  we can do this x
says the minister who worked for #deutschebank  then who instead of voting #leave as his conscience said      decided to vote #remain for his career prospects  #sajidjavid is another #careerpolitician  he is a fake   a phony  p ss off sajid  #standup4brexit #brexit #tory @dcbmep
the tide has truly turned   be warned #brexit mps your days may well be numbered  do not thwart the real will of the ppl to #stopbrexit   #remain in control that also means you jeremy abandon your deceitful #lexit   get behind a #peoplesvote or lose 
spot on   re #brexit there s no middle way  no compromise  it s always been a bad version of leave  an even worse version of this #brexitshambles vs  #stopbrexit   #remain in control may s awful blind brexit fudge must be rejected   a #peoplesvote given
#brexit  may gives way over #gibraltar after spain s  veto  threattaking back control to lose controlperhaps this time we should help mrs may close pandora s box  i know   let s have a #peoplesvote with a #stopbrexit #remain in control option 
i don t need 60 secsit s direa pay   obey no say #brexit removes rights without consentthreatens jobsundermines public serviceshands veto control to the euhamstrings economy   politics  leaves us worse off#peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit #remain option
#may says the #eu won’t give us a better deal than hers  yes they will  it’s called not leaving at all  a #peoplesvote to give the people the #finalsay on #brexit is still on the cards  if we #exitfrombrexit now we can #remain and keep our bespoke status 
both #brexit options mean lost jobs  more damage to our economy and a sharpening of austerity the only option that avoids all this self inflicted damage a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain in the eu 
this emphasises how stopping #brexit is fortunately for so many people above party @libdems like @sfejfer   myself happily campaign alongside tories like @anna soubry   lab members like @mikegalsworthy anyone wanting #peoplesvote #finalsay #exitfrombrexit   #remain is my friend
now more ministers are lining up to admit a #peoplesvote #brexit referendum is a real possibility they might think it’s a threat  many will hope it’s a promise a #finalsay with an option to #remain should lead to an #exitfrombrexit
message to #corbyn  don t  expect any #remain parties to prop up a minority #corbyn govt intent on leaving the #eu we have no electoral mandate to back #brexit whether it be a tory brexit or #labour brexit 
the stupidest thing here is that if he hacked a #peoplesvote then all indicaters suggest that #remain would win and that by itself would surely bring down this government thus triggering a general election just goes to show how much #corbyn is still clinging on to #brexit 
real headline  minister proves he knows as little as #brexiters about an eu army or is deliberately lying for publicity we had a veto in the eu   a triple lock opt out which your debased govt   its invalid #brexit are throwing away #peoplesvote #stopbrexit   #remain in control
tory pleading for labour support should be dismissed out of hand labour knows if it backs a tory #brexit it is dead as a party of govt tory #brexiters keep saying we should back the govt deal   do what is in the natl interest that would be to #stopbrexit #remain is an option
superb work by @jolyonmaugham 6 others on this  now ecj will be ruling on if a50 is unilaterally revocable  it’s important for mps to know before they vote on may’s #brexit deal   can frame arguments for a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with option to #remain   #exitfrombrexit
okay  a lot of people seem to want a #peoplesvote  i m going to do one now  the result will show which side has more determination to win  vote   share widely with your audience  this is a competition  you have 7 days  #brexit #remain #fbeu #standup4brexit
it ll end when in an #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum  the public vote for an #exitfrombrexit so we can #remain and then #brexit will finally have hit the buffers  
in which jeremy makes it totally clear he is 100 per cent committed to  #brexit  possibly more committed than may  #remain have to turn their back on him  the future is now  the country is in crisis  corbyn is complicit
no  there should be a first legal  fact based #brexit referendum that treats the uk electorate with a modicum of intelligence  the electorate of the uk  #leave and #remain  deserved better than the 2016 debacle  we still do  #finalsay
an emergency cabinet of cross party politicians not concerned with their own political careers needed to get us out of this mess  tories have lost the plot their brexit a delusional dream  #brexit #remain @uklabour @conservatives @libdems @theresa may @jeremycorbyn @vincecable
why all the angst about a ‘second referendum’  we want a first legal  fact based #brexit referendum that treats the uk electorate with a modicum of intelligence  the electorate of the uk  #leave and #remain  deserved better than the 2016 debacle  we still do  #finalsay
new @dailymailuk editor moved gently towards #remain  but today s issue is appalling  oborne s column is outrageous  twisting facts to suit a venomous campaign against a true #brexit  last one i ll buy  anyone recommend another giant crossword 
another encouraging poll on #brexit it’s time for a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with an option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit
i’ve thought this for a while  boris johnson has already said he’d prefer to #remain in the eu than to have may’s deal  after all he didn’t expect to win when he backed #brexit it was just a tactical move for future leadership of the tories  
#remain is consistently ahead in polling   has been for many weeks now  our campaigning across social media is making a positive difference we all need to keep on keeping on  making the arguments  showing the positives  welcoming #remainernow s to the #fbpe family   #brexit 
dear labour   the best way to thwart the #erg  the murdochs  the #cambridgeanalytica s  a tory #brexit  cos that s the only sort you re getting is to oppose it   #stopbrexit the democratic way is to offer a #peoplesvote   a #remain option stop bloody prevaricating  step up 
it s 876 days since the #brexit referendum  the idea that the eu is going to change the deal at the last hour because andrea leadsom  liam fox et al are on the case is fantasy it s may s deal or a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain 
dear @uklabour  are you a #remain party  or are you still clinging on to the deluded  respect the vote achieved by cheating   breaking the law  cake   eat it jobs first #brexit party your response is going to define your future  so it s important you climb down off the fence 
it is clear that @uklabour want a general election well let me be clear  if you want my vote then your manifesto must be clear and unambiguous on a #remain position i will not vote for a jobs first #brexit
1  there is no compromise   may s attempt to find one is falling apart there is no #lexit  all versions   tory #brexit  all remove rights w o consent  threatens jobs public services   are far worse than to #remain a choice betweenpay   obey no say   no deal is not a choice 
another side effect of @theresa may #remain deal is we’d continue to pay all import duties over to brussels  currently around £77m per week  not incl in our £350m wk members fees   it’s hardly taking back control of our money is it     #brexit #brexitresignations
dear @guyverhofstadt more british people actively voted for #remain in the #brexit referendum than the combined population of the 8 smallest countries in the #eu we are still eu citizens but a deal is being made that will strip us of that against our will  how is it possible 
an ordinary  decent man  tricked into voting for #brexit  now heartbroken   guilty at what s happened to our country shame on all the liars #imwithbill#peoplesvote#remain  leave voter breaks into tears as he apologises for backing brexit
“i believe with every fibre of my being that the course i ve set out is right for our country ” the pm today sounds like conviction  but mrs may  you voted #remain  you must have believed in it then   thought #brexit to be wrong for our country  so the lady’s all for turning 
i’ll be honest  as a #remain voter  this #brexit thing is going  exactly  as i thought it would   
jesus   how many times do we have to say to mps saying a #peoplesvote is simply a ruse by #remain to reverse the 2016 euref  you total wazzocks if a majority of the people vote to #reject #revokea50 #remain #reform   #brexit is stoppedthat s the majority will of the people 
1  we will not go back to square 1 if we #reject #revokea50 #remain   #reform we will have stopped #brexit   immediately the £ will rise  business will heave a huge sigh of relief   the maj of the people   most democracies will think  thank f    for that    continued below 
1  mcdonnell on @bbcr4today still after a ge   doing his absolute damnedest to avoid putting a #peoplesvote with a #stopbrexit #remain option you can feel in his every utterance  his very being  the deep desire to avoid stopping #brexit remember this 
ok mrs may  here s the real deal  you won t get your deal thru parl    frankly soon your use by date is up you believe you re right   backing your flawed #brexit deal is best for us so put your deal to us in a #peoplesvote with a #remain option  call the bluff  get out of jail
the word #remain is now being openly used on the floor of the hofc  remainers have been derided  attacked and called unpatriotic  but we stayed focussed  fair and vocal  well done every one of you who got us this far  we fight on #strongertogether#fbpe#waton#brexit
well said  my thoughts exactly when watching this debacle this morning  if england is so desperate for #brexit why doesn t england #dissolvetheukunion   leave #scotland   #northernireland to get on with what  they  voted for  to #remain in the eu   prosper as  they  want 
dominic raab resigns    that s a biggie     2 down   let s have a real #remain rebellion    follow @jojohnsonuk    may said it her deal   no deal  orno #brexit#peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit #remain
i ve known my son to put more effort into comparing breakfast cereals than most mps have done in comparing #brexit #leave vs #remain  at least he has opportunity to study things like the ingredients list  use by dates  etc whatever happened to proper consideration of options 
so theresa may admits there is a no #brexit option   that is quite significant given she has hitherto stated the only choice was her #brexit or a no deal #brexitshambles   let s take the #stopbrexit #remain route please   it s better than either of the other 2 
 @remain labour launched just under 11 months ago  we said then #brexit was not inevitable and the with leadership from #labour  we could #remain in the eu that has never been more true than it is tonight  join us and let s win a #peoplesvote  
may has finally admitted what everyone else has been saying for a long time  #brexit can be stopped all she now needs to admit is that there should be a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with the option to #remain then we can #exitfrombrexit
after a pack of spin and false claims   the pm concedes herself this is not a two way choice between her “deal”   and no deal  she says it could also mean no #brexit   all the more reason why it’s time for a @peoplesvote uk #finalsay for the public   with #remain on the ballot 
dear @maitlisi knew @jeremycorbyn campaigned for #remain  with 60  of @uklabour following his lead    that he said he voted remain  but i had no idea he d vote for #brexit given another chance  can you plse give me a link to more info on this amazing revalation @bbcnewsnight
i ve supported @jeremycorbyn since he was a joke nomination  i still think he will make a good prime minister and i want to vote for him  but right now  as i write this @carolinelucas is my leader  #stepup #brexit #remain #peoplesvote
a no deal is looking more likely  that means #remain must be the outcome  no one voted for no deal  no one voted for troops on the streets  no one voted for stockpiling  #brexit can and must be stopped 
may must failcorbyn must be overruledwe must face a no dealthen one hopes a sensible majority of mps will put country 1st   allow the ppl a get out of #brexit not quite free card   a #peoplesvote giving us the #finalsay with option to #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu 
thank you for your leadership gordon brown if #labour mps back a #peoplesvote and take the lead in the campaign  we can and will #remain in the eu #brexit is not inevitable  
considering parellels betwn #brexit   the black death which also led to basic incomes rising survivors benefitted but at an awful cost to the maj of others is there a version of this #brexitshambles that leaves the majority better off with rights intact  or might #remain be it 
 @bbcradio4  @jacob rees mogg has described calls for another referendum on #brexit as an attempt to reheat #projectfear i agree david cameron s campaign now looks like a plate of congealed left oversbut our #remain campaign is now  project hope   positive  fresh   vibrant
there s no long game  there s no cunning plan  corbyn is either a committed brexiter  or he believes a damaging #brexit necessary so he can achieve his utopian nirvana  either way he won t push for the much needed #peoplesvote #finalsay with option to #remain   #exitfrombrexit
jo johnson on #brexit #leave campaign s  his brother s  promises   a false prospectus     a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were  #peoplesvote #finalsay with option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit can t come soon enough 
rational moderate #remain mps in labour must be at their wits end as #brexit can be stopped  there s only 2 possibilities  corbyn is incapable of understanding  or deliberately misleading  only option left for those mps seems to be to leave labour   reduce it to a cultist rump  
yet more pressure for #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum as transport minister jo johnson quits and calls for a vote on the #brexit dealthat vote must have the option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit
hard to find words to describe anyone still denying that any#brexit  lost controllost influencelost rightslost jobslost incomelost public serviceslost businesseslost futureslost lives #peoplesvote#stopbrexit#stopbrexitsavebritain#reject #revokea50 #remain #reform
it s utterly astounding to think the entire workings of govt is geared to imposing an invalid blind #brexit upon the ppl with as little scrutiny  accountability   control as possible  it is also clear there is growing evidence that a maj of the ppl want to #stopbrexit   #remain 
#brexit  growing support for #remain across #wales as well 
poll shows surging support for #remain   ⁦@peoplesvote uk⁩ every welsh constituency in favour of a public vote  #cardiffcentral has highest level of support in wales  reflecting my view   what my constituents tell me every single day #brexit 
the scottish parliament has just backed a #peoplesvote by voting convincingly in favour of a @scotlibdems amendment to a government motion on #brexit  particular thanks to @scottishlabour rebels who defied their whip to abstain and voted with us  #remain #eu #exitfrombrexit
very significant result from @peoplesmomentum across all traditions in the party  a clear majority of voters  members   activists want #labour mps to vote against the withdrawal deal and then campaign to #remain in a #peoplesvote  standing against #brexit can unite the party  
every single person i know who voted #brexit would still vote brexit tomorrow  in fact  some of the people i know who voted #remain are now so bored   frustrated with this process they too would now back brexit because they just want it over and done with 
ico finds “disturbing disregard for voters’ personal privacy” in investigation into data misue during #brexit campaign  into #leave eu    #arronbanks company  clearly time for a #peoplesvote #finalsay with option to #remain leading to an #exitfrombrexit
i m going to this event with @anna soubry @madeleinakay @mikegalsworthyi believe there will be a good turnoutnumber of people in shrewsbury   shropshire openly campaigning for #peoplesvote #finalsay on #brexit grows dailythey want a #remain option to secure an #exitfrombrexit
this #friday  we ll be launching our newest local group in caernarfon   #gwyneddforeurope #gwynedddrosewrop the momentum is with us  join us and help us achieve a #peoplesvote on the final #brexit deal  with #remain on the ballot    @gogs4europe @peoplesvote uk @dafydd wigley
support remain  support the #remain party #libdems let’s find a freedom from #brexit in a #finalsayforall
largest survey yet revealed last night where public now stand on #brexit  in another vote tomorrow  we d vote to #remain by clear margin  as new info becomes available  people can and will change their view  and  increasingly  they are  let s #endthechaos 
after channel 4 last night  it is plain @nigel farage and #brexit are frit  scared witless of a #peoplesvote with a #remain option  i say that because they should be worried  i voted leave and now want to vote remain   leaving is pure madness  
the faces of the tory government minister and farage when the #c4brexit poll revealed significant swing to a #remain majority across uk were fascinating    time for @peoplesvote uk on #brexit 
looks like #wales just swung for #remain  clearly  as people rethink this issue in ever greater numbers  we require a #finalsay on #brexit so we can #endthechaos 
yet more support for a #peoplesvote referendum as 1 400 senior lawyers urge a #finalsay vote on #brexit saying it would be democratic to do so with an option to #remain the u k  can decide to take the only rational route and #exitfrombrexit
very interesting  majority  55   of british people now support at least one version of a @peoplesvote uk #finalsay on #brexit   with strongest support for a question of #remain vs leave with a  “deal”  tho see previous posts for my views on that  
signing off to do reading for tomorrow  but #remain tribe keep pushing  every single thing you do to question #brexit and demand answers helps  the tipping point is so close  do not let up  push  as hard as ever  on every front however you can  #rightsideofhistory #fbpe  
so if even #arronbanks thinks we d have been better off to #remain what argument is there left for #brexit  ffs people  gotta be time to #stopbrexit once and for all surely   #fbpe
no  she hasn t  the treacherous witch is simply calling complete surrender a  deal   this will simply mean they agree to say we ve left  while in fact we #remain  the #brexit betrayal i predicted when the tory elite chose the maybot is now all too clear
finally   forget the gagging   the govt has sought to evade scrutiny   supress dissenting voices  it s time business shot down the #brexit bs   the people were finally told the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth then we must have a #peoplesvote   a #remain option
where would rather live rt for leave   for remain #brexit #leave #remain #remoaners #brexitshambles #labour #tory #ukip
yet more support for a #peoplesvote on #brexit the momentum for a #finalsay referendum with an option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit is becoming unstoppable 
up   down the country it is the same story    when will this shambles end  the @bathforeurope are doing a great job raising awareness  #brexit #stopbrexit #remain #bath
the guy s a liar  eu citizens don t have the right to #remain here in perpetuity as members of the eu  our govt has failed to exercise the 3mth rule which is part of eu law you re bloody useless at picking up on the #brexit bs  these charlatans are let off the hook all the time 
remain also had the advantage of spending £9m on a leaflet drop to all households persuading us to vote #remain and used our money to pay for it   now that really is criminal  #brexit
our wonderful country has made a terrible mistake #brexit  i’m not voting to make my constituents #broxtowe poorer  i will continue to campaign for   will vote for @peoplesvote uk @nottpeoplesvote @conservative4pv to give my constituents a #finalsay with #remain on ballot paper
89 days to #stopbrexitkeep going #remain #fbpe   write and visit your mps  get active with local groups  join @sodemaction if you can  talk to your friends   neighbours  #brexit is more of a monstrosity than anyone thought in 2016  #resist #revokea50 #rebuild 
enjoying the fact that #remain #remainers #remainernow have not  moved on   got over it   sucked it up   as #brexiters wanted may   corbyn invoked a50w o due diligence hoping we d all fall in line  wrong we re a growing majority #revokea50 stop #brexit or face judgement day 
the media village covering #brexit outside #ukparliament has been dismantled and the almost daily #remain protestors are noticeably absent on the #collegegreen  #yellowvestuk demonstrations are expected in #jan5th in 2019
i ve been  uninvited  from a new year s dinner for not supporting #brexit i have been kicked out of the book club  we knew you were political  they said but they hadn t twigged that almost 3 years of non stop campaigning for #remain meant i didn t want brexit brexit   idiocy
errm  just a thought  how about increasing border force  enforcing 100  control over non eu immigration we always had  using the 3mth fom rule   let s #revokea50 stop #brexit   #remain in control in the eu with vetoes  opt outs   rebate taking back control to lose control 
the tory party owns #brexit  so why isn t the @uklabourowning #remain a #peoplesvote is for the many  why do the few not want you to have it 
britain will be divided for a generation or more because of @conservatives #brexit stupidity  @theresa may deal is neither #leave nor #remain  @jacob rees mogg   @owenpaterson wto option will destroy the economy  either will alienate remainers   to remain will alienate #leavers 
one of the fastest ways to distinguish a #remain vs #leave supporter is that many remainers see #brexit as a nostalgic spasm of imperial grandeur whereas most #leave supporters understand 21st c will bring bright future of mutually beneficial partnerships for #uk across the world
said it before will say it again if corbyn backs #brexit #lexit   loses the ge it will be his fault   his alone  not that of #remain voters who have principles too  we can t vote for parties backing a policy that removes rights w o consent   leaves us worse off #revokea50 #abtv
remember   anything that starts with  i voted #remain  but     is from some troll trying to trick you  #brexit is bad  #stopbrexit  #revokea50 #remainintheeu
absolutely truly brilliant from mike  thank you for such an honest post  ‘tonnes of us have had enough now ’corbyn is not labour  labour backs #remain  so we fight on more united than ever to stop people dying outside westminster and to stop #brexit breaking britain   
now we know for sure where corbyn stands on #brexit it’s time to decide the next steps  is it fanciful to think there could be an alliance of mps from all parties to argue for and achieve a #peoplesvote  we can’t let tribal politics kill our #remain movement 
as we have come to expect from @joannaccherry  a first class and informed take down of jacob rees mogg and his right wing irresponsible and deeply damaging #brexit project  well worth a listen  #remain 
with the support for a #peoplesvote #finalsay #exitfrombrexit   #remain shown in these figures  i think we can safely conclude jeremy corbyn is pursuing a #brexit policy for the few and not the many  
have struggled over c 2 wks of lurgy   c 3 yrs in the #remain trenches  i m not a bot or shill so am spent declaring a partial xmas truce fewer #brexit posts   more of the things i enjoy r r ready for the battle royale in 2019 merry xmas to all  bollox 2 #brexit #revokea50
first one of these polls from b a and a whopping 89  #remain in ireland  so much for your #irexit nonsense let alone #brexit  ireland is europe   
who is not voting for #brexit anymore  my joint work with @eleala systematically studies recent opinion polling data from @survation to decompose what is driving the swing towards #remain    read more here 
and it has to be said the #peoplesvote march compared rather favourably both numerically   in terms of crowd behaviour to some gatherings of the far right   the latter are nothing but a bunch of bullies   thugs #revokea50 stop #brexit #remain in control in the eu 
if you have a spare second today or tomorrow  send a last minute  card to your mp  and theresa if you can  demanding #remain still be considered an option  we need to keep the pressure on now more than ever  #brexit isn’t just for xmas it’s for life  #stopbrexitnow
poor vlad s worried in case the ppl wise up to the fact that #brexit is against their interests   that of their country   thwart his grand design good enough reason to#revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control with our real friends in the eu #stopbrexitsavebritain
both main parties cling to the utter delusion they can reunite the uk by either passing may s pig awful compromise or backing corbyn s fantasy #lexit bs  we are irrevocably divided for a generation the choice is simple#brexit   wreck our future or#remain   save our future
100 days  ww1 was won in the last 100 days come on #remain #remainers #remainernow    let s bring this ghastly #brexitshambles down in the last 100 days   thwart the ideologues of both far right   left  keep fighting   use #fbpe    or this #brexit is forever#revokea50 #abtv
clear answer from @ianblackfordmp to @anna soubry confirming @thesnp consider the #norwayplus ship has sailed  scotland voted to #remain   @thesnp mps want a 2nd #eu referendum with #remain on ballot paper #brexit #peoplesvote
it is amazing to me that in the #brexit disaster neither major party is expressing the will of at least half the country to #remain #givethepeopleachoice# lifeisnotabloodylobstertrap
have to say i m astounded that corbyn is still respecting a ref based on lies   illegalities   is prioritising a multi issue ge it s almost guaranteed by his #brexit stance  that he ll lose it #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control in the eu
the default setting in the event of no clarity on a #brexit future must be to #remain in the eu at least for the foreseeable future the euref didn t deliver an informed mandate on such an existential issue  lies   illegal practices debased it #revokea50
another #remain myth busted  there is no requirement for an eu member to have a minimum wage  indeed 6 member states have no minimum wage at all  denmark  italy  cyprus  austria  finland and sweden the uk government created and supports the minimum wage not the #eu#brexit 
please read and rt  many #remain supporters aren’t as old as me   therefore as well versed in political theory dogma  this excellent article explains why @jeremycorbyn   other @uklabour leaders support #brexit   nick cohen 
being allowed to change your mind is not a  betrayal    it s a blessing  the only way a #peoplesvote can reverse the decision of the #brexit referendum is if the will of the people is now #remain  how can it possibly be undemocratic to ask 
everyone who wants to #remain in the eu   supports a #peoplesvote should back the @libdems@uklabour has been lost to pro #brexit elements more in tune with leninism than social democratic  liberal   progressive values we need a sea change in uk politics
there s only 1 course of action responsible mps  putting the national interest above the will of 26 5  of it s citizens  should take in the event of the threat of no deal   that is no #brexit #revokea50   #remain in control in the eu to forge ahead would be gross negligence 
on @sophyridgesky @thesnp leader @nicolasturgeon  says #remain must be on ballot paper for second #eu referendum in order to give people the right to choose based on the facts #brexit #peoplesvote #scotlandsplaceineurope
is labour backing away from a #peoplesvote if they end up de facto helping the tories get #brexit across the line millions of #remain voters will do their utmost to bring those #lexiters down   deny corbyn govt #remainers wld be incandescent #revokea50
corbyn urges support for his #brexit planhe needs to abandon the multi issue ge bs  it can t decide #brexit and if he s dragged kicking to back a #peoplesvote  just make sure it s a simple majority binary binding with a clear #revokea50 #remain option
streets of london   #peoplesvote march      c 750 000  ignoredstreets of paris        gillets jaunes                 c 66 000    concessionsstreets of london   far right yellow vests    c 20           emergency vehicle halted#brexit #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control
surely it couldn’t be more stark for corbyn help tories pass #brexit   #libdems will overtake #labouras much as i’d like libdems to overtake labour it’s clearly time for corbyn to get behind #peoplesvote #finalsay so we can #exitfrombrexit and #remain 
one of the fastest ways to distinguish a #remain vs #leave supporter is that many remainers see #brexit as a nostalgic spasm of imperial grandeur whereas most #leave supporters understand 21st c will bring bright future of mutually beneficial partnerships for #uk across the world
“i am angry today  so i have decided to kill some #brexit unicorns ” @nickynoo007 in @pmpmagtoday  #nodeal #brexitshambles #unicorns #remain #peoplesvote
we are citizens in the united states of europe this is our president jean claude juncker @junckereu#remain #leave #brexit #uk #yellowvestuk @theresa may bizarre moment juncker ruffles woman s hair   youtube

this is a much watch  stop feeling sorry for theresa may  she isn’t listening  she is a bull in a china shop  wrecking our country in pursuit of her #brexit obsession  that is clearly bordering now on madness  #remain in the answer  the question is how best to get there
ps stop respecting #brexit  there snothing left to respect #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control in the eu 
then labour should ditch the meaningless multi issue ge con   focus on either giving the ppl the #finalsay in a #peoplesvote or to counter no deal fess up that #brexit is an appalling mistake   just #revokea50 unilaterally #remain in control in the eu with our current deal 
tell you what  we re not france  nor italy  nor greececons   labour far right  further left are mistaken in thinking they ve won the agenda in the uk #brexit s awakened the centre  i m not talking lds etc  beyond party there s now an #remain army waiting to pay you both back 
#brexit new data on voters  shift to #remain   constituency by constituency 
imagine if just for once the bbc were to visit a pro #remain area and interview young people about what they think about #brexit  you know  just for balance 
got another #brexit plan   we swap the house of commons for the house of lords   the latter become the legislative chamber   the former  now disfunctional can stfu#revokea50 #stopbrexit#remain in control in the eu just a thought  it s about as democratic as may s approach
i almost teared up at that   then the dark cold anger  at what the #govt   a majority of appalling #brexit politicians are doing to our country   our futures  took hold again #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in controlcan we swap the lords with the commons please  
so  #remain @conservatives mp s support #remainermay @theresa may to do a remain deal to remain in the #eu  its time for the 117  and more  to quit the tories and join @ukip  back leader @gerardbattenmep on #supplyandconfidence deal with @10downingstreet to deliver #ukip #brexit
i just heard richard burgon mp @skynewspolitics say that labour wanted to stop the half baked botched #brexitdeal    stop the possibility of no #brexit   it s what he said  did he mean a no deal #brexit  if not he has just lost several million #remain votes for the labour party
24hrs later and we are still no clearer on what #brexit looks look  we do know that no deal that is proposed will get through parliament  time for a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain we say 
my sincere request to parliament  brexit is not guaranteed and the british people will not forgive you if you deliver it  all those who want to stop it are praying for #remain  #revokea50 #peoplesvote history will judge which side you were on  #brexit 
to those mps who state there s no point replacing a pm at a time of #brexit crisis   i remind them someone else came back from europe with a meaningless piece of paper   she doesn t even get that replace #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control  #pmqs
the brexiters are hopelessly divided  there was never a majority for any form of #brexit  we are paying the price for a hand waving leave option in the referendum that could attract support from people with wildly conflicting ideas about #brexit  only #remain has a majority 
just remember when #brexiter   #lexiter charlatans state that they think a #peoplesvote is divisive   warn it might lead to no #brexit  what they re really saying is that they know there is now a majority of the ppl who want to #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu think on that 
all party @peoplesvote uk press conference underway led by #labour ‘s respected margaret beckett  time for everyone to step up in the national interest  only a #public #peoplesvote can settle #brexit w #remain on the ballot paper @libdems @carolinelucas @plaid cymru @thesnp
#remain now on 62  @theresa may  to continue with #brexit is criminal in the face of overwhelming evidence it is both damaging and clearly against the publics wishes  
it is amazing just how many members of our #remain #parliament begin a  statement with the words  i respect the result of the #referendum  before  proceeding to regurgitate a view which completely disrespects the result of the referendum  disgraceful political maggots  #brexit 
#brexitdeal #brexiti love john bercow   you tell  em  don t let may get away with this charade  vote to deny her delay  take the vote   decide   then fgs take the decision to move on to other options #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control 
let’s #revokea50 and #remain on the same terms we had before cameron kicked off this clusterfuck sure  it’s a bit embarrassing  but it won’t last long unlike the total  country destroying humiliation of #brexit #stopbrexit#peoplesvote
no mrs  mayno #brexit is not a risk but agreat opportunity to reset our countryto reform our politicsto reconnect our disenfranchisedto rescue our disposessedto revive hope in our hopelessto restore our place in the worldto #remain an open tolerant society#revokea50 now
i voted for @jeremycorbyntwicenever againhe took lifelong #labour voters  aspirations 71  of us voted #remain in 2016  86  now and flushed themas if we are in order to promote #tmay s #brexit#politicallyhhomelesswill vote for any #stopbrexit party
leavers  is this the #brexit you voted for if there’s #nodeal a minister will be able to overrule your doctor and decide you can’t have the medicines you need yet another reason we need that #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with an option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit
1  may s lost control of #brexitshe s history but has 1 chance to salvage a small part of her reputation   do the right thing by the country allow a #peoplesvote #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control in the eu give us a #finalsay #brexitdeal
what a superb thread from @guitarmoog sadly i suspect those that really need to read this won’t  if they did they’d have to conclude only logical course of action on #brexit is a #peoplesvote #finalsay with an option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit
it’s obvious now   and indeed always has been   that the best outcome for britain is to #remain  #brexit has always been an elite austerity project and anyone calling themselves a democratic socialist should oppose it heart and soul 
#brexit divides all parties  but we know overwhelming majority of #labour members support #remain   @peoplesvote uk  the problem is the leadership   their backers   hard leftists who’ve always been anti #eu #brexiteers
of course arron banks’ firm has  no address   who expected otherwise source of finance of #leave campaign as transparent as may’s #brexit deal is in interests of uk case for #peoplesvote #finalsay an #exitfrombrexit   #remain is becoming unchallengeable 
ps stopping #brexit is not a risk theresa may jeremy corbyn  it is an opportunity to be grasped #remain ing in the eu doesn t betray anyone   it does us a huge favour   it s just that some of us don t yet realise it #peoplesvote asap#revokea50   #remain in control
if you want the u k  to #remain in the eu   you’re inclined to vote labour  read   weep out of touch with their members and voters  corbyn   his cabal seem determined to be on the wrong side of history over #brexit as dogma continues to triumph over rational actions  
this vote took #brexit from the people and handed it to a #remain parliament 
i have to say the ian blackford   the snp make a far more convincing opposition to #brexit   govt than corbyn has    such a pity they want independence   #peoplesvote #stopbrexit  #remain in control
just imagining what our country would look like now if we’d had a real opposition leader for the past two years  thank you to all grassroots people who have kept #remain on the table in spite of two main parties supporting #brexit  and no opposition party  keep fighting x
oh   jeremy you were on the verge of doing quite well against the govt   then chris @chrislesliemp asked you to confirm if you felt that to #remain in the eu was better than the pm s #brexit deal   then you blew it again we no longer have to respect the flawed ref based on lies
pm   you ve not negotiated a compromise   you ve negotiated a bad version of a blind #brexit in which we ll have no control   no leverage you were right  brexit does mean brexit   there never was a compromise  it has always been a #brexitshambles or #remain  the maj want remain
ffs pm the option of no #brexit is not a risk   given the utter cluster    you have made if it   it is an extremely positive outcome  #peoplesvote #stopbrexit   #remain in control in the eu  
do i trust this govt to do what is right for the country   the majority if its ppl by allowing the option to halt this #brexit fiasco #revokea50   #remain in control in the eu not one jotdo i trust mps to put country b4 party   #stopbrexit jury s outyou will pay if you don t 
we said from day one that #brexit is not inevitable  today we have the legal confirmation on #article50 #labour mps across the country should be emboldened  if they back a #peoplesvote in parliament  the country can have a #finalsay in early 2019 and vote to #remain in the eu 
wow    ecj advocate general opinion that the uk can unilaterally #revokea50  final ruling awaiteduk govt sought to thwart this we can stop #brexit b4 29 03 19   keep our current best poss deal resp mps must #stopbrexit #remain in control in the eu 
as you   many other  experts  warned it wld become but neither the lady  nor the gentleman were for listening when they invoked a50 w o a clue nor having undertaken due diligence they shld either stop #brexit or allow us to do so in a #peoplesvote with a #remain option 
what course should we take with the #brexit deal  #leave #remain #eu #takebackcontrol
more very encouraging news but we shouldn t just be preparing for a #peoplesvote  our party should be actively campaigning for one the sooner @uklabour is campaigning for #remain  the better our chances of staying in the eu #brexit is not inevitable

dyson wants less workers rights  no corporation tax  he took his manufacturing away from uk  he wants to avoid paying tax    sounds like he s looking out for himself  rather than uk public well  that s put me right off buying #dyson products #brexit or #remain go #henry

labour and the eu are right on this  labour are wrong on brexit  #paradisepapers #finalsay #remain #labour 
as the paye public’s outrage at the #paradisepapers grows  the government votes against an eu crackdown on tax dodgers  the brexit gov are out of touch  #finalsay #remain

did i just hear @bbcr4today use the word  remoaner   england is happier   remoaners  are starting to relax about brexit  rubbish  #stopbrexit #remain never  relax  about brexit  #exitbrexit 
unfortunately most #remain mps won’t speak up until they see public opinion shift decidedly  pathetic i know  but our task is clear  #brexit 
real reason for brexit#remain #exitfrombrexit #paradisepaper #paradiseleaks #stopbrexit 
there it is  corbyn doesn’t want to give us a chance to vote on the #brexit deal  #remain @uklabour supporters take note  
there r no  remoaners  only fellow cits who r awake to the damage #brexit s doing to the uk   who seek a democ #finalsay   option to #remain 
great day handing out leaflets and helping with the stall for @leedseurope  @harryjsmall #remain #brexit #eu #bollockstobrexit 
#brexit or #remain university should be where young people can express   explore ideas  sadly this is not the case  
here is something we #remain campaigners can all do  we are all over the uk   indeed the world  most of us have at least one local newspaper  do you follow yours  if not  do it  watch for local stories about #brexit   grass roots stuff  business closures  local jobs unfilled  1 n 
it s simply because @uklabour support brexit @owenjones84  even the thoughly bent yougov polls show #remain is now comfortably ahead of leave  @bbclaurak @bbcnews won t report that though#fbpe #stop #exitfrombrexit 
trade union leader@manuel tssa gives a passionate speech to @eurolabour arguing that best #brexit deal is to #remain rather than acquiescence in the chaotic tory #brexitshambles   
we can save all this wasted time  effort   money chris  simply by giving the ppl another vote  a binding #finalsay in 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu there s no way 37  of voters backing leave in a non binding ref can be the final will of the ppl  sos 
bbc news    i gave up my job to fight brexit   #stopbrexit #loveeu #remain 
in any case @keir starmer  do you think your voters are hoping when you get hold of hard evidence #brexit is a bad idea @labour can then justify a u turn towards #remain  
until he announces a full public reversal of @uklabour position on  #brexit and they go full #remain i won t believe a word @jeremycorbyn  says#fbpe #exitfrombrexit #stopbrexit 
thank you   time is running out   damage has been done but we must halt #brexit somehow  the will of 37  of voters is not the will of the ppl  the latter has shifted enough to warrant a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit   #remain option  country before party  
we still need to reach out to more remainers  the overwhelming majority of remain voters have little idea of the chicanery driving #brexit and the consequences if is driven through  if they did our movement would grow hugely #stopbrexit #remain 
polling  is it me or has polling gone very quiet  are pollsters worried even polls with questions assuming #brexit s a given will now show the will is changing clearly to #remain  come on let s have some honest questions   a50 can be revoked you can #stopbrexit  leave or remain  
a little noted feature of the #euref was the asymmetry of the consequences  a narrow #remain win would have left open the chance to push for another referendum  but  #brexit once implemented would have irreversible consequences a super majority clause was necessary #stopbrexit 
had the #euref electoral franchise included eu 27 nationals   16 17 year olds as in the scottish 2014 referendum  #remain would have won  so far from being based on the  will of the people  #brexit is based on the government s choice of who was allowed to vote #stopbrexit  1 
will someone just step up   lead #remain   if there were 1 decent politician calling out the bs   getting a clear message over that #brexit can t work we can stop this farce  we have probs with the rest of the world too  people must be allowed a #finalsay  
i am getting increasingly frustrated with #remain voters who now accept #brexit as inevitable  taking bad policy and pretending it can be made into good policy when all the evidence points the other way is wrong  weak and dangerous  bad policy must always be called out  
for the hard of thinking  this is open to eu or efta eaa members  the brextremists are stupidly pursuing a harmful wto brexit  that has consequences  this is the very least of them  #remainersnow #finalsay #remain 
better to just #remain and keep all the benefits  work to change the bad and stop wasting money on the damaging #brexit that could be better spent on the nhs education or public services #stopbrexit 
more please   if you support #remain there s no way you can vote for parties supporting #brexit  make your vote count to #stopbrexit   #remain 
wonder what could be the cause  i wonder         oh oh oh oh  i know  the twin tory attacks of brexit and austerity stop brexit and the excuses for austerity end as well #fbpe #stopbrexit #exitfrombrexit #remain 
european city of culture another casualty of brexit  more disastrous consequences to follow  #remain 
let me get that straight  £3 billion expenses for #brexit and only £2 8 billion for the nhs  weren t we promised 350 million a week   plus unicorns ok  we ve all had a good laugh about how gullible we are  can we now stop the charade and #remain please  
the bittersweet fruit of the brexit elite riding roughshod over british democracy is that it is them that killed brexit the moment they cheated voters  it s a brexicide  #leavegate #remain #remainersnow 
uk firms  excluded  from space contracts by brexitwell what s the point of playing an important role in such programmes  most #brexit supporters can t see beyond the white cliffs let alone into space  binding #finalsay ref in 2018   #stopbrexit   #remain

on the contrary  the biggest whoppers during the #euref were told by #remain  remember the brexit budget  £4000 poorer  instant diy recession and even war remain also spent 45years deceiving the people as eu treaties gave away control of the uk to brussels  
it s been a very long week in brexit and it s only tuesday  #stopbrexit#remain

very annoying to hear brexiteers complain about the cost of #brexit   shows how much they believed their own propaganda  none of this is necessary  we should #remain and tackle the real issues that confront us  
1  a final deal referendum is a totally different thing to a replay of the 2016 referendum  no one has voted on  or even knows the final reality of #brexit  2  leavers like farage   raab were already calling for a repeat referendum if #remain gained a narrow victory #stopbrexit 
splash in @mailonsunday on mainly #toryparty #brexit mp s who defy will of the people in their #remain constituencies  
#remain hero @kenclarkemp made the most pertinent comment this week  if #ukgov didn’t intend watering down workers’ rights after #brexit  why wouldn’t they back @uklabour’s amendment to protect those rights  share @jon danzig’s blog  link   
has anyone noticed people who claim to have voted #remain but have time lines full of far right material  this strikes me as a new brand of disinformation #stopbrexit #brexit

1  dear #remain peeps   i share the frustration   anger with the travesty of this invalid non binding #brexit  based on an opinion of only 37  of voters being treated as the indisputable will of the ppl  i too am incredulous that folks still choose to wilfully ignore facts but   
please retweet and get this important message out  the eu has indicated yet again that the uk can stop #brexit and choose to #remain  we must keep up the fight  #stopbrexit @libdems @thegreenparty @thesnp @uklabour

on behalf of #remain i would like to apologise for many warnings we made  saying #brexit would be an omnishambles clusterfuck even we didn t go far enough in saying just what a total shitshow run by 3rd rate cretins it would befor not screaming louder   constantly  i apologise 
govt #tories   #labour have been in thrall 2 37  voters who voted leave in a non binding opinion poll i sense growing anger amongst the ignored #remain camp who ve always known   those who r coming to know #brexit s a con   parl better listen  we re the real majority #stopbrexit 
dear @daviddavismpduring the eu ref campaign #leave cleverly undermined #remain by dismissing all #brexit risks as #projectfearearlier this week i held a poll   we have decided to brand #brexit as #projectfacepalmyou ll be glad to know that you re the poster boy for it#fbpe 
this is what pisses me off more than anything about #brexit   there was no consensus on what #voteleave actually meant  still isn’t   these options should have been on ballot paper for clarity  uk being pushed off a cliff when the majority was actually for #remain  #stopbrexit 
our #remain movement keeps growing  it s not backed by big money or the two main parties  it s formed of 10s of thousands of activists giving their time   energy  it s a huge   growing popular movement of people who care deeply about their country #stopbrexit #brexit #fbpe 
let s just quietly admit brexit is an complete omnishambles presided over by the clueless and the terrified   call the whole damn thing off before more damage is done  #remain #bollockstobrexit

could someone wake up the politicians and tell them there are only 2 solutions to brexit and ni border issue   stay in the single market   customs union or #remain  
the whole world can see that brexit will destroy our economy  we are stuck with it because most if our mps wont ignore the xenophobic racist and economically illiterate  will of the people   our mps must do their duty and have the courage to get together and #stopbrexit   #remain 
irish govt would be mad to let it through   there s no way the #brexit the uk govt espouses can avoid a harder border somewhere  whether roi ni or ni gb   fom on one side alone means passport checks somewhere  it s a tory con   just #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu

very important to stress that rejecting whatever brexit govt comes up with would not be a  u turn  by the voters  even if it would be by this hopeless #torybrexitgovt  the voters were not given a prospectus  so they are entirely free to say  not up to expectation  prefer #remain

forget 48    the real majority is now for #remain   the ppl must be allowed a democratic #finalsay in 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit  we re with you   other democrats who still believe in the right to rethink   change minds  
dad spent 37 years working in a yorkshire coal mine  mum was a miner s daughter   school  dinner lady   my sister   i both graduated and went into teaching  nice to know that voting #remain means we re now part of  the elite   #ordinarypeopleremain #brexit 
#brexit is what will benefit the establishment  it s a rouse to avoid the new tax laws the eu are bringing in the day after brexit is supposedly happening  #remain 
yep  it s that simple   if you consider #brexit is going to wreck our country economically  morally   globally the use #fbpe proudly  defeat the trolls   it s working  binding #finalsay 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit   #remain   save the best ever deal rights   control

mike  labour is a pro brexit party  albeit less extreme than the tories  and until  if ever  it changes that position it is just as much an opponent of the #remain cause as the tories  our policy must be to prevent either lab or cons gaining a majority #stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit  
if there is a general election the best thing for remainers to do is to aim for a hung parliament with a larger number of libdem   green mps than now  and the way to do that will be to follow the suggestions made by #remain tactical voting organisers #stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit 
oh deary me  it seems another far right leaver has had to delete his brexit poll     i was reading some of the comments on it earlier  they appear rather perplexed that #remain keeps on winning their polls   #stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit  
the ft today  uk output is now about 0 9  lower than if the country had voted to #remain in the eu  that s almost exactly £350m a week lost to the economy  it s what #leavers promised would be available to the #nhs if we went for #brexit  it s time to #stopbrexit  
if the best and most persuasive argument for 2016 and 2017 was for me to get behind brexit is to  get over it   then i have little hope that 2018 will bring any more of a persuasive argument  i will continue to campaign to #remain until we do  or i start the campaign to #rejoin  
i wonder how #tory remainers can look at themselves in the mirror knowing a maj want to #remain   live with the disastrous future they re consigning us   the uk to  they shame their calling they betray us  #finalsay 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit  
a @yougov poll shows that a quarter of @uklabour voters could switch party if they continued to back #brexit  two thirds of those who voted #remain said they would be disappointed or angry if labour said it would proceed with brexit  
i’ve been saying it for 18 months and i’ll keep saying it  brexit is not about “new exciting opportunities”  it’s all about harking back to the past  a past that looks less and less attractive  #stopbrexit #remain

tonight s @houseofcommons vote to deny the british public a further say on brexit  including #remain as now in #eu  is nothing short of a  national disgrace   scandal   given that so much has  emerged  over the past 18 months  beware all who neglected their duty  #exitfrombrexit 
depressing how ridiculous   damaging #brexit will be yet both govt   opposition continue to force it through in the most autocratic way  denying us the people a further #finalsay in 2018 because they know we d vote #remain now   democracy is dying in the uk    
msm stance seems to be that #brexit can t be stopped unless there is a significant shift in public opinion  yet polls now showing 55 45 in favour of #remain  that s a 10 point lead  when will our politicians stop ignoring the facts  #stopbrexit #fbpe 
twitter is full of comments about appalling govt   brexit disaster etc  so now we need to do something serious   unite the many remain groups  get the unions on board to save jobs  get a parliamentary group  all under 1 umbrella we need leadership and we need it now  #remain 
it s the least worst brexit  that s the best that can be said of it  but for a country of 66m to be a ruletaker with no vote on those rules which we now influence very considerably is a curious  improvement   #exitfrombrexit in order to #remain is immeasurably superior 
use #fbpe to find and follow other pro eu accounts  togeather we can #stopbrexit  #brexit #remain #unitedkingdom #england #scotland #wales #nothernireland #london please rt

brexit will cost us £50bn every year of lost tax so if a future lab gov spent all that tax on improving the nhs it d save 31 505 lives per year  over a 30 year term   back of fag packet brexit costs nearly 1 million britons their lives  #fbpe #nhs #remain

if cornyn hadn t whipped labour mps to support so many tory motions we might have had a vote of no confidence and a ge by now   and an anti #brexit labour would have won easily  unfortunately corbyn s pro #brexit stance means the #remain vote is rapidly leaching away from labour

“after meeting #askbarnier       #farage said he was convinced that the frenchman doesn’t understand why more than 17 million people voted for the u k  to leave in the 2016 referendum ” maybe that’s because 16 141  241 voted to #remain pic text @brexit

an excellent take down by @jolyonmaugham of the brexiters’ argument that having a referendum on the #brexit deal v #remain will weaken uk’s negotiating position with eu it’s clear uk needs to find a way to #exitfrombrexit 
i joined in a little drive to get #remain trending  who s up for twitter bombing the hashtag between 6 and 7pm uk time today you can add other anti brexit hashtags too but that s the one were going for it will need a lot of us to make it work  
unless @uklabour change their position and oppose brexit then i will take my vote elsewhere  i have voted labour all my life  this is too important  #remain 
it appears that prior to #fbpe those who wanted to #remain were viewed as ‘useful idiots’ for those on the momentum left  now that we are organising they are scared as they will not be the beneficiaries again without changing brexit policy   hence this #retain bs

boris digs himself in deeper as his usual tricks fall flat boris johnson’s brexit speech had no substance  just a few lame lines it’s clearer than ever that we need to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu  #fbpe

i m wondering how many real #brexit supporters there r  so many fake accounts   often far right usa  being thrown at an ever growing number of real ppl supporting #remain that i guess the only way to find out wld be to hold an actual ref in 2018   let the real voters vote #fbpe

safe to say the picture is much better at 22 30 than it looked at 16 30  but the fight is only just beginning  in the end  labour must give the people a chance to #stopbrexit   through a referendum or in a pro #remain ge manifesto  
we have run out of time  if you want to #remain we have only one way to have our voices heard  vote for an anti brexit party  you can not vote labour or tory  who are both intent on delivering brexit  we can send a huge message with #abtv  but we have to stand together 
important  let #bbcfeedback know what we think about #bbcbrexitbias almost total blackout on any anti or #stopbrexit opposition  any counter views to #brexit   a total lack of impartiality #fbpe #finalsay #greatnorthernmarch #witheuinspirit #waton #remain #remainernow 
#brexit  britons now back #remain over leave by 10 points  exclusive poll shows

just one informed  inspiring pro #remain leader in the commons could have turned #brexit round  save for the few brave souls what a craven bunch of party hacks we have placed there  a perfect storm 
#finalsayforall on the deal   a #remain option  confirm the will of the ppl  
excellent  i reckon every time #blair opens his mouth another 100 000 people at least who voted #remain become committed brexiteers  keep going @bbcnewsnight  #brexit  
and now we are a divided country thank you #theresamay everything you touch turns to chaos  #jews #muslims #left #right #brexit #remain #homophobes #gays i have never ever seen our country so divided with hateful accusations all round you’ve failed #jc4pm 
the nasty whiff overhanging this flawed #brexit process just gets stronger  at what point will our mps wake up to the threat to democracy   take steps to at least offer a #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option  this #brexit can t be morally legitimate until this s done  
yep   well aware of this   the fact they are still able to con voters into thinking their version of #brexit is going to lead to a utopian future   not the reality which is that it will become a tory brexit over time if we don t get a #finalsayforall with a #remain option  #abtv

#greateasternmarch ipswich   great event  so many ppl prepared to take the message out to a wider audience  #brexit is bollox   we must have a binding #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option to #stopbrexitsavebritain
the majority now want to #remain 
#brexitispersonal@theresa may the demos mrs may includes 16 2m #remain voters and the millions of british germans french poles  all eu27inuk   ukineu you continue to exclude  #weareeuropebrexit will fail   
i voted #remain   however  i have blocked many fbpe  follow back pro europe  tweeters who followed me because it is clear to me their agenda is more about unfairly trying 2 use #brexit to damage labour than about remain  
our brexit insomnia has moved from spain to leeds  very excited to see everybody later in the #greatnorthernmarch to demonstrate how much we want to #stopbrexit   #remain  have a good day at the rallies all around the uk  we are #witheuinspirit 
no  if you are for #remain you can vote for a remain supporting party  membership of a cu  whoop de doo  brexit for the many  what a crock  vote for lib dem  green  snp    and give the brexit cons and brexit labour a bloody nose  #stopbrexit 
with each step your  leader  takes in support of #brexit or denial of a #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option  he moves further away from power  we won t forgive him for this theft of our future in the eu  he s not interested in the real will of the ppl nor democracy  
anyone out there who still believes corbyn is playing some clever long game on #brexit   will swing behind a referendum   #remain at the last minute  
no you re not  it s all lies  the best deal is #remain   you know it  we ve seen your own analysis that #brexit leaves 99  of us poorer 
after #euref they expected #remain to hush up   accept result  
#remain #fbpe pic twitter com rf1ym28gs0 
the polling companies stopped asking how we would vote in a second referendum in december  after 11 12 polls showed a #remain majority and the last but one showed a ten point lead  now why would that be 
isn t it time mps acknowledged the only legitimate solution to this mess is to give the ppl a binding #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option  retest the will of the ppl   stop imposing party will on the ppl  
if brexit is your priority then you have to vote tactically  there’s no other way to be heard as an #remain voice  these are exceptional times  it’s a one off local election  to stop brexit we have one last chance  
a gerrymandered electorate  an advisory non binding ref     it s a travesty may is pushing an extremely hard brexit  wholly undemocratic  plain wrong  #remain 
when you think that remain campaigning was led by cameron and corbyn backed by tories who ve almost all transmogrified into rabid brexiters  while leave had the support of 80  of the press by circulation it s amazing that #remain even got 48  of the vote  
i find myself asking why the #remain campaign let themselves get labelled  project fear  when the real  project fear   hate and lies was that unleashed by the leave side  why didn t the remain campaign respond forcefully  
#stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #brexitshambles #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #reunion 
quite frankly if the govt can only negotiate the best possible deal as they always say and not a better deal   then there is no way #brexit should go ahead   only false ideologies are now obstructing the democratic move to give the ppl a #finalsayforall with a #remain option  
often accused by those backing pcpeu that as #fbpe i m anti corbyn  which is bs btw  i m anti corbyn s support for #brexit   denial of a binding #finalsayforall with a #remain option 
it ll only collapse if we the people work damn hard to make it collapse  even the most pro #remain mps have said they won t reverse #brexit  so keep protesting  writing to mps and getting the truth out there over social media 
scotland voted #remain  i d happily move to an independent scotland in eu  if #brexit gets ruined  bonus  #may promises a fairer society whilst riding roughshod over the nations  48     eu citizens  #stopbrexit 
so  it s a  phased in brexit  that they re attempting  and by the time that happens the old folks that voted leave will be dead   the youngsters that would have voted #remain will be 18  the whole situation is insane  
my respect 4 her grows with each passing week   each statement  we need many more mps to do their homework  appreciate the dire consequences of this flawed #brexit   to get behind a #finalsayforall with a #remain option  play the get out of jail free card   #stopbrexitsavebritain 
your daily reminder that #brexit is built on a tissue of lies that are unravelling  the british people were sold a false prospectus  we must have a #finalsay with an option to #exitfrombrexit and #remain  anything else would be undemocratic and a danger to the national interest  
i voted for #brexit and was a committed brexit voter  but facts have changed and with another vote  i would vote #remain @campbellclaret @davidlammy @chukaumunna 
mps should have the courage to say publicly what many believe privately   that brexit is a disaster  and that we should #remain in the eu  
#brexit groups are scared stiff of a 2nd referendum  precisely because some ex committed brexit voters  like myself  have changed their minds  let s #remain 
haggis and george are right  we are stronger within the eu  that s why vlad helped farage win the brexit ref  it weakens the uk and weakens the eu  a putin wet dream  #skripal #brexitreality #remain

a home win for the @remain labour campaign  my local branch of @hounslow labour  brentford   isleworth  has just passed a motion asking the labour party to support a 2nd referendum  with an option to #remain  
in a free society  people should also be able to criticise #brexit without being called traitors  enemies of the people or being against democracy  but you don t like people criticising brexit do you nigel  #justsaying#stopbrexit2018 #finalsayforall #fbpe #remain #waton 
there s a definite swing in the attitudes of #brexiters  they now blame the downsides of #brexit on the #remain camp and the eu  they won t accept the consequences of their own actions  they say they knew what they were voting for  so they need to grow up and own the downsides  
the government response to our petition is shameful  all they offer is a choice between an inevitable bad brexit deal or an even worse no deal  there must be an option to #remain  let’s gather in westminster on 23 april to tell them

excellent article by @acgrayling comprehensively explaining why there’s no rational case for there not being a referendum on the #brexit deal vs #remain 
govt s whole approach to a #brexit that can only leave us poorer  weaker with fewer rights and less control whilst denying the ppl a binding #finalsay on the deal with a #remain option is sinister 
a reminder  many politicians on the #brexit right had no intention of respecting a narrow #remain victory in the referendum

i will not vote labour again until the party reflects it s members voters the unions   supporters #stopbrexit #remain 
i have been in no doubt what the labour leadership strategy has been  they ve stated it clearly  to leave the eu   deny the ppl a #finalsayforall with a #remain option    basically let #brexit happen   then try to pass all the blame onto the tories   
who else in the uk is feeling politically homeless  powerless  aghast  dismayed  angry  terrified for the future of the uk and for our children  determined to fight  embarrassed  saddened and mortified because of #brexit #brexitshambles #remain 
does @jeremycorbyn remember that #scotland voted #remain by 62 38   and that leaving will see our economy shrink by 9   and he thinks we can be fooled by his incoherent waffle on #brexit

you have a cheek @liamfox   just take a look at @scientists4eu and listen to @mikegalsworthy and you will see that you and the #tories are wilfully taking action with #brexit which will decimate british science  #stopbrexit #bsw18 #remain

great call in to @mrjamesob on @lbc by @marcusfysh re the reasons to be cheerful about #brexit i think marcus has probably added a few thousand more to the already majority that now wish to #remain well done  
mps need to get a grip on this debacle   if they can t #stopbrexit alone then give it back to the ppl in a #finalsayforall   we ll vote #remain  
2  whatever the wording that emerges a maj in both the hol   the hoc must now know that any #brexit will seriously harm the uk  it must now be apparent that the only way final legitimacy can be conferred upon this course is by giving the people a #finalsay with #remain an option 
i don t understand this  labour is supporting referendum implementation   not asking for a #finalsay  it is not the party of #remain   at all   it may have maj of members who support #remain     of voters  but it supports #leave   isn t changing   1 2

after 98 of 150 councils pro #brexit parties  #conservatives  #labour  #ukip    18 seatspro #remain parties  #libdems  #greens    47 seatsthe numbers speak for themselves   #stopbrexit

am sincerely hoping david davis that great proponent of democracy becomes a part of our glorious past along with #brexit sooner than he anticipates   binding #finalsay in the autumn with a #stopbrexit #remain option#fairvote to #stopbrexitsavebritain 
voting labour to oppose brexit is like helping to build the scaffold on which you will be hung  be careful what you wish for #abtv#remain 
hey i ain t here to tell you how to vote in the #localelections but if you got a pro european anti brexit candidate in your area i d sure as heck think about voting for them   #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain #abtv #localelections2018 #voteremain

for anyone weighing up a tactical vote today every opinion poll which says the  voice of the people  now favours #remain  the brexists say   the only vote that counts is the one at the ballot box  today you can get the message across  we don t want brexit  #peoplesvote #abtv 
good morning  today is the 3rd may     if 1st may was international workers  day  let s shorten that today   make it just international day use the polling booth today to f x #brexit   vote #abtv to #remain in the eu don t forget to vote  every vote counts   
if you want to hinder brexit tomorrow then don t vote tory and don t vote labour  they re both deserving of a bloody nose  #voteremain 
liam fox says parliament could gain power to ‘delay brexit indefinitely’ well done to all the lords and mps who have backed amendments to the brexit bill keep up the #fbpe campaign for a #peoplesvote to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu   it’s working  
and yet both the pro brexit conservatives and labour parties still expect remainers to keep voting for them out of loyalty  well i won’t be  i’m a conservative but i’ve stopped voting tory since the referendum and will vote lib dem in protest at brexit on thursday  #fbpe #remain 
eu law is not “imposed on the uk  as a member statewith a veto  gbwith the other member statesamends   consents tothus “makes eu lawdemocratically#stopbrexit #stopbrexitnow #meaningfulvote #ukpolitics #brexit #bremain #leave #remain #democracy 
dear liam fox   were you a real democrat   believed in the will of the ppl   not about imposing your will on the ppl  you wouldn t have a problem with a binding #finalsay   a #stopbrexitsavebritain option which would only confirm if the will of the ppl is still #brexit or #remain 
if 6 5mill people do this on thursday    but leave out labour this time  we could #stopbrexit so   on thursday may 3rd   don t vote tory or labour they both support brexit   vote #remain   use #abtv help us get a #finalsay in a #peoplesvote 2 2 
very important use this to #abtv  not a single vote for any of the pro #brexit parties  we need 16 million #remainers to go out and #vote   #vote for #remain parties    #stopbrexit #fbpe #waton #abtv #le2018 #the3millionvote #resist #hope 
this is not a threat and not something i say lightly  but if @jeremycorbyn wishes to retain the vote of some one who voted for him twice  then he needs to offer either a 2nd ref or a final vote with the option to brexit or #remain it s that simple  national interest 1st #fbpe 
 @jeremycorbyn  @keir starmer for the first time in my life i will not be voting for #labour on thursday  65  of labour supporters voted #remain  in an advisory referendum    our collective voice has been ignored  #stopbrexit #peoplesvote #finalsay #finalsayforall #brexit #fbpe 
may suffers huge brexit defeat as lords backs ‘meaningful vote’ on eu deal government defeated by 335 to 244 as parliament ‘takes back control’ of brexit process next  mps and peers should call a #peoplesvote to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu  
they shame our country   they shame our democracy   what s left of it   i hope corbyn pays a price for his support of #brexit   denial of a binding #finalsayforall with the option to #stopbrexit   #remain 
worth remembering that internationalist #edinburgh north and #leith voted 78  to #remain in 2016   overwhelmingly against jeremy corbyn’s hard #brexit position  @thesnp  @deidrebrock and i are standing up for scotland’s place in europe   labour aren’t  
the more you realise how much russia benefits from trump s presidency and #brexit the more certain you become of its involvement in making both happen  #russiacollusion #impeach #remain #natosummit #putinspuppet 
2  at no point was loss of rights raised  no consent for that  no one understood the implications nor the final version  all a #peoplesvote does is confirm if a maj of ppl still want #brexit or now to #stopbrexit  if a maj for #remain what right do #brexiters have to deny it  
if the last 2yrs have taught us anything it s this   uk s problems are due to failings of successive uk govts  not the eu  no deal will come anywhere near being as good as what we have now  so we should #remain  our govt is disrespecting us by non stop #brexit lying   spin 
the majority now wants to #remain in the eu  polls show   and by a bigger and bigger margin all the time brexit is not the will of the people hold a #peoplesvote to #stopbrexit  
1  #brexiters   #lexiters u probably think u just need to pass 29 03 19   u ll be home   dry   #remain just disappears  well if u get away with with this tainted #brexit coup know this  we may not have stopped the #brexitshambles but by god the next task will be stopping you  
no  @theresa may  the future of our country voted overwhelmingly to #remain in the eu  and now an overall majority would do the same you are robbing people of their future and defending brexit lies to build a britain fit for the future  hold a #peoplesvote to #stopbrexit  
our choices   1  leave a chunk of the people angry   aggrieved   ruin the country2  leave a chunk of the people angry   aggrieved   cease ruining the countryeither way to validate which course of action a maj of the people must get a #peoplesvote to decide #brexit or #remain 
1  believe it when i see it   every #brexit scenario leaves us poorer  weaker with less control   fewer rights  the only way to prevent that is to #stopbrexit   this may require mps giving the ppl a #finalsay a #peoplesvote with a #remain option  
i voted for #brexit  i am stupid  i know this because those who voted #remain keep telling me so  how did i get it so wrong  please forgive me  
carry on  dawkinsevery time you bore us with your condescending  metro elite claptrap you make us #brexit voters more resolute   reasonable  democratic #remain voters more inclined to accept the resultcarry on  you contemptuous halfwit 
what a stirring speech yesterday by @carolinelucas at the #peoplesvotemarch she spoke with clarity  passion and honesty about the damage #brexit is doing to our beloved country  #remain 
we know any brexit’s damaging  we know majority are #remain  we know the job of mps is to protect the national interests  we know @jeremycorbyn said ‘britain must remain in the eu as the best framework for the 21stc’ we know @uklabour fb weren’t at #peoplesvotemarch #stopbrexit 
as a #remain voter  i do not support #fbpe or #ofoc because 2 many of them are snp tories libdems or blairites   using brexit to try to unfairly undermine corbyn  when they should be attacking lobbying the tories  tory mps have more votes than labourulterior #motive#worldnews 
the  narrow result  which even #nigelfarage said before the referendum meant that  the matter would not be settled    he said 52  for #remain  48  leave  ought to be something that every responsible mp should be concerned with and not go pell mell ahead unless you are a zealot  
reports of up to 500 000 at the #peoplesvotemarch   massive the public demand a final say for all on the brexit deal  and a choice to #stopbrexit brexit is not the will of the people   polls show the uk would #remain  please rt and tag your mp and media so everyone knows  
hello world  this is andy   a #remainernow please watch and rt  andy was lied to  and would vote to #remain if there was a #peoplesvote andy says stop brexit @mollymep @women 4 europe @remainernow @peoplesvote uk @catherinemep @ferretgrove 
digby jones finally loses the plot  he seems to think airbus are in cahoots with #remain to stop #brexit  as a failed businessman @digbylj needs to realise that real multinational businesses are run by professional business people  they don t play at it  
not trying to be sarky   a genuine question  is this an okay thing for an official #bbc account to tweet  #brexit #remain #fbpe 
check out the sheer scale of today’s massive #peoplesvotemarch  filling central london the public demand a final say for all on the brexit deal  and a choice to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu please rt and tag in mps  journalists and media #stopbrexitsaturday #fbpe 
huge #peoplesvotemarch fills central london   too big for politicians and media to ignore the public demand a final say for all on the brexit deal  and a choice to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu please rt and tag in mps  journalists and media #stopbrexitsaturday #fbpe 
the airbus  threat  taken apart   they have neither the supply chain nor technology base to move  #emptythreat all part of the no change  #remain strategy  #brexit 
if you are pro #remain   join in with #fbpe   why  cos it s working  if it weren t the far left   right would be ignoring us #finalsay in the autumn with a #stopbrexit option to confirm if the will of the ppl is still to #brexit or now to end this #brexitshambles   #remain 
most sensible thing to do now is not abandon red lines but to abandon #brexit which a clear majority now want  the most democratic way to achieve it is to give the ppl a #finalsay with a #remain option which a majority of the ppl also want why do u deny the ppl the choice  
the public want a final vote on the brexit deal  by a huge margin  48  to 25  and britain would vote to #remain in the eu  by 53  to 47   says the latest @survation poll  we should #stopbrexit  let’s march on saturday for a #peoplesvote with an #optiontoremain  
the government knows there is no brexit dividend  why are they misleading the public we’re better off if we #stopbrexit   the #remain dividend could help fund the nhs  
two years ago we were entering the last hours of campaigning in the referendum and @keir starmer was one of thousands of labour activists campaigning to #remain  at @remain labour we think it’s time keir came back to our side  let him know if you agree  
the reason we haven t been offered a #peoplesvote on the #brexit deal is obvious    #remain would now win by a landslide  young people would be mobilised in their droves  polling companies have picked up the swing but not its extent  and this  apparently  is democracy    
the #fbpe community now under constant attack from fake accounts  @juliahb1  corbynistas  @paulmasonnews his communist friend the very confused @aaronbastani and many many more we must be leading the #remain conversation  why else would they bother #brexit #peoplesvote 
absolute bs @ofocbrexit are hard working kids campaigning to #stopbrexit challenging both the shambolic #tory government and #labour s equally damaging pro #brexit stancewhen #jezza stops backing brexit  the #remain movement will start backing @labour 
i want to #remain in the #eui know #corbyn can t do a thing about it unless the #tories revolt  which they don t and won t 70  of #labour constituencies voted #leave i want the #toriesouti believe in campaigning on more than #brexit the #nhs needs labour unity #fbpe 
#leave won  they claim #remain lost#remain are campaigning hard because #brexit will damage jobs  the economy and people s lives why are #leave still trying to sell #brexit to the public  if it was going to be a huge success  just sit back and gloat     unless             
my mp dominic grieve thinks #brexit is risky  bad for the u k  and would rather it did not happen  that’s why he voted #remain he says #stopbrexit could happen if there is a major change in public opinion  i will writing a more detailed letter about #remainernow campaign later  
sorry @emilythornberry  it simply isn t true that no @uklabour mps want the chance to stop #brexit  dozens have already called for a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain  the majority of members want it and we are determined to deliver it  #marr 
i have the answer  no need for another referendum  every mp has to take a lie detector test  the question being  is brexit in the best interests of the u k  if the majority of mps pass the test and say yes  then we brexit  whatever that means   if they’re all lying we #remain x 
this is so silly  when will #remain acknowledge that #brexit prevailed because people voted for the #magnacarta narrative identity #uk shares with #canzuk  not #eu’s charlemagnian option  it was a choice between two possible futures   #leave won  time to #respecttheresult #ukpoli 
in my view  a c  grayling should be permanently on tv representing case for #remain   virtues if eu   it really would ensure that if there was 2nd referendum  his side would lose #bbctw 
if you re one of the millions who voted #brexit in the referendum  and had been promised it would be beneficial  do you now understand that they wilfully lie to you #stopbrexit2018 #peoplesvote #remain #finalsayforall 
laura smith mp @bbcr4today  it s not my job to tell ppl they were wrong  re #brexit me  offering the ppl a #finalsay where everyone has a chance to decide if they still want this #brexitshambles or now to #stopbrexit #reject #revoke #remain #reform isn t telling it s asking  
just to remove any uncertainty  i am hard #remain  i am marching with like minded friends on 23rd june in london who are also hard remain  hard remain means no #brexit  no may brexit and no fucking corbyn brexit  fuck brexit and what it is doing to my country #stopbrexit 
quick one on #lewishameastbyelection i think the events of the last couple of days could see a huge anti brexit tactical vote come out and could see a hell of a swing i am also hearing things about canvas on the ground  keep an eye on it tomorrow #voteremain 
i’m a member of @uklabour  i voted #remain i voted for @jeremycorbyn in the 2nd leadership election after the #brexit ref i voted labour in the ge after the #brexit ref i would vote labour again tomorrow  brexit belongs entirely to the tories #istandwithjeremycorbyn 
stunning new poll shows that even a majority of #remain #voters want to see the #referendum result respected  with the #uk taking back control of its #trade policy  a huge majority of  want #independence but #theresamay drags her feet    #bbc #sky 
as we all head to bed i’m thinking of my #remainathon friends and colleagues sleeping out now in london to support the push for #meaningfulvote  ordinary people doing extraordinary things in the most challenging of times  we can  stop brexit  but only together  #remain  
brexit is not the will of the people the majority now say brexit is “wrong”  by a 7 pt lead and the majority would now #remain in the eu so take back control @heidiallen75 @jdjanogly @s hammond @oliverhealduk @nickymorgan01 @neill bob @sandbach @anna soubry @sarahwollaston 
real proud of all you beutiful people out in london for the #remainathon  tonight and tomorrow  y all keep safe and create some kinda merry hell for those #brexit fans  with you in spirit  keep on keepin on to #stopbrexit  #fbpe #remain #peoplesvote  
i need 31 lovely tweeps to get me to 7000 followers  i’ll follow everyone back  let’s keep growing the #fbpe #remain voice  now is the time to dig deep like the #remainathon guys in london demanding a meaningful vote  brexit can be stopped but only if we stop it #waton  
the problem we face isn t the #brexiters   #lexiters in parl including many in both main party leadership teams but the maj of #remain mps who consider 23 06 16 as the #finalsay come what may   they are wholly misguided in the face of this flawed #brexit  a #peoplesvote is vital  
brexit is collapsing  it is built on lies and cheating  and it is not the answer to the country’s problems the majority of labour voters and members want to #remain in the eu  as do a majority of the public now  @uklabour should #stopbrexit and call a #peoplesvote  
brexit  more mps back new referendum on the brexit deal now 40 mps sign up to #remain campaign group @bestforbritain’s plan for a vote mps should call a #peoplesvote on may’s brexit deal  with an #optiontoremain  
the idea that someone who opposes #brexit is somehow undemocratic is so feeble it really is surprising that anyone still thinks to voice it  the will of the people is now unambiguously to #remain  #brexit is dead and it s not coming back  
brexit could keep uk economy  in the slow lane’  says cbi britain could be overtaken by other economies  with #brexit and protectionism putting investment at risk  says ⁦@cbitweets⁩ so hold a #peoplesvote to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu  
if theresa may sacked her pro brexit cabinet ministers and went to the country on a #remain ticket she d get a 100 seat majority is that idea insane just asking  #fbpe 
whilst i share this view by @campbellclaret i m concerned there s a real risk of complacency on #remain side about a #peoplesvote referendum if we are to secure an #exitfrombrexit with hopefully a decisive majority we need to start planning now how that campaign will be fought  
been obvious from day 1 #brexit may happen but in no way can it work   certainly not in the country s best interest nor that of its citizens this #brexitshambles needs to be stopped  vital to #stopbrexitsavebritain to avoid more lasting damage #reject #revoke #remain #reform 
poll  polling companies now consistently showing a 7 point swing towards #remain which would translate into a 55 45 result once don t knows are removed  do you think this is a sufficient mandate for a #peoplesvote on #brexit  please rt far and wide  particularly #leavers  
when #stellacreasy or any other #remainer tells you that ‘nobody talked about leaving the #singlemarket prior to the #referendum’ it’s a straight up #lie  here are the leaders of the #leave and #remain sides explicitly saying just that   #bbc #sky #lbc #uk 
#tuesdaythoughtswe stand on the cusp of one of the most dangerous political moments in my lifetime  this isn t abt #brexit   it s abt power  where do we want it to reside  in the hands of a n°10 cabal  or in parliament  whether you voted #leave #remain  join @sodemaction protest 
this shld be the true voice of labour   not the complicit fudge which ll help the tories deliver a #brexit that can only leave us poorer  weaker with fewer rights   less control  it s not bloody working out as promised so #reject #revoke #remain   #reform #finalsay #peoplesvote 
“if you’re sick of brexit  ditch brexit ”good to see @dmiliband talking real sense on why we need to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu  
brexit promises in 2016  “no downsides  only considerable upsides”brexit reality in 2018  “food  petrol and medicines would run out ”nobody voted to take these kinds of risks  we need to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu  
dear julie harpy seweri m a voter   i voted #remain  you did not  it is my democratic right to try and stop brexit  it is not in the best interests of our country  that s democracy   
roadmap to #stopbrexit to be sent to mps and peers the public now say brexit is the wrong choice and a majority want to #remain in the eu demand mps give the people a say   with an option to stay hold a #peoplesvote for all with an #optiontoremain  
more @uklabour mps back new brexit referendum another 18 mps back call for a #peoplesvote on the brexit deal to protect jobs we need a #finalsayforall to #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu  
just to be very clear   on 23rd june i shall be protesting with the #stopbrexit column  not limping along hoping for some soft brexit scraps  nor demanding anything less than a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain i haven t spent 2 years of my lie to settle for appeasement  
i am marching 23rd june to #stopbrexit  i don’t care how  by legal challenge  by parliamentary vote or by people’s vote  but we are all uniting with one aim  stopping brexit and taking back control  we can only do this together as one #remain voice  see you there  
pm rules out #peoplesvote under any circumstances   me  i ruled you out ages ago  you ruled out a ge before trying out the  strong   stable  line   that went well #brexit is fubar  poorer  weaker with less control   fewer rights  a #finalsay is the democratic way out #remain 
britain no longer wants brexit the majority say it is going badly  will be bad for the country  and leave them worse off most now want a new #peoplesvote referendum  and a 59 41  majority would now vote to #remain  it’s time to end this shambles  #stopbrexit  
public opinion is shifting sharply against brexit  sky data poll reveals 78  think the government is doing a bad job on brexit 65  say we’ll get a bad deal and the public would now vote to #remain in the eu   59  to 41  help #stopbrexit  please rt  
1  time 4 those mps who ve sat on their supine arses or backed this farce to get off them #brexit s failed before it s happened  a majority no longer want it   only a #peoplesvote can validate the end game we must have the #finalsay with a #remain option  
public mood continues to shift against #brexit  #remain has clear lead the numbers are now reaching point where supporting a #peoplesvote should be considered as a career saver by may or corbyn it vindicates @vincecable  s call for an #exitfrombrexit 
so let s see   the eu will collapse if we vote leavenogerman car manufacturers wiil save us nowe ll get a great deal from the usanoour commonwealth will back us nowto will be fineno#brexit will be easy peasy   we ll all be better offno#finalsay #remain anyone  
we should have demolished all the #brexit lies by now  says @jon danzig in his wake up call to the #remain movement  we’ve squandered two years since the #eureferendum by not tackling head on the lies that led to brexit winning  please share his blog   
of course we mustn t panic the ppl into realising that this #brexitshambles is a total disaster   that politicians   charlatans deceived them  lied   cheated  mean to say they might start wanting a #finalsay which might mean their #brexit coup will fail #peoplesvote #remain  
in greece  italy  france   others  anti eu politicans are dropping calls to leave eu  support for membership grows only in uk  do the anti eu elite pursue their #brexit fantasythey don t want a #peoplesvotethey fear #remain will win  via @financialtimes 
so much evidence undermining the validity of the #brexit result  has anyone yet heard #theresamay or #jeremycorbyn draw attention to this  or for that matter most tory   labour mps  wondering why that might be #peoplesvotethis won t go away  time now for a #finalsay #remain 
brexit  sunday times front page news this morning  if the #remain side said it was a possibility during the referendum it would have been described as ‘project fear’ sadly it is project reality  there’s still time to think again  #peoplesvote 
yes  the  campaign  for a second referendum is a #scaretactic  a second ref would trash #remain even more  forget the #fake #deal  #brexit now  #eu needs #uk more than uk needs eu  #theglobalwarminghoaxmustbedestroyed  destroy #euets eu #deindustriliazation tool  #saveourfish 
more than 330 000 people back the independent s campaign for a vote on government s brexit dealcome on #remain   rt   rt again    let s get it over the million   then set the next target   #finalsay #peoplesvote #stopbrexit   #remain

we’ve reached a tipping point on support for a second referendum  brexiteers have nothing left to offer  this is as good as it gets for them  nobody is coming out in favour of brexit any more  momentum is with #remain reform  
if you ve forgotten all the lies told during the brexit referendum and what the truth has turned out to be  then here is a nice little reminder  #remain #brexit #brexitshambles ⁦@ralflittle⁩ 
wow  keep up the pressure  be in no doubt #remainers  #remainernow  #releavers   #brexit ain t a done deal unless you allow it don t give up  #remain is winning #brexit hands the uk to the far right  thwart their plans fight for a #peoplesvote#fbpert 
there’s fake news  electoral fraud  rule breaking  all ‘cheating’   whether you voted #remain or #leave  don’t let the privileged british establishment duck the blame for their mess  demand a vote on whether to accept or reject their poor deal no deal #brexit   
i’ve just been out stockpiling for brexit   #brexit #remain #remainers #leave #eu #brexitchaos #brexitbetrayal 
important to understand crux of #brexit is that #uk voted in #euref for the #magnacarta narrative identity it shares with #canzuk  not #eu’s charlemagnian alternative  it was a choice between two possible futures  #leave won   #remain lost  it’s time to #respecttheresult #ukpoli 
i do not recall the excruciating detail of the 2016 referendum ballot paper  but i am sure that the option to #remain did not say  a vote for remain is an act of treason   did it  was it on the bus  #peoplesvote 
barnier   the eu reject the uk s customs plan  tariff collection   state ni border backstop not sorted no surprises there then chequers is dead   no deal looking likely unless concessions made  erg won t accept #brexit is #fubar so #peoplesvote with a #remain option it is  
#brexit update  govt now admts it wants to stockpile food  medicines etc  only to be told we don t have space to do it   yet another thing they haven t thought through   cartoon time     #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #peoplesvote #finalsay 
so jc you back a #brexit that leaves us poorer with less control   fewer rights   deny a #peoplesvote  you ve lost a chunk of scotland   alienated a swathe of #remain  face disadvantageous boundary changes   now an angry jewish community   anything else  maybe change your stance  
the biggest democratic vote in our history is now being betrayed by our own government #brexit means #remain under @theresa may 
1  ffs   if i hear another commentator who knows #brexit will be bad  stating we shouldn t have a #finalsay with a #remain option before we leave   have to go through with it because we have to respect the existing vote i shall be looking to buy a new tv  
can we just get rid of govt   the opposition leadership   reset the uk to default mode  neither serves the uk s nat interest  merely their own self serving agendas  both back a #brexit that will cause irreversible harm   deny the ppl a democratic way out #peoplesvote #remain 
‘we still haven t won the arguments we lost in the #eureferendum ’ read and share @jon danzig’s commentary on the ineffectiveness of the pro #remain  anti #brexit movement since may 2015  link   
in a #peoplesvote   a huge 77  of #labour voters would vote to #remain  we need a change in direction  we need @uklabour policy on #brexit to represent the many  not the few   
interesting how brexiters wanted a 2nd referendum if #remain had won  but won t consider a #peoplesvote now  do they fear #democracy cld #stopbrexit   @brexitbin @acgrayling @emmyzen @spaceangel1964 @fish in a hat @ferretgrove #fbpe 
chickens leaving home to roost   #brexit ain t working  if we d had decent leaders not party hacks   ideologues in charge this self harm #brexitshambles would have been strangled at birth #stopbrexit#reject #revoke #remain #reform 
gisela  you broke the law  you rigged a referendum from which most of those personally affected were barred  you misrepresented a narrow win as decisive  you claimed the result as being for the hardest #brexit possible when the question was a simple binary #criminalbrexit #remain 
brexit is a made up word without a plan  it started as a tory gamble to stuff ukip  it wasn’t supposed to happen  the referendum was gerrymandered  manipulated and incorporated electoral fraud and lies  no one can find any benefit  the ending is unwritten #stopbrexit #remain 
pm in newcastle says she is delivering on #brexit vote she s still lying through her teeth she s delivering #remain she has some brass neck to say she is delivering #brexit when she s doing the oppositetories need to remove her before she destroys their party #brexitbetrayal 
brother  i m strongly #remain but we must respect the result  we can t just keep having votes until we get the result we want me  but what about the illegal activity of vote leave   explains brother  what  i didn t know   #brexit has to be stopped #stopbrexitsavedemocracy 
you would need to be a fucking magician with a time machine  rewind two fucking years  wave your magic fucking wand  acknowledge the fucking referendum was advisory  #remain and then fix the fucking causes of #brexit  that s how you could have brought the country together   
so  an incentive to ditch the govt   rump of erg  on the basis of giving the ppl a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit option #brexit can t be decided in a multi issue ge unlesslabour stands for #remain so come on let s do it  but let s just #revoke not extend 
#euref was to determine if the #british people wish to #remain or #leave the #eu majority voted to #leave all mps obligated to support the government in honouring the result of the #euref mutual self interest will secure #uk   #eu post #brexit trade deal #allabouttrust 
this is why no one trusts #remain  they lied before the #euref  they lied about honouring the #brexit result   now they’re lying about not trying to stop it  then there’s the £9 4 million they spent of our money on leaflets  but yes let’s all talk about #leave’s 200k overspend  
do you remember  and we will make a success of it  mrs may @theresa may  how does crashing out with a no deal #brexit in any way measure up to any level of success  you have failed and are being held to ransom by the #ergmafia  admit it and call it off  #remain 
#nadinedorries @daily politics confirms the ppl can t have a #finalsay   do not have the right to change their minds  given that 26 5  of the ppl have decided we must go ahead with the erg version of #brexit #peoplesvote #remain optionlet s thwart the will of the erg  
new boy #raab threatens to refuse paying #brexit bill     where did he learn such idiocy     #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #brexitshambles #marr #fbpe #abtv #waton #peoplesvote #finalsay 
i understand that john major  ex tory pm will appear on #marr tomorrow to reiterate his concerns about his party s handling of #brexit  and i ll be nodding along  this is the darkest place that i ve ever been in support of what i believe  #leftagainstbrexit #remain 
a £9 3m pro #eu publicity blitz by david cameron s government in the run up to the #brexit referendum gave the #remain side an unfair advantage  the like of which should be outlawed in future votes  an independent commission has suggested  
why is brexit happening   this cartoon may help explain    #brexit #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #brexitshambles #erg #fbpe #abtv #waton #peoplesvote #finalsay #reesmogg 
trying to work out how may is asking the eu not to fall back on unworkable positions  does she mean the single market   customs union both seem to be working rather well for the eu as they do for us the unworkable position is held by the govt   anyone backing #brexit #remain 
if you were given a #finalsayforall #peoplesvote   how would you vote   #leave #remain #eu #brexitplease rt after you vote for a larger sample  
didn t see  clean  #brexit on the ballot paper   what about #brexit supporting mps whose constituents voted #remain #peoplesvote 
there was speculation that boris would deliver the killer punch against pm in his resignation speechjust as geoffrey howe did to maggieit turned out to be a damp squibit was left to tory backbencher @andreajenkyns  to deliver the killer punch when did #brexit become #remain   
i ve a good #fridayfeeling that all may not be good with the good friday agreement if ukgovt is allowed to get away with this now invalid #brexit coup the only way to keep an open border between roi  ni   gb is to #remain in the sm cu   but then we might as well stay in the eu 
so #fbpe   other remainers  mrs may will rule out the eu backstop for ireland  no deal brexit  she has to go  @uklabour this is your chance  support #remain   you have a real chance of forming a gov  no deal could bring the cons down  but we need an alternative  #stopbrexit 
#nadinedorries   #number10 were led by the nose by the elite #remain  establishment  they were battered by them     @dominicraab has one job and that is to prepare for a #nodeal #brexit   @juliahb1 @nadinedorries  @conhome @andreajenkyns @dcbmep #uk 
fraudulent  #remain was backed by government funding  plenty of working class people voted for #leave  you all said the uk economy would fall apart once #brexit was announced  here we are with the best unemployment figures for 43 years and 21 consecutive quarters of gdp growth  
steve baker just stated in parl re ministerial debates that if the govt accepted an eea lite option it would damage the tory party me  there we have it   the priority for this #brexit madness is not the ppl  is not the country  is not the economy but the tory party  qed#remain 
as i have told you  i will not commit  as an ex #brexit voter  to voting #labour unless you support a #peoplesvote in which i would now vote #remain we need to escape this brexit madness   i live in a labour held marginal   
for  ghastly man  translate ashonest statesman   democrat unlike the charatans who lied  deceived   cheated their way with illegal tactics to gain a deeply suspect #brexit result #peoplesvote to allow a #finalsay   a #remain option  the only way out of this debased policy  
it s not been a good week for the bbc  has it     #cliffrichard #sircliffrichard #brexit #stopbrexit #remain #brexitshambles #fbpe #abtv #waton #peoplesvote #finalsay #bbcbias 
no one seems to be reporting this  but the look on #corbyn’s face when the #remain amendment fell  was incredible proper #brexit and no general election  he then skunk out of the chamber looking a broken man  
  first poll on a three way referendum gives #remain a comfortable lead  parliament is paralysed and the mood of the country has changed  the only way out of #brexit is through a #peoplesvote  with #labour leading the campaign to remain  
huge #remain majority in a new brexit referendum  latest poll shows the public would now vote to remain by 55  to 45  in a “three way” question referendum  according to tonight’s @yougov poll for the times #stopbrexit #peoplesvote 
it won t make the headlines it should  but the eu has signed a historic trade deal with japan today  how can the uk enjoy the benefits  reject may s #brexit deal  earn a  #peoplesvote and win the campaign to #remain 
nadine dorries attacking anna soubry for delivering a forensic study of the brexit chaos  nadine doesn’t have a plan that can end in an agreement nadine has finally realised that no deal was always the only option what took her so long #remain #fbpe #peoplesvote 
so giving the ppl a #peoplesvote where all voters get a #finalsay to confirm if they still want the #brexit deal no deal or now to #stopbrexit #remain   #reform damages democracy if a majority of ppl no longer want this #brexitshambles do you believe it should be stopped  
here are six of the most ridiculous claims from #projectfear about the impact of a clean #brexit on businesses  prices and jobs  i’m paraphrasing to make my points  but all are staples of the #remain camp   1 8  
so says @andrealeadsom  the lady from the previous @conservatives leadership contest who talked the #brexit talk  but then stepped aside at last minute to give #remain er @theresa may an uncontested victory  what price was paid then  what price now  another 30 pieces of silver  
watch #borisjohnson come out for  a #softbrexit  whatever that is  or even go back to #remain   which he once was  he knows that #trump   #stevebannon   have killed  #brexit as we know it    except for hardcore  who will shelter  in #ukip the #tories rightwing  holding party  
nobody is coming up with an alternative to may’s brexit  errr      #remain  #fbpe 
a clear and consistent 10 point swing from #leave to #remain giving remain a 5 point lead @theresa may  at what point do we get a #peoplesvote   or are referendums only held to settle arguments within the #tory party #brexit 
lloyds has been in britain since 1686 because of brexit  it is now moving jobs to brussels and that means less tax money to fund the nhs  too #stopbrexit #remain 
a no deal #brexit would most likely result in a state of emergency  measures could be taken in the name of preventing disorder such as banning protests   criminalising incitement to protest  which if given a broad definition could shut down the #remain movement #stopbrexit #fbpe 
this is what i don t get  giving the ppl a #peoples vote to allow a #finalsay doesn t overturn #brexit unless the majority of the ppl now wish to #remain in which case it is the ppl who overturn it it s a false reason used as an excuse to avoid them forcing their will on the ppl 
please listen whether you voted #leave or #remain  this gave me goosebumps  of total fear  who is going to answer that question  what happens the day after  #brexit  
in 24 hours #trump has insulted the mayor of london  humiliated the government and praised boris johnson over #brexitwe must stand up to him  the single best way to do it is to #remain in the eu  help us make it happen  help us fight back  
dear mps #brexit has hamstrung our country   you re flogging a dead horse   give it up   move on   get over it   #stopbrexit put country 1st    #peoplesvote #finalsayforall#reject #revoke #remain #reform 
so now in backing a deeply flawed #brexit which can only leave us poorer  weaker with less control   fewer rights corbyn s labour will be backing decades of austerity   #peoplesvote to give everyone a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit option #remain 
the only way theresa may can save her brexit plan now is to let the british people vote for it   or to #remain this whole sorry mess illustrates that you can’t resolve brexit in westminster so #suspenda50 and call a #peoplesvote  
democracy    mmmm   that would be giving all the people a #finalsay via a #peoplesvote to confirm if the still want a #brexit deal no deal or now to#reject #revoke #remain #reformis that not correct  
mrs may re chequers  to deliver a smooth   orderly #brexit that    protects jobs  protects livelihoods   also meets our commitment for no hard border between roi   n i me  so we ll have to #remain in the eu then   that s a relief  
as long as the pathetic #liar   #fraudster @theresa may remains in the office of #pm  #britain will #remain within the #eu  the eu #turd polisher needs to go  #maymustgo #maymustgonow @conservatives #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty #theresamay #brexit  
from a leading #qc interpreting the phrase  ‘the #commonrulebook ’ every  person who voted to #leave should read this and understand its meaning   the #chequers turd proposal is to #remain in the #eu and we will be in a far worse position  than we are now  #maymustgo #brexit #uk 
if you’re unhappy about #brexit for the love of sanity   our country sign this  you never know  it just might include an option to #remain we mustn’t give up hope    #peoplesvote 
boris   dd have left the government in crisis we ve never had a better chance of convincing the @uklabour leadership to fight to #remain  but we need your help to make it happen let s not waste this crisis  please help us to stand against #brexit  
and a bigger platform needs to be given to the #remain activists who have the personality   character to engage the apathetic and communicate the importance of stopping #brexit  we have such talent in our community that needs to be supported not constantly criticised   undermined 
our latest win comes from @winch labour brilliant to hear they have passed their version of the @remain labour   @labour4eu motion for #lab18  it calls on the party to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu #brexit is not inevitable  
1  labour schism  the threat s real if there s not a major shift in #brexit policy at conference a #brexitshambles harms uka #peoplesvote is democratica #finalsay confirms the will#remain   current deal is best dealprob is the leadership stance#fbpe 
 @rafaelbehr eviscerates the claim that #brexit will make britain more open to the world in just two paragraphs eu membership is a springboard to global trade  not a barrier to it if we value a global britain  we need a #peoplesvote and we need to #remain in the eu  
macron rejects may s plea for help to rescue her #brexit plan another day  another nail in the #brexit coffin  there is no  good deal   bring it to a head asap   no fudging  no transition  no extensions  just give us the #peoplesvote   a #remain option  
may   corbyn both supported #remain  both are now desperately working for leave   despite the woeful  illegal campaign  the narrow margin of the result   the warnings about the uk s world standing post #brexit i do not trust either of them  i will never vote for either of them  
a reminder that farage  raab  redwood and other tory brexiters were calling for a 2nd referendum  a straight replay  not a vote on the final outcome  in the event of a #remain victory #peoplesvote 
if @uklabour commits to backing a #peoplesvote and campaigns to #remain in the eu  we stand to win 4 million more votes  it s in the national interest to stop #brexit and the party interest to stop brexit join @remain labour and let s make it happen  
does anyone else think that all the noise about a no deal #brexit is smoke   mirrors to make us feel happy about any deal actually made  i don’t want a bloody deal  i want a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
#brexit has a tipping point  we are almost there  don’t give up  don’t get off the #remain side of the see saw  we can only do this together  united  knowing we are on the right side of history and democracy  have a fab weekend #fbpe peeps#saturdaymorning #bankholidayweekend 
is it me or has the #remain cause grown exponentially whilst the #brexit one deflates by the day  it s now only the govt  the opposition   an army of fakes sustaining it   preventing its collapse they ve nothing new to offer to justify this #brexitshambles #finalsay #stopbrexit 
this #map shows that since #brexit turned out to be more complex and difficult than many might’ve assumed the public opinion has shifted and now favors #remain  source   pic twitter com 0y4gbgaixa 
there is no room for me in corbyn s #brexit supporting labour  i am a centrist #remain  die hard   i will not hand him my vote on a plate to be misinterpreted as support for a corbyn #brexit   
i watched your speech on #bbc parliament late lastnight you gave on churchill not a #tory supporter at any time but must say it made me proud to be #british hence why i think #brexit is a disaster   #remain is the answer as for #mogg he should have gone to #ukip or lost his seat  
 @francesogrady is right  #brexit will be devastating for working people there is only one deal that will restore confidence  boost economic growth and restore the value of the pound in your pocket  that is the deal that sees britain #remain in the eu  leading  not leaving  
you want to try and keep your eu citizenship  the eu wants to helpwe need to get 1 000 000 on this official eu recognised petition   sign and share across europe   all current eu citizens can sign#peoplesvote #brexit #remain #brexitshambles 
it’s the job of a responsible government to have the national interests foremost  your own figures show brexit is a disaster in whatever form  the majority of the country are #remain #voteleavebrokethelaw that’s the gov’s own ministers who were responsible for its governance  
from  £350 million more a week for the nhs   to matt hancock pleading with gps not to stockpile life saving medicines  this is the story of #brexit a story that must end with a #peoplesvote and @uklabour leading the campaign to #remain in the eu  
people  now this ain t your normal #petition this one s going straight to the european commission and could have a major impact if it hits 1m  sign and share folks  sign and share  rt #brexit #stopbrexit #weareeurope #strongertogether #finalsay #peoplesvote #fbpe #remain 
shock poll shows the north east has abandoned its thumping support for brexit the region has seen an 8 point swing to #remain and a majority now back a #peoplesvote a no deal brexit would cost each   every person in the ne £3 000 a year  #stopbrexit  
democracy demands a new brexit referendum   menzies campbell scotland supports a #peoplesvote by 48  to 31  and scotland would vote overwhelmingly to #remain in the eu by 66  to 34  let’s do it  #stopbrexit  
remember the #remain campaign   led by unenthusiastic european cameron  and career long brexiter corbyn  and packed with  remainers  like theresa may  who ve effortlessly converted into zealous brexiters  it s amazing that remain nearly won  #stopbrexit #brexit  
get on board @jeremycorbyn we don t want #brexit we want a #peoplesvote with #remain as an option  your members want it and they should make policy 
can t wait for the #brexit  technical papers  i e  a catalogue of govt s abject failure to deliver any of the promises a raft of ministers   mps aka  charlatans  made to con a small majority of the ppl to back it and it is not the eu s fault #peoplesvote for a #finalsay#remain 
no need to bully them  they re doing it willingly now they see the lies   deceits behind an invalidated #brexit which will rob us of our rights w o consent  our young ppl of their future   damage our country irreparably the denial of a #peoplesvote the act of autocrats  #remain 
this two years ago i voted #remain  i hadn’t thought much about the eu but leave had no plan and farage and boris were embarrassing  i now know from my time on social media #brexit is an orchestrated concerted attempt on our democracy  we must #standup2brexit  together 
i think it s the responsibility of the #brexit team to find its own comedians  rather than blaming the #remain side for not providing any god this conversation feels familiar    
if we backed brexit in a snap ge knowing   the country thinks brexit a mistake  labour members and voters are majority remain  our constituencies are majority remain  it s bad for the countrywe would inevitably be judged at the ballot box #remain 
believe strongly that if twitter   facebook lived up to their promises   purged every fake account #brexit would stop tomorrow   #remain would win this hands down  it s all #brexiters have to offer  fakes  delusionists   charlatans   lies #peoplesvote   a #finalsay to prove it  
obviously as a maj of members   voters back #remain  to win corbyn must gain non labour votes  unlikely while he denies a #peoplesvote   #stopbrexit option corbynites just don t get that #remainers r more committed to stopping #brexit than electing him   
if there is a ge the #remain vote goes only to remain parties  not soft brexit or fudges  you fooled us once but not again  so who wants our votes  there are millions of us  we are the makers of kings  but we are no ones fools  #peoplesvote #brexit  
labour   #remain both need to curb the influence of the tax dodging #brexit billionaire press  we should unite against it  but to do that labour has to oppose brexit  so long as labour backs brexit it cannot properly fight against the right wing press#peoplesvote 
this was only a matter of time  as the result of the eu referendum showed  brexit is england s problem  in scotland our eyes must #remain fixed on independence  
absolute hogwash  how much did the sun pay for this online poll for brexit spin doctors to tweet out every credible pollster shows a growing majority to #remain in the eu as the country turns against brexit  call a #peoplesvote and put it to the test  
can i remind you george  nobody voted for a #conservative #brexit  @uklabour  @thegreenparty  @libdems  @dupleader  @thesnp or @ukip #brexit the choice on #euref ballot paper was #leave or #remain @theresa may s #chequers brexit means we #remain in the #eu   is unacceptable  
#labour voter or party member opposed to #brexit  one of the 77  of lab supporters who  believe our party should back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu sign up to our grassroots campaign and take us past 7000 twitter  followers today  
there is no way that stopping #brexit can be termed a betrayal if a maj of voters now wish to #stopbrexit  the betrayal of democracy is down to those who fight furiously to prevent the ppl having the opportunity to #remain if that is now the majority will crystal #peoplesvote  
i haven t had a #poll yet on the #bigissue of the day         so here goes #poll #brexitpoll #remainpoll if there were another vote how would you vote #brexit  #leave #remain #ivevotedonce #inevervote  #europeanunion #eu #ukvotes 
dear nigel welcome back  #remain s ready 4 u  the lies behind a flawed #brexit won t work anymore you re right it s important the establishment listens to the ppl  the way to find out is to give all the ppl a #finalsay  a #peoplesvote   a #remain option  
so  the dirty  rotten #leave campaign is to be run all over again   even without another referendum  all the same old lies used to win the #eureferendum will no doubt be trotted out again  is the #remain movement ready  share @jon danzig’s commentary link   
“as a welsh socialist  i believe we have a moral duty to #stopbrexit on behalf of everyone in the uk since the brexit referendum  we have all discovered many more reasons why leaving the eu will be immensely damaging ”hold a #peoplesvote to #remain  
when people are willing to sacrifice an opportunity at full sovereignty and economic prosperity because they want to be an exchange student more easily then you know there is something wrong #brexit #remain 
so #remain is best option unless you buy into mogg and digby and agree that this is an ideology that might  in 50 to 100 years have some benefits that’s a pretty altruistic stance to hope your great great grandchildren might get a sniff of a better life from #brexit  
what corbyn  may and farage don t want you to know is that we could have 224 brand new hospitals a year   if we bin brexit and grab the #remain dividend  #nhs #remaindividend 
respect a ref result based upon the non binding opinion of 26 5  of the ppl 37  voters backing various #brexit  all of which remove rights w o consent   leave the uk   the maj of its cits poorer ok sure  if u respect the democratic right of 100  voters to get a #finalsay#remain 
2  oppose not appease #brexitat least support a democratic #finalsay  a #peoplesvote with a #reject #revoke #remain #reform option   don t suppress a conference debate   vote   that is the action of autocrats    
what matters keir is that the labour leadership remembers it is meant to be a democratic party  that all versions of this flawed #brexit are tory   remove rights   leave the uk   cits worse off   that to validate it there must be a #peoplesvote  a #finalsay with a #remain option  
my constituency #richmondpark is now 74  #remain  @zacgoldsmith how can you justify backing #brexit when the vast majority of your constituents clearly don t want it   
i am not hoarding food   i m buying more   putting it away tho   i don t believe that #brexit will be allowed to happen   i believe that we will get a #peoplesvote and #stopbrexitso i am storing food for the huge party that #remain is going to have    when we #stopbrexit 
the bad news for #brexiters just keeps coming   just in case you missed it  you are the minority   tbh you always were   the uk is a #remain nation   any mp forcing this invalid #brexit upon us will not be forgiven #peoplesvote#remain optionnow  
even e  anglia   the heart of brexitland has changed its mind on #brexit only autocrats would ignore this shift   still deny the ppl their #finalsayforall #peoplesvote nowwith a #remain option may   corbyn don t you dare delay it until it s to late  
people are exhausted  no one asked for this and no one expected to be catapulted into twitter land visibility  im in awe of all the #fbpe and #remain counts who every day fight #brexit  we are all different but ultimately united  group hug and huge respect to all  thank you x 
the #conservativeparty manifesto  in 2015 pledged to give british citizens abroad the vote in 2016 they voted to ignore their manifesto and stopped 3 5 million brits abroad from voting in the referendum it s  because they thought they would vote #remain #fbpe   
the govt   opposition have buggered off on hol but that s ok  less of their #brexit bs   when they come back they ll find out #remain  #fbpe #abtv have grown exponentially  neither now represent the majority will which is clearly to #stopbrexit ignore us at your peril  #finalsay 
brexit  ‘they don’t know what they’re doing’leave voting areas like swansea are turning their back on brexit and going #remain with more and more people wanting to stay in the eu  here’s why we need a #peoplesvote with an #optiontostay  
belief is all you have  fact free quasi religious rhetoric majority are #remain  100 constituencies have swung  name a brexit benefit other than for the tax avoiding elite   disaster capitalists  how will brexit benefit those whom you mendaciously pretend to champion  #finalsay 
#brexit  we should forget about a second referendum and simply dump brexit  #remain 
two thirds of @uklabour constituences now back #remain 171 out of 262 labour seats are remain seats   65  mps should back voters  members and constituences who all want to stay here’s the full list of 112 brexit voting areas that now want to remain  
this story could not be more important  the country is turning against #brexit and the shift is biggest in #labour heartlands it is time for @uklabour to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu  it is in the party interest  it is in the national interest  
another leave voter changes to #remain  noting the #brexit that’s pursued is ‘trick against the masses for private gain’ many leave voters won’t admit they’re victims of a scam by a wealthy elite  those voters are as much victims of brexit as others are  
the majority now want to #remain in the eu by a six point margin  53  47  under 50s strongly want to stay  huge poll finds and four in every five 18 to 24 year olds want to stay in brexit is not the will of the people hold a #peoplesvote and #stopbrexit  
most popular  it s the only way out now  if a maj still want to accept a #brexit that leaves us poorer   removes rights then i guess at least it will confirm it but if a maj now wants to#revoke #remain #reform then mps must now vote to #stopbrexit #fbpe 
the #remain campaign was lost by an arrogant pm who failed to understand his policies had peed off much of the country  the #brexit negotiations are being lost by an arrogant pm who fails to understand how the eu works  what a bloody shambles#peoplesvote 
i often come accross tweets from #brexit accounts bemoaning the fact that #remain ers don’t “get behind it”out of interest  what do the brexiters do to “get behind it”and how’s that working out so far   
#brexit is all about the removal of rights   a disgrace that nearly 70 million eu  incl all 65 m uk  citizens will have rights removed without consent   in many cases without having been given a vote #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option#finalsayforall #fbpe #abtv 
absolutely not   #brexit is a betrayal of the country   leaving the eu without delivering a single one of the brexitter s promises would be a betrayal of leave voters too a clear majority now want a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
stand up for #brexit   that s funny i m standing up for democracy   the sort that allows all voters a #peoplesvote giving us a #finalsay with a #remain option 
1  ok you #brexit backing autocrats who are only interested in imposing your wills on the ppl than in the real will of the maj of the ppl let s try once again a #peoplesvote giving us all a #finalsay with a #remain option doesn t undermine   #stopbrexit unless a maj want it  
a little recap on the #brexit  options  and the extent to which each scenario will damage our public finances and public services  we must reject a choice between pain and more pain we must earn a #peoplesvote and win the right to #remain in the eu  
a reminder that @patel4witham s claims that #remain cheated have been dismissed by the electoral commission  just more #leavelies to add to the mountain of mendacity perverting our politics  defend democracy #stopbrexit and #jailtheleaveliars #brexit 
no deal brexit will break ‘eu’s own laws’that’ll be #remain then sorted #fbpe 
 absolutely no way  demands for people s vote on brexit deal can be ignored  says senior momentum sourcecome on #remain   interesting bedfellows but let s give momentum our support to get a change of labour policy   thwart the erg #brexitlive poll too     
maybe it s time that labour recognised that all versions of #brexit leave us poorer   remove rights   hand the country to the far right  and that only an anti tory alliance   a #peoplesvote allowing the ppl a #finalsay with a #remain option can thwart them  
why the hell aren’t you actually supporting #remain  @jeremycorbyn  for a moment  just pinch yourself   experience reality  millions of jobs lost   for a flawed principle   a brexit that fewer   fewer want  wake up  give yourself   and @uklabour a fighting chance  #peoplesvote 
mr @jeremycorbyn you promised  no jobs lost #brexit  in #ge2017why are you not supporting #remain every type pf #brexit loses jobs71  of @uklabour voted remain in 2016youngsters supported #labour in #ge2017because you dissembledif you commit to remain  labour might win 
come on labour   what could be more fun than helping #fbpe  #remain thwart the invalid erg #brexit that s being imposed upon us  you know the maj of you want to #stopbrexit   the loss of rights   impoverishment of the uk  back a #finalsay   ditch your leadership if they deny it  
been a heck of a week for me  priscilla   the family on the #eu mainland in #france reminded me more than ever we gotta stay close to our neighbours   friends over there  keep on keepin on fightin #brexit any way you can  y all know it makes sense #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain 
#brexit news  sky news opinion poll shows 50  of uk citizens wishes a second referendum and 59  would vote #remain in the eu please retweet to inform   #peoplesvote #bexitshamble #fbpe #finalsay #stopbrexit 
stick it to  em faisal   factual journalism at its best   #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #revoke #remain #reform option #brexit is all about the imposition of political will on the ppl   nothing to do with the true will of the ppl   
we are fighting to stop #brexit  but not for the status quo  we need to #remain in the eu  but we need reform and renewal as well  the @andrew adonis   @williamnhutton book makes the case brilliantly   
if brexit leaves you poorer who will you blame  #brexit #eu #poll #retweet #peoplesvote #remain #retweet 
just remove the term  no deal  from the title   you cover all versions of this #brexitshambles   there is only one type of #brexit that has any hope of working in the national interest   that s #stopbrexit utter madness#peoplesvote #remain 
he has considerable foresight  he made sure he was elected as an mp in order to maximise his influence on a no deal #brexit  once he gets his way he ll just disappear into his privileged lifestyle and count his amassing fortune  and say  screw you to his constituents  #remain 
i voted #remain i voted for @jeremycorbyn in the 2nd leadership election after the #brexit ref i voted labour in the ge after the #brexit ref i would vote labour again tomorrow  brexit belongs entirely to the tories i stand with jeremy corbyn #wearecorbyn 
so our democracy is now in the hands of cowards who are more scared of the far right thugs than of the majority of decent people   by backing #brexit they fuel the extremistsdon t appease    oppose #peoplesvote #finalsay#revoke #remain #reform#stopbrexit stop the far right 
so there it is   #remain did not break the law and #leave did  what next  when will a halt be called to this illegal fiasco   #stopbrexit 
may replaced by soubry corbyn replaced by any remainer cable replaced by moran #peoplesvote #stopbrexit #remain in #eu general election #toriesout lab lib green plaid snp coalition in austerity ended fptp replaced by pr      or #brexit and #fascism  
#gdp growth figures for the #uk have overtaken the #eurozone in q2 of this year companies choose to #remain and invest in the uk    ignore the #brexithysteria  the economy is robust  and we look forward to #brexit #projectpositive 
1  oh no you don t @michelbarnier @guyverhofstadt @donaldtusk   don t  you dare sell out the majority of brits who want to #stopbrexit   #remain whether in the uk or in the eu  a #brexit fudge won t be worth the paper its written on stop pandering to may  she has no mandate   
public opinion is shifting towards #remain  how is it democratic to force a hard brexit on a nation that can see the cliff edge more clearly now that it’s getting closer and wants a re think  #peoplesvote #finalsayforall 
brexit costing britain £500m a week and rising  new report shows and without brexit  austerity would be over didn’t see that on the side of the bus let’s #stopbrexit  #remain in the eu  and fund our nhs instead  
sky data poll  56  think brexit will be worse than expected majority of the public now want a #peoplesvote with an #optiontoremain  50  to 39  and #remain would now win by a huge 10 point margin  55  to 45  please rt so everyone knows  #stopbrexit  
the will of the people has changed they re now very pessimistic about brexit    clearly favour holding a referendum on #remain v #nodeal #brexit  remain leads 55  45  the case for #peoplesvote #finalsay leading to #exitfrombrexit is overwhelming  
to all filthy cave dwelling unhelpful #remainers  more   more people are waking up to the truth that any #brexit deal will be a national disaster  you are my inspiration   strength to carry on  see you in london on 20th october  we deserve a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
jacob explains why parliament won t vote again on brexit if no deal is agreed with eu then we #leave   trade on wto tariffs mps will not be able to stop that happening why aren t #remoaner media   mps telling you that because they want us to #remain  
still think #projectfear is fake  uk appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no deal brexit yes  hmg has appointed a  minister for rationing  in peacetime we need a #peoplesvote with #remain as one of the choices to stop this madness 
the majority of voters never voted for it in the 1st place   a clear majority now want to stop #brexit   remain   it simply the minority of #brexiters in govt   #lexiters in opposition who are standing in the way of a democratic #peoplesvote with a #remain option #finalsayforall 
“useful talks”  you literally said you could support a  sensible  tory brexit deal  let me tell you @jeremycorbyn  no #brexit deal is sensible  the sensible option is to have a #peoplesvote  campaign to #exitfrombrexit so we can #remain and #stopbrexit  
currently on the train to folkestone  from paris  3 vans   loaded 11 am   tip 7 pm heathrow   load and strait out to brussels for a 08 00 am drop tomorow   reload and tip heathrow tomorrow pm   that’s how #justintime transport works   no customs   no brexit   #remain #peoplesvote 
a food minister  a fucking food minister   appointed to make sure we don t all starve to death after #brexit  alternatively  we could just #remain and not starve   http so   www theguardian com business 2018 sep 26 uk appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no deal brexit 
in summary then  mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn wants a general election so he can push through his dream #brexit  failing that then perhaps maybe a #peoplesvote with possibly perhaps an option to #remain  full steam ahead with respecting a vote achieved by cheating   breaking the law  
still think #projectfear is fake   uk appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no deal brexit yup  hmg just basically appointed and minister for rationingwe need a #peoplesvote with #remain as one of the choices to stop this madness 
uk appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no deal brexit brexiters are literally gambling with our food supplies nobody voted for this demand your mp calls for a #peoplesvote and campaigns to #remain  
the brexit duopoly of labour   the tories is wrecking the u k they are speaking different ideologies that translate into the same regressive language      we need a #finalsay referendum to #remain  
brexit has become unnegotiable ⁦@theresa may⁩ now has a constitutional duty to admit that truth there is no positive outcome that is acceptable to the eu and to the uk mps need to hold a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain  
if we don’t stop the leavers  we will all be losers #finalsay referendum with the option to #remain 
there is no sweet spot  the more the #brexit options unravel it’s clear none will benefit our country as the govts own assessments concluded months ago that’s why more and more people are backing @peoplesvote uk deal or no deal   with #remain on the ballot paper  
crystal clear   corbyn’s principal aim is to deliver #brexitunlike the @libdems who want a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum leading to an #exitfrombrexit if you want the uk to #remain then you’re wasting your time voting for or being a member of corbyn’s labour  
been out  realise jeremy is speaking the critical words 4 #remainers #remainernow to watch out for are  we respect the referendum if they appear in any form then any #peoplesvote will be a sham   the leadership have no intention of a real #remain option#finalsayforall #fbpe 
keir starmer launched an unexpected brexit zinger – and it hit the spot@uklabour’s brexit boss set the #lab18 conference alight when he revealed that #remain could be an option for a #peoplesvote keep up the campaigning  we can #stopbrexit  
2  #brexit removes rights without consent  undermines good jobs   will leave most citizens worse off why should the ppl not be given a #peoplesvote to confirm the majority opinion to eitheraccept the #brexit deal no deal or#reject #revoke #remain #reform  
a significant moment  @uklabour grassroots   trade unions tonight back new clear policy on #brexit  we will oppose no deal  oppose a reckless tory deal or blind #brexit   we want a ge but if not possible   we need a  public vote  where #remain is an option  @peoplesvote uk #lab18 
do you think @uklabour should back a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  #brexitplease rt after you vote for a larger sample  
ps it s only betraying 26 5  of the ppl who voted 4 several versions of #brexit  many of whom now regret it having seen the utter mess you re making of it  to deny it is the betrayala #peoplesvote is the only democ way to confirm if the maj will is still 2#brexit or #remain 
jeez labour try to understand if u force a ge you alienate tory rebelsif u offer a tale of two #brexit s you lose millions of #remain votes   the ge if u give the ppl a #peoplesvote with a chance to #remain   #brexit fails  the govt falls   #remain votes return   its win win  
the majority of people wanted #brexit  you’ve had 2 years to get the best possible deal  you told us it would be easy if the majority of people would now vote to #remain  that only reflects your failure #labconf18 #lab2018 
keir starmer said it  if #brexit deal fails  nobody s ruling out a public vote   #remain must be an option  not in approved script apparently standing ovation dennis skinner s face a pictureno doubt corbyn  mcdonnell  gardiner mccluskey will do their damnedest to thwart it  
excellent speech from @keir starmer strong   clear @uklabour will oppose no deal  blind #brexit    a reckless tory #brexit   that we want election   but if that not possible   we will campaign for a  public vote  where #remain an option  @labpeoplesvote @peoplesvote uk #lab18 
a direct appeal to delegates to the @uklabour conference #lab18  the british people deserve an opportunity to deliver their verdict on #brexit  the lies have been exposed  vote for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  thank you  
 @keir starmer on #r4today says labour position is ‘referendum if no general election’  but he’s unable to promise labour will push for #peoplesvote with option to #remain he’s clearly doing his best  in the circs of the labour party  but it’s all for us all still to push for 
 @bbcnickrobinson ‘just like the conservatives  labour is a party conflicted on brexit’   @libdems are not  btw  we are solidily pro remain  calling for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  
the money s there#remain is angry#brexit has aroused the centreparty loyalty lowvoters disillusioned with 2 party fixsocial media opens accesslibdems offer base organisationcentrist tory labour mps cometh a leader it s not 1981   the ground is fertile  
 i voted #remain but since the #eu were so rude to theresa may  i want to #brexit is the biggest load of tosh i have ever heard  and what s more  mps are tweeting this codswallop then there is nothing to fear from a #peoplesvote with a #remainoption#letuschangeourminds 
keir starmer  new #brexit ref under labour could include option to #remain  me  fine but if it ain t policy   in writing it ain t worth the paper it won t be written on #peoplesvote   remain option or no labour govt  
presumably this would have to be norway plus cu incl services to avoid the irish border   be compliant to sm which is effectively apay   obey no say #brexit might as well stay   must be a clear #remain #reform  uk  option or it s still a bad deal which removes rights   jobs 
love corbyn  hate brexit       which is it to be  you can t have both#lab2018#peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
given half a chance  the tories   labour will unite in favour of a #peoplesvote referendum to force #brexit through  we must unite to ensure that #remain is an option  the people who bought #brexit won’t give in easily  #remainoption #optiontoremain #arealchoice 
labour members in favour of a #peoplesvote   wanting to #remain in the eu have been sold a pig in a poke for the labour leadership #brexit will happen in contrast @libdems want a #finalsay referendum   an #exitfrombrexit time for labour mps   members to vote with their feet  
so labour nudging towards norway option while tories sliding over to canada option   hobson’s choice #brexit then  not what we want @labour4eu @remain labour @women 4 europe and many other #remain groups  we fight on   
dear @uklabour members who want to #remain  a ge before march 2019 may get you a labour government but it will also get you a labour #brexit  you have a leadership that does not want us to have a #peoplesvote  
leave mean leave spokesman stating a #peoplesvote would disenfranchise those who voted for #brexit disenfranchise   deny a vote  like happened to c  5m uk eu citizens directly affected  in the euref all voters including #brexiters would get a #finalsay u      #remain #fbpe 
so no change   no commitment   no #remain option   more #brexit fudge   less time left  not bloody good enough simple majority  binding #peoplesvote for a binary #finalsayaccept the #brexitshambles or#reject #revoke #remain #reform#fbpe #abtv 
for those in the @uklabour compositing meeting drafting the brexit motion  remember 86  of your members   and the majority of the public   want a #peoplesvote on brexit  and the majority of the public now want to #remain commit to a final say  with an option to stay  
right  i am no longer fucking pulling punches  so do with that what you will  #brexit makes no sense  it’s a political storm in which you need to find your ground  michael dougan is where you should ground yourself  as he has from 2016  think  open your eyes  fight x #remain 
#brexit  100s of young labour activists flock to newly created app to push party to back new ref don t let #corbyn  mcdonnell  gardiner   mcclusky misappropriate the #peoplesvote  it s not theirs  it s the peoples   it has a #remain option at its heart  
thousands of #peoplesvote marchers shut down liverpool city centre in show of anti brexit feeling the public   and labour members   want to #remain @uklabour must commit to a #peoplesvote with a clear #optiontoremain  #marchforthemany #pvforthemany 
in the event a snap general election is called  will you lend @uklabour your vote if their policy is still for a  jobs first  #brexit and they do not support a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain please vote and retweet for the best sample  thank you  
come on peeps this is vital   jo   team have won the referral to the ecj to consider our unilateral ability to #revokea50  stop #brexit   #remain in the eu with rebate etc intact please give what you can to the battle fundyou country needs you lets also get that #peoplesvote 
#nigelfarage  we need to send a clear message to #remain #mps  if you betray #brexit  we will never vote for you again   #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc @conservatives @conhome @labourleave @standup4brexit @leavemnsleave @cchqpress @theresa may #tory #conservativeparty 
if they decide  not  to include #remain as a voting option in a #peoplesvote then the whole exercise will be rejected by the @peoplesvote uk movement the whole point of a #finalsay referendum is for the british people to be given an opportunity to reject #brexit#endthechaos 
so it comes down to this  defeat chequers  call a ge  vote out the tories and tory #brexit  vote for corbyn and a @uklabour brexit  no fucking way  we are the king makers  the two main parties would do well to remember that #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
giving the people the #finalsay does not mean a choice of either a #labour #brexit or a #tory brexit  the people must be able to vote to #exitfrombrexit and #remain in the #eu  a #peoplesvote must give people this meaningful choice  #brexitreality 
my god the audacity   brexit is the fascist playbook  including playing the victim while quashing all    any dissent   calling those defending democracy the enemy  anyone not in this fight yet   time to get off the sidelines   pick a side  #remain #stopbrexit #peoplesvote 
if @jeremycorbyn backs a #peoplesvote  i will back him in november when he tries to topple may — on condition the #peoplesvote is held before we #brexit and has an option to #remain  cc  @keir starmer 
leave means leave ‘mass’ rally in bolton with farage  davis and hoey barely attracts 1 000 people  in contrast hundreds of thousands have attended #remain rallies  the british people have turned against brexit  #peoplesvote 
@bbcradio4 how dare @jeremy hunt claim that remainers will now want to speed up #brexit because the #eu is threatening to break up the uk  one of the many reasons to #remain is that we knew all along that brexit  not our #eu partners  brought this very threat  #r4today 
right we have officially gone off piste la la land now  there must be something we can do to stop #brexit it’s utter full scale national insanity not the will of the people  please promise me friends you will fight for #remain right to the end  we can do this but only together  
2  the real prob is the labour leadership   the govt will undermine itself with its impossible #brexit but corbyn s stubborn refusal to back a #peoplesvote   a clear #remain option is not principle it s cynical game play he s wrongany #brexitshambles harms us all  #stopbrexit 
1  fgs what s wrong with us i was surprised by saltzburg  not that it happened but that it happened now i thought they d let may get away with it as she hoped   kick her invalid harmful #brexit down the road judgement day sooner no more tory con#peoplesvote #remain asap 
it is 819 days since the referendum and there is no more viable plan for leaving the eu today than there was on day one  it is over  the government has failed on its own terms it is time for @uklabour to show leadership  call for a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu  
#remain and prosper because #brexit   is totally bonkers   
so daily express reporting may will throw her toys out of the #brexit pram   walk if the eu doesn t do what she wants   me  please   find a cornfield   go on a long walk   maybe   just keep walking so the rest of us can hold a #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option  
if the #peoplesvote was on whether there should be #nodeal or #chequers  i’d get it  what i cannot accept  as a #remain voter myself  is an option to ignore the result of the referendum   stay in the eu  even though i d like it  i think it’s anti democracy  
more than 8 in 10 people aged 18 20 want to #remain in the eu by offering the country a #peoplesvote @uklabour can prove we are on their side we can only stand up for young people if we stand against #brexit 
1  read every single word   inwardly digest  now s the time 4 every citizen to step up in defence of our democracy  don t be silent #fighback vs this debased govt   complicit opposition   their invalid #brexitfight 4 a #finalsay   a #peoplesvote #remain 
1  i wonder how many of the mps in the 100 constituencies now showing a majority in favour of stopping #brexit   wishing to #remain in the eu   or those shifting close to switching are reading the runes   starting to question openly the decision to leave   backing a #peoplesvote  
she most likely can claim her constituents have changed their minds too in any case this #brexit has lost its mandate 26 5  of the ppl is not the peopletories lost their mandate in 2017labour falied to win onea maj want a #peoplesvoteif a maj want to #remain  #stopbrexit

1  observer view on giving voters a chance to deliver their verdict on brexit terms a #peoplesvote is the only legitimate way to sort this #brexit fiasco but it must besimple majbinding  binary #brexit deal or #remain 
i #countthewins every day when i see so many more #remain supporters flocking to the colours 2 yrs ago we numbered 10s now we it s 10s of 1000s keep growing we ll overwhelm the autocrats together   #reform this country w o wrecking it like either a tory or labour #brexit would 
public opinion has switched to #remain remain leads the polls by six points  53  to 47  2 6m leave voters now want to remain in the eu and 112 constituencies have switched from leave to remain brexit is not the will of the people #stopbrexit #peoplesvote#countthewins 
this is crucial   the erg tories will break the #brexit deal in future  #labour even if in power  unlikely atm imho  won t always be  there is no good dealthe only option that retains rights  jobs  influence  control   prevents us getting poorer is to #remain in the eu   #reform 
gove’s chequers comments this morning add weight to something i’ve always believed soft #brexit would never have been an ending  just a step a few years of rule taking with no say would just anger the brextremist and off we would go better to #remain and keep our influence 
the observer view  we must give voters a chance to deliver their verdict on brexit terms brexiters mis sold a disingenuous delusion  they’ve failed to deliver voters must be offered the option to #remain in the eu #stopbrexit #peoplesvote #fbpe 
barry gardiner  offering a 2nd ref gives mrs may a lifeline when we need to hold a gen elect me  so we have to stick with #brexit cos you consider it more important to get labour in power than prevent the loss of rights  jobs  influence   national wealth #peoplesvote #remain 
#thankeu for moving to the right side of history   just hope the maj of your membership   labour voters who now wish to #remain can get your party leadership to back this stance labour will lose millions of votes if not   #brexit removes rights  jobs  control   makes us poorer   
the choice facing parl   mps does not have to be back may s chequers deal or #brexit with no deal the choice to #remain must be on the table alongside a #peoplesvote  labour must back a #stopbrexitsavebritain option  don t back may #finalsayforall #fbpe 
now that #brexit is going so badly   #brexiters are losing the argument terminally i honestly think the term #remoaner needs 2b superceded by #bremoaner  poor dears really are struggling to see their debased brexit invalidated by reality   a majority in favour of #remain  
i don’t want brexit lexit or anything like it  the clear alternative to this utter shambles is #remain  i’d rather parliament sorted it but it looks like we have no leaders  so #peoplesvote it is 
oh and btw i voted #brexit and because of people like @albawhitewolf i have changed my mind to #remain and want a #peoplesvote without people like her  i may never have changed my mind  you see i was open to reason  
to any #queensofremain out there  thank you  this isn’t a love in  it’s a battle for what’s right  and sometimes a group hug is necessary  just to say i appreciate your efforts  #brexit is shit  stay strong and let’s support each other as we fight for #remain  
be in no doubt re a #peoplesvote if @uklabour do not back it   a version based upon a simple maj  binary  binding choice betweenaccept #brexit deal no deal or#reject #revoke #remain #reformthere ll be electoral hell to payno moving goalpostsno to a labour brexit@labour4eu 
no  the reason it s called a #peoplesvote is cos it allows the ppl to express their will on the #brexit fiasco may s govt   cameron s has delivered us  one based on lies   illegalities   supported by only 26 5  of the ppl the ppl want a ref   a #remain option  represent them  
this country is being taken over by ukip because we have no credible opposition  to electoral fraud  foreign manipulation  illegal data sharing  illegal targeted advertising and a #brexit pushed by the furthest right across the globe  stopping brexit stops facism #remain

if the eu27 rally to save may   offer a fudged deal then they will be guilty of betraying what is now a majority of uk cits   indeed their own cits in the uk any #brexit will rob citizens of rights   this has no consent any brexit impoverishes the uk #peoplesvote now  #remain 
but we have 2b careful  many leaning towards a #peoplesvote are not clearly stating it must be a simple maj  binary  binding ref   a clear#reject #revoke #remain #reform option there s still a hint of respecting the euref afraid i don t trust the eu not to offer #brexit fudge 
 @femi sorry is absolutely right #brexit in any form will sharpen austerity and hit hardest those who have least @uklabour must have the courage to argue for a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu  we need to commit to it at #lab18  not for it be a last resort  
i have always used  if  from the 24 06 16 i concluded that #brexit will not happen  they promised the impossible during the #euref and now there is no majority in parliament to vote through any version of #brexitthe #remain majority will have to offer a #peoplesvote#fbpe

dear @theresa may there was a vote two years ago that split the country roughly down the middle  at the time nobody knew what the ramifications of #brexit would be  the public are now far better informed and polling suggests they re now strongly #remain why no #peoplesvote

1   a ref won t stop #brexit unless a maj want 2 #stopbrexit2  if a maj now wish to #remain it s the will of the ppl3  those denying a #finalsay r autocrats4  those forcing thru an invalid #brexitshambles r tyrants5  a #peoplesvote doesn t subvert democracy it reinforces it  
andrew marr presents david davis and liam fox as  both sides  of the brexit debate   rational people don t exist in his universe   cartoon time #andrewmarr #brexit #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #liamfox #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #peoplesvote #finalsay 
no  @theresa may  calling a #peoplesvote a “betrayal of democracy” is even more ludicrous than your dancing  the majority now want to #remain in the eu  by 53  to 47  and the public now want a #peoplesvote on brexit  brexit is not the will of the people #stopbrexit  
uk is not a homogenous blob  only 37  voted for #brexit  half the country want to #remain  we do not want to lose our eu citizenship   are fighting desperately to #stopbrexit  we are the first people to have to fight fork eu citizenship so we know how precious it is  
labour are a waste of space when it comes to tackling brexit  support a party that isn’t afraid to fight for what is right for the u k   support the #libdems for a #finalsayforall to #remain 
no  @bbcnews  repeatedly referring to this as “the last budget before brexit” sums up what is wrong with your reporting brexit is not a done deal  it’s not a certainty  it’s just a policy the majority of the country now want to #remain  report on that  
many jokes about #brexitcoin today  but issuing this at this stage of negotiations shows the utter contempt the govt have shown to #remain and the majority of the country for two and a half years  #brexit isn’t even agreed by the cabinet so why would be celebrate  #shameful 
there s only 1 #budget2018 announcement that can guarantee growth   it s that #brexit will be stopped   we ll be #remain ing in the eu with the best possible deal any sovereign country has ever been able to secure it s a no brainer  all versions leave us worse off#stopbrexit 
#poll in your opinion is the @bbc @bbcnews biased in favour of the #torygovernment   #brexit against those wishing to argue the case to #remain in #europeanunion #yes #no  #please #voteandretweet 
our petition calling for the next #labour manifesto to pledge a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain is only 7 days old  we are already at nearly at 7 000 signatures #brexit could collapse this govt at any time  we need to be ready for all scenarios  
i’m sure i’m not alone in thinking that there are many in the treasury  including philip hammond  that have a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with an option to #remain leading to an #exitfrombrexit high on their private wish lists it’s only course that makes economic sense  
and in #brexit land today  all is well   nothing to report   steady as she goes   no need for a #peoplesvote especially with a #remain option   
hammond on #marr now talking about ‘minimising the impact of brexit’ and saying any deal should involve close eu partnership and frictionless trade to prevent ‘consequences’ for u k  businesses  how about #remain  
three things you can do today to help #stopbrexit 1  sign the petition for a #finalsay on brexit 2  sign the petition to #remain if there is no deal 3  write to your mp please rt to spread the word  
corbyn urged to back amendment for 2nd #brexit vote he d better back it or he s history but ffs a #peoplesvote doesn t  thwart  anything unless a majority of voters want to #stopbrexit   #remain if that s the case then that s the will of the people   
this is where we are 》the talks have collapsed》there s no majority in parliament for any brexit position》over 700 000 marched to demand a #peoplesvote》the government s drawing up plans for a new referendum》all that s left now is either #nodealbrexit or #remain 
scrutiny  accountability  transparency  honesty  integrity  disingenuity  deniabilty  illegality #brexit fantasy #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit #remain option hold these charlatans to account 
 ⁦@michelbarnier⁩ told to plan for new brexit referendum as #finalsay petition gets close to 1m signatures prominent #remain politicians met the eu’s chief negotiator  calling for article 50 to be extended and for a #peoplesvote to #stopbrexit  
@uklabour @jeremycorbyn  @johnmcdonnellmp need to listen up to younger voters  their support has dwindled  they will carry the biggest brexit burden  they are  84  #remain 
we have days left to keep #remain on the table  so many brilliant ordinary people have fought hard  with courage dignity and honesty to tell the truth about #brexit  so  just as the trolls  the bots and the left and right wing brexit fanatics up their game  so do i  join me  
#brexit s now an all out civil war with 2 irreconcilable optionsthere is no compromisethe choice s always been betwn a #brexitshambles causing irreversible harm  removing rights   our future or an option to#stopbrexit   the harm  #peoplesvote #remain 
not sure what i did  barely engaged the guy  maybe they just don t want to see the fact that #remain is now a major movement that threatens to eclipse his man his man is losing #remain votes faster than he retains red kippers there is no #lexit all versions of #brexit r tory  
if there was a ge i would not vote for labour  i would vote lib dem  this is entirely about #brexit  nothing is acceptable to me except a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  labour’s front bench are brexiters  supporting labour supports brexit   
maj of labour leadership want a non existent #lexit which will   #brexit  they seek to shut down options to #stopbrexit by seeking a ge which won t include them standing to #revokea50   #remain a multi issue ge can t decide it  a #peoplesvote can  
more support for a #peoplesvote as ft economic editor @chrisgiles  declares one is needed the only logical way forward is a #finalsay referendum with option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit 
it’s clear the only brexit possible is #badbrexit  be that no deal or be that a fudge  so it’s not surprising to see tweets attacking #fbpe  as it’s the only pro #remain movement there is  there are no sunlit uplands  no jobs first brexit  you either support #brexit or you don’t 
it s a sign of intelligence to change your mind if you make a mistake   to apologise if you re wrongi backed #corbyn for the same reason other idiots backed #trump   #brexit   i thought he would shake things upfor this i apologise   will never vote @uklabour again#remain 
#afterthemarch i knew i wasn’t alone in my passion to #remain  millions shared my belief #brexit is not the answer  yet as the week’s gone on  i realised many people hadn’t a clue about the march  we have to work harder to break out of our bubbles  to talk and debate locally 
for fecks sake just oppose brexit  support a #peoplesvote support #remain 
why do i think mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn has some responsibility for #brexit  for not opposing #brexit not saying he doesn t think it s in the best interests of our country suggesting that his idea of #brexit will be not supporting a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  
john mcdonnell @bbcradio4 stating we have to respect the ref but keep all options on the table   would not clearly state  yes  to allowing a stop #brexit #remain option  me  you can t state you re respecting the ref result w o ruling out a chance to reverse it he backs #brexit 
to be clear for all southern media  according to latest polling #yorkshire would vote #remain if a referendum were held tomorrow  out of touch mps like @andreajenkyns   @carolineflint need to listen or their electorates will not forgive them for leading them into #brexitshambles 
fine speech by @thesnp northern ireland spokesperson @gavnewlandssnp reminding uk govt to listen to the people of the north the majority of whom voted #remain but whose voice is not heard in @houseofcommons #northernirelandbill #brexit 
we think the claim that 45 #labour mps will bail out @theresa may and back her #brexit deal is baseless but we need to send a strong message sign   share our petition  calling for a labour manifesto pledge to a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain  
please remember that the true majority in the uk want to #remain  what you re witnessing now is a coup  we will return to normality but for now  please accept my apologies for the harm brexit is causing the union  
despite the pathetic   somewhat unpleasant tweets over the last 48 hrs  i will reiterate that my vote is not yours to take for granted  you have to #earnmyvote  it is contingent on #brexit   supporting a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain  insults   intimidation don t work  
the brexit elite want to take away your rights to travel  live  work or retire across europe meanwhile  they’re making sure they can still live or do business wherever they like brexit is one rule for the rich  another for the rest of us back a #peoplesvote to #remain  
it was the largest  most peaceful demonstration that i have ever been to  i didn t see a single police wo man in 4 hours  people have woken up to the fact that brexit stands to destroy the uk  they are rallying behind a way out  an informed vote on the deal  that includes #remain 
they are not on our side     have done everything they can to further #brexit     really why they have done that   doeesn t matter to most #remain ers #finalsayforall #optiontoremain #finalsay 26 26   ends 
the #peoplesvotemarch showed it’s remainers who are truly patriotic it’s becoming ever clearer that brexit is a damaging far right project  says @zoesqwilliams no wonder so many people are taking to the streets to demand a #peoplesvote  and to #remain  
it’s clear that may will serve up a #blindfoldbrexit   withdrawal from the eu but none of the brexiters’ promises on “the easiest trade deal in history” will be delivered and then the tory brexiters will replace may  to get hard brexit we need a #peoplesvote and to #remain  
brexit is not the ‘will of the people’ but most people now want to #remain in the eu by 53  to 47   polls consistently show let your mp know you want a final say write to them to demand a #peoplesvote  and ask them to campaign to #remain  
it’s about time  i am utterly sick to death of mp’s making pronouncements that we the people   have no say on brexit deal including whether to decline and #remain  since an ill informed illegally gained 2016 decision we demand a #finalsayforall   we decide #peoplesvotemarch 
 i believe norway can catch their own fish  credit to @evanhd for reducing farage to a shouting  incoherent wreck clearly hates being reminded that both he   vote leave advocated soft brexit   ends up having to use #remain leaflets to justify a #hardbrexit now   wtf   
more people marched against brexit than are members of the two biggest political parties put together help make sure mps hear us write to your mp today to demand a #peoplesvote and that they campaign to #remain please rt to help everyone get involved 
so let s commit natl suicide to save the faces of the worst bunch of politicians in decades it resolves nothing a #peoplesvote at least salvages our democratic credentials if we vote #remain   #reform we ll repair   renew  if not #brexit happens   we re still in the      
one woman thinks #remain “didn’t lose”one guy says he’s moving to mars if brexit happensdelia  yes that one  says she can’t promise the result of a 2nd #euref would be respectedanother guy wants all rich people dead    and on and on astonishing why they lost really  
anything is possible with #brexit  including a snap general election  we must be ready   sign our new @remain labour petition  calling on @jeremycorbyn to guarantee that a #labour ge manifesto would pledge a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain   
yeah    when they thought #remain would win   they were shutting down any chance of changing the result   now they ve lost and #brexit is the result   they won t shut up about changing it  anti democratic hippocrites all   and not fit people to sit in a british parliament   
civil servants ‘war gaming a new brexit referendum’ amid impasse fears the public want a #peoplesvote  and the people would now vote to #remain let’s get on and do this  #stopbrexit  
excellent analysis  brexit was always undeliverable on the terms on which it was sold  there’s no good brexit   just varying levels of damage to jobs  businesses and communities cbi should join calls for a #peoplesvote   and campaign to #remain  
inspiring time with @hackneylabour comrades on #peoplesvotemarch yesterday  standing up for our 40 000 eu nationals  all those in hackney who voted #remain   those who ve had enough of this shambles of a #brexit whether they voted for #leave or #remain no one voted to be poorer  
uk politics is no longer labour vs conservative  it s brexit vs #remain  it s time we all get used to that  
i voted #remain there shouldn t be a second vote on #brexit because that would make a mockery of #democracy but if there is a second vote i ll be voting #leave #euhaveyoursay 
i’m a member of @uklabour  i voted #remain i voted for @jeremycorbyn in the 2nd leadership election after the #brexit ref i voted labour in the ge after the #brexit ref i would vote labour again tomorrow  brexit belongs entirely to the tories i stand with jeremy corbyn  
incredible scenes with 700 000  people on the #peoplesvotemarch to demand a final say on brexit please rt so everyone knows   brexit is not the will of the people write to your mp and ask them to support a #peoplesvote and to campaign to #remain  
complete silence from @uklabour while at least 700 000 people march against #brexit   this could have been an election winning shoe in but you ve just lost a lot of support   it s quite simple  if you re not supporting #remain you re supporting #brexit  
i m puzzled   they keep telling us that remain will ultimately prevail b c all the old  white people voted leave   will be dead soon    #peoplesvotemarch #peoplesvote #peoplesmarch #peoplesmarchvote #brexit #leave #remain #london 
#peoplesvotemarch      700 000nigel farage   harrowgate 1 200#brexit is now well past itsuse by date #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option 
isn’t it funny  the uk is now probably the most  well versed country in europe on european policy and also the most pro eu country in europe   give it up jacob  nobody wants brexit   it’s undeliverable and out of fashion   brexit offers no tangible benefits  #remain #peoplesvote 
inspired by the 700 000 on #peoplesvotemarch and want to join our campaign to ensure #labour backs a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain please take 60 seconds to sign up to our mailing list and join our movement #brexit is not inevitable  
so  further  pondering     there s been a march for a 2nd referendum  but what happens  if  a 2nd referendum produces the same outcome  is there another march and a call for a 3rd referendum  best out of 3 or should we just go for a #generalelection to sort this out #remain 
and it has shown that there is more passionate will for the uk to #remain in the #eu than there is for #brexit  #leave simply cannot  and have not  motivated this level of public support  #farage may bribe a few into a scruffy pub with the offer of a free beer  but that s it  
you missed the boat today jeremy   wrong side of history again your chances are slipping away with your votes   there s no such thing as #lexit if you re not in power all versions of #brexit will be tory #peoplesvotemarch#peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option 
nearly 700 000 people march against #brexit   in favour of a #peoplesvote in #london  1 200 attend a #leave event in #harrogate  a town which voted #remain       @bbcnews give them equal coverage  meanwhile many #brexiters still claim bbc is  pro remain   
waiting for the off the shropshire contingent on the #peoplesvotemarch gathers outside the dorchester  to halt the #brexit mess  we need a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with option to #remain leading to an #exitfrombrexit 
the pro brexit march attracted 12 supporters this week  the #peoplesvotemarch will attract hundreds of thousands  do you see @theresa may  the will of the people is not to #brexit at any cost  the people want a vote on the #deal with an option to #remain  
i am so excited  i am seeing people beginning their travels to london  ii am buzzing with excitement we all need a vote on the final say  a democratic #peoplesvote with an option to #remain if the #brexit deal is a shitshow  pic twitter com t2bcfsdc6f 
many saw this 2  yrs ago #brexit was lost when may backed by corbyn invoked a50 w o a clue or due diligence  an act ofgross negligence whether there s a fudge or no deal all versions of this #brexitshambles threaten rights jobs   our future #peoplesvote #remain option now  
from all over uk ppl of all ages  backgrounds and political views including former #leave voters will march tomorrow for a #peoplesvote deal or no deal w #remain on the ballot paper you can take back control of #brexit   end the chaos @peoplesvote uk see you there  
i ll be on one of those coaches from shropshire on saturday  glad i m able to go on #peoplesvotemarch calling for #finalsay referendum with option to #remain so uk can #exitfrombrexit public mood s now firmly behind #peoplesvote which is why brexiters are increasingly desperate 
in excess of 100 000  way  way in excess  this is the march of our lives  for our future  for our children and their futures this is not  as the brexeratti put it  a second referendum  this is for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  see you there  
much like denying a #remain option in the #peoplesvote would be   there snothing left to respectin a ref based on lies   illegalities which removes rights w o consent   threatens jobs  public services   our future all versions of #brexit end up tory

this thread shows the government s position on the eu   why they believed remaining was in the best interests of the uk  my position hasn t changed  yours might have  or it should do  there s still time  #brexit is not inevitable  join me  saturday #peoplesvote  option to #remain 
if the same question was asked today  in a new referendum  how would you vote #brexit#brexitpoll #remain #leaveplease retweet for as large a poll as possible 
there is a #peoplesvotemarch on saturday in #london  the reason  because the people aren’t being listened to  #remain has been ignored for two and a half years  but no longer  the majority of the u k  do not want any form of brexit  tory or labour  we will be heard  #fbpe   
the govt is after forcing through a blind #brexit   to get us out of the eu w o any honesty about our final destination     that film didnt end well   #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option 
if you insist on being so tedious  yougov   co founded   co owned by a #brexit bonking mp   has been running a tracker for years  oldest  respected  consistent  shows a clear shift to #remain  especially amongst women we re not too proud to admit it when we make a mistake  
 we will make a success of it  no deal #brexit looks increasingly likely not going so well is it mrs may @theresa may get yourself off the hook  why not give the people a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain  
yet another survey out showing a majority for #remain if a new #referendum on #brexit were held tomorrow – this time with a lead of 17 points     can we please stop treating #willofthepeople as somehow static on this issue  #endthechaos #letthepeopledecide 
no  respect the 49 2m people who did not vote for brexit respect the 53   majority who would now vote to #remain respect those who have seen through the lies and changed their mind  and those still to do so join the #peoplesvotemarch and let the people decide to #remain

a brief reminder of how cambridge analyta used kneejerk tactics to get #remain to spread #leave  views in the referendum     how that was aknowledged to have contributed to the spread of negative messages about the eu   #peoplesvotemarch 8  
#willofthepeople is subject to change  #lancashire and #preston councils become the latest local authorities to consider a further vote on #brexit  after it emerges that preston is one of many constituencies that voted leave in 2016 but now back #remain 
mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn is mistaken  there s no #brexit deal better than the one we already have  therefore any brexit plan would be unacceptable  marí is right  we need a leader who puts country before their own party and dogma   supports a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
in the blue corner we have @conservatives offering singapore on sea #brexitin the red corner we have @uklabour offering venezuelalite #brexitpersonally i d rather a sunny yellow #remain @libdems#finalsayforall 
well done to these mps for standing up for democracy and backing a @peoplesvote uk  nobody is getting what they voted for on brexit let the people decide if they want may’s deal or to #remain  
the majority want to #remain in the eu mr tusk  no one should respect a #brexit ref result obtained by criminality  huge lying  cambridge analytica aiq   the support of russian interference  we demand a #peoplesvote you will see the size of support at the #peoplesvotemarch 
fifteen minutes to go till theresa may finally admits #brexit will break our country  and so she is withdrawing article 50  #remain  right  
the co operative party  several of whom sit on #labour s front bench  have voted “almost unanimously” in support of a new referendum on #brexit – with an option to #remain  the pressure on jeremy #corbyn is growing steadily on this    #endthechaos 
i am gutted that my #brexit vote may come to pass  i want to hit myself on the head and shout  stupid  stupid  stupid  most of all i want a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain to reverse my foolishness  
what a bloody mess  so much time   treasure wasted on a hiding to nothing sh t is hitting the #brexit fan as so many warned it would 2 years ago  any deal is bad   any version of this #brexitshambles leaves us worse off fess up #revokea50   #remain 
as the prospect of a possible ge comes nearer  so does the inevitability of another hung parliament  i for one will not be lending @uklabour my vote while a corbyn #brexit is still on the table  rule it out  support a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain   my vote is yours  
sick to death of #brexiters whingeing on about how #remain backers seek to  thwart reverse #stopbrexit listen you wazzocks a #peoplesvote can t thwart #brexit unless a maj of voters want it stopped  if that s so then democratically we must #revokea50 no are you brain dead   
for two years he had responsibility for negotiating a better deal   he couldn’t do it   now david davis urges cabinet mutiny to kill theresa may s brexit plan   the only alternative is #remain  
happy weekend everyone  this time next week we’ll be on our way to the #peoplesvotemarch  millions of us making huge efforts and sacrifices to be seen and heard  each in our own unique way  #remain is a broad  church  inclusive  supportive  our fight is #brexit  not each other 
however  your alleged journalists are failing in their duty to challenge   question the increasingly outrageous claims made by pro #brexit politicians @bbcnewspr  start by giving proper coverage to the march in london on 20th october for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain 
ok  #remainers  #remain british #fbpe  #peoplesvote   #stopbrexit be nice so many people are considering their choice  don t make it emotional  make it a reasonable the forces for #brexit are mobilising inane nationalism  be nice to potential #remainernow folks  safe place  
i do hate this picture  very disingenuous  for the sake of balance voted to #remain  16 141 241did not vote to remain  48 858 759 #brexit #uk 
i m a #brexit moderate who voted #remain  but since we re going to #leave we must make it work for us  i can t therefore see that either parliament or i would vote for britain to be locked into a permanent open ended customs union arrangement  
if you can’t explain to me how #brexit will benefit me  the young people and businesses  then you are under a duty of care to change direction  #explainorchange#remain 
 @theresa may said in #pmqs  she has duty to deliver #brexit maybe for ukip   erg but she utterly ignores  16 1m that voted #remain 1m @britishineurope @the3million eu citizens 1 5m of @generation vote   millions that still want  @efta4uk approx 3m #remainernow 
this is brilliant   sums it all up perfectly  #brexit #leave #remain #remoaners 
as a ex #brexit voter i will take a #peoplesvote with a #remain option  forget an inferior deal  
come on peeps   it really is a no brainer   the uk  gb  england  scotland  wales   n ireland  gibralter  the people will all be better off staying together stopping #brexit   backing the option to #remain let s thwart the autocracy of right   left  #peoplesvote #stopbrexit 
eea doesn t resolve the irish border which would also require customs union membership   in which case it s a pay   obey no say #brexit why give up the control we have to be worse off   lose rights better to #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu #peoplesvote   a #finalsayforall  
both the govt   labour are now enforcing a #brexit that is against the will of the people   after the lies   illegalities   the non binding opinion of only 26 5  of the people it s time to confirm the majority will one way or the other or there s no legitimacy to it  #remain

absolutely right we need full and fair representation of the 56  who want to #remain and the 59  who want a #peoplesvote a brexit vs brexit debate is undemocratic  unacceptable and a breach of the bbc charter complain to the bbc here and to @ofcom  
no  @bbcnews  the issue isn’t which channel it is on the issue is that a brexit vs brexit debate is not fair or balanced 56  want to #remain  59  want a #peoplesvote @ofcom must intervene to ensure their views are fully represented  
having a brexit vs brexit debate is a clear breach of the @bbc charter the majority who want a #peoplesvote and to #remain must be represented complain to @bbcnews here  
completely unacceptable brexit vs brexit is not a balanced debate who will be representing the 56  who want to #remain who will be representing the 59  who want a #peoplesvote democracy demands you don’t hide the real choices at this critical time sort it out @bbcnews  
i’ve huge sympathy with this @j amesp but i can think of something worse    that’s losing the best opportunity of stoppping #brexit that’s why i support a #peoplesvote #finalsay so we can #exitfrombrexit   #remain then i hope we don’t have any referendum for a very long time   
survation   mail poll on #brexitagreement shows   by 59 41  voters want #peoplesvote on the may deal    by 55 45  they prefer #remain to the may deal    by 56 44  they prefer remain to a no deal brexit 
there’s nothing final about @theresa may’s dreadful deal  she’s kicked the can down the road on the big issues the only thing for sure is that we’ll all be worse off  and still debating brexit for years write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote   #remain  
this is quite a development  @uklabour s shadow chancellor says a #peoplesvote on #brexit “might be an option we seize upon”  saying for the first time that #remain should be on the ballot and that ‘no deal’ should not more as we get it   #endthechaos 
govt  finally admits #brexit will make us all poorer he’s going through the motions but there’s little doubt philip hammond privately is hoping may’s deal gets voted down   we have a #peoplesvote #finalsay   #exitfrombrexit   #remain no sane chancellor would want otherwise  
they don’t present it that way  but  excluding the don’t knows  the survation   mail poll on #brexitagreement shows   by 59 41  voters want #peoplesvote on the may deal    by 55 45  they prefer #remain to the may deal    by 56 44  they prefer remain to a no deal brexit   
brexit will cost huge sums of money we could be spending on our nhs brexiters promised brexit would save us money  they lied and cheated  it will cost money the mayhem deal will waste £40bn  no deal will waste £150bn our best option is to #remain  
good news legally  we can #stopbrexit politically  the majority now want to #remain morally  the 2016 referendum result is tainted by lies and cheating it’s time for a #peoplesvote to give the public a final say to stay email your mp today  
okay people  get on this now  send an email to your mp easily to point out that #article50 is revokable now that the european commission have confirmed it article 50 case   the good law project  rt rt rt #brexit #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain #notbuyingit #eu

i think the government should send out a copy of my #24reasonstoremain booklet to every household in the ukit s imperative that we make the positive case to #remain  inform people about the cost of #brexit  so they speak out now for a #peoplesvote 
the #brexit news may   corbyn don’t want the uk public and uk mps to hear  the eu council   eu commission have just confirmed they believe a50 is unilaterally revocable great work by @jolyonmaugham   team time for #peoplesvote #finalsay so we can #exitfrombrexit   #remain

epic thread   if i read this right  the important point here is that a50 can be withdrawn without us having to leave and rejoin  therefore there is no reason for us to leave on any deal or a disastrous no deal  we need to #remain and fix the causes of #brexit   
the perfect opportunity for jeremy to tell the country that #brexit in any form will hurt those who have least and he will   a  call for an immediate #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu orb  run in a snap election with a manifesto pledge to a #peoplesvote 
it needs to be made clear may has signed away control to 27  separate eu vetoes before any trade deal will be signed   each of the eu27 seeking their pound of flesh whilst we re stuck in perpetual #brexit limbo #peoplesvote #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control

shadow brexit secretary @keir starmer has just made plain that if and when the prime minister s deal collapses  the option of a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain must be on the table let s #endthechaos  
theresa may pulls the pin out of a political hand grenade and hands it to jeremy corbyn  will corbyn have the gumption to throw it back at may before it explodes  by backing a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with an option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit   
#traitor  after 2 5 years of lies @theresa may has been forced to show her true hand   #remain she can no longer hide behind lying slogans “#brexit means brexit”   “nodeal is better than a baddeal”#tory mps will now be forced to get rid or @conservatives face electoral suicide  
teresa may she says she believes the deal is in the best interests of the country well then i believe she is a deluded fool brexit is a disasterbrexit will be a disasterthere is no brexit that won t beit s only a question of how bigor we #remain 
so theresa may admits there is a no #brexit option   that is quite significant given she has hitherto stated the only choice was her #brexit or a no deal #brexitshambles   let s take the #stopbrexit #remain route please   it s better than either of the other 2  
 @remain labour launched just under 11 months ago  we said then #brexit was not inevitable and the with leadership from #labour  we could #remain in the eu that has never been more true than it is tonight  join us and let s win a #peoplesvote   
may has finally admitted what everyone else has been saying for a long time  #brexit can be stopped all she now needs to admit is that there should be a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with the option to #remain then we can #exitfrombrexit 
after a pack of spin and false claims   the pm concedes herself this is not a two way choice between her “deal”   and no deal  she says it could also mean no #brexit   all the more reason why it’s time for a @peoplesvote uk #finalsay for the public   with #remain on the ballot  
do you support the british public having a final say on the brexit deal yes  65 no  35 how would you vote if another eu referendum was held today remain  54 leave  46 #remain lead  8 points ex don’t know wouldn’t vote source  @populuspolls  24 10 6 11  sample  ~8000  
dear @maitlisi knew @jeremycorbyn campaigned for #remain  with 60  of @uklabour following his lead    that he said he voted remain  but i had no idea he d vote for #brexit given another chance  can you plse give me a link to more info on this amazing revalation @bbcnewsnight 
brexiters have tried to dupe the public  says boris’s brother britain was “never going to have a brexit that matches in any way the fantastical promises of the false prospectus that was made” write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote   #remain  
i ve supported @jeremycorbyn since he was a joke nomination  i still think he will make a good prime minister and i want to vote for him  but right now  as i write this @carolinelucas is my leader  #stepup #brexit #remain #peoplesvote 
thank you for your leadership gordon brown if #labour mps back a #peoplesvote and take the lead in the campaign  we can and will #remain in the eu #brexit is not inevitable   
brexit is bad for business  bad for jobs and bad for our economy check our this thread documenting brexit job losses and businesses moving investment overseas to see why we should #stopbrexit and #remain in the eu  
magical thinking has persisted until now  but time’s up  the brexit crisis point is here all the logic points to an extension of article 50  more talks and a #peoplesvote write to your mp and demand a #finalsay   and that they campaign to #remain  
 @bbcradio4  @jacob rees mogg has described calls for another referendum on #brexit as an attempt to reheat #projectfear i agree david cameron s campaign now looks like a plate of congealed left oversbut our #remain campaign is now  project hope   positive  fresh   vibrant 
brexit timetable thrown into turmoil as theresa may is forced to cancel planned cabinet meeting to approve her so called deal brexit is in chaos  but time is tight keep campaigning to #remain  write to your mp today to demand a #peoplesvote    
remainers are often criticised for remoaning rather than making the positive case to stay in the eu   so as we enter the brexit end game  here s a reminder of some of the amazing benefits for  everyone  if we simply #remain in  
citing ‘the people’s will’ won’t save our leaders in a post brexit carnage both ⁦@conservatives⁩ and @uklabour are complicit in brexit if brexit goes ahead  we will not forgive or forget write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote and #remain  
there s no long game  there s no cunning plan  corbyn is either a committed brexiter  or he believes a damaging #brexit necessary so he can achieve his utopian nirvana  either way he won t push for the much needed #peoplesvote #finalsay with option to #remain   #exitfrombrexit 
sorry not good enough   corbyn  stated brexit cannot be stopped   that’s a lie   as you know @keir starmer constitutionally   legally brexit can be stopped  no more counter statements   one statement from whole party  we support a #peoplesvote   stand on #remain

it s not about winning or thwarting #brexit tim  it s about ensuring that rights are not removed w o consent   the maj will of voters is still toaccept the deal no deal or#reject #revoke #remain #reformfrankly i m surprised you d choose the word  remoan  it does u no favours  
respect your party’s conference motion respect the majority of labour voters  members and mps who want to #remain respect that the uk now wants to #remain  we can and will #stopbrexit @uklabour will never be forgiven if it is complicit in brexit and denies a #peoplesvote  
sorry not interested   corbyn says brexit can’t be stopped   i understand the ppl negotiating this position did so in good faith but they were lied to  under jc labour  brexit is happening  time for him to go   he’s a leaver leading a #remain party   #peoplesvote 
jo johnson on #brexit #leave campaign s  his brother s  promises   a false prospectus     a fantasy set of promises that have been shown up for what they were  #peoplesvote #finalsay with option to #remain so we can #exitfrombrexit can t come soon enough  
if she were a great leader she d reverse #brexit   but she s a mediocre stubborn technocrat   won t neither will corbyn the stubborn ideologue it s up to the silent maj of mps who know the choice is btwn a disastrous #brexitshambles or #remain 
corbyn says #brexit  can t be stopped  amid calls for #peoplesvote of course it can  he s the major obstacle now in denying the democratic right to a #finalsay   needs 2b forced to follow the maj will of his party voters   as is now clear the ppl #remain 
rational moderate #remain mps in labour must be at their wits end as #brexit can be stopped  there s only 2 possibilities  corbyn is incapable of understanding  or deliberately misleading  only option left for those mps seems to be to leave labour   reduce it to a cultist rump

every brexit is a bad brexit it will leave the people you claim to represent poorer  put jobs at risk  and achieve nothing that the people who voted for it wanted voters will not forgive @uklabour if you are complicit in brexit demand a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain  
come on uk   if the democrats can win back lost ground from trump   begin to retore sanity then we sure as hell can win back our country from those seeking to impose a debased #brexit upon us step up   sign up   fight to #stopbrexitnothing left to respect #peoplesvote #remain 
err  big mistake carole   biggest funder of the euref on #brexit was the official #remain campaign backed by tories  labour  libdems   greensthe working people defeated all of you despite ur privilege   wealthcut out the crap and give us clear facts if u claim to be a journo 
here is the map of the uk turning #remainernow on the basis of the @survation poll for #c4brexit from the 2016 #euref results  in fact all but 2 local authorities have shown a shift  towards #remain just some not quite over 50    yet  brexit is not the will of the people   
every single person i know who voted #brexit would still vote brexit tomorrow  in fact  some of the people i know who voted #remain are now so bored   frustrated with this process they too would now back brexit because they just want it over and done with

this #friday  we ll be launching our newest local group in caernarfon   #gwyneddforeurope #gwynedddrosewrop the momentum is with us  join us and help us achieve a #peoplesvote on the final #brexit deal  with #remain on the ballot    @gogs4europe @peoplesvote uk @dafydd wigley 
largest survey yet revealed last night where public now stand on #brexit  in another vote tomorrow  we d vote to #remain by clear margin  as new info becomes available  people can and will change their view  and  increasingly  they are  let s #endthechaos  
banks said that #brexit has released the demons burning grenfell tower effigies attacking forriners for talking forrin denying the people the right to change their mindsrespecting a vote achieved by cheating and breaking the lawyeah  banks is right#peoplesvote #remain 
after channel 4 last night  it is plain @nigel farage and #brexit are frit  scared witless of a #peoplesvote with a #remain option  i say that because they should be worried  i voted leave and now want to vote remain   leaving is pure madness   
dear trolls on my timeline who argue that this #c4brexit  @survation poll is too  small  to count  i m happy for us to have a larger poll  1 where all of uk has chance to accept #brexit deal or #remain to see if this is reflective of a larger sample  we can call it #peoplesvote  
no arrogance   my fight is for the democratic right to a #peoplesvote to confirm the true majority will of the ppl the result will be either toaccept the #brexit deal no deal or #reject #revoke #remain #reform it s the denial of the right to a #finalsay that s wrong  
remain would win a new brexit referendum by 8  according to a huge nationwide poll the uk would vote to stay in the eu by 54  to 46  105 local authorities that voted leave in 2016 would back remain write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote   #remain  
so @uklabour’s @barrygardiner says that brexit will make working people worse off  but will press on regardless even though we now know the leave campaign lied and cheated write to your mp to let them know you won’t support them unless they back a #peoplesvote and #remain  
so the #c4brexit #survey says we got a 54 46 remain leave split now  sure it s only from 20 000 people but the arguments from @carolinelucas were way better than those from @nigel faragewe got this folks  keep the faith  #brexit #stopbrexit #peoplesvote #fbpe #remain 
huge ch4 poll shows an 8 point lead for #remain britain would now vote to #remain by 54  to 46  brexit is not the will of the people write to your mp today to demand a #peoplesvote #c4brexit 
yet more support for a #peoplesvote referendum as 1 400 senior lawyers urge a #finalsay vote on #brexit saying it would be democratic to do so with an option to #remain the u k  can decide to take the only rational route and #exitfrombrexit 
corbyn will support brexit to the end we will leave the eu an election will happen corbyn will lose he ll resign we ll be stuck outside the eu and we ll all realise corbyn never deserved our support to begin with or   #peoplesvote #remain #toriesout 
very interesting  majority  55   of british people now support at least one version of a @peoplesvote uk #finalsay on #brexit   with strongest support for a question of #remain vs leave with a  “deal”  tho see previous posts for my views on that   
 the #remain campaign got money from #goldmansachs  #jpmorgan     @arron banks exposes #remain referendum funding from multinationalbanks and biased #andrewmarr is desperate to silence him    #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc #brexit @dcbmep @brexitstewart #conhome #uk 
people know exactly what is behind #brexit anna parliament voted by a huge majority to ask the uk electorate if we should #remain in or #leave the eu over 17 4 million uk voters decided to #leave the job of all mps is to deliver the #cleanbrexit we voted for #notdifficult 
so if even #arronbanks thinks we d have been better off to #remain what argument is there left for #brexit  ffs people  gotta be time to #stopbrexit once and for all surely   #fbpe 
may has spent two years repeating nebulous soundbites like “brexit means brexit” now she’s losing her temper when someone politely points it out just stop this shambles write to your mp to demand they #revokea50 or hold a #peoplesvote to #remain  
this is a much watch  stop feeling sorry for theresa may  she isn’t listening  she is a bull in a china shop  wrecking our country in pursuit of her #brexit obsession  that is clearly bordering now on madness  #remain in the answer  the question is how best to get there 
watch @mikegalsworthy in @pmpmagtoday explaining brilliantly how the #remain side can strategically take advantage of the #brexiteers’ split between those supporting theresa may’s #brexit deal   those supporting a #nodeal  
ps stop respecting #brexit  there snothing left to respect #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control in the eu  
we  have  respected the referendum result the advice given was ‘we’re not sure  but we might want to leave’ we investigated the possibilities  we’ve found that it leads nowhere good let’s now do the sensible thing   #remain  
then labour should ditch the meaningless multi issue ge con   focus on either giving the ppl the #finalsay in a #peoplesvote or to counter no deal fess up that #brexit is an appalling mistake   just #revokea50 unilaterally #remain in control in the eu with our current deal  
my message to europe  tell us you want britain to stay nobody wants brexit  whether european countries or the majority of the british people instead of trying to get brexit over the line  europe should make the case for the uk to #stopbrexit   #remain  
tell you what  we re not france  nor italy  nor greececons   labour far right  further left are mistaken in thinking they ve won the agenda in the uk #brexit s awakened the centre  i m not talking lds etc  beyond party there s now an #remain army waiting to pay you both back  
i voted #remain but still not convinced of the need for a second referendum  in fact  if there was another one i might be tempted to vote #leave to preserve democratic integrity  #bbcqt @fox claire 
#brexit new data on voters  shift to #remain   constituency by constituency  
imagine if just for once the bbc were to visit a pro #remain area and interview young people about what they think about #brexit  you know  just for balance  
i’ve actually run out of things to say about #brexit  i cannot believe so many people favour the disaster of no deal  politicians need to be honest or be held to account when the ensuing crisis occurs  keep up the good fight all  we really are #strongertogether #fbpe #remain 
i almost teared up at that   then the dark cold anger  at what the #govt   a majority of appalling #brexit politicians are doing to our country   our futures  took hold again #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in controlcan we swap the lords with the commons please   
the dupers don’t speak for anyone other than extremist orange headbangers  people in gb need to understand most people in the north of ireland  didn’t  vote for any kind of brexit  they’ll settle for the #backstop if brexit has to happen  but would rather #remain 
i just heard richard burgon mp @skynewspolitics say that labour wanted to stop the half baked botched #brexitdeal    stop the possibility of no #brexit   it s what he said  did he mean a no deal #brexit  if not he has just lost several million #remain votes for the labour party 
24hrs later and we are still no clearer on what #brexit looks look  we do know that no deal that is proposed will get through parliament  time for a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain we say  
still so bloody sick when i hear these charlatans  in this case  bernard jenkins hide behind the british ppl voted for #brexit  no they did not once again  51 8  voting   37  voters   26 5 of the ppl  is not the british peoplethe will is not fixed#revokea50 #remain 
my sincere request to parliament  brexit is not guaranteed and the british people will not forgive you if you deliver it  all those who want to stop it are praying for #remain  #revokea50 #peoplesvote history will judge which side you were on  #brexit  
to those mps who state there s no point replacing a pm at a time of #brexit crisis   i remind them someone else came back from europe with a meaningless piece of paper   she doesn t even get that replace #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control  #pmqs 
the reality is  being in the eu gives each country more control and more sovereignty   as ireland is now showing brexit isn’t working  the lies of the brexit campaign are unravelling before our eyes write to your mp to demand they #revoke article 50 so we #remain in the eu  
wake up guys   it s painfully clear as i listen to commentators that there are those who think we can #revokea50 to buy more time to prepare to leave  this s #brexit bs   the judgement s ruled this out it s a one off to allow time for a #peoplesvote or a parl decision to #remain 
just remember when #brexiter   #lexiter charlatans state that they think a #peoplesvote is divisive   warn it might lead to no #brexit  what they re really saying is that they know there is now a majority of the ppl who want to #stopbrexit   #remain in the eu think on that  
the path out of this brexit shambles is clear  we need to #revoke article 50  #remain in the eu  and work to reform uk politics  
ffs enough with the utter bullshit mike  orderly brexit  smooth brexit  red white and blue brexit  british brexit  jobs first brexit    now we have gone to  managed no deal   give it a fucking rest  #remain is the only deal worthwhile   
i’ve been here 30  top trumps    love it  born in belfast  presbyterian  married an english catholic  three kids who are confused but happy  cooperation and collaboration make our country and ireland great  not recreating borders  #brexit is toxic #remain #strongertogether 
all party @peoplesvote uk press conference underway led by #labour ‘s respected margaret beckett  time for everyone to step up in the national interest  only a #public #peoplesvote can settle #brexit w #remain on the ballot paper @libdems @carolinelucas @plaid cymru @thesnp 
exactly this  there is now no “accidental no deal brexit” may is trying to run down the clock until it’s her deal vs no deal but  as the european court makes clear  the reality is we can choose to #stopbrexit write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote and #remain  
remember that the real negotiations with the eu haven’t even got started yet may’s deal is just a withdrawal agreement   no a long term trade deal yet if you think brexit is a mess today  it’s only just getting started write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote   #remain  
we should all be concerned  may’s behaviour is undemocratic and unacceptable mps were promised a “meaningful vote”  instead  may is trying to run down the clock on brexit until it is her deal vs no deal mps must “take back control” and call a #peoplesvote to #remain  
cancelling the #brexitvote isn’t just discourteous   it’s deeply undemocratic may can try to run down the clock on brexit until it’s her deal or no deal mps and the public must not allow it write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote and #remain  and let’s restore democracy  
donald  i m ashamed of my government  they are trying to drive through a damaging #brexit when the people now wish  by a huge majority  to #remain in the eu  don t give up on britain    
#brexitdeal #brexiti love john bercow   you tell  em  don t let may get away with this charade  vote to deny her delay  take the vote   decide   then fgs take the decision to move on to other options #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control  
let’s #revokea50 and #remain on the same terms we had before cameron kicked off this clusterfuck sure  it’s a bit embarrassing  but it won’t last long unlike the total  country destroying humiliation of #brexit #stopbrexit#peoplesvote 
be in no doubt if we #revokea50 unilaterally   #stopbrexit to #remain in control in the eu we get to keep ourrebatevetoesopt outswe stop the destructive haemorrhage of time  money   influence wasted on #brexit at the expense of sorting uk s probs   the economy will thrive  
now that everyone has witnessed the total mess that the uk has put itself in with the #brexit vote  it’s time for another referendum  #remain 
huge  uk can unilaterally cancel brexit  eu court rules we can revoke article 50 to keep our current favourable membership deal and #stopbrexit write to your mp   again if you’ve already done so   to demand a #peoplesvote and #remain  
ludicrous  undemocratic and unacceptable for may to try to exclude a remain option in a referendum parliament will decide  not may  and 57  would now vote to remain  the latest poll shows so write to your mp today to demand a #peoplesvote   and #remain  
farage says there s no appetite for a second referendum  he was champing at the bit before the referendum saying a 52 48 split in favour of #remain would be unfinished business by a long way  well nige  the country is ready to devour a #peoplesvote  they really are  
no  i didn t want a #tory referendum  or a @uklabour one  or  any referendum  i was happy with the peaceful  prosperous  happy  healthy  free  democratic family of the eu  i wasn t interested in the tory greed ridden  or labour ideological fantasy  just #remain

if you want the u k  to #remain in the eu   you’re inclined to vote labour  read   weep out of touch with their members and voters  corbyn   his cabal seem determined to be on the wrong side of history over #brexit as dogma continues to triumph over rational actions   
i think we can safely say there’s a clear trend on this graph the number of people saying we were were wrong to decide to #brexit now has a clear lead over those who still believe it was right it’s time for a #peoplesvote #finalsay so we can #exitfrombrexit and #remain 
a government in contempt of parliament for the first time in history tells you everything you ever needed to know about #brexit #peoplesvote #remain 
#brexit poll shows 11 point lead for those who believe #leave vote was a mistake #notmybrexit #peoplesvote #remain 
this vote took #brexit from the people and handed it to a #remain parliament  
margaret beckett is an amazing stateswoman towering above the likes of bullyboy johnson   her speech is informed and mesmerising  brexit is a scam   calls for #peoplesvote#rejectthedeal #remain 
breaking  @assemblywales rejects @theresa may s botched and blind #brexit #standupsenedd #notmybrexit #peoplesvote #remain 
oh   jeremy you were on the verge of doing quite well against the govt   then chris @chrislesliemp asked you to confirm if you felt that to #remain in the eu was better than the pm s #brexit deal   then you blew it again we no longer have to respect the flawed ref based on lies 
we said from day one that #brexit is not inevitable  today we have the legal confirmation on #article50 #labour mps across the country should be emboldened  if they back a #peoplesvote in parliament  the country can have a #finalsay in early 2019 and vote to #remain in the eu  
well done jo et al   things shifting in our favour just need labour to wake up   get behind what is now probably the majority opinion  #peoplesvote stop #brexit   #remain in control in the eu  
brilliant work by @jolyonmaugham   the team  i suspect when dust settles on #brexit the nation will realise debt of gratitude owed to them worth remembering may’s govt has shamefully fought this case all the way  trying the deny that uk had power the revoke a50   #remain 
wow    ecj advocate general opinion that the uk can unilaterally #revokea50  final ruling awaiteduk govt sought to thwart this we can stop #brexit b4 29 03 19   keep our current best poss deal resp mps must #stopbrexit #remain in control in the eu 
if anyone tries to take down #fbpe at this stage  can i suggest you join the tories and push for hard brexit  for those of you who have grievances with individual people  then have them out  but you are not supporters of #remain or it’s fight  in all its forms  hate is hate 
as you   many other  experts  warned it wld become but neither the lady  nor the gentleman were for listening when they invoked a50 w o a clue nor having undertaken due diligence they shld either stop #brexit or allow us to do so in a #peoplesvote with a #remain option  
may should have come clean with the british people on the costs and risks of brexit  instead  she doubled down on lies from the brexit campaign so now the people  not politicians  need a final say write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote   #remain  
business is roundly rejecting may’s brexit deal  there’s overwhelming support to #remain give the country a #peoplesvote  
what course should we take with the #brexit deal  #leave #remain #eu #takebackcontrol

she advised me to vote #remain  i did  since then it has become even clearer that was the right decision  therefore i see i can’t suddenly get behind a fraudulent referendum and a brexit which shafts our country  our fellow europeans and threatens the very union  happy new year 
people i know who  1 campaigned for #remain    2 have worked hard to fight a hard brexit   they re being viciously insulted just for not being in favour of a #peoplesvotesad to see the pro eu movement  a movement i once enthusiastically backed  end up in such a terrible state

only in the centre can you see extremes   that s why the far left and far right can t see how wrong they are  because to them they aren t  extreme    #brexit has normalised them  arguing is futile  save your energy for those willing to listen  #peoplesvote #remain #thinkagain 
errm  just a thought  how about increasing border force  enforcing 100  control over non eu immigration we always had  using the 3mth fom rule   let s #revokea50 stop #brexit   #remain in control in the eu with vetoes  opt outs   rebate taking back control to lose control  
it is  anti uk to brexit ok to change yr mindit is not  pro tory to be #remain pro austerity to be #remain undemocratic to have a 2nd vote ok to ignore that leave broke the law anti everything corbyn stands for to hate lexit ok for anyone to claim a monopoly on morality 
#brexit is austerity max  it will mean recession  job losses  increased poverty  rising costs  and further public service cuts  if austerity was one of the main motivators for leave voters  it makes no sense to worsen it   it s long past time for a re think  #peoplesvote #remain

this is the problem  the left propping up a tory #brexit  tribalism is delivering brexit now   anyone who says they would vote leave based on what we know now about an illegal fraudulent referendum  which the majority of the country reject  is at very best deluded  #remain 
fed up seeing corbyn support brexit  take action email your mp to let them know they have lost your vote until their party backs #remain please rt to spread the word and help #stopbrexit   
to block a new brexit referendum would be an affront to democracy britain now wants to #remain  by a huge 12 point lead write to your mp to demand a #peoplesvote   and to put them on notice you’ll vote for another party until theirs backs #remain  
said it before will say it again if corbyn backs #brexit #lexit   loses the ge it will be his fault   his alone  not that of #remain voters who have principles too  we can t vote for parties backing a policy that removes rights w o consent   leaves us worse off #revokea50 #abtv 
the majority of labour membership  voters   constuencies are now #remain mike   it s the leadership out of kilter with them   the rest of the #remainers what s reassuring is that you appear to acknowledge those wishing to stop #brexit are a sizeable political force now #abtv 
remember   anything that starts with  i voted #remain  but     is from some troll trying to trick you  #brexit is bad  #stopbrexit  #revokea50 #remainintheeu 
young supporters will desert ⁦@uklabour⁩ in their millions if the leadership keeps backing brexit 79  of young people want to #remain in the eu labour’s leadership must clearly campaign to #remain   or lose their support for generations to come  
loathesome lies   no deal   no transitionparl better find a bloody way not just to stop no deal #brexit but to #revokea50   #stopbrexitaltogether the ppl have been betrayed by a rightwing coup back by a leftwing complicity  #remain mps act now    
#remain will come to understand the #crux of #brexit is that #uk voted in #euref for the  narrative identity  it shares with #canzuk  shall we call it our #magnacarta narrative identity  not #eu’s alternative  a choice between 2 futures   the people have chosen to #leave  #ukpoli 
corbyn faces furious labour backlash over backing #brexiti should cocoa  man s a rogue #brexiter close him down #revokea50   #remain in control in the eu   
may   corbyn by backing #brexit  have created a new political party #remain  it grows by the day   whether we leave or not it s implacably opposed to the narrow minded insular vision of both left   right if they don t #revokea50 this new force will inflict real damage on both  
absolutely truly brilliant from mike  thank you for such an honest post  ‘tonnes of us have had enough now ’corbyn is not labour  labour backs #remain  so we fight on more united than ever to stop people dying outside westminster and to stop #brexit breaking britain

now we know for sure where corbyn stands on #brexit it’s time to decide the next steps  is it fanciful to think there could be an alliance of mps from all parties to argue for and achieve a #peoplesvote  we can’t let tribal politics kill our #remain movement  
how come pro eu corbyn supporters believe every word jc says  except when he fully admits he supports #brexit  what s the longest river in de world again  that ll be de nile    #noopposition #peoplesvote #stopbrexit #remain

time for the libdems to stop herding cats   evolve   become a catalyst on the way to a new centrist alliance which disillusioned tory labour mps can coalesce around then #revokea50 stop #brexit #remain in control in the eu   #reform the hell out of both uk   eu #stopbrexit 
a party of the right led by a stubborn technocrat with authoritarian tendencies   a party of the left led by a stubborn ideologue with autocratic tendencies   great combination in the #brexit mix #remain is rising with an anger that will wreak payback on them both #revokea50  
this must rank high amongst the threads of the year    worth breaking my xmas truce for blood boiling again reading such a gut wrenching tale #brexit must be destroyed utterly it s a battle we must win  mps denying the real majority will will pay dear #revokea50 #remain

have to say i m astounded that corbyn is still respecting a ref based on lies   illegalities   is prioritising a multi issue ge it s almost guaranteed by his #brexit stance  that he ll lose it #revokea50 #stopbrexit   #remain in control in the eu

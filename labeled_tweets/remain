we can save all this wasted time, effort & money chris, simply by giving the ppl another vote; a binding #finalsay in 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit & #remain in the eu.there's no way 37% of voters backing leave in a non-binding ref can be the final will of the ppl. sos

if there’s an election in the next year an anti #brexit alliance could win it. but political tribalism would destroy the #remain cause. we must put normal politics aside to win this battle otherwise britain will be damaged for generations to come.

there it is, corbyn doesn’t want to give us a chance to vote on the #brexit deal. #remain @uklabour supporters take note.

1. agreed; strongly suspect if we leave there'll be no going back...soft #remain won't want the euro or a fed eu nor soft leavers + soft #brexit is harder in waiting anyway as brits will not likepart pay & obey but have no say...we have to #stopbrext & stay with the current deal
this...  nail on the head.a percentage of those who didn't vote did not vote out of complacency. as most of the #brexit news has been negative, non-voters will turn to #remainadd in those who are #remainernow + elderly #leave voters now deceased.... #stopbrexit #fbpe

dad spent 37 years working in a yorkshire coal mine. mum was a miner's daughter & school "dinner lady". my sister & i both graduated and went into teaching. nice to know that voting #remain means we're now part of "the elite"! #ordinarypeopleremain #brexit
#brexit is what will benefit the establishment. it's a rouse to avoid the new tax laws the eu are bringing in the day after brexit is supposedly happening. #remain
this is why it drives me mad when #remain folk say "i respect the result of the referendum, but..."no! let's **not** respect the result of this flawed, unjust, undemocratic, fraudulent, shambolic & therefore irrelevant #brexit referendum!! 
**poll**please vote and retweet for a larger sample.do you want a second referendum on brexit? #brexit #eu #remainers #leaveeu
the greed, hate, lies and chicanery of #brexit have given birth to a massive and growing #remain movement. put enough snowflakes together and you get an...... avalanche!#stopbrexit #fbpe

if there is a general election the best thing for remainers to do is to aim for a hung parliament with a larger number of libdem & green mps than now. and the way to do that will be to follow the suggestions made by #remain tactical voting organisers.#stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit
check their tweets:some #remainers  never attack the tories for #brexit but only attack labour. curious in that it was tories who called eu referendum,tories who misled voters&tories who r in gov't.using #brexit 2unfairly attack labour#newyearsresolutions read between the lines
the ft today: uk output is now about 0.9% lower than if the country had voted to #remain in the eu. that's almost exactly £350m a week lost to the economy. it's what #leavers promised would be available to the #nhs if we went for #brexit. it's time to #stopbrexit.
a @yougov poll shows that a quarter of @uklabour voters could switch party if they continued to back #brexit. two thirds of those who voted #remain said they would be disappointed or angry if labour said it would proceed with brexit.
michael's crime is to understand his own party. @jeremycorbyn is main reason most #tory #remain mps frightened to revolt on #brexit 
delia here decided to talk about her #brexit regret first thing christmas morning. she sets out her reasons for her #leave vote in a number of tweets which i will thread below. all good reasons but now wants to #remain - reason 1  #fbpe #stopbrexit

one of the great delights of #brexit is laughing at sad #remainers having a collective breakdown over #bluepassports.

#dominicgrieve is the former attorney general. he knows the law. he stood up for parliamentary democracy, hard-won by ordinary people in this country. they didn't fight-for a #remain"/"leave" check box on a voting paper.. that addresses primary legislation.#brexit-#torymess
well done to the tory rebels for standing up to may. now the rest of the mp #remainers need to show a backbone too. this #brexit madness can be stopped by a sovereign parliament where mps do what is right for the country, not what is right for their party or their careers

1.corbyn & labour struggle with a false unity, waiting for a tory collapse to gain power whilst backing #brexit, wanting out of the sm/cu/ecj same as the tories & preventing a #finalsay..#remain grows by the day..they may also find they're on the wrong side of history.#stopbrexit

polls say 68-72% of labour voters pro-#remain. your plan for winning the next ge is to drive away 9 million voters to lock in the 4 million who are pro-#brexit? interesting strategy. a bit like #brexit - give up £65bn in benefits to take back £9bn. i'm sure jc will call you soon!

an excellent take down by @jolyonmaugham of the brexiters’ argument that having a referendum on the #brexit deal v #remain will weaken uk’s negotiating position with eu.it’s clear uk needs to find a way to #exitfrombrexit
a warning to #brexit politicians. demographic change alone will produce a #remain majority in 2020, which will grow relentlessly from then on. there will be little tolerance for politicians who have foisted brexit on a nation opposed to it. #stopbrexit #fbpe

it's time our mps debated the result of the advisory referendum, discussed whether #brexit is a good idea or a bad one, and had a free vote on whether to take the advice or #remainintheeu.@borisjohnson @brandonlewis @cj_dinenage @carolinenokes @spelmanc @charlieelphicke
1. read in full & rtsee the message not the messenger...this encapsulates the case perfectly & rightly seeks a #finalsay in 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit. of course he's for #remain & it's easy to see why. i have one small caviat.....
i think it's time our mps debated the result of the advisory referendum. i think they should discuss whether #brexit is a good idea or a bad one. then they should have a free vote on whether to take the advice or #remainintheeu. simple. easy. quick.
as someone who voted #leave i regret it massively and would vote #remain if we got another vote but i also think we need to stop blaming #corbyn for #brexit. heres why:
great if so but #remain supporters need to send a strong msg by not voting for leave backing parties...this is the last real chance to make a protest that really hurts them where it matters.binding #finalsay 2018 to confirm #brexit or #stopbrexit & save rights & controls!
be in no doubt, #remainers have won the argument and are seeing many former #brexit supporters change their minds. keep up the campaign. we will #stopbrexit andfor the love of the uk we must #stopbrexit
in light of misleading information exposed, accurate information obtained, a deeper realisation & understanding of the complexities & consequences & because it affects the destiny of millions, it is wise & our duty to reconsider brexit.#stopbrexit #brexit #remain #leave #fbpe
happy new year all! it’s going to be a big 2018 for the #remainernow movement as we work to make it clear to the govt that their #brexit policy is not wanted by so many that voted #leave in #euref but also those that did not and could not vote! #finalsayforall #exitfrombrexit

#brexit has irrevocably opened an unhealable chasm between #leavers and #remainers in the uk.that idiots like fox, johnson, gove and may cannot see it, is a crying shame. they have allowed a flawed referendum result to stand without challenge.history will not be kind to them
it really is very, very simple. we cannot leave the #eu without causing significant damage to our economy. that has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. people need a chance to re-evaluate their #leave positions now this crucial fact is known.#stopbrexit#fbpe#brexit#remain
dear @uklabour and @jeremycorbyn. there is no upside to #brexit for the poor and the vulnerable. there is no upside for business. the majority of people now want to #remain in the #eu. base your strategy on that for that is the view of the vast majority of @uklabour members.

a message to all #leavers that claim it's unreasonable for the #remain camp to want a vote on on the final deal, including an option to exit from #brexit.the uk holds general elections every five years so the public can change its mind on who runs the country. #democracy
the problem with many brexiters...is they do not understand the difference between patriotism and nationalism.#stopbrexitsavebritain #fbpe #remain #brexit #stopfundinghate
why has #brexit opinion polling stopped? 8-10 december #remain had a 10 point lead, one more poll released a week later, also showing uk doesn't want to #leave, then nothing for 2 months.what don't they want you to know?!?!#fbpe#stopbrexit
fantastic straw man, as ever from #remain bed-wetters. coincidentally however, humans share 60% of their dna with bananas. so how about we give every banana a british passport, and the eu can have all our whingers who can't distinguish a continent with political union? #brexit

#remain means the same thing to all, it is clear, it is concise, it is unequivocal.#brexit means many different things to many different people.even the government's mps have opposing views on its final implementation.a vote on a fractured concept cannot be a valid mandate.
we are not 'former' #remainers . truth, decency, common sense, a backbone & integrity means we will continue to fight the #brexit catastrophe. #fbpe #stopbrexit #abtv #r4today
a warning to #brexit politicians. demographic change alone will produce a growing #remain majority. that majority feels ignored by the present political elite, and will not look kindly on the politicians who have foisted brexit on them. #stopbrexit #fbpe #waton
most of the #remain vote in 2016 came from @uklabour supporters. yet the party is avoiding discussing #brexit. the party is supposed to be democratic & policy should be determined by its members, mps & affiliates. demand labour debates brexit by emailing policyforum@labour.org.uk 
claire. i'm a former @uklabour party member. i cannot understand why people would vote for the #labourparty again when your #brexit policy is the same as @ukip and the @conservatives #followbackproeu or #fbpe means #stopbrexit & #remain @jeremycorbyn wants #hardbrexit 
so...#remain was right about the costs, but #leave decided they wanted out anyway?say, can you guys be the  ones who pay for  #brexit then-all of it?for starters: #markcarney has the  estimated financial cost. (it'll be billions)cheers!
new evidence that illegitimate russian pro #brexit influence on #euref dwarfed that of #leave campaign. surely no uk government or true british  patriot can stand behind a result engineered by a foreign power intent in weakening our country? #fbpe #waton #remain #stopbrexit
so here’s another #leave voter who has now looked at who #brexit will actually benefit and has changed their mind. brexit cannot be for the many - just the few. those few being elite & rich already.respect @wafu23rn for speaking out as a #remainernow  there are so many like you! 
#brexit - it's a monster! that's how germany is depicting theresa today. and they are right. it is a monster and we have to fight it to #remain in the eu.
at some point this week the govt will give us a picture of the #brexit future. theresa may will pull excalibur from a stone and announce a golden age harking back to britain's ancient past. we'll then all die of bubonic plague. #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain #eu

tell me again how there was a lot of dishonesty on "both sides" of the #brexit debate.for real. where's the #remain equivalent of these??
i'm wondering how many real #brexit supporters there r? so many fake accounts, (often far right usa) being thrown at an ever growing number of real ppl supporting #remain that i guess the only way to find out wld be to hold an actual ref in 2018 & let the real voters vote.#fbpe
can there be many examples of stopping lower than #brexiters blaming #remainers for the disaster that is #brexit. this belongs surely in the #guinnessworldrecords collection
establishment #remain campaign threatens #brexit in name only. please help show support to save #britain's fish by flying the flag. get one here ->   show we won't capitulate to being a #vassalstate in a "transition" obeying all #eu laws after we leave!
don't mistake my support for #remain as an ex #brexit voter as meaning to ignore the vote. i want a #2ndreferendum after we have the facts and yes i would now vote remain and hope it wins #fbpe
here is jaim, he voted leave in 2016 as he thought a narrow leave victory would lead to a “liberal leave” with membership of the eea. he’s now seen the reality of #brexit & he’s said i made a mistake & i’m a #remainernow.it’s all in this superb blog.bravo @melbourneplex
so emma (a very active #remainernow see ) has just posted this wonderful passionate video talking about her bregret & why she changed her mind on #brexit this is courageous in many ways & i urge people to watch, comment & share widely. @mrsemmajk
i was an enthusatic #brexit voter, but having heard all the evidence since the vote, i am a passionate #remainernow we need a #2ndreferendum to have the chance to stop this madness #remain
#brexit spin started with the normalisation of the claim that 52:48 was an overwhelming majority (not the mild preference it actually was) and has not let up since. you may have won, but we won't get over it. #stopbrexit #waton #remain
let me summarise what the #remoaners are saying about #brexit17.4 million voted to #leavebut that is all too difficult to do.so we will ignore the biggest vote in britain's history and #remainhow about we get some politicians who can deliver the #brexit we voted for in 2016?

here’s #remainernow hugh being interviewed by french journalists near @no10vigil about his change of mind on #brexit & activities he is getting up to in fighting for a #voteonthedeal #finalsay & growing #bregretter movementhopefully they will broadcast this soon. fyi @bbcnews
yep...well aware of this & the fact they are still able to con voters into thinking their version of #brexit is going to lead to a utopian future & not the reality which is that it will become a tory brexit over time if we don't get a #finalsayforall with a #remain option. #abtv
if @keir_starmer or any other #remain mp thinks"there is nothing s/he or anyone else can do to stop #brexit"they are in the wrong job !resign as an mp now !let someone with a backbone come in and take your worthless spaceps - party is not worth saving if it ignores country pic.twitter.com/ug1o8gpp3j
on #bbc coverage of #brexit in general, and brexit protest marches in particular.  dedicated to all who joined a #marchforeurope!  #stopbrexit #remain #fbpe #abtv #waton
it's enough that our govt subverts the parliamentary process by seeking exec control over it, denying scrutiny & accountability & stating that #brexit can't be reversed but the whole process was tainted by lies & deceit...this is just more confirmation.#finalsayforall + #remain
add to that the €160m paid by the #eu to various pro-#remain lobby groups in the years leading up to the #referendum & you begin to see just how big a feat it was to beat the #europhile #propaganda machine!  #bbc #lbc #sky #uk #tory @conhome #brexit #leave
2/ oh & brussels has always been relatively immune to corporate & billionaire lobbying - possibly real reason behind #brexit? #remain #remainernow
the bbc packs qt audience with an unrepresentative percentage of  pro #brexit young people. presenters shut down #remainers. the news fails to report thousands protesting against #brexit.just what is going on in the uk, manipulation of the press is something fascist states do.
a thread on the #fakenews now provided by #channel4news and the #guardian. how the #left and #remainer institutions manipulate the truth to suit their own agenda, especially over #trump and #brexit. 1/10
it will take #remain voters turning away from @uklabour ,and for many like me, that is not an easy choice. but to stop #brexit it's worth it! 3/5/18 #toriesout2018 #theresistance #resist #rejointheeu2027
#brexit = deception, denial & democratic deficit.binding #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option.confirm the will of the ppl don't impose the will of far right & left ideologues!
ever wondered how the nonentity gina always seems to be on the #tv & became a #remainer spokeswoman...? #ginamiller is being funded by #eumoney & is in secret talks with the #eu to undermine your #brexit! she is a truly vile individual! #bbc #lbc @lbc #sky #uk @conservatives
hello, mps!it's time you all made a decision. most of you are opposed to #brexit. there are over four hundred of you who want to #remainintheeu. well, it's time you did something. ignore your party whips, decide how to use parliamentary procedures to #stopbrexit, and...
i voted #remain , however, i have blocked many fbpe (follow back pro europe) tweeters who followed me because it is clear to me their agenda is more about unfairly trying 2 use #brexit to damage labour than about remain. remain or leave #istandwithjeremycorbyn#saturdaymorning
this is the moment even loyal moderate labour #remain voters need to place a tactical vote against party policy on #brexit...it can't undermine the parl balance but it wld send a clear message. votes can't be taken for granted by pro #brexit parties.#finalsayforall #abtv
i too joined @uklabour to weaken @conservatives call for a hard #brexit. ditched them in january and joined @libdems as it became clear @jeremycorbyn is an isolationist and eurosceptic. #remain 
anyone out there who still believes corbyn is playing some clever long game on #brexit & will swing behind a referendum & #remain at the last minute? your choice is clear: vote labour/tories for a catastrophic brexitvote @libdems for #finalsay referendum & an #exitfrombrexit
i'm a #remainer, but owen smith wasn't sacked because of his stance on #brexit. he was sacked because as a #cabinet member, he breached the code when he publicly went against his party. that is what you sign up to when you move from the back-bench.#owensmith #labour
no you're not! it's all lies. the best deal is #remain & you know it. we've seen your own analysis that #brexit leaves 99% of us poorer.you have no mandate for this. you promised us sunlit uplands, the exact same benefits as now - even that we'd be better off. lies, all of it. 
this is a symbolic indication of #remainer @theresa_may's commitment to #brexit! a #british company @delarueplc being denied this contract @liamfox @daviddavismp any comment..? #nationaldisgrace! #fakebrexit #bluepassports #bbc #lbc #sky #uk @conservatives #conservatives @conhome

the polling companies stopped asking how we would vote in a second referendum in december. after 11/12 polls showed a #remain majority and the last but one showed a ten point lead. now why would that be?#fbpe#stopbrexit#cambridgeanalytica#russia#leavelies#brexit
everyone did not have a vote in the #brexit refsadly you are misinformed.a gerrymandered electorate, an advisory non binding ref.....it's a travesty may is pushing an extremely hard brexit. wholly undemocratic. plain wrong. #remain
when you think that remain campaigning was led by cameron and corbyn backed by tories who've almost all transmogrified into rabid brexiters, while leave had the support of 80% of the press by circulation it's amazing that #remain even got 48% of the vote. #stopbrexit #brexit
did you vote leave at the #euref after being told the economic warnings were #projectfear? well, sadly, they are becoming #projectreality but do you know what? #brexit is not inevitable and it’s ok to change your mind. say your a #remainernow & help change the country’s course!
here’s someone who voted leave but now has #bregret@cadams050419661 you were not stupid, you were misled by those that advocated #brexit on mistruths, there are so many like you. respect  for saying so! you don’t have to live with regret #brexit can be stopped.#remainernow
unfortunately #brexit has been made easier for may and her merry band of ministers, because #jcorbyn and his pathetic archaic ideology has given brexit a shoe - in - #labour ar3% behind the worst gov in history! won’t have my vote #remain #centralist #abtv

often accused by those backing pcpeu that as #fbpe i'm anti corbyn, which is bs btw. i'm anti corbyn's support for #brexit & denial of a binding #finalsayforall with a #remain option.my question is,why do many add the 'peu' when seemingly not wanting to #stopbrexitsavebritain?

scotland voted #remain. i'd happily move to an independent scotland in eu. if #brexit gets ruined, bonus! #may promises a fairer society whilst riding roughshod over the nations, 48%+ & eu citizens. #stopbrexit
my respect 4 her grows with each passing week & each statement. we need many more mps to do their homework, appreciate the dire consequences of this flawed #brexit & to get behind a #finalsayforall with a #remain option. play the get out of jail free card & #stopbrexitsavebritain
your daily reminder that #brexit is built on a tissue of lies that are unravelling. the british people were sold a false prospectus. we must have a #finalsay with an option to #exitfrombrexit and #remain. anything else would be undemocratic and a danger to the national interest.
given all the russia related mud slinging this story about the #brexit select committee majority report is not getting enough coverage. i’m proud to be one of the “high priests of #remain”  #fbpe 
i voted for #brexit and was a committed brexit voter. but facts have changed and with another vote. i would vote #remain @campbellclaret @davidlammy @chukaumunna
more starting to say it as it is but goodness why has it taken so long to get here when it was blindingly obvious any form of #brexit must leave us poorer, weaker with fewer rights and less control.binding #finalsayforall on the deal with a #remain option.#stopbrexitsavebritain
thanks @joelmcw, very candid and useful. it’s not a cause of embarrasment to realise that #brexit is not turning out how it was sold, and that a rethink based on the real facts is in order. true #remainers strongly welcome all who are #remainernow 
in october there will be a meaningful parliamentary vote on the govt’s #brexit deal. on april 23rd there will be a debate on ensuring that vote includes an option to #remain if the deal does not match #brexit promises.i’ve just written to my mp about it  why not do the same? 
here is a 3 tweet thread from very active #remainernow josh (see ). it’s on why a number of people voted leave and how, in order to ensure more come out as #remainernow it must be made clear that #brexit is the opposite of the answer to their concerns. 
1. lord price trde mnster on @bbcr4today asked if he'd still vote #remain in a ref: yes we face more imp global challenges & #brexit's a distraction. but the ppl voted 4 it & we have to do it.me: 26.5% of the ppl gave a non-binding opinion. if it's wrong give us a #finalsay.
conor is another person who used to support #brexit but has now looked at the evidence & is a #remainernowas he says, the eu may not be perfect but far better to be on a boat that you can fix than outside looking for a life boat. @conorwells0 respect  to you for speaking out!

the more this #brexit idiocy continues, the more we see of putin's autocracy & trump's tweets, the more the govt tries to subvert our constit & democ process; the more i'm astounded the overwhelming majority of mps & lords aren't crying out to #remain. #stopbrexitsavebritain.
#brexit britain is now weak on the world stage. while it is hard to admit this, virtually every relationship it has is now in tatters.#stopbrexit#strongerin
remind me again why we are pressing on with a #brexit that can only leave us poorer, weaker, with fewer rights & less control at this time, based on the non-binding opinion of a minority of the ppl & the electorate?binding #finalsayforall + #remain option
all #remainers and pro-europeans should be voting for the @libdems.they're the only party who genuinely seem to be not be playing games with #brexit and using it as a way of achieving power. 
in a free society, people should also be able to criticise #brexit without being called traitors, enemies of the people or being against democracy. but you don't like people criticising brexit do you nigel? #justsaying#stopbrexit2018 #finalsayforall #fbpe #remain #waton
there's a definite swing in the attitudes of #brexiters. they now blame the downsides of #brexit on the #remain camp and the eu. they won't accept the consequences of their own actions. they say they knew what they were voting for, so they need to grow up and own the downsides.
if there is no #brexit deal, brexit is so so so far from what was promised from boris et al art 50 must be revoked.#waton #exitfrombrexit #stopbrexit #finalsay #remain petition:if no agreement to leave the european union is reached, art 50 be withdrawn

over three quarters of the uk does not want #brexit, frans. the british government is acting unconstitutionally, forcing us to leave when we want to #remainintheeu. your solidarity is very much appreciated!
giles & mary on gogglebox.....brexit is like putting sugar in a petrol tank just completely stalled the country.  well said. what a superb metaphor. #brexit #gogglebox #remain
do you know someone who voted leave being told that #brexit would be easy & make uk no worse off. well maybe it’s worth telling them to read both this headline & article underlying it. tell them it’s ok to change their mind and be a #remainernow#finalsay
make the most of this youngsters.seriously.do it while you canwhilst the uk is still in the eumy kids won't get the opportunitydon't waste yours#brexit woes #remain #fbpe
this is superb from @chukaumunna & @anna_soubry great to see such x-party co-operation. they are right, if #brexit continues on this trajectory @uklabour & @conservatives will not be forgiven.plenty of #remainernow undertones in here as well.

polling shows a gradual but small shift from #leave to #remain since the referendum that we might exit the eu with a majority against, let alone the supermajority in favour required in most countries, is an affront to democracy.#stopbrexit #brexit
france jumps ahead of uk in signing trade deals with india, whilst not leaving the benefits of the eu. haven't seen too many brexiters commenting on this story!the only rational course for the uk is a #finalsay referendum on #brexit deal vs #remain to secure an #exitfrombrexit
excellent article by @acgrayling comprehensively explaining why there’s no rational case for there not being a referendum on the #brexit deal vs #remain problem is tory government & their labour leadership allies aren’t acting rationally at present.
govt's whole approach to a #brexit that can only leave us poorer, weaker with fewer rights and less control whilst denying the ppl a binding #finalsay on the deal with a #remain option is sinister.you're only interested in imposing your will on the ppl not the will of the ppl.
far too many in the #fbpe camp want to use the next general election as a single issue campaign. voting @libdems as some kind of #remain protest will only help the tories, it is a folly as bad as the #brexit we would all like to see stopped.
#brexit is the only political issue i am passionate about. once it's over and we #remain #stopbrexit we can deal with the issues that sparked the referendum result. after all, we are called the "united" kingdom. i will only vote for those parties on this issue 
who else in the uk is feeling politically homeless, powerless, aghast, dismayed, angry, terrified for the future of the uk and for our children, determined to fight, embarrassed, saddened and mortified because of #brexit #brexitshambles #remain

so they lie to us, cheat us, ignore us and conspire to take away our rights.  then they tell us to "come together" and "get behind #brexit."  sorry, but no.#stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #brexitshambles #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #reunion
mark is a #remainernow - he sent me why he changed his mind on #brexit in a private message. he is yet another person who has looked at the reality of brexit, including of trade deals and he has been humble enough to say he made a mistake.  mark. so many like you!#finalsay
great call in to @mrjamesob on @lbc by @marcusfysh re the reasons to be cheerful about #brexit i think marcus has probably added a few thousand more to the already majority that now wish to #remain well done!
astounding the level of disassociation between #brexit causation & reality...cognitive dissonance abounds....mps need to get a grip on this debacle & if they can't #stopbrexit alone then give it back to the ppl in a #finalsayforall & we'll vote #remain!

john here (who voted leave in june 2016) makes an excellent point that #brexit is so complex that it should have never been put to a public vote. even many politicians and commentators didn’t appreciate the half of it! @sigma_john  for joining so many others as a #remainernow
george here has some issues with eu governance (& i believe he voted leave) but he is happy to campaign for #remain in a #finalsayforall (with a condition).@gfkw47 many people accept eu needs reform, but that must be done from within as #brexit is too harmful to uk’s prosperity!

7/ the @bbc ignores #remainers 16 plus million people. it ignores the millions who do not want #brexit and are fighting to stop it. how can this be impartial or professional journalism? it is a total betrayal of @bbcs natural constituency & supporters. so i can empathise.
will any #remain supporters join us in condemning the abuse of #brexit voters? perhaps it could be a good opportunity to let the healing begin. but, 'hatred will never eradicate hatred, only loving kindness will eradicate hatred; this is the law, ancient and eternal'. the buddha 
message for #labour & #tory #remainers: sometimes to advance you have to retreat. i know it goes against the grain, but to get your party to change its #brexit policy, please vote for a pro-#eu party in #localelections2018. le's for 4yrs, #brexit for life.#abtv #voteeu #fairvote
why does the bbc think that #brexit is a done deal and keep referring to #remainers as remoaners. more than half the country don't want it. using derogatory terms is peurilei do wonder if they had to compete for funding, whether they would simply shrivel and wither on the vine.
fear is what we #remainers feel about #brexit fear is what #leavers feel about the way it is being handled by the governmentno one is getting what they wanted, so why not remove #fear from all of us and #stopbrexit?#stopbrexitsavebritain #abtv #waton #fbpe #follow5001
public opinion on #brexit is shifting, albeit slowly. but let’s not be complacent. there is still a lot of work to do to build a decisive majority for #remain ahead of any #finalsay. keep up the good work! #fbpe #finalsayforall

i agree with an awful lot of this by @nick_clegg the hardline brexiteers are showing that they are panicked that #brexit is collapsing as reality bothers and many 2016 leave voters speak out as #remainernowwe need a #peoplesvote to stopbrexit

the republic of ireland’s referendum result, 66.4% to 33.6% in favour of overturning the abortion ban, deserves to be respected as “the voice of the people”. the uk eu referendum result of 51.9% to 48.1% in favour of brexit does not.#stopbrexit #ukpolitics #leave #remain #brexit

not being funny here, but if the #remain camp are serious about blocking #brexit, action needs to be ramped up  very shortly. forget demonstrations, take a leaf from the french. blockade ports, block motorways, burn the odd tyre etc. #getserious.
"age 50-64-60% #leave. 65 & older -64% leave." -@yougov.#brexit  is not about the present nor the future.it lies largely in #nostalgia. and in a past washed clean and hung out to dry. #remain is  fighting for the future.we will not stop.that's #democracy#futureofresearch
the pm regularly exhorts the country to "get behind brexit" without slightest self-awareness that, given the #brexit she plans to deliver, she is asking #remain to get behind a car carrying hopes, dreams & deeply held values & help push it off a cliff. no thanks. #stopbrexit
#brexiters...wake the f*** up! you may want to wreck your own futures but you have no right to wreck ours. make it right..back a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit option to confirm if the will of the ppl is still to #brexit or now to end this #brexitshambles & #remain.#finalsayforall
i'm getting pretty sick of the conceit that the corbyn groupies exhibit in trying to blame us; how can we #remainers support a man who backs a #brexit that can only leave us poorer, weaker, with less control & fewer rights..if the tories get back it will be because of him not us.
precisely...why give up the best ever possible deal which is membership for an unachievable #brexit that can only leave us poorer, weaker with fewer rights & less control. madness.#finalsay stop the #brexitshambles #remain#finalsayforall #peoplesvote
did you vote leave because those advocating #brexit pledged it was a great opportnunity for british business? well the last 10 secs of this clip is #brexitrealitywhen the facts change, i change my mind, what do you do?why not join so many other leave voters as a #remainernow?
great to see these 5 @uklabour politicians from merseyside joining the calls for a #peoplesvote on #brexit. with so many leave voters nationwide changing their mind and becoming #remainernow it’s vital mps stand up and offer u.k. a way out. 
proof the #remainer row over eu customs union is claptrap: there's barely a customs officer in sight at felixstowe which handles £80 billion of goods a year... so why all the hysteria about the irish border with its £3 billion trade?  #brexit 
there has been a clear shift in public opinion that #brexit is bad for uk since aug 2017 & the latest figures in may its increased again.so many people who voted leave or abstained in 2016 have changed their minds & are #remainernow brexit reality is a long way from promises!
delighted with debate at @selbylabour tonight. two-thirds of the (small minority) of those who had voted for #brexit in #referendum say they would now vote to #remain
the biggest problem we have had in the last seventy years is #brexit.it is the stupidest thing we could possibly do.we have to #stopbrexit. we want to #remainintheeu.
#remainers though we're growing in no. by the day, there r accounts pretending to have been supporting #remain but now stating #brexit will happen & it's best to compromise on a softer #brexitshambles.check followers; don't fall for it.we're winning #finalsay to #stopbrexit.
1/ why why why on earth should anyone who voted against #brexit or for that matter has changed their mind get behind something they do not want? why? have we now lost the right in this country to democratically oppose policies we disagree with? #fbpe #stopbrexit #remain
had dinner with a friend not seen for ages last night. on #brexit, he said the information was poor or non-existent and he made up his mind in the polling booth. he voted leave. he knows the eu isn’t perfect. he’s a #remainernow. #peoplesvote
how can any #remainer still want to be associated with such a #bullying organisation ?#brexit means that the uk had the scruples to take a stand against tyranny once again. we are a proud nation with righteousness on our side.
whether you voted #remain or #brexit, retweet if you think theresa may's government is making a dogs' dinner of everything
here’s owen, he voted leave but like so so many others he’s now changed his mind. he now regularly replies to tweets on #brexit opposing it.@owentomkins respect to you for speaking out. #brexit is not inevitable & uk can change course, have you written to your mp?#remainernow
yeah right. just cancel it. the referendum was rigged. we've read the report. no one from the #remain camp is going to accept there is a mandate for any kind of #brexit now. stop being complicit, #stopbrexit #fbpe
simon here voted leave as a protest against some of the bits of the eu he didnt like as he thought #remain would win anyway. he now sees the harm the #brexit is causing & what it’s unleashed and is quite clearly a #remainernow#peoplesvote@theneweuropean
this thread  will resonate with so many leave voters who are #remainernow surely with all these broken promises we must have a #peoplesvote once final #brexit deal is known? 
due to european legislation from brussels, all eurovision acts are required to do neo-goth lady gaga looks. #brexit #remain #bulgaria #eurovision
#brexit has turned out to be a shit sandwich and the #leave camp know know it, hence they're crawling from under their rocks to blame #remainers.sorry chaps, it's shit sandwich of your making. you're going to have to man up and swallow it yourselves. enjoy.
if you had told me before the #brexit vote that i would be sitting here, waiting for my meal, reading @theneweuropean i would call you mad. the change is complete , time to #remain

1. govt lost its mandate & labour didn't win one; there was a lot of #remain tactical voting...either way this current #brexit & can't be legitimate on a number of grounds w/o confirming if it's still the will of the ppl to leave or now to end this #brexitshambles & #stopbrexit
this is some top work by @euflagmafia as they say, for a year now polling has indicated u.k. is #remainernow the reality of #brexit is becoming clearer. it’s great that they can help get that message out on #europeday
corbyn will find himself on the wrong side of history as the will shifts even further to #remain. every version of #brexit leaves us poorer, weaker, with less control & fewer rights. how can a labour leader back such a #brexitshambles & deny a #peoplesvote
happy #europeday people, whatever you're doin today do it with an #eu flag raised loud and proud. don't let anyone tell you it ain't our flag, we fought wars for this and we'll keep on fightin #brexit  #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain #iameuropean #veday

an enfeebled tory party haunted by bitter infighting is not beaten by labour in mid term council elections despite ukip's vote collapse. tells you that #labour supporting #brexit is not what the public wants.had labour been for #remain, the tories would've been decimated.

did you vote leave because you were told by #brexit backing politicians that economic warnings were #projectfear and/or eu27 economies were collapsing anyway.well this is what’s currently happening, uk bottom of the pile & we not even left yet! why not be #remainernow ??
be in no doubt a vote for tories or labour is a vote for #brexit.this #brexitshambles is locallocal nhs, local social care, local schools, local services.if you don't vote for #remain parties who back a #finalsay to #stopbrexit you will be voting for austerity.#abtv #le2018

dear liam fox,  were you a real democrat & believed in the will of the ppl & not about imposing your will on the ppl, you wouldn't have a problem with a binding #finalsay + a #stopbrexitsavebritain option which would only confirm if the will of the ppl is still #brexit or #remain

worth remembering that internationalist #edinburgh north and #leith voted 78% to #remain in 2016 - overwhelmingly against jeremy corbyn’s hard #brexit position. @thesnp, @deidrebrock and i are standing up for scotland’s place in europe - labour aren’t.

according to #leavers, uk job losses are not the result of the #brexitshambles. they are either the fault of the eu, or the fault of #remainers for not getting behind #brexit.wake up #leavers, jobs lost will be entirely your fault. own it, don't try passing the buck.
spot on from @andrew_adonis. explains exactly why we #remainers are totally ignored by may, corbyn and most of the mps on both sides of the house. sometimes feels like to tories have a majority of about 500 the way #brexit is being railroaded through. 
did you vote leave because you were told by #brexit campaigners that “we held all the cards” and “merkel will be forced by car makers to give u.k. a good deal”? well this  is what bmw are saying about #brexitreality.not what you voted for? why not say you are a #remainernow
looks like @theresa_may has changed her mind on heathrow expansion. whether or not i agree with heathrow issue, i respect her being able to do so, because in a democracy it’s ok to change your mind. just like many leave voters have on #brexit who are #remainernow!#peoplesvote

what a stirring speech yesterday by @carolinelucas at the #peoplesvotemarch she spoke with clarity, passion and honesty about the damage #brexit is doing to our beloved country. #remain

digby jones finally loses the plot, he seems to think airbus are in cahoots with #remain to stop #brexit. as a failed businessman @digbylj needs to realise that real multinational businesses are run by professional business people, they don't play at it.
@carolinelucas - brilliant advocate for an inclusive britain, a positive european future, and a #peoplesvote at the people’s vote march #peoplesmarchvote @bathforeurope #brexit #remain @pulseofeurope
the airbus "threat" taken apart.  they have neither the supply chain nor technology base to move. #emptythreat all part of the no change, #remain strategy. #brexit
should've listened to corbyn - he warned about a tory brexit a long time ago. given tory majority of votes on #brexit in parliament & given that tory mps will not vote against theresa may, it's all pretty much in tory hands now. labour doesn't have enough votes 2 stop it#remain
did you vote leave? read thisthe only reason the govt is pushing ahead with damaging #brexit is,not because it’s good for uk, but the result of #euref if you don’t want the #brexit she is pursuing to be in your name, act, say you’ve changed you’re mind. be #remainernow
most sensible thing to do now is not abandon red lines but to abandon #brexit which a clear majority now want. the most democratic way to achieve it is to give the ppl a #finalsay with a #remain option which a majority of the ppl also want.why do u deny the ppl the choice?
tomorrow it’s time to put on a massive demonstration to show that those who understand that #brexit can only harm the uk, their own, and their children’s futures at the @peoplesvote_uk @stopbrexitmarch i will be there with some several #remainernow guys from 11am!see you there!

sorry @emilythornberry, it simply isn't true that no @uklabour mps want the chance to stop #brexit. dozens have already called for a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain. the majority of members want it and we are determined to deliver it. #marr
people are saying we can't stop may doing her #brexit to us.she is one person.we are 65 million.i think we can stop her.we all know the referendum was a cheat, and not valid.may can be stopped.she has to be.we want to #remainintheeu.who decides, us, or her?
why does he oppose offering the ppl a #finalsay when the eu27 get one, to confirm if the will is still to #brexit or now to #stopbrexit & #remain. this merely checks if the majority still want it or not...& if not what right do #brexiters have to deny that majority will?
here is nigel, he voted leave (& campaigned for #brexit most of his life). he’s now realised #brexit is not working out how he envisaged & says it may be better to #stopbrexit.@nigel_farage have you heard of the #remainernow movement? 
did you vote leave thinking no deal was a conceivable outcome? if not, know it’s ok to change your mind, know #brexit is not inevitable, know others feel like you, know you can become a #remainernow

 @owensmith_mp if you’re a #remainer or a #remainernow & like owen (and me) you believe #brexit will make the uk poorer, weaker and more isolated, it’s vital you do what you can to oppose it!write to your mp, talk to friends, join local anti-brexit group, back #peoplesvote!
just to remove any uncertainty, i am hard #remain. i am marching with like minded friends on 23rd june in london who are also hard remain. hard remain means no #brexit. no may brexit and no fucking corbyn brexit. fuck brexit and what it is doing to my country.#stopbrexit
#remain fanatic #annasoubry has told 17.4 million #leave #voters to "suck it up" regarding her #brexit  betrayal. this vile & hateful #woman has nothing but contempt for #democracy and hates #brexiteers with a passion! #bbc #sky #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #tory #conservatives #uk pic.twitter.com/m73hv13qfu
here’s another great video prepared by @lljourn this time with #remainernow gary from norfolk. he talks about the lack of information about ramifications of leave vote at #euref and how he’s seen his prices go up & that #brexit is not wanted by the young!
i really hope @peston analysis is correct. if it is, still all to play for to avert severe #brexit damage from risk of no deal & can keep pressure on for #peoplevote with #optiontoremain before it’s too late.so many leave voters did not vote for this mess!#remainernow
#ids: "during the course of the whole #brexit debate it was made categorically clear by #remain that if you vote to #leave you will have to leave the #customsunion... & you will have to leave the #singlemarket & therefore you will not be members of those."
oh wow, now this is a sight for sore eyes. these guys are camping out all night at the high court in london against the disaster that is #brexitmakes you proud to be a #european #stopbrexit #remainathon #peoplesvote #fbpe @bbcnews @itvnews @channel4news @theresa_may

did you vote leave because you were led to believe that the warnings of companies moving jobs abroad as a result of #brexit was just #projectfear? sadly #brexitreality is different . but please know it’s ok to change your mind your mind, be #remainernow & help #stopbrexit
#brexit: barnier questions may's 'backstop plan'.a) may's only plan is to stall long enought to impose her #brexitshambles on an increasingly reluctant pplb) we should all question everything may's doingc) let's just #stopbrexit & #remain#finalsay
every time @theresa_may sets a direction of travel for #brexit it is towards what #remainers, #remoaners & #traitors want and not what 17,410,742 #brits voted for! #theresamay is the ultimate traitor to #britain! #maymustgo #bbc #sky #lbc #uk @conhome @cchqpress @conservatives
indeed, and that’s why we need to keep growing and publicising the #remainernow campaign, so leave voters are willing to speak out as they see others do it and realise their is absolutely no shame in admitting you have changed your mind once you know more on #brexit reality 
been obvious from day 1 #brexit may happen but in no way can it work...certainly not in the country's best interest nor that of its citizens.this #brexitshambles needs to be stopped. vital to #stopbrexitsavebritain to avoid more lasting damage.#reject #revoke #remain #reform
fruit is rotting in fields as #eucitizens are put off coming to the uk due to hostile #brexit environment and depreciation of £ as a result of the vote!did you vote leave but this is not what you voted for? it’s ok to change your mind, be a #remainernow
poll: polling companies now consistently showing a 7 point swing towards #remain which would translate into a 55/45 result once don't knows are removed. do you think this is a sufficient mandate for a #peoplesvote on #brexit? please rt far and wide, particularly #leavers!
record 7% lead for #brexit being “wrong” in latest @yougov brexit tracker:brexit right: 40% -3brexit wrong: 47% +3as many leave voters & abstainers become #remainernow as facts become clear that will increase!brexit is not the #willofthepeople. we need #peoplesvote!
a soft #brexit when:- over half of the population wants to #remain - all soft brexit options = job losses + economic losses + rule-takingthe people now want to #stopbrexit !!!a soft brexit = cowardice + stupidity + gross negligence
during the referendum, and since, ultra remainers have lied saying uk would be excluded from erasmus scheme. now the whole world is to be invited (as long as they pay). #brexit #remainerlies
#myengland @bbcr4today ..i'm british & european & a cit of the human condition! this to me represents inclusivity not exclusivity ..togethering not othering.#brexit represents the latter & all the hate & intolerance that goes with this #brexitshambles#finalsay #remain #reform
this shld be the true voice of labour...not the complicit fudge which'll help the tories deliver a #brexit that can only leave us poorer, weaker with fewer rights & less control. it's not bloody working out as promised so #reject #revoke #remain & #reform.#finalsay #peoplesvote
we buy and sell oil on the international markets. we refine oil products. we distribute fuel. there is no question of running out of such products. pure unadulterated #remain propaganda designed to “terrorise”. think about that word ppl. #fbpe #brexit #leave #remain #lordhawhaw
here’s dan, he voted leave but changed his mind having seen the ramifications the #brexit vote is having on hard working eu nationals in the uk.to you @real_danhoward for speaking out on this issue, takes guts but you are far from alone being a #remainernow let’s #stopbrexit

the same way disgraceful @skynews can get away with spurious poll that has 2 questions to split the #brexit answers & lower voting result numbers & only 1 question for the #remain  - resulting in a rigged vote
pm rules out #peoplesvote under any circumstances...me: i ruled you out ages ago. you ruled out a ge before trying out the 'strong & stable' line...that went well.#brexit is fubar. poorer, weaker with less control & fewer rights. a #finalsay is the democratic way out.#remain
1. time 4 those mps who've sat on their supine arses or backed this farce to get off them.#brexit's failed before it's happened. a majority no longer want it...only a #peoplesvote can validate the end game.we must have the #finalsay with a #remain option.
public mood continues to shift against #brexit& #remain has clear lead.the numbers are now reaching point where supporting a #peoplesvote should be considered as a career saver by may or corbyn.it vindicates @vincecable 's call for an #exitfrombrexit

we should have demolished all the #brexit lies by now, says @jon_danzig in his wake-up call to the #remain movement. we’ve squandered two years since the #eureferendum by not tackling head-on the lies that led to brexit winning. please share his blog.
danny dyer on #brexit: why i changed my mind after voting leave.“what have we voted for, we still don’t know. it’s a f****** travesty" says eastenders star.the public must have a final say, with an option to stay.#stopbrexit #peoplesvote #remainernow
of course we mustn't panic the ppl into realising that this #brexitshambles is a total disaster & that politicians & charlatans deceived them, lied & cheated; mean to say they might start wanting a #finalsay which might mean their #brexit coup will fail.#peoplesvote #remain.
in greece, italy, france & others, anti-eu politicans are dropping calls to leave eu. support for membership grows.only in uk, do the anti-eu elite pursue their #brexit fantasythey don't want a #peoplesvotethey fear #remain will win  via @financialtimes
so much evidence undermining the validity of the #brexit result. has anyone yet heard #theresamay or #jeremycorbyn draw attention to this? or for that matter most tory & labour mps. wondering why that might be.#peoplesvotethis won't go away; time now for a #finalsay.#remain
there’s fake news, electoral fraud, rule-breaking. all ‘cheating’.  whether you voted #remain or #leave, don’t let the privileged british establishment duck the blame for their mess. demand a vote on whether to accept or reject their poor deal/no deal #brexit. 
important to understand crux of #brexit is that #uk voted in #euref for the #magnacarta narrative identity it shares with #canzuk, not #eu’s charlemagnian alternative. it was a choice between two possible futures. #leave won & #remain lost. it’s time to #respecttheresult #ukpoli
pro-eu campaigners posing as "removals ltd" offer to help @borisjohnson vacate his grace-and-favour london home - more than two weeks after he resigned as foreign secretary. #brexit #leaveeu #remainread the full story here:

dear anti brit anti britain anti #brexit #bbcnews #skynews and #channel4news following your wall to wall coverage about referendum payment irregularities last week where is your coverage of this story?impartial?total #remain propaganda channels more like.
#brexit update: govt now admts it wants to stockpile food, medicines etc, only to be told we don't have space to do it.  yet another thing they haven't thought through!  cartoon time ... #stopbrexit #daviddavis #remain #eu #fbpe #abtv #waton #peoplesvote #finalsay
so jc you back a #brexit that leaves us poorer with less control & fewer rights & deny a #peoplesvote; you've lost a chunk of scotland & alienated a swathe of #remain, face disadvantageous boundary changes & now an angry jewish community...anything else? maybe change your stance?
the problem, as #brexit is clearly demonstrating, is that in an increasingly interdependent world absolute sovereignty invested in the nation-state is no longer practical.the truth is that #brexiteers need to start facing up to reality instead of blaming #remainers.
can #remainers not see what’s happening here?!? by supporting the eu you are blatantly harming our nation. if the #eu can make concessions this quickly with @realdonaldtrump why can’t they with us?!? let me tell you, they want our money! wake up! #brexit 
this is new petition launched by the independent. now that so many who voted leave in good faith are realising they were misled about #brexit reality & are #remainernow we say...theresa may: give people a final say on brexit deal - sign the petition!
1. ffs...if i hear another commentator who knows #brexit will be bad, stating we shouldn't have a #finalsay with a #remain option before we leave & have to go through with it because we have to respect the existing vote i shall be looking to buy a new tv!
can we just get rid of govt & the opposition leadership & reset the uk to default mode. neither serves the uk's nat interest, merely their own self-serving agendas; both back a #brexit that will cause irreversible harm & deny the ppl a democratic way out.#peoplesvote #remain
‘we still haven't won the arguments we lost in the #eureferendum.’ read and share @jon_danzig’s commentary on the ineffectiveness of the pro-#remain, anti-#brexit movement since may 2015. link:

so..an incentive to ditch the govt & rump of erg, on the basis of giving the ppl a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit option.#brexit can't be decided in a multi issue ge unlesslabour stands for #remain.so come on let's do it. but let's just #revoke not extend
ok i’m going to make this simple for you. if you don’t support food stockpiling, medical shortages, generators in the irish sea or military on the streets after a no deal #brexit then sign. now. we have run out of time. if you want to #remain you can’t just sit back. #peoplesvote

a £9.3m pro-#eu publicity blitz by david cameron's government in the run-up to the #brexit referendum gave the #remain side an unfair advantage, the like of which should be outlawed in future votes, an independent commission has suggested.
trying to work out how may is asking the eu not to fall back on unworkable positions? does she mean the single market & customs union?both seem to be working rather well for the eu as they do for us.the unworkable position is held by the govt & anyone backing #brexit.#remain
if you were given a #finalsayforall #peoplesvote - how would you vote?  #leave #remain #eu #brexitplease rt after you vote for a larger sample.
there was speculation that boris would deliver the killer punch against pm in his resignation speechjust as geoffrey howe did to maggieit turned out to be a damp squibit was left to tory backbencher @andreajenkyns: to deliver the killer punch'when did #brexit become #remain?"
the only sensible thing to do about #brexit is to #stopbrexit.we know that every form of brexit will damage the country badly.we know that the majority of the voters want to #remainintheu.what we don't know is why may is till forcing this madness on us.
and no transition period....not looking good...what a stubborn disingenuous pm we have. a great leader would be able to say #brexit ain't working, it can't be made to work & here's why. we need to ak the ppl if they still want it or are prepared to #remain with the best deal.
#nadinedorries: "#number10 were led by the nose by the elite #remain  establishment; they were battered by them ... @dominicraab has one job and that is to prepare for a #nodeal #brexit." @juliahb1 @nadinedorries  @conhome @andreajenkyns @dcbmep #uk
.@uklabour doesn't need to help the government on #brexit, but it does need to help the country.we can't sit on our hands at a time of crisis. supporting a #peoplesvote and campaigning to #remain is in the national interest and the party interest.
fraudulent? #remain was backed by government funding. plenty of working class people voted for #leave. you all said the uk economy would fall apart once #brexit was announced. here we are with the best unemployment figures for 43 years and 21 consecutive quarters of gdp growth.
steve baker just stated in parl re ministerial debates that if the govt accepted an eea lite option it would damage the tory party.me: there we have it...the priority for this #brexit madness is not the ppl, is not the country, is not the economy but the tory party. qed#remain
as i have told you, i will not commit (as an ex #brexit voter) to voting #labour unless you support a #peoplesvote in which i would now vote #remain we need to escape this brexit madness . i live in a labour held marginal.
'@andreajenkyns asked the key question at #pmqs today: ‘when did #brexit come to mean #remain?’ the @conservatives will rue the day @theresa_may allowed this to happen. fate will not be kind to them! #maymustgo #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #theresamay @dcbmep #tory

looks like the country is #remainernow based on polling based on the 3 way #peoplesvote suggested by @justinegreening so if #brexit is both not the #willofthepeople and on (the vast majority of independent and the government's own) economic analysis bad for uk, why continue?
no-one seems to be reporting this, but the look on #corbyn’s face when the #remain amendment fell, was incredible.proper #brexit and no general election. he then skunk out of the chamber looking a broken man.
it won't make the headlines it should, but the eu has signed a historic trade deal with japan today. how can the uk enjoy the benefits? reject may's #brexit deal, earn a  #peoplesvote and win the campaign to #remain
if anyone voted leave is angry that #brexit backing mps think you/your family losing your job is worth it for their idelogical vision, please know this.- brexit isnt a done deal- it's ok to change your mind & be a #remainernow - you'll be far from alone
here are six of the most ridiculous claims from #projectfear about the impact of a clean #brexit on businesses, prices and jobs. i’m paraphrasing to make my points, but all are staples of the #remain camp. (1/8)
so says @andrealeadsom, the lady from the previous @conservatives leadership contest who talked the #brexit talk, but then stepped aside at last minute to give #remain-er @theresa_may an uncontested victory. what price was paid then? what price now? another 30 pieces of silver?
watch #borisjohnson come out for  a #softbrexit (whatever that is) or even go back to #remain...which he once was. he knows that #trump & #stevebannon   have killed  #brexit as we know it ...except for hardcore  who will shelter  in #ukip-the #tories rightwing  holding party,
dear hoc mps, the majority of you are #remainers. may has said if you reject her plan, there will be no #brexit. it is back in your hands. do the right thing. reject her childish cakeism plan. #stopbrexitsavebritain
a clear and consistent 10 point swing from #leave to #remain giving remain a 5 point lead.@theresa_may. at what point do we get a #peoplesvote ? or are referendums only held to settle arguments within the #tory party?#brexit
even #remainers can see that #theresamay's #chequersdeal doesn't deliver on the #referendum result. good for @piersmorgan to tell it like it is! #brexit #maymustgo #bbc #sky #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty @conservatives @dcbmep @brexitstewart #conservativeparty
this is what i don't get..giving the ppl a #peoples vote to allow a #finalsay doesn't overturn #brexit unless the majority of the ppl now wish to #remain in which case it is the ppl who overturn it.it's a false reason used as an excuse to avoid them forcing their will on the ppl
we asked labour's @benpbradshaw #howwillbrexitbenefitme?thank you for your honesty ben - we agree that the people must be given the #finalsay on any #brexit deal with the option to #remain#stopbrexit #sodemaction
this invalid #brexit represents the antithesis of our core values shared with 27 other eu countries.our rights are being removed w/o our consent & we must be given a #peoplesvote & a #finalsay with a #stopbrexit option to confirm it.if a majority now wish to #remain we must!
please listen whether you voted #leave or #remain. this gave me goosebumps. of total fear. who is going to answer that question? what happens the day after? #brexit 
in 24 hours #trump has insulted the mayor of london, humiliated the government and praised boris johnson over #brexitwe must stand up to him. the single best way to do it is to #remain in the eu. help us make it happen. help us fight back 
dear mps #brexit has hamstrung our country ..you're flogging a dead horse...give it up...move on...get over it...#stopbrexit.put country 1st... #peoplesvote #finalsayforall#reject #revoke #remain #reform
did you vote for #brexit as you were at persuaded by people like @borisjohnson and his promise of a bright future? did you think he must have a plan on how to achieve it? well this is the reality feel cheated & betrayed! join many others as a #remainernow
all so obvious to #remain & stated at the start of this #brexit farce. most mps know it but have remained shamelessly compliant to a false advisory plebiscite.the only logical solution; to #revoke #remain #reform & only party self interest prevents it!
2. and if you're now backing #brexit under the labour banner then at least own up to it & stop pretending you support #remain...then ppl can at least see you for what you & the party really stand for...

there has never been a majority of british voters who wanted #brexit. the size of the #brexit fanatic minority gets smaller every day. most of the uk would like to #stopbrexit, and #remainintheeu.
because teresa the appeaser and her coterie of #remainiacs have always wanted to frustrate #brexit. its the tories own fault for electing someone who didn't believe in a policy to enact the most important policy for 50 years.

#brexit stopped being about the will of the ppl from the point the pm chose to press ahead & circumvent parl on the basis of a non-binding opinion of only 37% voters.this's all all about imposing party wills on the ppl hence the denial of a #peoplesvote & #remain option.
1. do #lexiters not understand that offering the ppl a #finalsay ref is not the same as opposing #brexit?! it simply allows the ppl to confirm if they still want this #brexitshambles or now to #stopbrexit & #remain. it neither thwarts nor betrays anything & is entirely democratic
you're having a laugh aren't you...there are so many reasons why millions of us will never accept this flawed #brexit coup which is more to do with the imposition of political ideologies & party wills than the will of the ppl. denial of a#finalsay + #remain option = autocracy!
accurate & damning indictment of the damned but if she were to fall & an election follow, labour must stand with an option to #revoke, #remain & #reform to offer the ppl a fair choice, or the country may yet be damned to a #brexit that leaves us poorer, weaker & with fewer rights 
i recently shared a video from #remainernow charles and he has now written this excellent article on the devastating effect #brexit will have on the nhs if it goes ahead.if you know anyone with #nhslove ask them to read this!⁦@charlesgallahe2⁩
incredible drama in #engvcol game at #worldcup18! can feel some positive patriotic feeling in he air.i love being half english, half scottish, british and european! let’s keep those proud patriotic juices flowing and save uk from damaging #brexit#stopbrexit #remainernow
penny mordaunt @bbcr4today: i remain optimistic we will get a good deal.me: which good deal would that be? and why are we going through this #brexit hell which can only leave us poorer, weaker with less control & fewer rights unless you can get a better deal?!!#remain #reform

potential book of the yearthe award winning @jk_rowling next book sensation and movie makers dream is the #insufferablehypocrite, based on her personal real life experiences on #remainers not accepting the democratic results of;#brexit 
david voted leave but, whilst he was well informed in 2016, he now realises much of what he read was lies. he is a #remainernowhe now believes that a #finalsay #peoplesvote on #brexit is a 'democratic necessity'!respect to david, so many people like him! 
and a bigger platform needs to be given to the #remain activists who have the personality & character to engage the apathetic and communicate the importance of stopping #brexit. we have such talent in our community that needs to be supported not constantly criticised & undermined
our latest win comes from @winch_labour!brilliant to hear they have passed their version of the @remain_labour & @labour4eu motion for #lab18. it calls on the party to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu.#brexit is not inevitable.
will voted leave but here he is on @skynews explaining why he changed his mind and why a no deal #brexit would be a disaster for the uk and the 'global britain' he voted for is not what will happen.@will_dryofoc #remainernow
.@rafaelbehr eviscerates the claim that #brexit will make britain more open to the world in just two paragraphs.eu membership is a springboard to global trade, not a barrier to it.if we value a global britain, we need a #peoplesvote and we need to #remain in the eu.
macron rejects may's plea for help to rescue her #brexit plan.another day..another nail in the #brexit coffin. there is no 'good deal'..bring it to a head asap...no fudging..no transition..no extensions..just give us the #peoplesvote & a #remain option. 
may & corbyn both supported #remain. both are now desperately working for leave - despite the woeful, illegal campaign, the narrow margin of the result & the warnings about the uk's world standing post-#brexit.i do not trust either of them. i will never vote for either of them.
#canzuk is not a #brexiteer idea. sure, it finds favour with a lot of pro-#brexit folks and they have their own reasons. however, you can and, in my view, should support a free trade and movement area across canada, australia, new zealand, and the u.k. if you voted #remain...
if @uklabour commits to backing a #peoplesvote and campaigns to #remain in the eu, we stand to win 4 million more votes. it's in the national interest to stop #brexit and the party interest to stop brexit.join @remain_labour and let's make it happen!
does anyone else think that all the noise about a no deal #brexit is smoke & mirrors to make us feel happy about any deal actually made? i don’t want a bloody deal, i want a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain
#brexit has a tipping point. we are almost there. don’t give up. don’t get off the #remain side of the see saw. we can only do this together. united, knowing we are on the right side of history and democracy. have a fab weekend #fbpe peeps#saturdaymorning #bankholidayweekend
is it me or has the #remain cause grown exponentially whilst the #brexit one deflates by the day? it's now only the govt, the opposition & an army of fakes sustaining it & preventing its collapse.they've nothing new to offer to justify this #brexitshambles.#finalsay #stopbrexit
i say regularly that #brexit is a cross party issue & partisan politics must be put aside.i'm followed by people of all parties & none. #remainernow folk come from all parties & none. i will celebrate any mp opposing brexit & criticise those not.so this is good to see.
ben here voted leave but like so many he now sees what #brexit really means and is a #remainernow and wants a #peoplesvote on the #brexit deal.respect to ben, it's ok to change your mind. 
this #map shows that since #brexit turned out to be more complex and difficult than many might’ve assumed the public opinion has shifted and now favors #remain. source:  pic.twitter.com/0y4gbgaixa
.@francesogrady is right, #brexit will be devastating for working people.there is only one deal that will restore confidence, boost economic growth and restore the value of the pound in your pocket. that is the deal that sees britain #remain in the eu. leading, not leaving.
did you vote leave? did you think it would bring economic prosperity to the uk?well read the chancellor's summary of what a 'no deal' #brexit, the goal of some, will mean!if this is not what you voted for, speak out as a #remainernow & join the growing welcoming community.

colleague just asked me "what is #brexit?" when i asked her if she voted in the referendum, she said, "yes i voted leave, that's what everyone on social media was saying" i just had to explain what it was and what we are risking, she apologised and said "we're mad" #remainernow
do you want to retain your right to #eu citizenship?then click and register!don't let a bunch of self-serving politicians deprive you/your family of your future!we are stronger & wealthier and healthier in europe!#remainers #brexit 
watch: "this isn't the #brexit you voted for" says @mitchbenn. throughout august we've shared videos from @remainernow who support a #peoplesvote on the final #brexit deal. send us your videos if you are a #remainernow
can't wait for the #brexit 'technical papers' i.e. a catalogue of govt's abject failure to deliver any of the promises a raft of ministers & mps aka 'charlatans' made to con a small majority of the ppl to back it.and it is not the eu's fault.#peoplesvote for a #finalsay#remain
listening to arch-#remainer ben bradshaw mp calling for a 2nd referendum and trotting out food, medicine, and other scares after #brexit, reminds me of "the milennium bug" when planes were forecast to fall out of the sky etc when computer clocks ticked over to 01:01 01,01,2000.
no need to bully them, they're doing it willingly now they see the lies & deceits behind an invalidated #brexit which will rob us of our rights w/o consent, our young ppl of their future & damage our country irreparably.the denial of a #peoplesvote the act of autocrats. #remain
this.two years ago i voted #remain. i hadn’t thought much about the eu but leave had no plan and farage and boris were embarrassing. i now know from my time on social media #brexit is an orchestrated concerted attempt on our democracy. we must #standup2brexit. together
i think it's the responsibility of the #brexit team to find its own comedians, rather than blaming the #remain side for not providing any.god this conversation feels familiar...
believe strongly that if twitter & facebook lived up to their promises & purged every fake account #brexit would stop tomorrow & #remain would win this hands down. it's all #brexiters have to offer..fakes, delusionists & charlatans & lies.#peoplesvote & a #finalsay to prove it.
obviously as a maj of members & voters back #remain. to win corbyn must gain non labour votes; unlikely while he denies a #peoplesvote & #stopbrexit option.corbynites just don't get that #remainers r more committed to stopping #brexit than electing him. 
if there is a ge the #remain vote goes only to remain parties. not soft brexit or fudges. you fooled us once but not again. so who wants our votes? there are millions of us. we are the makers of kings. but we are no ones fools. #peoplesvote #brexit

what have we learned since #euref2016 ?- there is no #brexit dividend - there is a £39 bn divorce bill- there are no trade deals- businesses are leaving- jobs are going- facebook data was stolen - individuals were targeted with ads with lies- many #leavers are #remainnow
when people are willing to sacrifice an opportunity at full sovereignty and economic prosperity because they want to be an exchange student more easily then you know there is something wrong.#brexit #remain
respect a ref result based upon the non-binding opinion of 26.5% of the ppl/37% voters backing various #brexit, all of which remove rights w/o consent & leave the uk & the maj of its cits poorer?ok sure..if u respect the democratic right of 100% voters to get a #finalsay#remain
lifelonglandlady had a number of family members that voted leave (some of them due to the questionable adverts in run up to #euref). however, now they have changed their minds and are #remainernowplease let them know about this initiative and #brexit 
ayo (@mcdarke) is a #remainernow who has been outspoken for some time. here's his quite superb video for #peoplesvote campaign explaining how #brexit is not shaping up like he envisaged (eg like norway) & now he sees what we have to lose &  that brexit is not will of the people! 
are you a big football fan?did you vote for #brexit in 2016 #euref?when doing so did you consider it would likely make it far harder for uk clubs to sign top players?well that is #brexitreality annoyed? why not become a #remainernow?#peoplesvote
charlie is a #remainernow who has been vocal for some time and who i have shared content from many times before. here he is with the latest in the series of @peoplesvote_uk videos of regretful leaver calling for a #finalsay on #brexit.@charlievg77 keep up the good work!
all ages welcome to fight #brexit alongside #eusupergirl  absolutely no ridiculing is allowed of people that voted leave or people who didn't vote if they are a #remainernow  people can make mistakes & change their minds - we should support them!  #weareeurope
my constituency #richmondpark is now 74% #remain. @zacgoldsmith how can you justify backing #brexit when the vast majority of your constituents clearly don't want it? 
broxtowe (the constituency of anti-brexit tory rebel @anna_soubry) voted leave 53/47 but  it's #remainernow by 53/47. just one of the leave voting areas where people are waking up to #brexit reality and changing their minds. we really need a #peoplesvote
.@ladymuckstyle's mum here is one of so many in her generation who voted leave due to concerns that the nhs needed a funding boost & who were persuaded by @borisjohnson & co that's what #brexit would bring. like so many others she's realised the brexit lies & is #remainernow. 
.@buddinggenius is another person who voted leave, as she was led to believe it would lead to a #brexit dividend for things like the nhs, but has #bregret now she sees #brexit reality.respect to her, takes a good person to admit they made a mistake. another #remainernow
much of essex voted leave but towns of chelmsford, colchester, southend, barking & ilford have looked at what #brexit will actually mean 2 yrs on & have become #remainernowthe people of essex are far from alone in changing their mindscc @essexforeurope 
the bad news for #brexiters just keeps coming...just in case you missed it..you are the minority.& tbh you always were...the uk is a #remain nation & any mp forcing this invalid #brexit upon us will not be forgiven.#peoplesvote#remain optionnow 
cornwall voted leave but this brexitometer in newquay (which supports previous polling) indicates the mood in the area has changed over #brexit and it continues to become even more #remainernow good work @cornwall4eu
even e. anglia...the heart of brexitland has changed its mind on #brexit.only autocrats would ignore this shift & still deny the ppl their #finalsayforall.#peoplesvote nowwith a #remain option.may & corbyn don't you dare delay it until it's to late.
people are exhausted. no one asked for this and no one expected to be catapulted into twitter land visibility. im in awe of all the #fbpe and #remain counts who every day fight #brexit. we are all different but ultimately united. group hug and huge respect to all. thank you x
terry here voted leave as he thought it was the best choice for the uk, but, now he sees what #brexit will actually mean, he describes it as the "biggest ever own goal"respect to you @terry_fy7 for being able to change your mind and talking about it. welcome to #remainernow
#brexit. we should forget about a second referendum and simply dump brexit. #remain
as @davidlammy says there are so many leave voters now concerned about what #brexit will mean for the country. the courageous ones speak out about it & join the #remainernow community. david please refer these guys to  we need a #peoplesvote#stopbrexit
this story could not be more important. the country is turning against #brexit and the shift is biggest in #labour heartlands.it is time for @uklabour to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu. it is in the party interest. it is in the national interest.
another leave voter changes to #remain, noting the #brexit that’s pursued is ‘trick against the masses for private gain’.many leave voters won’t admit they’re victims of a scam by a wealthy elite. those voters are as much victims of brexit as others are.
most popular? it's the only way out now. if a maj still want to accept a #brexit that leaves us poorer & removes rights then i guess at least it will confirm it but if a maj now wants to#revoke #remain #reform then mps must now vote to #stopbrexit.#fbpe
the #remain campaign was lost by an arrogant pm who failed to understand his policies had peed off much of the country. the #brexit negotiations are being lost by an arrogant pm who fails to understand how the eu works. what a bloody shambles#peoplesvote
i often come accross tweets from #brexit accounts bemoaning the fact that #remain ers don’t “get behind it”out of interest, what do the brexiters do to “get behind it”and how’s that working out so far? 
the #brexit zealots are in charge, they are now the establishment of our country. they control government and through their billionaire tax dodging offshore media moguls they control the vast majority of the press. we #remainers are the insurgents!
on #brexit , britain’s youth, looking to their future, want to #remain in the eu...
emma  (not on twitter) voted leave thinking it would lead to a boost in cash for public services like the nhs. but like so many leave voters she has realised #brexit will mean the opposite & is a #remainernowemma also came to hol in april (see reply)
#brexit is all about the removal of rights & a disgrace that nearly 70 million eu (incl all 65 m uk) citizens will have rights removed without consent & in many cases without having been given a vote!#peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option#finalsayforall #fbpe #abtv
#brexit is a totally unnecessary, self-imposed, self-harming crisis. we, the uk, don't *have* to do it. @conservatives @uklabour, read @chrisgreybrexit 's blog. #stopbrexit #remainer #remainernow @peoplesvote_uk @ofocbrexit @ffsake_ , let's take over the slogan #takebackcontrol !
dragons den star & business leader @duncanbannatyne voted leave, and whilst it's not clear whether he is a fully fledged #remainernow, he has come out publically for the need for the country to consider the #brexit issue again.respect to you duncan, it's ok to change your mind! 
did you vote leave for the nhs? well this  is #brexit reality!if you have #nhslove and voted brexit the best thing you can do is to say, i want to protect the nhs, i want to #stopbrexit the #remainernow community will welcome you with open arms.#peoplesvote
a little recap on the #brexit 'options' and the extent to which each scenario will damage our public finances and public services. we must reject a choice between pain and more pain.we must earn a #peoplesvote and win the right to #remain in the eu.
a reminder that @patel4witham's claims that #remain cheated have been dismissed by the electoral commission. just more #leavelies to add to the mountain of mendacity perverting our politics. defend democracy #stopbrexit and #jailtheleaveliars!#brexit
charlie's a #remainernow i have shared many times before. here is stating that he's now so against #brexit he will only vote for parties offering a #peoplesvote. moderate conservatives voters like charlie are abandoning the party in droves, and will continue to do so over #brexit 
'absolutely no way' demands for people's vote on brexit deal can be ignored, says senior momentum sourcecome on #remain...interesting bedfellows but let's give momentum our support to get a change of labour policy & thwart the erg #brexitlive poll too... 
many regular followers will be very familiar with #remainernow @jdlarwood from his previous videos and his article in the @independent but here he is with a further video for @peoplesvote_uk clearly setting out why he changed his mind on #brexit & why we need a #finalsay 
mr @jeremycorbyn,you promised 'no jobs lost #brexit' in #ge2017why are you not supporting #remain?every type pf #brexit loses jobs71% of @uklabour voted remain in 2016youngsters supported #labour in #ge2017because you dissembledif you commit to remain, labour might win
well done @pimlicoplumbers for this #brexit banner on their premises - which is visible from train lines.many #remainernow will surely agree with the sentiment (ps. makes me glad i used them to put in a new boiler for me last summer when i still lived in london.)
been a heck of a week for me, priscilla & the family on the #eu mainland in #france reminded me more than ever we gotta stay close to our neighbours & friends over there. keep on keepin on fightin #brexit any way you can, y'all know it makes sense #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain
rather than cancelling police leave due to unrest that will be caused by a catastrophic why not just cancel #brexit itself?given the fact the country is #remainernow anyway it makes political sense.

here's nat, she did not vote in the 2016 #euref as she found the campaigns so poor, she was confused & couldnt decipher the best way to go. now she sees the reality of #brexit she's a #remainernow & is desperate for a #peoplesvote!@nat_orwell84 welcome to #remainernow club.
this is the report on the @skynews #brexit poll  that came out on monday. it’s worth 3 minutes of your time.it shows much disillusionment with brexit and that it’s not the ‘will of the people’ as many leave voters & anstainers have become #remainernow
here is raj, he voted leave as was persuaded by those advocating #brexit that it offered a great global future with new trade deals with the world whilst keeping eu links,. he's now realised that is false and is another #remainernow fantastic @rajruia, let's get a #peoplesvote
the tories have now evened things up a bit by threatening everyone in the uk with the horror of a #nodealbrexit if the #eu does not give the tories what they want. everyone in the uk is now a bargaining chipwelcome to our world! #brexitreality #leavers #remainers #brexit 
what is this the head of the erg back in 2011 calling for a double referendum on #brexit with the second once we know terms? so some kind of #peoplesvote may work? sure @jacob_rees_mogg would want this retweeted widely as he is a 'democrat'.#remainernow #stopbrexit
we are fighting to stop #brexit, but not for the status quo. we need to #remain in the eu, but we need reform and renewal as well. the @andrew_adonis & @williamnhutton book makes the case brilliantly. 
massive shout out to anyone who voted #brexit but has since become a #remainernow. your honesty and decency is overwhelming, and is an enormous boost to the #peoplesvote campaign.thank you.#stopbrexit #fbpe #waton #stay #eu
andrew is a #remainernow who has been speaking out about #brexit for some time (see thread in reply) but he has become the third #bregretter to add to the series of daily videos for @peoplesvote_uk for the month of august.great stuff @andrewhardie3 continue to speak out!

are we heading for ‘blind #brexit’ ie. leaving the eu but not knowing what it entails until after we have left? this is a real danger for the #remain campaign. stopping it will be like trying to capture the invisible man. we must have a strategy for this.
1. oh no you don't @michelbarnier @guyverhofstadt @donaldtusk ..don't  you dare sell out the majority of brits who want to #stopbrexit & #remain whether in the uk or in the eu. a #brexit fudge won't be worth the paper its written on.stop pandering to may..she has no mandate. 
dear jeremy corbyn...#brexit's on the slide...& you are silent...even if it happens it will fail...you'll find yourself held equally responsible for this #brexitshambles..time's running out for the uk & you.back a #peoplesvote now...give us a #finalsay with a #remain option.
i've followed this story and nearly all of the critics who argue against the welsh language are brexit fanatics. it goes to show that, for many, #brexit was about re-establishing britain's supremacy. is it any wonder that the vast majority of welsh speakers voted #remain?
if this invalid #brexit is allowed to go ahead..these ppl & the erg will have won. history will not look kindly on those who have helped force it upon us theresa may & jeremy corbyn.you don't appease the far right, you oppose it & deny it air.#stopbrexit & #remain#finalsay.
the press, police and the london mayor admit that #remainers are more likely to be fuelling the rise in violence in london ! #shock #horror #statistics #brexit
no kidding!  the closer we get to #brexit, the more polls show britain wants to #remain in europe #peoplesvotesent via @updayuk

exactly like edward heath, @theresa_may is trying to deceive us over chequers deal, pretending we will be free.  arrant treachery. @borisjohnson explains.  #borisjohnson #boris johnson #brexit #remain #leave
1. #brexit: how likely a 2nd eu ref?i'd dispute the labour position. my sense is of a membership & voters + starmer wanting it but corbyn et cabal anti a #peoplesvote & esp a #remain option.disgraceful mps accept 51.8% to leave but not 54% to #stopbrexit 
to all filthy cave dwelling unhelpful #remainers, more & more people are waking up to the truth that any #brexit deal will be a national disaster. you are my inspiration & strength to carry on. see you in london on 20th october. we deserve a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain
dear mrs may @theresa_may, here is your periodic reminder that you said we are better, safer, stronger in. i think so too. any #brexit is going to be a national disaster. give the people a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain.
the absurdity of such a statement! give people - many of them very hardpressed - an opportunity not to get into this ‘difficult situation’ of #brexit - by choosing to #remain#finalsay #peoplesvote #exitfrombrexit
that would be cos he is a statesman with great political integrity...unlike most of the charlatans from right & left who are forcing this invalid #brexit upon an increasingly unwilling majority w/o gaining confirmatory consent.#peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
the majority of voters never voted for it in the 1st place...a clear majority now want to stop #brexit & remain...it simply the minority of #brexiters in govt & #lexiters in opposition who are standing in the way of a democratic #peoplesvote with a #remain option.#finalsayforall
but @sajidjavid 1. it may not be up to you, parliament can dictate this.2.  many leave voters are calling for #peoplesvote as they see #brexit is not what was advertised.maybe a number of #remainernow ladies and gents should reply to your tweet below confirming this!
a food minister. a fucking food minister - appointed to make sure we don't all starve to death after #brexit. alternatively, we could just #remain and not starve.. http so://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/26/uk-appoints-food-supplies-minister-amid-fears-of-no-deal-brexit
in summary then, mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn wants a general election so he can push through his dream #brexit, failing that then perhaps maybe a #peoplesvote with possibly perhaps an option to #remain? full steam ahead with respecting a vote achieved by cheating & breaking the law?
dear mrs may @theresa_may, you seem to have changed your mind, why can't the people?the country deserves a better future than any #brexit can deliver.the people deserve a democratic #peoplesvote with the option to #remain.
are you a #lefty or a #remainer worried about #brexit?has a democratic referendum & a general election still left you feeling cheated? don’t worry, you are a wanker & this can help you!  
do you think @uklabour should back a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain? #brexitplease rt after you vote for a larger sample.
ps it's only betraying 26.5% of the ppl who voted 4 several versions of #brexit, many of whom now regret it having seen the utter mess you're making of it. to deny it is the betrayala #peoplesvote is the only democ way to confirm if the maj will is still 2#brexit or #remain
jeez labour try to understand.if u force a ge you alienate tory rebelsif u offer a tale of two #brexit-s you lose millions of #remain votes & the ge.if u give the ppl a #peoplesvote with a chance to #remain & #brexit fails, the govt falls & #remain votes return - its win win!
the majority of people wanted #brexit. you’ve had 2 years to get the best possible deal.(you told us it would be easy)if the majority of people would now vote to #remain, that only reflects your failure #labconf18 #lab2018
keir starmer gets a standing ovation from #labourconference2018 when he says option to #remain should be available in place of a bad #brexit 
keir starmer said it..if #brexit deal fails 'nobody's ruling out a public vote & #remain must be an option'.not in approved script apparently.standing ovation.dennis skinner's face a pictureno doubt corbyn, mcdonnell, gardiner mccluskey will do their damnedest to thwart it.
excellent speech from @keir_starmer strong + clear @uklabour will oppose no deal, blind #brexit, + a reckless tory #brexit + that we want election - but if that not possible - we will campaign for a *public vote* where #remain an option. @labpeoplesvote @peoplesvote_uk #lab18
a direct appeal to delegates to the @uklabour conference #lab18: the british people deserve an opportunity to deliver their verdict on #brexit. the lies have been exposed, vote for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain. thank you.
the money's there#remain is angry#brexit has aroused the centreparty loyalty lowvoters disillusioned with 2 party fixsocial media opens accesslibdems offer base organisationcentrist tory/labour mps?cometh a leader?it's not 1981...the ground is fertile.
keir starmer: new #brexit ref under labour could include option to #remain. me: fine but if it ain't policy & in writing it ain't worth the paper it won't be written on.#peoplesvote + remain option or no labour govt.
1. ok ge ahead? not if govt can avoid it before gerrymandering the boundaries but let's say we have 1tories= tory fubar #brexitdup= duh brexit & united irelandlabour= tory brexit at some pointsnp= brexit = indy2 & sod ukwhat a choice.what if all #remain voted libdem?
so many leave voters are now aware that the #brexit they ordered isn't actually on the menu & can't be served.as a result they've changed their minds want to cancel their order & not have to pay. surely they should be allowed.#peoplesvote #remainernow
labour members in favour of a #peoplesvote & wanting to #remain in the eu have been sold a pig in a poke.for the labour leadership #brexit will happen.in contrast @libdems want a #finalsay referendum & an #exitfrombrexit time for labour mps & members to vote with their feet.
so labour nudging towards norway option while tories sliding over to canada option.  hobson’s choice #brexit then. not what we want @labour4eu @remain_labour @women_4_europe and many other #remain groups. we fight on. 
dear @uklabour members who want to #remain. a ge before march 2019 may get you a labour government but it will also get you a labour #brexit. you have a leadership that does not want us to have a #peoplesvote.
leave mean leave spokesman stating a #peoplesvote would disenfranchise those who voted for #brexit.disenfranchise = deny a vote..like happened to c. 5m uk/eu citizens directly affected, in the euref.all voters including #brexiters would get a #finalsay u ****!#remain #fbpe
so no change...no commitment...no #remain option...more #brexit fudge...less time left..not bloody good enough!simple majority, binding #peoplesvote for a binary #finalsayaccept the #brexitshambles or#reject #revoke #remain #reform#fbpe #abtv
#brexit: 100s of young labour activists flock to newly created app to push party to back new ref.don't let #corbyn, mcdonnell, gardiner & mcclusky misappropriate the #peoplesvote..it's not theirs..it's the peoples & it has a #remain option at its heart!
in the event a snap general election is called, will you lend @uklabour your vote if their policy is still for a 'jobs first' #brexit and they do not support a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain?please vote and retweet for the best sample. thank you.
come on peeps this is vital...jo & team have won the referral to the ecj to consider our unilateral ability to #revokea50, stop #brexit & #remain in the eu with rebate etc intact.please give what you can to.the battle fundyou country needs you!lets also get that #peoplesvote
#nigelfarage: we need to send a clear message to #remain #mps: if you betray #brexit, we will never vote for you again!  #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc @conservatives @conhome @labourleave @standup4brexit @leavemnsleave @cchqpress @theresa_may #tory #conservativeparty
if they decide *not* to include #remain as a voting option in a #peoplesvote then the whole exercise will be rejected by the @peoplesvote_uk movement.the whole point of a #finalsay referendum is for the british people to be given an opportunity to reject #brexit#endthechaos
so it comes down to this, defeat chequers, call a ge, vote out the tories and tory #brexit, vote for corbyn and a @uklabour brexit? no fucking way! we are the king makers. the two main parties would do well to remember that.#peoplesvote with an option to #remain
#lordowen calls #2ndref campaign "disreputable". it's not the #peoplesvote, it's the #losersvote, the public can see that, including many #remainers. #lab18 #brexit pic.twitter.com/ei7etazcnr #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc @conhome @conservatives @cchqpress #labour #standup4brexit #uk #eu
hang on. jeremy corbyn admits #brexit was a protest vote against policies in this country. he admits it is damaging our country and the most vulnerable. yet he has supported it from the day after. what am i missing here? oh yea an opposition. #waton #remain #stopbrexit
2. #brexit can't be decided legitimately in a ge unless #labour stands clearly on a platform to #revokea50 & #remain in the eu.
don't hold your breath. if this is 2b valid he'll have to back asimple maj #peoplesvote 4 a binding #finalsay with a #remain option & a binary choice:accept #brexit deal/no deal or#reject #revoke #remain #reformanything else will merely be a tale of two brexits tory or labour
many leave voters are now agreeing with this from miliband "the most corrosive thing in the long term will be a brexit on terms that were missold."as a result they have changed their mind on #brexit and are #remainernow we need a #finalsay #peoplesvote
@bbcradio4 how dare @jeremy_hunt claim that remainers will now want to speed up #brexit because the #eu is threatening to break up the uk. one of the many reasons to #remain is that we knew all along that brexit, not our #eu partners, brought this very threat. #r4today
sorry @stevievanzandt we experienced 40y of lies, deceit & manipulation from our political and social elites - that’s what got us so deep into this eu mess.having witnessed the eus treatment of may and our country only the most extreme #remainer could vote for this eu. #brexit 
the resolve & determination of #brexiteers & #leave voters solidified into cast iron yesterday.the #fbpe #peoplesvote pipe dream is dead now. having witnessed the eu bully boys & gangsters in action only the most extreme #remainer could vote for this eu.#brexit #standup4brexit
quick poll. please rt: fbpe welcome to vote as long as you can kept it civil in the thread (rare) #brexit #voteleave #remain #theresamay #downingstreet #brexitcastlive do you want to?
#downingstreet   "i will not split the country" as she ignores scotland's  vote to #remainis this woman on glue or just wants to keep the 10 dup votes?#scotland #brexit
there's been a solution to #brexit staring may in the eyes ever since the vote. just emulate norway. it keeps the #leavers happy as the uk will have 'left the eu' and keeps #remainers happy as the benefits are broadly the same as membership.and ignore the erg protestations.
1. fgs what's wrong with us?i was surprised by saltzburg, not that it happened but that it happened now.i thought they'd let may get away with it as she hoped & kick her invalid harmful #brexit down the road.judgement day sooner.no more tory con#peoplesvote #remain asap
#brexit was the choice... of the #english people !!!!in #scotland, 62% voted #remain and 38% voted #brexit. in #england, 54% voted #brexit and 46% #remain.if london centralizes all powers sent back from the eu to westminster, a 2nd independence referendum will be justified.
i'm a #remainer &i feel betrayed by the democratic process, #newsnight. remember the lies. i know s.o. who changed her vote because of turkey. now we know #voteleave broke the law. #may didn't try to a find consensus. #brexit will damage our country. #peoplesvote #finalsay #fbpe
only 1 q you need to answer, bearing in mind #brexit at best represents the disparate wills of only 26.5% of the ppl, if a maj of voters now wish to #remain after seeing your #brexitshambles y is it undemocratic to allow them to express that yet democratic to deny a #peoplesvote?
#brexitshambles#nhsrailwayssocial careeducationprisonsall failing...but its never the fault of ministers.tory britain isn't working!#brexit will make it worse.#brexitislocal#peoplesvote is an urgent necessity..& the #finalsayforallmust have a #remain option.#fbpe
thanks tom...but no one mentions the removal of our rights, neither mps nor in the media. it is never discussed as an issue yet an entire level of protection is being stripped away w/o consent.#peoplesvote#finalsaysimple majbindingbinaryaccept #brexit or#remain #reform
#peoplesvote says 'multiple opportunities' for #brexit ref.i so hope this is the case & if #remain gets to #stopbrexit in the face of the full weight of govt & opposition trying to deny a #peoplesvote, it will have been an astounding feat against the odds
charles voted leave. but he is a #remainernow (see a video from him in reply).yesterday he got this great article in the @independent about how the #brexit @theresa_may intends to deliver is nothing like what he thought he voted for.#peoplesvote
more than 8 in 10 people aged 18-20 want to #remain in the eu.by offering the country a #peoplesvote @uklabour can prove we are on their side.we can only stand up for young people if we stand against #brexit
1. i wonder how many of the mps in the 100 constituencies now showing a majority in favour of stopping #brexit & wishing to #remain in the eu...or those shifting close to switching are reading the runes & starting to question openly the decision to leave & backing a #peoplesvote?
she most likely can claim her constituents have changed their minds too.in any case this #brexit has lost its mandate.26.5% of the ppl is not the peopletories lost their mandate in 2017labour falied to win onea maj want a #peoplesvoteif a maj want to #remain, #stopbrexit
there is no #brexit deal whatsoever that is more beneficial to the people of the uk, uk jobs or the uk economy than #remaining in the eu.this is an irrefutable fact. i defy any #leavers to provide evidence to the contrary.#stopbrexitsavebritain
a little reminder:norway/eea/efta = #brexitnorway+ = brexitchequers = brexitcanada+ = brexitno deal = brexittransition = brexitblind brexit = brexit29/03/19 = brexitbrexit = brexitall types of brexit = lost rights/ control/jobs & leave us worse offonly #remain = remain
1. observer view on giving voters a chance to deliver their verdict on brexit terms a #peoplesvote is the only legitimate way to sort this #brexit fiasco but it must besimple majbinding &binary #brexit deal or #remain
looks like @labour4eu met a number of leave voters who have #bregret now they see the effect #brexit will have on the lives of working people when they were.out in nottingham this weekend.this is common all over the country, their voices must be heard.#remainernow
oi brexiters!! ever heard of 'cause and effect'? without #brexit, we wouldn't have cause to fight it. without #leavers, there would be no #remainers. you made us, dipshits - we're the effect. deal with it. we're there right till the bitter end. #stopbrexit #peoplesvote #finalsay
gove: stating that chequers is a temp stop gap as a future pm can change it.me: so it's clear over time any #brexit will become an erg #brexitshambles. the ppl r twigging it's a shame the #labour leadership are naïve enough to believe in a labour brexit#peoplesvote #remain
#theresamay has humiliated herself & the country in #brexit talks. we have so much leverage to use but #remainer may hasn’t even bothered to use it. instead may has just made concession after concession, of course a deal will be struck when @theresa_may surrenders on every issue!
superb to see @sadiqkhan call for #labour to embrace a #peoplesvote! on the eve of #lab18, all the momentum is with our campaign to change party policy.nothing in politics is inevitable. we can stop #brexit and #remain in the eu.
monthly cleaner at my house today.i came back from a #brexit street stall with my toddler who randomly handed her a #peoplesvote flyer.unprompted, she said, she abstained in 2016 as felt she didn't know enough. she has regretted it since. she confirmed she's #remainernow
#brexit in a nutshell, we voted leave for our children and grandchildren,  not for a few extra euro's holiday money or visa free eu travel like the shameful #remainers
#remainers, especially @theresa_may , take note of this.  your brave ancestors died often horrifically to save this country from a european tyrant. honour your brave ancestor's and don't give away the freedom they paid for. #eu#brexit 
wonder what strategy  @borisjohnson will come up with today for cancelling the chequers #brexit?he's seen the writing on the wall and is tilting like a windmill to the wind of change. bojo is clearly a #remainernow
now that #brexit is going so badly & #brexiters are losing the argument terminally i honestly think the term #remoaner needs 2b superceded by #bremoaner. poor dears really are struggling to see their debased brexit invalidated by reality & a majority in favour of #remain.
.@chrislesliemp is  correct. so so many leave voters did not vote for the #brexit that is on offer and as a result they have changed their minds. they are #remainernow democracy demands that they have a chance to reconsider now they see reality.#peoplesvote #finalsay
because incompetent @jeremycorbyn’s a dyed in the wool #brexiteer & believes the dire consequences of #brexit will drive voters to his hard left policies in desperation but he & @peoplesmomentum miscalculated as moderate #remain #labour voters like me will never vote for #corbyn
oh and btw i voted #brexit and because of people like @albawhitewolf i have changed my mind to #remain and want a #peoplesvote without people like her, i may never have changed my mind. you see i was open to reason.
more good news for the @remain_labour & @labour4eu campaign!thank you to members in @richmondclp for becoming the latest local party to call on the party to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu.#brexit is not inevitable 
to any #queensofremain out there. thank you. this isn’t a love in. it’s a battle for what’s right. and sometimes a group hug is necessary. just to say i appreciate your efforts. #brexit is shit. stay strong and let’s support each other as we fight for #remain 
was expecting #twitter to be lit up with #remainers praising #juncker's #stateoftheunion vision for the future of the #eu today. but...nothing...nada...zilch....#brexit
we’ve worked for two years to build this case to #prosecuteboris. this is about fighting #fakenews and dishonesty in politics. focussing on #leave or #remain with #brexit is a mistake. we need to deal with the misconduct that divided us first. #boris

.@femi_sorry is absolutely right.#brexit in any form will sharpen austerity and hit hardest those who have least.@uklabour must have the courage to argue for a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu. we need to commit to it at #lab18, not for it be a last resort.
great to see my good buddies from @sodemaction and the mighty @euflagmafia givin out #euflags at the #proms tonight, with musical accompinament too! it ain't exactly rock n roll but i like it like it yes i deu!  #brexit #stopbrexit #fbpe #finalsay #remain
more encouraging news ahead of @the_tuc conference. #brexit in any form will sharpen austerity, cost jobs and hit hardest those who have least.to stand up for union members, we need @uklabour to back a #peoplesvote and campaign to #remain in the eu  
just realised that when david davis said that the chequers proposal was worse for the uk than staying in the eu he was being honest. there's no #brexit solution that can possibly be as good as simply remaining in the eu on the existing terms. davis is a #remainernow 
an inquiry takes time which is limited. labour must take the initiative & back a #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option now. pls don't wait for a no deal, there's enough evidence already to invalidate the ref. no more stalling #brexit removes rights & makes us poorer

new @kthopkins video: i asked anti-#brexit campaigner femi oluwole this question — and the interview fell apart...  | #uk #remain #politics
how could anyone have known what #brexit meant 2 years ago when even now, 2 years later, the government cannot agree on what brexit means. i voted #remain, i didn't know what brexit meant, & neither did 'the people'. now we know it isn't going to be good, time for a #peoplesvote.
the petition to rescind article 50 if #leave broke election laws (they did) is to be debated in parliament on 10th september. the government initially dismissed the petition but then it reached over 190,000. so now it must be debated by mps. well done everybody.#brexit #remain
there's v. little direct action uk can do on our own to counter russian aggression but here's 2 damn good responses that would really stick in putin's craw & avoid retaliation1. increase uk's military capacity.2. stop #brexit & #remain in the eu.
dear @theresa_may there was a vote two years ago that split the country roughly down the middle. at the time nobody knew what the ramifications of #brexit would be. the public are now far better informed and polling suggests they're now strongly #remain.why no #peoplesvote ?

1.  a ref won't stop #brexit unless a maj want 2 #stopbrexit2. if a maj now wish to #remain it's the will of the ppl3. those denying a #finalsay r autocrats4. those forcing thru an invalid #brexitshambles r tyrants5. a #peoplesvote doesn't subvert democracy it reinforces it.
within this article it is clear from  recent @yougov polling (with 18k + sample) that the uk is #remainernow.(51% men, 56% women).as more & more 2016 abstainers & leave voters realise #brexit reality & that it's not inevitable, this will only increase.
how would a #finalsay *vote* be undemocratic? the #brexit ref was, even ignoring the meddling, too close for a hard cliff-edge brexit mandate to be read from it. imagine #remain had won 52-48 and that had been taken as a mandate for the euro, schengen, and full federalism.
#brexit is lose lose...it's that simple...#peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
uk is not a homogenous blob. only 37% voted for #brexit. half the country want to #remain. we do not want to lose our eu citizenship & are fighting desperately to #stopbrexit. we are the first people to have to fight fork eu citizenship so we know how precious it is.
well done to @patrickcherry's daughter for this great letter in her local paper on #brexit.more people should write to local papers on this, many people get news that way.if you are a #remainernow and want to do this let us know, we can help with drafting & placing.

many jokes about #brexitcoin today. but issuing this at this stage of negotiations shows the utter contempt the govt have shown to #remain and the majority of the country for two and a half years. #brexit isn’t even agreed by the cabinet so why would be celebrate? #shameful
the sunday times polled its readers on #brexit and @peoplesvote_uk, a clear sign that opinion has changed, reality has sunk in and the uk requires a second referendum. #renewparty #peoplesvote #remainoption
there's only 1 #budget2018 announcement that can guarantee growth & it's that #brexit will be stopped & we'll be #remain-ing in the eu with the best possible deal any sovereign country has ever been able to secure.it's a no-brainer. all versions leave us worse off#stopbrexit
millions of #remainers are deeply worried about the rise of the far-right, facilitated by #brexit, which threatens our democratic rights.we don't want cake. be nice if you could stand in solidarity with us mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn.
#poll in your opinion is the @bbc @bbcnews biased in favour of the #torygovernment & #brexit against those wishing to argue the case to #remain in #europeanunion #yes #no ?#please #voteandretweet
our petition calling for the next #labour manifesto to pledge a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain is only 7 days old. we are already at nearly at 7,000 signatures.#brexit could collapse this govt at any time. we need to be ready for all scenarios 
why all the angst about a ‘second referendum’! we want a 1st legal, fact based #brexit referendum that treats the uk electorate with a modicum of intelligence. the electorate of the united kingdom (#leave and #remain) deserved better than the 2016 debacle. we still do. #finalsay
it is not a myth.it is an outright lie.they knew it was a lie, and still told it.they know we know it is a lie, and they still tell it.#brexit is a scam. we want to #stopbrexit and #remainintheeu, @eucopresident,@michelbarnier, @guyverhofstadt.
it's saturday! it's #fbpeparty day!@theresa_may is leading us towards ruin.@jeremycorbyn does nothing about it.if you believe #brexit would be destructive & the referendum result was ill-gotten, now's the time to stand up for the uk.#peoplesvote #remainoption #fbpe #waton

i've signed the official petition to stop the second referendum on the brexit vote as i do not want the #remainers to obstruct the will of the people on #brexit.  have you? .
it’s clear the only brexit possible is #badbrexit, be that no deal or be that a fudge. so it’s not surprising to see tweets attacking #fbpe, as it’s the only pro #remain movement there is. there are no sunlit uplands, no jobs first brexit. you either support #brexit or you don’t
come on mrs may, wipe the grins off the faces of your backstabbers, knock the wind out of the #brexiters & #lexiters & just for once put uk 1st; forget the stubborn technocrat.fess up, admit the #brexit bs & offer a #peoplesvote with a #remain option!reputation win people win!
#afterthemarch i knew i wasn’t alone in my passion to #remain. millions shared my belief #brexit is not the answer. yet as the week’s gone on, i realised many people hadn’t a clue about the march. we have to work harder to break out of our bubbles. to talk and debate locally
#brexit shafts our country, our people and our fellow eu citizens. on every level. we don’t have to do it. #remain is still an option and i will support everyone who is fighting to keep that on the table. it’s that simple. i will do all i can to #stopbrexit 
this week, eu has voted to ban single use plastics, voted to end the indiscriminate use of antibiotics on farm animals & voted for better welfare standards 7 billion broiler chickens produced each year - #whathaseueverdoneforus #bettertogether #eu4animalwelfare #brexit #remain

why do i think mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn has some responsibility for #brexit? for:not opposing #brexit.not saying he doesn't think it's in the best interests of our country.suggesting that his idea of #brexit will be.not supporting a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain.
john mcdonnell @bbcradio4 stating we have to respect the ref but keep all options on the table...would not clearly state 'yes' to allowing a stop #brexit #remain option..me: you can't state you're respecting the ref result w/o ruling out a chance to reverse it.he backs #brexit

dear corbynites if jc loses the next ge don't pin the blame on anyone other than him.you may worship the ground he walks on & back a #brexit that removes rights without consent, threatens jobs & publ servs & leave us worse off,we don't.#peoplesvote #stopbrexit #remain#fbpe
despite the pathetic & somewhat unpleasant tweets over the last 48 hrs, i will reiterate that my vote is not yours to take for granted, you have to #earnmyvote. it is contingent on #brexit & supporting a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain. insults & intimidation don't work.
so many areas of uk that benefit from regional investment will lose out massively from #brexit, this massive one in stirling is just one example.if you are concerned about your area and voted leave, know it's ok to change your mind. be a #remainernow
people who voted leave, was this what you voted for? if not and you say to #brexit #notinmyname then speak out. join the growing community of #remainernow. write to your mp, demand a #peoplesvote with #optiontoremain. we can stop this mess!

they are not on our side - & have done everything they can to further #brexit - & really why they have done that - doeesn't matter to most #remain ers.#finalsayforall #optiontoremain #finalsay 26/26 - ends

i voted #remain there shouldn't be a second vote on #brexit because that would make a mockery of #democracy but if there is a second vote i'll be voting #leave #euhaveyoursay
i’m a member of @uklabour. i voted #remain.i voted for @jeremycorbyn in the 2nd leadership election after the #brexit ref.i voted labour in the ge after the #brexit ref.i would vote labour again tomorrow. brexit belongs entirely to the tories.i stand with jeremy corbyn!
complete silence from @uklabour while at least 700,000 people march against #brexit.  this could have been an election winning shoe-in but you've just lost a lot of support.  it's quite simple, if you're not supporting #remain you're supporting #brexit.
#peoplesvotemarch      700,000nigel farage - harrowgate 1,200#brexit is now well past itsuse by date #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
inspired by the 700,000 on #peoplesvotemarch and want to join our campaign to ensure #labour backs a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain?please take 60 seconds to sign up to our mailing list and join our movement.#brexit is not inevitable 
and it has shown that there is more passionate will for the uk to #remain in the #eu than there is for #brexit. #leave simply cannot, and have not, motivated this level of public support. #farage may bribe a few into a scruffy pub with the offer of a free beer, but that's it.
waiting for the off!the shropshire contingent on the #peoplesvotemarch gathers outside the dorchester. to halt the #brexit mess, we need a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with option to #remain leading to an #exitfrombrexit
here is @damidude talking about why, despite voting leave in 2016, he is at #peoplesvotemarch.he is a #remainernow demanding a #finalsay on #brexit#peoplesvote #stopbrexit
who is the biggest asshole in british politics?#tonyblair@sajidjavid@nick_clegg@chukaumunna @conservatives@uklabour#brexit#remain#peoplesvotemarch#askingforafriend
the pro-brexit march attracted 12 supporters this week. the #peoplesvotemarch will attract hundreds of thousands. do you see @theresa_may, the will of the people is not to #brexit at any cost. the people want a vote on the #deal with an option to #remain.
i am so excited! i am seeing people beginning their travels to london, ii am buzzing with excitement!we all need a vote on the final say, a democratic #peoplesvote with an option to #remain if the #brexit deal is a shitshow. pic.twitter.com/t2bcfsdc6f
many saw this 2+ yrs ago.#brexit was lost when may backed by corbyn invoked a50 w/o a clue or due diligence..an act ofgross negligence.whether there's a fudge or no deal all versions of this #brexitshambles threaten rights jobs & our future.#peoplesvote #remain option now.
from all over uk ppl of all ages, backgrounds and political views including former #leave voters will march tomorrow for a #peoplesvote deal or no deal w #remain on the ballot paper you can take back control of #brexit & end the chaos @peoplesvote_uk see you there!
this was not advertised by leave campaign! thought we were supposed to get a #brexit dividend? that's what many leave voters were made to beleive!feel misled and betrayed? would you rather this money went on schools, hospitals & housing? become a #remainernow & fight #brexit 
no one knows what #brexit is, so no one knows why they voted for it. apart from the brexeratti, who stand to gain a shitload of money, while everyone else loses. that is why i will be in london on saturday marching for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain11/11
the govt is after forcing through a blind #brexit...to get us out of the eu w/o any honesty about our final destination...& that film didnt end well...#peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
if you insist on being so tedious: yougov - co-founded & co-owned by a #brexit-bonking mp - has been running a tracker for years. oldest, respected, consistent. shows a clear shift to #remain, especially amongst women.we're not too proud to admit it when we make a mistake.
'we will make a success of it''no deal #brexit looks increasingly likely'not going so well is it mrs may @theresa_may?get yourself off the hook, why not give the people a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain?
no to an extension of a transition period...it's a #brexit conyes to #revokea50 to allow for a #peoplesvote for a binding #finalsay with a #remain option.
yet another survey out showing a majority for #remain if a new #referendum on #brexit were held tomorrow – this time with a lead of 17 points(!). can we please stop treating #willofthepeople as somehow static on this issue? #endthechaos #letthepeopledecide
this filthy rag does not respect the fact that many of the 17.4m have changed their minds & in any event didn't vote for a no deal #brexit. they also think there will only be 100,000 marching on saturday for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain, let's prove them wrong, bigly!
red brexit or blue brexit#labour  or tory, same #brexit.same policy of leaving eu single market that wil kill jobs!fight to #remain join or support the #libdems #finalsay
shut up, you child-the adults are going to take control and end this mess. take that from someone who believed the lies & voted leave and is a #remainernow. the #peoplesvote & an end to #brexit will save ordinary people. brexit would bankrupt ordinary folk, not that you care.
together, we can make the top tweets about #brexit become #remain tweets, week in, week out.  as #remain ers - it is a choice that we have now, one of the few that we do have.  9/9 #peoplesvotemarch #stopbrexit #fbpe
to #remainers it has come as no surprise that the govt cannot deliver #brexit. a promise based on lies will always flounder when reality kicks in. i just wonder how long it will take for the penny to drop in the minds of dogmatic #leavers who refuse to believe they were conned.
happy #tuesdaythoughts#brexit is dying, the misrepresentations have hit reality & it's clear there is no way to do brexit well.it will be stopped.and the more and more sensible leave voters that speak out as #remainernow the quicker that will happen.#finalsay #peoplesvote
mr corbyn @jeremycorbyn is mistaken, there's no #brexit deal better than the one we already have, therefore any brexit plan would be unacceptable. marí is right, we need a leader who puts country before their own party and dogma & supports a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain
first episode of #remainernow podcasthere we talk to @damidude about why he voted leave, why he changed his mind & what he's now doing to fight #brexitit's a bit rough & ready (awkward pause at start) but hope it's interesting.links to articles etc 
in the blue corner we have @conservatives offering singapore-on-sea #brexitin the red corner we have @uklabour offering venezuelalite #brexitpersonally i'd rather a sunny yellow #remain @libdems#finalsayforall
#corbyn not one word about #remain or #peoplesvote#labour want their own #brexit their very own cliff edge! 
fifteen minutes to go till theresa may finally admits #brexit will break our country, and so she is withdrawing article 50. #remain  right?
when asked are you happy living in the eu by eurobarometer, 66% of those in the uk who were asked said yes & just 25% said no!the uk appears to be #remainernow on that basis #brexit is clearly not the #willofthepeople. surely the democratic option is to have a #peoplesvote?
the co-operative party, several of whom sit on #labour's front bench, have voted “almost unanimously” in support of a new referendum on #brexit – with an option to #remain. the pressure on jeremy #corbyn is growing steadily on this... #endthechaos
75% of doctors and nurses now say they would vote to #remain in any new vote on #brexit – up from 66% in 2016 – with 83% saying the famous £350m for the #nhs was a deliberate lie. is an injection of chaos really what the #health service needs? #endthechaos
i am gutted that my #brexit vote may come to pass. i want to hit myself on the head and shout "stupid, stupid, stupid" most of all i want a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain to reverse my foolishness.
what a bloody mess. so much time & treasure wasted on a hiding to nothing.sh*t is hitting the #brexit fan as so many warned it would 2 years ago. any deal is bad & any version of this #brexitshambles leaves us worse off.fess up #revokea50 & #remain
lord wolfson is #brexit funder and enabler. isn't it about time #remainers voted with their feet and stop buying from #next
just recorded the 1st episode of the new #remainernow podcast with regretful leave voter @damidude.we chat about why he voted leave, what changed his mind, what he is now doing to fight #brexit & tactics for a #peoplesvote. look forward to bringing it to you in next few days.
as the prospect of a possible ge comes nearer, so does the inevitability of another hung parliament. i for one will not be lending @uklabour my vote while a corbyn #brexit is still on the table. rule it out, support a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain & my vote is yours.
hilarious yet chilling take on #brexit by australia’s abc insiders program. boris as you have never seen him before #stopbrexit #peoplesvote #stopbrexitsavebritain #brexitnightmare #remain #peoplesvotemarch
sick to death of #brexiters whingeing on about how #remain backers seek to 'thwart/reverse/#stopbrexit'listen you wazzocks a #peoplesvote can't thwart #brexit unless a maj of voters want it stopped; if that's so then democratically we must #revokea50 no?are you brain dead?!
dear @bbc, what a treat it would be if you were to give at least the same coverage to the march in london on 20th october. it's a mass rally against the far right #brexitand for a #peoplesvote with an option to #remain. how about it?
this is an excellent video featuring many leave voters that have become  #remainernow. as the facts become clearer, people are changing their minds on #brexit. and that is one of the many reasons why we should have a #peoplesvote. let’s see if the country really wants this.
why brexiters hate the eu:'turkey'the euroschengenislamic refugeesstraight bananaseu armyno blue passportsever closer unionall of these are myths or do not apply to the ukwe've killed the delusions of #brexit, now we must kill the myths of #remain
happy weekend everyone. this time next week we’ll be on our way to the #peoplesvotemarch. millions of us making huge efforts and sacrifices to be seen and heard, each in our own unique way. #remain is a broad  church, inclusive, supportive. our fight is #brexit. not each other
ok. #remainers, #remain british #fbpe, #peoplesvote & #stopbrexit be nice!so many people are considering their choice. don't make it emotional, make it a reasonable.the forces for #brexit are mobilising inane nationalism. be nice to potential #remainernow folks. safe place?
hey now listen to my good buddy @garylineker here, he's got the right idea. time for a #peoplesvote, and time for a #peoplesvotemarch next saturday. it's gonna be huge. be there. #brexit #stopbrexit #fbpe #remain
i do hate this picture, very disingenuous. for the sake of balance:voted to #remain: 16,141,241did not vote to remain: 48,858,759 #brexit #uk
enjoying a bit of a break from 24/7 #brexit...but please can we just stop this #brexitshambles, get rid of the far right & left & get back to being the country i used to feel proud of?we can you know..just #revokea50, #remain in the eu & #reform the uk.#peoplesvote asap
i'm a #brexit moderate who voted #remain, but since we're going to #leave we must make it work for us. i can't therefore see that either parliament or i would vote for britain to be locked into a permanent open-ended customs union arrangement!
glad to hear my good buddy john major still fightin the good fight against #brexit and all who still believe in it. gotta be time for a #peoplesvote surely? #fbpe #remain 
as ken says, there is no majority for various iterations of #brexit in the hoc.the uk is the same, there are so many versions of #brexit those who want to #remain far outweigh any version, particularly as so many leave voters become #remainernow
the #remainarettes say for *u*k's sake stop #brexit its not a done deal #peoplesvote
.@theresa_may said in #pmqs  she has duty to deliver #brexit.maybe for ukip & erg.but she utterly ignores:-16.1m that voted #remain-1m @britishineurope-@the3million eu citizens-1.5m of @generation_vote - millions that still want  @efta4uk-approx 3m #remainernow
if you voted for #brexit believing it would benefit the nhs, you were lied to.if you voted for #brexit believing you would take back control, you were lied to.if you voted for #brexit believing it would benefit you & your family, you were lied to.#peoplesvote #remainoption
this is brilliant & sums it all up perfectly! #brexit #leave #remain #remoaners
with brexit negotiations entering their final stretch and just 5 months until brexit day. if there was a second referendum. what would be your vote now? #brexit #remain #leave
eea doesn't resolve the irish border which would also require customs union membership...in which case it's a pay & obey no say #brexit.why give up the control we have to be worse off & lose rights.better to #stopbrexit & #remain in the eu.#peoplesvote & a #finalsayforall.
this is big. we are officially #remainernow. what does business (small & large), the lgbtqi+ community, scientists, british medical association, young people & countless others all have in common? they all believe #brexit will have devastating consequences. 
the tide has turned against #brexit @standardnewsnow this is not the end. it is not even the beginning of the end. but it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.#peoplesvote #stopbrexit #brexitbritain #peoplesvotemarch #remain
rt if you believe you have been lied to by the #leave campaign (& the entire #brexit process) and also if you would vote #remain if you were given a #finalsayforall #peoplesvote.if you want a #peoplesvote please continue to spread the message...
this is what #labour leadership on #brexit looks like.thank you @sadiqkhan a #peoplesvote with the option to #remain in the eu? #yeswekhan
i urge readers to join us at the march in london on 20th october. nobody voted to prepare for this shit, nobody. the reality is #brexit is not in the best interests of our country. #peoplesvote with an option to #remain
many people that voted leave & are #remainernow, is in light of information that they weren't aware of at #euref. the fact that so many were unaware of #brexit implications is down to misleading politicians but also media failing. i agree with @peston 
dunc voted leave and is a #remainernow i have shared before. he is annoyed that everything he was led to believe #brexit backing politicians has proved false, and with listening to the excellent @mrjamesob he has changed his mind.thanks for being open on this @bigd7788, 
david here voted leave, but he changed his mind a long time ago. he feels he was lied to and feels #brexit will hit those least able to protect themselves the hardest. david is a #remainernow respect  for speaking up @david_harman_uk, not easy but so many feel like you!
whilst in the end totnes mp @sarahwollaston voted remain, for a time prior to june 2016 she backed #brexit.this is a good article on why she changed her mind & arguments that can be used in ensuring leave voters can be encouraged to be a #remainernow
a #peoplesvote & a #remain option must be offered whether or not there's a deal.any deal that leaves uk cits worse off & removes rights is wholly invalid.@uklabour better back it & join the tory rebs.euref & #brexit betray he people.nothing to respect 
just think if govt & opposition allow this debased invalid #brexit to proceed & we lose the oversight of the ecj supported by 27 sovereign democracies & these con artists gain majority control of our legal system what's in store for us.#peoplesvote #remain #stopbrexitsavebritain
unilever (one of the largest corporations in the world) has now abandoned its plan to move its hq from london to rotterdam. it will #remain in #london after #brexit along with the banks and other major companies.
thank you for an excellent turnout - it was a great event.  a strong manufacturing sector provides well paid, skilled jobs for ppl in coventry especially those at @jaguar #jaguarlandrover #brexit puts them at risk. that’s why we need a @peoplesvote_uk deal or no deal + #remain
my sense is the nov budget will be full of promises of jam today to sweeten the #brexitshambles...but inevitable home auctions tomorrow.do not believe a word these tory #brexit bs*itters utter..the clue is in the name.conservative.#peoplesvote #remain
#remainernow @bigd7788 makes a good point here. it's often difficult for leave voters who have changed their minds on #brexit to speak out due to abuse they get from both sides.being a #remainernow is brave & they should be welcomed, most leave voters did so in good faith.
and this on the same day a drug trial firm announces it won't now start trials in the uk due to uncertainty from #brexit. to all the people who voted for brexit, this is your dividend. time to wake up & realise brexit is all risk for no benefits. #remain
nadine. think. the eu have been consistent from day 1. honest fair transparent. what is happening is the realisation brexit can’t deliver anything it promised. no one is forcing us into no deal. the choice now is #brexit or #remain. and i know which is winning. #peoplesvote 
#remainers i think we should do it en masse in protest at tory and labour's stance on brexit.i have, even though i normally vote @uklabourbut last ge i was told my vote was for #brexit.they must understand that they can't rely on our votes#wontgetfooledagain
looks like many tory ministers are reconsidering their position on #brexit and are coming round to a #peoplesvote.let's ensure we all keep writing to mps to encourage them to out #countryoverparty but especially if you are #remainernow#stopbrexit
may: asking for party unity to avoid her deal being derailed & the #brexiters risking ending up with no #brexit.me: she's just admitted she knows a maj of the ppl cld vote #remain in a #peoplesvotethis woman doesn't believe in the real will of the ppl.1 person1 vote 1 time.
just be aware even if it goes ahead neither the tories nor a complicit labour leadership can ever take #remain votes for granted.we will neither forgive nor forget this #brexit betrayal.you've awakened a quiet element of the electorate & forged a new alliance.cometh the leader
uk ministers' #brexit plans must be stopped and @plaid_cymru will campaign "hard" to keep the #uk in the #eu, the party's new leader @adamprice has said. #notmybrexit #nideinbrexit #peoplesvote #pleidlaisybobl #remain @peoplesvote_hq
just look at the absolute state of these maundering fruitcakes.when i see these mentals out on the streets marching against brexit, i can rest assured that i’m sane i voted correctly.#remainerderangementsyndrome#brexit
we have literally weeks to stop #brexit.remainers need  to stop covering for #corbyn and #labour being ambivalent. time to support the #libdems100%#remain#fbpe
nice to hear @anna_soubry making the #remainiacs case of: "we little people must vote again & again & again until we get it right (according to her at least) on #bbcradio5 she never misses a chance to open her front hole whilst simultaneously talking out of her back hole. #brexit
hang on, was it not promised this #nhs funding was coming from #brexit??it was printed on a bus and everything!voted leave & fed up with the lies you were given at time of #euref? join so many others as a #remainernow! you will find a welcoming community!#cpc18 #stopbrexit
neither @theresa_may nor @jeremycorbyn understands. this isn’t like anything else. there’s no debating this; no revising; no tweaking.this isn’t ordinary politics. it’s #brexit. and it’s so illegal, repulsive, and destructive that we will never allow it. never. ever.#remain
the insanity of #brexit grows with each passing day. had it not happened deficit cld've been cleared.there can be no good outcome given the irreversible damage but at least it can be mitigated if we get a #peoplesvote for a #finalsay with a #remain option
many people who voted leave did so as (a) a protest against austerity and (b) to fund the nhs.it's now clear that #brexit has prolonged austerity and is costing the uk economy £500m a week.if this is not what you voted for, join us as a #remainernow
less than 6 months until #brexit day & the biggest risk to brexit now is that we are forced into a #baddeal that #remainers & the #eu have been colluding towards. we don't need a #transitiondeal, we shouldn't pay a #brexitbill & we must quit in full on the 29th of march 2019!
the #eu & #remainers like #theresamay are colluding to stop a #realbrexit from happening. they don’t want the #uk to #leave & are using a deal to trap us under eu control so we are not really a #free nation. we must stop them for overturning #brexit. we must have a clean break 
#remainers have made the uk look weak, they are not fighting for #brexit & they never will because they despise hate people for voting brexit & rejecting their view. we need a strong #brexiteer leader who will stand up to europe like we have done as a nation so many times before!

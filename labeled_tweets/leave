britons were massively misinformed on the main #brexit issues  in all cases to the advantage of the #leave campaign john major said  if they decide to leave on the basis of inaccurate information     then i regard that to be deceitful #stopbrexit #fbpe 
pleasing to see so many #leave voters putting the pro europe tag on their tweets  nice to see they want to hear the voice of the #remain camp   also are fighting for a democratically conducted referendum  a #finalsay with no foreign money will give us that  #fbpe #stopbrexit 
post may s brexit  a romanian working in mcd can still bring over his wife 4 kids and parents to live in britain with better rights than us brits  and they can take their case all the way to the ecj  how is this fair  #brexit #nodeal #leaveeu pls rt and like if you agree 
i discovered today that some generally well informed anti #brexit #labour voters were unaware that even in #leave voting lab seats  majority of lab voters chose #remain  i shared this     
dear @daviddavismpduring the eu ref campaign #leave cleverly undermined #remain by dismissing all #brexit risks as #projectfearearlier this week i held a poll   we have decided to brand #brexit as #projectfacepalmyou ll be glad to know that you re the poster boy for it#fbpe 
this is what pisses me off more than anything about #brexit   there was no consensus on what #voteleave actually meant  still isn’t   these options should have been on ballot paper for clarity  uk being pushed off a cliff when the majority was actually for #remain  #stopbrexit 
net migration to the uk has dropped by a third since last year’s brexit vote  #leave 
 brexit is not the answer to social injustice that many poor #leave voters wanted  on the contrary  #brexit is a deepening part of a continuing problem   #stopbrexit  #toriesout   #solveukpoverty  simples  
brexit climbdown is not what leaving the eu was meant to look like  all the claims of a post #brexit promised land have  as predicted  fallen away  no wonder the #leave camp are so grumpy  they re realising they were lied to by their masters  tough

here’s another regretful #leave voter   #remainernow   anthony described it as naive optimism that led to his #leave vote  maybe that’s because @borisjohnson   friends pretended #brexit would be easy   not ridiculously complex  anthony it’s not too late to #stopbrexit #fbpe 
the latest world economic league table states that britain has recovered from an initial economic blip after the vote to #leave and now looks set to maintain its position in the rankings and improve by 2020 after #brexit  
delia here decided to talk about her #brexit regret first thing christmas morning  she sets out her reasons for her #leave vote in a number of tweets which i will thread below  all good reasons but now wants to #remain   reason 1  #fbpe #stopbrexit 
 @melouise5 here voted #leave in #euref but is concerned that you cannot trust this govt   is worried for what the #brexit future will bring  she is another #remainernow   she is not alone   people like her should be applauded for speaking out   encouraged to take positive steps  
the rich #brexit donors who bankrolled the #leaveeu campaign now want an exemption for the tax they owe  
this is jo  she voted #leave in #euref but she sees the harm #brexit is doing to the uk   regrets her vote  @wilson2008mrs thank you for having the courage to publically say you made a mistake  the key thing is mps are made aware there are so many like you  #fbpe #remainernow 
remember all the times #leave leaders promised we wouldn t leave the single market  they were lies designed to win over wavering voters and win the referendum by deceit no mandate for a #brexit built on a mountain of #leavelies #stopbrexit #fbpe 
the #leave campaign was funded by vast amounts of money from the super rich  £7 5m from arron banks alone  our pro eu campaign is all volunteer effort plus a little crowd funding  we are the real popular  grassroots resistance #stopbrexit #brexit #fbpe 
dear @theresa maymy national identity as english   british does not need to be restored  as an eu citizen my national identity was never taken away  on the contrary i feel it has been enhanced  we need to bring people together not divide them #stopbrexit #brexit #remain #leave 
why   despite pre referendum claims from the #leave camp   small fishing communities stand to lose out due to #brexit  just like everyone else  #stopbrexit 
because #leave is not about #economics  it would be dead in the water if it were makes no economic sense  leave is uk s very own  rightwing #populism  like trump  #afd  #frontnational the eternal tory #proxywar re  europe has had many manifestations this one is called  #brexit  
my mother voted #leave because she trusted the commitment to £350m for the nhs  she is angry that promise will not happen  she’s not online  so persuaded by press   bus  mum wants another referendum  she feels she’s been lied to  #brexit

in a second eu referendum  as suggested by nigel farage today  how would you vote   rt please #opinions #polls #youth #remain #leave #politics #brexit #stopbrexit #haveyoursay #nigelfarage #eu #euref2 #secondreferendum #rt 
aaron banks   #nigelfarage   want a #2ndreferendum on the #brexit deal fine okay if you insist i won t put up a fight seems like a very sensible idea to me very democratic in fact let s do it  landslide for #leave  they say they say   #stopbrexit #fbpe 
is it me     or is the @bbc ignoring the public support for jacob rees mogg becoming leader of the @conservatives  it s like they don t want the @conservatives to win the next election or something #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu #euref 
in under an hour begins #stopbrexithour  this is #stopbrexit2018  and here s 1 reason why  the referendum did not specify what #leave would mean  and given that the result was so close there is certainly no mandate for #hardbrexit  #fbpe #finalsay 
here is paul  he voted #leave but now regrets it  like many he feels his vote has been hijacked   is yet another #bregretter calling for a #finalsay #brexit referendum when the facts are clear  @bravehartley thanks for acting like your name suggests   speaking out on this issue  
oh usa what hv u done  conned by  populist  #trump who didn t want to win   hasn t a clue on delivery  sounds familiar  #brexit #leave et al 
seriously  what is the point of #brexit will it give £350m extra to #nhs  nowill it maintain exact same rights   benefits as we have now  nowill it make us better off  noall the #leave promises are broken  #brexit isn t what we thought  we can change our minds  #finalsay 
well  thank goodness #leave won the referendum and the nhs is now receiving that additional £350m a week    one of the many brexit benefits we re all now enjoying   
the public were grossly misinformed about critical issues at the time of the #brexit referendum  always to the benefit of #leave  john major said it would be deceitful if the vote was based on inaccurate information  we should not respect a vote built on lies #stopbrexit #fbpe 
#fbpe #stopbrexit #brexit #leavers #leaveeu if there were a second ref would you change your vote  or if you didn t vote last time   
in light of misleading information exposed  accurate information obtained  a deeper realisation   understanding of the complexities   consequences   because it affects the destiny of millions  it is wise   our duty to reconsider brexit #stopbrexit #brexit #remain #leave #fbpe 
reminder  voters were grossly misinformed about the main issues in the #brexit referendum  in all cases in favour of #leave  this is a damning indictment of the state of british media  britain is much more a failed democracy than a healthy one #stopbrexit #fbpe #waton 
boe governor mark carney points out that the economy is about 1  smaller than the bank predicted it would be before the #brexit vote     but that was a prediction made in the event of a  remain  vote     he predicted armageddon for #leave 
by 2019  about 1 5 million people over 60 will have died since #eureferendum  data shows 70  backed #leave so say 1 1m  we are on course for 2 5m 18 34s to register to vote  if 70  back #remain that s 1 75m  crucially  no more majority for #brexit by default #remainernow  
two thirds of people believe #brexit going badly  according to poll  #brexitreality does not correspond to #leave promises    
in a second eu referendum  as suggested by nigel farage last week  how would you vote   rt please #opinions #polls #youth #remain #leave #politics #brexit #stopbrexit #haveyoursay #nigelfarage #eu #euref2 #secondreferendum #eu27 #rt 
without the votes of racist far right bigots #leave would have fallen short of a majority  the british political elite is now pandering to this odious minority and ignoring the best in our country  #fbpe #stopbrexit #brexit 
interesting graphic showing what many of us know  that the #remain #leave divide is on the authoritarian libertarian axis  not the left right one  hence the divisions in our political parties and the fraught   angry communications between the two sides #stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit  
interesting piece from a #leave voter who would like a chance to reconsider #brexit    
you cannot  respect  the referendum result without legitimising the torrent of hate and lies poured out by the right wing press which won the vote for #leave #stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit  
the consensus now is that #brexit is no longer inevitable  the eu wants us to stay  a huge #remain community wants to stay   the #leave camp is running scared  let s make the most of this opportunity   pull out all the stops to #stopbrexit@libdems @thegreenparty @snp @labour4eu 
you cannot  respect  the referendum result without legitimising the torrent of hate and lies poured out by the right wing press without which #leave would have surely lost the vote #stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit 
back in 1973   1975 british citizens were told they would be £5 per week each  better off as a member of the eec  eu   our trade deficit with the eu has risen year upon year  strange how germany benefit the greatest   uk the least  #brexit #leaveeu 
so   #remain was right about the costs  but #leave decided they wanted out anyway say  can you guys be the  ones who pay for  #brexit then all of it for starters  #markcarney has the  estimated financial cost   it ll be billions cheers  
new evidence that illegitimate russian pro #brexit influence on #euref dwarfed that of #leave campaign  surely no uk government or true british  patriot can stand behind a result engineered by a foreign power intent in weakening our country  #fbpe #waton #remain #stopbrexit 
so here’s another #leave voter who has now looked at who #brexit will actually benefit and has changed their mind  brexit cannot be for the many   just the few  those few being elite   rich already respect @wafu23rn for speaking out as a #remainernow  there are so many like you   
never forget to remind leavers that leading brexiters including farage  redwood and raab had no intention of respecting a narrow #remain victory  and were making it clear that their side would be calling for a 2nd referendum if #leave lost #stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit  
if honda go then so will toyota and nissan  those who maintain that we should still #leaveeu like to call themselves patriots  but #brexit is turning out to be the most treacherous and cowardly act of national destruction  #stopbrexitsavebritain #stopbrexit #fbpe 
suddenly  no deal  #brexit has reared it s head again   become a very real possibility  even though it was never #leave s stated intention to leave the eu without a deal and leavehq said it would be  so catastrophic  no responsible govt would do it   scary  demand #finalsay  
did you vote #leave on the promise of a great free trade deal which would retain the benefits of the eu membership but with less red tape well a no deal brexit would be a nightmare with a huge  in red tape   huge economic cost  regret your vote  say you’re a #remainernow 
well said @terrychristian on #bbcqt  #brexit is simple   only for simple people  struggling to recall richard tice or anyone else from #leaveeu telling british public about  benefits  of having irish border reinstated or uk financial sector losing eu trading passports  
so the uk region that voted strongest for #leaveeu is to be worst hit economically by #brexit  whilst remainer london  will be least hit  quelle surprise  as michel barnier might say  
if the referendum had proposed a specific form of brexit as the leave option then #leave would almost certainly have lost  #leave won because the option was 4 words which could mean almost anything to anyone  and what gave leave victory is causing chaos now  #stopbrexit #fbpe 
walk away now     and give the eu 30 days to reconsider their position #leaveeu #leave #nodeal #brexit 
it really is very  very simple  we cannot leave the #eu without causing significant damage to our economy  that has been proven beyond reasonable doubt  people need a chance to re evaluate their #leave positions now this crucial fact is known #stopbrexit#fbpe#brexit#remain 
the #leave campaign has almost been driven off social media as brexit supporters face #brexitreality  they ve run out of arguments and now face disaster  the #fbpe community and the #remainers now dominates the agenda and we re winning  #finalsay 
this guy is bang on the money  we didn’t vote #leave to regain some sovereignty  we voted to leave to regain all sovereignty  #brexit #bbcqt 
an appeal to all sane #british peoplewhether you voted #leave or #remain  can we please all agree that #peace in northern ireland is a bridge too far for #brexit  1   
we are actually starting to win this  #remain now has 10 point lead over #leave  keep going  don’t let up  march  write  lobby  persuade  time is short  but there is now light showing at the end of the tunnel   #brexit  
us patriots with irish    british roots please help our nations to break free of europe  the eu is dictatorial  corrupt and disfunctional #leave #irexit #brexit #euiscorrupt #eu 
we are looking for #european mods that want to #leaveeu and stand against #eurabia  dm me if that sounds like you    #mega #newright #brexit @euroskeptic 
q  do you want to leave the european union  p s  if you don t vote the right way i will keep posting this poll until you do #brexit #leave #leaveeu #remain @conservatives @uklabour @libdems @thesnp @ukip #ukpolitics #eupolitics 
some in the #leave camp are definitely getting concerned that #brexit isn t going to happen  the clearer it becomes that it s going to be an unmitigated disaster  there also appears to be a correlation between how abusive they are and the amount of racism in their twitter feeds 
i’ve spent many a christmas away from my home and family  reassured by the fact i was serving my country  what is see out of my window now  with the left wing  tree hugging  pc dipsticks gets to me  however #brexit for me makes it all worth while  dont let us down #leave #torys 
 #blair can’t see that he s the epitome of why many working class people voted #leave  a man elected pm to help the working class  helping only himself  to lucrative jobs  a 10 strong housing portfolio and a £30million fortune   #brexit #remain #jc4pm 
why  if you care about our democracy  regardless of your views on #brexit  the #cambridgeanalytica #facebook #voteleave scandal matters  my latest @expressandecho column  
excellent account of #brexit promises that the #government has quietly dropped   no doubt hoping that #leave voters won’t notice they’ve been lied to  
#brexit #leaveeu 
 #brexit #article50 #oneyeartobrexit #betteroffout #freedom #booeu 
one of #brexit s ironies is that those areas with the highest #leave vote will suffer most harm from #brexit  i hope political parties are being responsible   explaining the real risks to them  #carmanufacturing cld go  #sunderland #northeasthour#1yrarticle50 #countdowntobrexit 
#brexit   #leaveeu 
have been seriously thinking about what my daughter is going to say to me  twenty years from now if we don t save the uk   why didn t you protect me daddy   i think that s the way we re going to have to look at this  #brexit #iamtommyrobinson #freespeech #leaveeu 
#brexit   #leaveeu 
#voteleave was louise s  campaign     she has tried to revise vote leave s ties various hate groups who helped amplify the brexit message   
#andywigmore of #leaveeu said #brexit was a  petri dish  for #trump  at the digital culture media   sport select committee  chris wylie confirmed #brexit was a dry run for trump s election 
if there are any #leave voters still clinging on to their noxious dream brexit and claiming that they were not lied to  here are 11 #brexit promises the government quietly dropped 
this is a must read  more excellent work by @peterkgeoghegan   @adamramsay on dodgy spending by #leave   #dup  investigative  journalism at its best #brexit #fbpe 
devastating that the admission of cheating by the #leaveeu campaign in the #referendum are made by a #brexit campaigner  
#jacobreesmogg  some have told us that we were stupid   didn’t know what we were doing   in truth  the vote to #leave was made by those who believed in #democracy   #bbc #lbc #sky @conservatives #tory @conhome @theresa may #conservativeparty #tories #brexit 
three top barristers conclude   crime committed over #brexit vote   #euref #brexitwhistleblower #voteleave #beleave #cambridgeanalytica #aggregateiq 
so @isabeloakeshott demanded evidence from @carolecadwalla that there was a link between #leaveeu   #cambridgeanalytica   insisted herself there wasn t one      yet    who is this journalist writing in 2015      what s this    oh   #marr #marrshow @marrshow @andrewmarr9 #brexit  
 i wrote about the use of #bigdata a year ago in the @theneweuropean re  #voteleave  
i think this should read that #leave voters in england care more about #brexit than the  precious union  of @theresa may  s imagination   they would be happy to see n i and scotland break away  
brexit   when rule britannia became fool britannia   we always knew #voteleave was full of lies   now there may have been fraud as well  #cambridgeanalytica   a great democracy like britain s shouldn t be undermined like this   a full inquiry needed   criminal charges if proven  
translation  while the government  the bbc  almost every politician   most of the media knew the right thing was to vote remain  and connived to achieve it   a handle of people i disapprove of argued for #leave  we therefore must vote again  until we get the right answer  #brexit  
no one likes a cheat so when they get caught out there are consequences #balltampering #resign #stevesmith  as the truth emerges about #leave dodgy funding  abuse of social media  fake claims   phoney promises  let’s make sure the voters they cheated hold them to account #brexit 
poor isobel oakshot desperately trying to shut down @carolecadwalla on #marr over the #cambridgeanalytica story  she knows her #leave   #tory mates are in the soup  carole’s conclusion that electoral spending law needs looked at 100  right #brexit #fbpe 
leave eu have also been busy deleting records of their relationship with cambridge analytica  but don’t worry  we have screen shots  #cambridgeanalytica #brexit #leaveeu 
 in wwii  we fought tooth and nail so everyone can have freedom  now  the #uk people exercised their right and the fact of the matter is that  we voted to #leave the #eu   #bbcqt  #bbc #lbc #sky #brexit #tory @conhome #labour #libdems #eu #ukip #tories 
#nigelfarage   in december  concessions were made and here we are in march making yet more concessions  it s very difficult for #leave voters to think we re  going to get anything other than #brexit in name only     #bbc #lbc #sky #uk @conservatives #tory 
the margin that trump won in the places that he won was minuscule   like the #leave win  another clue that #bigdata micro analytics may have played a part  
#cambridgeanalytica is to politics what the doping scandal is to sport  to think how badly may has behaved to #remainers  when all along the #leave victory was only obtained through psychological manipulation  i am so angry  we need a radical re think of #brexit  govt may fall   
1 #leave campaigns were purposely based on lies
if i lived in #grimsby and relied on #fisheries for my living i d sue  hm government  the motto of #leave was  #takebackcontrol 
these images were  targeted  to those people whose harvested data showed they were the most susceptible to voting #leave 
from day 1  the whole #brexit negotiation has been a farce  it should have been barnier summoned to number10  put in a darkened room with @nigel farage  made to pay his bar bill  and given this handwritten note  #leaveeu #leadership 
whether it s sabotage or incompetence  may s government has folded pocket aces at every stage of the #brexit  negotiations   this latest capitulation must now trigger a leadership challenge  we need a brexiteer at the helm  #leaveeu #mogg4pm

good work pontypridd @uklabour calling for a #finalsay on #brexit   now the party leadership must catch up with its membership and the majority of its voters  they must start listening to all the #leave voters    abstainers  that have changed their minds and are #remainernow

it is very unlikely #leave would have gained a majority without the hate   lies in the #brexit press  so you @jeremycorbyn are legitimising and using that tide of right wing xenophobic hate   lies to push your version of #brexit 
#brexit ~ what happened to #remain s and #projectfear s recession  #unemployment down  #productivity up  #exports up  all at an inevitably testing time when the eu and its supporters are doing all they can to talk #britain down  thank god the majority voted to #leave  
davis says he doesn t trust the eu  so he will keep planning for a no deal all the way to march 29th 2019  personally  i wouldn t bother dealing with them  but i admire him for his persistence and positive outlook #brexit #leaveeu 
the press are the mouthpiece of the rich  not the people  put your sunnies on people   #brexit   #leaveeu 
i don t understand this  labour is supporting referendum implementation   not asking for a #finalsay  it is not the party of #remain   at all   it may have maj of members who support #remain     of voters  but it supports #leave   isn t changing   1 2 
#brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu #leave 
kirsty voted #leave but she’s feels she was lied to   now she sees the reality of #brexit and  particularly its ramifications for the #nhs  she has spoken out as a #remainernow@kirstystirrup2 as you say many others feel like you   we can get a #finalsayforall in uk’s interests  
#brexit #leaveeu #leave @theresa may @conservatives 
#nigelfarage  every single major player of that referendum said that if we #voteleave we are leaving the #singlemarket   by implication the #customsunion  unless we leave we will not be able to go global and get the benefits that ought to come from #brexit  
didn’t take #farage long to tell his first fib on #bbcqt when he said everyone in referendum campaign said we’d exit the #singlemarket if we #brexit   several prominent #leave campaigners said the opposite  
these outright lies are why farage and the #leave camp were able to get the gullible to vote for #brexit 
#retweet  @david cameron  there will not be another negotiation or another #referendum   if we vote to  leave  then we will #leave  #remainers case for another #eureferendum  void   #brexit #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @cchqpress @conservatives @theresa may

regardless of if you voted #leave or #remain in the 2016 referendum  it is the people who should make the final decision on #brexit  that is why we are demanding a #peoplesvote and will be marching to parliament on june 23rd  
i’d like to ask every #remoaner this question  #leaveeu #brexit  
why pay taxes  work hard  send our children to war and respect the law if we are only slaves to a system that disrespects our vote  #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu 
the north east of england voted #leave  fairly heavily  but people in the region are changing their minds   becoming #remainernow  majority of leavers are unhappy with the way #brexit is going and are concerned it will make them poorer #peoplesvote   
nottingham voted #leave 51  to 49  but its #remainernow this poll states that 1 in 11 notts leave voters have changed their minds on #brexit   with just 35  thinking the uk will be better off outside eu  52  think the reverse we must have a #peoplesvote 
here’s harris  he voted #leave but changed his mind on #brexit soon after #euref when he saw the racism   xenophobia the vote unleashed  he’s a #remainernow@harrismcannery1 thanks for speaking out   i see you’ve already written to your tory mp but how about your local paper

awkward conversation with #leave voter today   i grimaced at the  get rid of all immigrants after #brexit  comment but foolishly pointed out his irish wife is an immigrant  that made him really angry   apparently  i am a racist to call her an immigrant  
#leave voters think #brexit isn t turning out as well as they hoped  poll finds  
a gentle word to #leave leaders and supporters who blantantly used #immigration   told lies to win the #eu referendum and now turn their attacks on the current and former home secretary  stop it  no one is fooled by your hypocrisy  
is there anything involved in #brexit that wasnt a scam “twitter account from former #wetherspoon socialmedia team claims they were shut down   deleted because the firm was “in fear of being caught for data ‘misuse’” connected to #voteleave   
#brexit divorce cost uncertain  say national auditors  but likely to be around £35bn £39bn so much for the #leave lie that it would save money that would all go to the #nhs   
that moment when you get caught out on a little fib     #brexit #leaveeu

here’s a combo video of 5 #leave voters talking about why they changed their minds   are #remainernow   why they demand a #peoplesvote on the brexit deal followers will be familiar with @jdlarwood @hughnorris7   @will dryofoc but 2 new faces voices too 
it’s not just the revelations that the #leaveeu campaign cheated  it’s the fact that the emerging #brexitreality bears no resemblance to what they promised  no wonder there is a clamour for a #peoplesvote on the actual #brexit deal   
with every passing month  week  day  the sheer arrogance  and blatant lies of those who believed they were simply untouchable  continue to be revealed #brexitscam #leaveeu #voteleave #cambridgeanalytica #truthwilloutvia @carolecadwalla

the bigger scandal is gina miller funded by soros  the 3 times overspend of #remain campaign  wheeling obama out  the imf  the boe   armageddon which never happened   get over your whining   #leave won  we are leaving   no1 was manipulated   we made our minds up b4 referendum  
 @theresa may  @borisjohnson and @michaelgove must all resign  this scandal is already massive  and it s only just beginning   #brexit #stopbrexit #voteleave #eureferendum #overspending #fraud 
#brexitshambles update qcs appointed by the @commonscms say there is a  prima facie case  that #voteleave broke uk electoral laws in the eu referendumthe result was likely illegally obtained #stopbrexit #bbcaq @lbc #finalsay 
the more #brexit seems doomed to abject failure  the more the racists and xenophobes seem to be getting angrier and nastier about those of us who oppose it  why is it that the #leave camp seems to have been so deeply infiltrated by these bile filled hate mongers  
i wonder if the 250 celebrities who wrote their daft letter to brainwash kids to vote remain will be voting for tony blair s #toxicswampparty  #brexit #leaveeu 
nearly 1 million more people were granted eu citizenship in 2016  who knows how many last year     all with carte blanche to come to the uk while we re twiddling our thumbs during this barmy transition period #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu 
theresa may     you re giving away too much #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu #hardbrexit 
some tory politicians claim that people were well informed before the #brexit vote  they won t  they were radically misinformed on some of the main issues  massively to the advantage of #leave a vote based on misinformation is scarcely democratic  #stopbrexit #voteeu 
significant that a key #leave campaigner now thinks there is no democratic mandate for #brexit   
also interesting to reflect on what #leave voter #chriswylie said on #marr today   a man who despite being canadian had a say on the fate of our #eu27 citizens because he s from a commonwealth country  whereas #eu27 citizens themselves did not  #brexit is trashing #britishvalues  
blair  germany will stop brexit and force britain to stay in the eu well  i suppose germany is about as an elected representative as the house of lords bring on the next battle #brexiteers#brexit #leaveeu #democracyindanger

#voteleave promised that we wouldn’t lose any funding as a result of #brexit failing to deliver this promise breaks the 2016 referendum mandate

 if a general election elects a gov on a  leave ticket  i would abide by it  in 2017 general election 90  of mps were elected on a manifesto that promised to #leave tory gov    dup who support them  were both elected promising to deliver #brexitwhy not abide by the result jon   
support in the community falling apart  choosing to have less cash to care for the elderly  almost inevitably you   less for the nhs  education  housing  transport  justice  food standards   police patrols  is an odd definition of  taking back control  #remain #leave #brexit 
in 2017 90  of the mps were elected on a manifesto promising to make #brexit happen they should stop all the faffing about and honour their promise if they don t  the 17 4 million who voted #leave will vote them out at the next election  
shameful that the assessment   views #brexit of people running vital british businesses like #pharma which employ thousands of workers are routinely ignored by media  these great firms will shift production  jobs  when we #leave #eu unless we secure #customsunion #singlemarket

during her brexit campaign louise mensch amplified neo nazi accounts like this one redcoat  louise used white nationalist accts who were conduits for her #voteleave xenophobic populism which was the weapon brexiteers used to sway voters  trump did the same

anyone else see it         pinko   berky    #brexit #leaveeu 
rees mogg  sir nick has missed the point when we leave #eu we will be out of the protectionist customs union customs union applies tariffs of 22  on food   over 11  on clothing   footwear that s why it s so essential to #leave customs union  #brexit 
great to see you working cross party to make the case that mps parliament must take control of our #brexit future  there is a consensus and way to deliver #leave that secures our economic future   peace in n ireland  #efta #eea #customsarrangement #customspartnership #getonwithit 
 @nickboles we’re representing views of british business   tuc  it’s time for realistic solutions to deliver #leave whilst doing the least harm to our economy   maintaining peace in n ireland  as #davidmiliband observes we cannot he held to ransom by hard #brexit ideologues  
#brexit has turned out to be a shit sandwich and the #leave camp know know it  hence they re crawling from under their rocks to blame #remainers sorry chaps  it s shit sandwich of your making  you re going to have to man up and swallow it yourselves  enjoy  
something is shifting in the #brexit #leave sphere  my auntie from east anglia who has avoided the topic for the past 2 years asked me today whether how we would be affected by brexit and acknowledged how bad things are going  we had an actual conversation  i see change

jacob rees mogg  so either uk govt or irish govt has to decide that it wants to implement a hard border both govts have said they do not wish to  so who is going to do this is it some sort of phantom govt that s going to do this  #brexit #leave #eu 
we knew the #brexit #referendum was  narrowly  won on the basis of a pack of lies and with a questionable franchise  we recently learned about data abuse  and now we know the #leave campaign cheated on the spending    
a former #brexit supporter and #leave campaigner changes his mind and has the courage to explain why    @will dryofoc

another russian #facebook ad  dated 14 01 2016  and targeting fb users in the us  and  the uk  remember fb told @commonscms they only had evidence of £1 of russian money spent in the uk     would have #voteleave or #leaveeu balked at using this type of propaganda  answer  no  
had a great time as joint guest of the day on @daily politics  brexit means leaving the customs union   it s time to get on with it  #bbcdp #takecontrol 
just one example of thousands of russian #facebook ads groups   it s no great leap to imagine this propaganda translated to  issues  pushed by the likes of #voteleave   #leaveeu prior to the #euref  @damiancollins @carolecadwalla @profcarroll @peterjukes @podehaye @fascinatorfun

if you cheat in the olympics  you lose your medal  if you cheat in an exam  you don t get your grade  if you cheat in a referendum or election  you get to walk away with a minuscule fine and slap on the wrist  #leaveeu 
be under no illusion   these are serious charges and include personal and corporate fraud  how can @theresa may not question the legitimacy of the referendum  #leaveeu 
it s official #leaveeu cheated during the eu referendum  if you add #voteleave lies   #cambridgeanalytica and #aiq data saga into the mix we can conclude there was nothing democratic about the outcome of the #euref vote  #brexit was and is a fraud   
i m not sure how many times i can say this before it starts to lose its meaning  the referendum result is now unequivocally null and void  we must not leave the #eu  #leave cheated and lied  the majority of uk citizens now want to stay in the eu  clear enough  
has house of lords apologised to the eu yet for the #brexit vote have the lords of lords apologised yet for 17 4m of us who obviously did not know what we were doing when we voted to #leave it is good job we have those wise people in the house of lords to correct our mistakes 
remainers are trying to bully gavin williamson into changing his mind   backing may s awful customs plan what they seem to forget is even if he does not only is his career over  the people still voted #brexitbritish people have rejected #eu rule#leave 
uk voted to #leave all #eu customs arrangements     may  needs to listen to her parties   her cabinet who have given a very strong message on this issue she may not realise it  but we are on the brink here this could be the end of theresa may #brexit 
if you google  #brexit benefits  how come you just get some forlorn right wing newspaper articles from 2017 about wooly nothingness  surely  if it was such a good idea  the #leave camp would have the media littered with multitudes of benefits by now      unless there aren t any  
the #leave camp garnered 37  of the electorates vote in the referendum  sensing a hard sell in the hoc  may called a general election on a #brexit ticket  the country replied by removing her majority  how on earth is #brexit therefore still called the will of the people  
#piersmorgan hits out at the same old pro #euro campaigners banging on about #europe   explains why we must now get on #brexit  “we had a #referendum  everybody had a chance to have their say and we voted democratically to #leave ”  #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc 
the vote that  @conservatives have now is largely a #leave vote they have an expectation  #brexit has cast a shadow people say that it s not mentioned on the doorstep  but it was such a very big choice so lab and cons have matched each other point to point   #johncurtice #wato

that #brexit uk was merely a  test run  for putin  trump and #cambridgeanalytics is a measure of how unimportant they consider us that various #leave campaigns so openly colluded with one another is a measure of how weak our policing and legal systems are  #stopbrexit pic twitter com 2ylwu9opl1

huge turnout at the #peoplesvote  march  which is not a surprise given that #brexit is looking to be costly  damaging and nothing like what was promised by the #leave campaign and brexit ministers   
jacob rees mogg  june 23  the anniversary of brexit referendum vote  will be remembered as a big moment of change in british history as big as the great reform act of 1832  victory at waterloo in 1815 or the glorious revolution of 1688 #brexit #leave #eu

jo cox was murdered on the 17th june 2016  the referendum campaigns were halted for three days out of respect  all campaigns were told to stop the time stamp on this message  7 46pm on 17 06 16 #euref #brexit #voteleave #leaveeu #beleave #finalsay #finalsayforall #peoplesvote 
and those investigations uncovered exactly how #leaveeu and #voteleave won  unexpectedly   they broke the law  pumped £600 000 illegally into illegal social media adverts  even ignoring the 3 day moratorium due to the murder of jo cox  that s how they won  unexpectedly   #brexit  
1  suddenly there s talk about disaster socialism  to me this is an equivalence thing from the #leave campaign  and to be clear  if #brexit happens and the capitalist fundamentalists takeover there will be no future socialism  because there will be no elections  no democracy    
funny how many of those currently criticising the bbc s coverage of #brexit and #voteleave were happy to mock corbynites when we had similar complaints about the bbc s coverage of corbyn  
my guess here is that @bbcnews won t admit that #voteleave broke the law until people are physically arrested  charged and found guilty in court  so  just now they re only prepared to use the word  allegations   i m in no way defending them because #voteleavebrokethelaw#brexit 
the #voteleave #brexit campaign been evidenced to have been a criminal conspiracy backed by dark money and the #altright    orchestrated by a lot of posh boys   backed by the daily mail   notice the similarity  
before the #eu #referendum  #johnmajor said it s  not politically credible  to hold another referendum after a #vote to #leave  couldn t agree more    #rightthefirsttime   #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty #tory @andreajenkyns #tories 
there’s fake news  electoral fraud  rule breaking  all ‘cheating’   whether you voted #remain or #leave  don’t let the privileged british establishment duck the blame for their mess  demand a vote on whether to accept or reject their poor deal no deal #brexit

important to understand crux of #brexit is that #uk voted in #euref for the #magnacarta narrative identity it shares with #canzuk  not #eu’s charlemagnian alternative  it was a choice between two possible futures  #leave won   #remain lost  it’s time to #respecttheresult #ukpoli 
pro eu campaigners posing as  removals ltd  offer to help @borisjohnson vacate his grace and favour london home   more than two weeks after he resigned as foreign secretary  #brexit #leaveeu #remainread the full story here   
not on your nelly   there is no way we #brexiteers will accept ignoring the referendum which said  would be implemented    one hell of a stink would result if this was to happen   we voted #leave and it must be delivered 
remember  #voteleave campaigners repeatedly said that #brexit would be dead easy and simple    
that this sham of a govt is considering  stockpiling food   medicines  in the event of “no deal”   in britain  in 2018  demonstrates just how locked into dangerous tunnel vision they are brexit was based on cheating  #voteleavebrokethelaw #voteleave 
we voted #leave because we didn t want to be ruled by unelected bureaucrats   now we have eu loving unelected bureaucrat olly robbins placed in sole charge of #brexit negotiations by the useless may   i despair  
   because @jeremycorbyn and @johnmcdonnellmp are old style hard left no deal brexiteers  they will sell out “remainers” and sensible #leave voters who  want a #brexit that protects jobs  prosperity and peace in n ireland   
#nadinedorries   is this some sort of bullying  do we say to the #british people  we don t trust you on your last vote  you ve got to vote again    we had the #referendum  #leave won   therefore we have to implement  leave     #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome 
#euref was to determine if the #british people wish to #remain or #leave the #eu majority voted to #leave all mps obligated to support the government in honouring the result of the #euref mutual self interest will secure #uk   #eu post #brexit trade deal #allabouttrust

john redwood  thank the irish pm for showing us how absurd project fear is there are international agreements allowing overflights irish planes will still fly over uk once we have left eu   uk planes will still fly over ireland   #brexit #leave #eu 
#tories #cheating to get votes through parliament  tory cabinet on the board of the #leave campaign that cheated to obtain the #brexit result how can #may continue as #pm unless she sacks those conspiring to #cheat in both votes  by doing nothing she is condoning their actions  
#labour calls for inquiry into ministers’ actions during eu #referendum  now that the #voteleave campaign that they ran has be found to have broken the law  
check out my article on @infactsorg there must be many #brexiters who bought holiday homes who’d find this interesting #brexitreality #brexit #leaveeu #stopbrexitsavebritain brits with holiday homes across eu are at risk from brexit @infactsorg 
fraudulent  #remain was backed by government funding  plenty of working class people voted for #leave  you all said the uk economy would fall apart once #brexit was announced  here we are with the best unemployment figures for 43 years and 21 consecutive quarters of gdp growth  
 the result in favour of #brexit was obtained  at least in part  by breaching electoral law  it cannot be allowed to stand   another vote now essential   says scottish brexit minister following #voteleave revelations 
if you have signed therescind article 50 if #voteleave has broken electoral laws regarding 2016 referendum petitionand as #voteleavebrokethelaw perhaps you would also consider signing the #peoplesvotepetitionplease sign   please repeatedly retweet  
boris  after 18 months of stealthy retreat    mr speaker  it is not too late to save brexit we have time in these negotiations we have changed tack once and we can change again #brexit #leave #eu via @guidofawkes 
a reality check  leave spent £13 5 million  remain spent £19 million  that s not including the £9 million the government spent of taxpayers’ money on their pro remain booklet  so take the biased electoral commission with a very large pinch of salt #brexit #leave 
4 000 disgruntled tory brexit voters joined ukip since may s stitch up 2 500 new #ukip members in the last week alone all because eu  associate membership  is not leaving the eu   17 4 million voters voted to leave   so leave #brexit #leave #eu go #wto 
yet another “honest mistake” by this govt in normal parlance   cheating  what this govt will do to push through brexit   #brexitmeansbrexit #voteleave #voteleavebrokethelaw 
#bbc  state of play  today  @electoralcommuk confirmed #voteleave  led by the  big beasts  of the #tory party  cheated  lied   broke the law in order to upend democracy   trigger the biggest constitutional crisis in modern times yet  not one single utterance on @bbcnewsnight 
it s not about labour or tories it s about whether our government  whichever party is in power  actually respects the democratic voice of the people #brexit means #leave 
“   a result won with cheating and law breaking can not  be said to represent the will of the people in june 2016” please sign and share this petition  @hackneyabbott   please  we need you and @uklabour to step up and speak up   the referendum must be annulled #brexit #voteleave 
so  even though brexit referendum was advisory the advisory result of it must be implemented against all reason  but because it was advisory any associated wrongdoing  cannot be challenged in the courts   #voteleave really are having their cake and eating it  
excellent thread from @adamwagner1 on why it will be very difficult to legally challenge #euref result on basis of #voteleave cheating  i agree with him that ultimately what we do about this is a political rather than a legal decision #brexit #fbpe 
by cheating on spending rules #voteleave broke the law  but the referendum was advisory  so the courts likely cannot intervene  so  it is up to parliament to decide if the result is void  we need a vote in this house   
the reason why the #voteleave cheating is so important is because it s not some minor technicality  that money was used to buy advertising that sought to deliberately mislead the public into thinking they would be better off with #brexit  they won t  it s a compounded fraud 
i ll just leave this here shall i  you outspent us 2 1  had the machinery of government behind you and still lost  #brexit #voteleave 
the magnificent @nsoames in the wake of the #electoralcommission report on #leave gross and illegal over spend has just called for the #eu #referendum to be re run  i agree with him  
brexit summary brexit voters wanted more control but brexit is leaving us bound by eu law but no longer influencing itreferendum wasn t just filled with lies but #voteleave broke the law3 months left to negotiate and the government still doesn t know what it wants 
very good point  if vote leave broke the law to win the referendum  and the government is pursuing brexit knowing that  they re aiding and abetting the original crime by ensuring that it bears  poisoned  fruit     accessories after the fact  #voteleave 
if you have any respect for the integrity of british democracy  you cannot find out that the biggest political shift in half a century was achieved by criminal action and just shrug your shoulders there must be a people s vote on the brexit deal #voteleave 
it s official  #voteleave lied   cheated in the referendum  so   engineer  designer  ux  data scientist  social influencer  the great british hack off will aim at brexit   july 21 22  london  by @techforuk   @bestforbritain #gbhackoff #fbpe pls share  
yesterday  no deal  brexit became the most likely outcome  today we see confirmed that #voteleave broke the electoral law and has  therefore  now been fined and referred to the policy  so when will responsible politicians stop this madness  
if only there was some evidence of massive over spending by the remain campaign then i am sure the electoral commission would investigate it     #voteleave #brexit #tuesdaythoughts 
disgraceful that vince cable and tim farron did not show up to debate and vote on brexit  last night they had the opportunity to vote against theresa mays brexit plan  they have misled their party and voters and should be ashamed of themselves  #voteleave 
jacob rees mogg is working theresa may from the back#voteleave cheated yet the #brexit result still standsthe scottish tory mps voted against @scotparl having any saywhy is scotland still in this uk union  this is not democratic  #indyref2 
#voteleave clearly doesn t give a crap about the integrity of british democracy  we believe brexit voters do  so surely you agree that there should at least be a people s vote on the deal   
i’ve never been a ‘let’s have a second referendum’ person but surely if #voteleave have been fined and referred to the police for breaking the law over their #brexit campaign there needs to be another one or this whole brexit thing stopped  
how many #voteleave mps have money in off shore tax havens  is this why they want #brexit because eu was going to clamp down on them  asking for a friend  
all the headlines about #voteleave being fined £61k for breaching spending limits feels like a storm in a teacup when you compare it to the £9m of taxpayers money spent by david cameron on sending #brexit project fear leaflets to each household   
i warned in february 2016 that #voteleave was not the right vehicle for the referendum given ⁦@matthew elliott⁩’s penchant for dodgy behaviour  today their groups were fined by the electoral commission and referred to the police  
#voteleave broke the law  have been fined and referred to the police  the referendum should be declared null and void  not only was it advisory anyway  the campaign was illegal  why on earth should the uk #brexit in light of this  #stopbrexit 
#soubry    nobody voted #leave on the basis that somebody with a gold plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them   #brexit 
#isabeloakeshott corners #remoaner #dominicgrieve on his anti #brexit meddling   you stood on a #manifesto which said we would #leave the #eu  the #singlemarket  and the #customsunion    #maymustgo #bbc #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty @dcbmep 
andrew marr   it’s fake sovereignty  it’s not real sovereignty in theory  we can go to brussels and say ‘do you mind if we change these rules’ in practice  once the common rulebook is in place  we can’t  not in the real world  #brexit #leave #eu 
pm says we can #leave in name only  or we don t #leave at all  there is a third way theresa you could deliver the #brexit we voted for no more single mkt or customs union no ecjno open door immigrationno payments to euget all our fish backno more eu laws   regulations  
polls carried out before david cameron announced the #eu ref showed #leave were trailing by up to 13 points  nobody wanted it now  hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition asking for a #peoplesvote and it is being denied  this is wrong #brexit#finalsay 
a clear and consistent 10 point swing from #leave to #remain giving remain a 5 point lead @theresa may  at what point do we get a #peoplesvote   or are referendums only held to settle arguments within the #tory party #brexit 
 @markdrakeford is right a hard #brexit  that makes wales poorer  that creates barriers to trade and collaboration  has no mandate join us to oppose this shambolic mess #takecontrol and demand a #peoplesvote on the final #brexitdeal  
please listen whether you voted #leave or #remain  this gave me goosebumps  of total fear  who is going to answer that question  what happens the day after  #brexit  
a #british #donaldtrump would have put britain first in #brexit negotiations  unlike the #traitor #theresamay who holds #leave voters in #contempt and has appeased #brussels at every turn with her treacherous actions  #brexit  #bbc #sky #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty

1 2  the investigation into #cambridgeanalytica is tugging at a loose thread that is connected to the very fabric of our society  this scandal isn t just about #facebook  #trump  #brexit  #voteleave etc  it is about the way corporate power subverts our democracy to its own ends  pic twitter com xcibj5dnmi 
it is clear the #euref result was achieved by massive illegal data fraud   breaking the law in multiple ways by #voteleave   #leaveeuhow long will it take before @bbcnews stops respecting fraud   illegal acts on our democracy #voteleavebrokethelaw #voteleavecheated #brexit  
from a leading #qc interpreting the phrase  ‘the #commonrulebook ’ every  person who voted to #leave should read this and understand its meaning   the #chequers turd proposal is to #remain in the #eu and we will be in a far worse position  than we are now  #maymustgo #brexit #uk 
over 12 months there have been no fewer than 35 opinion polls carried out  with about 60 000 participants  how many of these have shown a lead for #leave that s right  two  out of 35 no longer the  will of the people #peoplesvote#noconfidence#brexit#brexitshambles 
i don t care why you voted to #leave the #eu in june 2016  if you still support #brexit knowing everything you know now  then you want to harm the #uk   #standup2brexit #stopbrexit #fbpe @remainingkind @loubinwally @lunaperla @stopbrexitmarch @acgrayling @marieannuk

if you haven’t already  please follow @standup4brexit and please make sure you’re asking your mp to respect the referendum and to #standup4brexit this campaign will save more than brexit  it’ll save the u k  from marxism  so please get involved and back it  
absolutely correct shahmir  also it is no coincidence craig mackinlay was part of the forerunner of #voteleave   conservatives for britain  set up by matthew elliott in june  15  cfb was headed by co chairs campbell bannerman and steve baker  of course steve baker   #brexitscam 
the @telegraph’s europe editor peter foster has claimed that no one has answered his key questions on brexit“in fact  they’ve been answered ad nauseam  sadly  some people are just not listening” say @jlongworthlml   iain duncan smith#standup4brexit 
amongst all the rhetoric and posturing from the #leave campaign  i ve never heard an economic case for #brexit having been made  lots of soundbites  but no actual numbersand no case for #brexit delivering a tightening of border controls  if indeed they re neededit s pointless 
 6 6  so it turns out young grimes s  beleave  was not the first teenager s  fake  company formed with a singular aim by the execs at the very top of the #voteleave campaign  perhaps darren can take some solace from being  given  £675 000 by dominic cummings     or maybe not    pic twitter com x8pt3zlsoa 
 5  of course   lyon shephard web solutions  was a bogus company  set up by  #voteleave solely to enable two teenagers to interrupt a pm s key speech to business leaders  the cheap but effective stunt was defended at the time by none other than vote leave s daniel hannan     
you know anna soubry is constantly on about a second referendum has she forgotten that she said that she accepts the referendum result and people are moving on i m confused  maybe she will change her mind again and #standup4brexit be a shame if you spread this 
‘@astonmartin ceo @andyataston has said today that any tariffs that came in as a result of wto #brexit would  even itself out  and that britain s economy would benefit from a weaker poundit’s time to ditch the shackles of #chequers and #standup4brexit

 the government is delivering a brexit for the people #chequers means people movementcontinued acceptance of eu rulesa backstop that would allow northern ireland to be separated from the rest of the uk be sure to support #standup4brexit and reject the #chequersplan 
 the government is delivering a brexit for the people are you kidding me  the #chequersplan breaches each of the three red lines  it fails to give control on borders  laws rules and it provides a backstop that would destroy the uk union please  support #standup4brexit 
the government is delivering nothing  chequers isn’t brexit  it’s a continuation of the status quo wrapped up in some fancy jargon  mps need to #standup4brexit or corbyn will be the next pm  marxism is a heavy price to pay for a deal no one wants  
hi @andrewrosindell we have an feeling that you’re pro #brexit  we wondered if you would join the growing number of mps to #standup4brexit and join our grassroots campaign to reject the #chequersplan it would be great if you joined us  we’d love a video from you too  
can i remind you george  nobody voted for a #conservative #brexit  @uklabour  @thegreenparty  @libdems  @dupleader  @thesnp or @ukip #brexit the choice on #euref ballot paper was #leave or #remain @theresa may s #chequers brexit means we #remain in the #eu   is unacceptable  
i haven t had a #poll yet on the #bigissue of the day         so here goes #poll #brexitpoll #remainpoll if there were another vote how would you vote #brexit  #leave #remain #ivevotedonce #inevervote  #europeanunion #eu #ukvotes 
i ll thinl you ll find that the promise of an in out referendum on our membership of the eu was an essential part of our 2015 win  if we don t honour it it will lead to inevitable defeat at the next election #brexit #standup4brexit 
if you haven’t already follow @standup4brexit and please make sure you’re asking your mp to respect the referendum and to #standup4brexit chequers leads to corbyn and we all know how damaging that will be to the u k  
why is nobody on the #leave side trumpeting the benefits of leaving the eu  before the referendum they were happy to spin any old lie to sell the dog  now they are silent  could it be because every lie has now been exposed and the dog has already died #stopbrexitsavebritain 
so  the dirty  rotten #leave campaign is to be run all over again   even without another referendum  all the same old lies used to win the #eureferendum will no doubt be trotted out again  is the #remain movement ready  share @jon danzig’s commentary link   
remember when we were promised that #brexit would mean control of our borders  money   laws then we got the #chequersplan which delivers none of itwant the #brexit we were promised  then please support @standup4brexit   tell your mp#standup4brexit 
it is now patently clear that the promises and the assurances made by the #leave campaign were never deliverable  so why on earth is the government pressing on with the bankrupt #brexit project  the lives of millions will be negatively impacted  nobody wins  everybody loses  
hi @mike fabricant we know that you re pro #brexit  how about you support our #standup4brexit campaign to reject the #chequersplan  we re grassroots   have pledges of support from the likes of @patel4witham @andreajenkyns @bbradleymp   others we d love to have you onboard 
longworth fumes ‘#chequersplan is a massive fraud on the electorate’ as leave means leave plots  the battle of #brexit  tory donors are starting to ask   why should we continue to support this party that is trying to sell us a pup #standup4brexit 
sadly it s clear that there are millions of racists in the uk and #brexit has given them carte blanche to say what they want with impunity many that voted to #leave did so as they had genuine concerns the tipping point was the racist minority  leaving gives them what they want

hi @timloughton you may have seen our grassroots #standup4brexit campaign where we are asking mps to to support rejection of the #chequersplan because #chequers is not #brexit will you join the growing number of mps like @patel4witham who have pledged to back our campaign   
what  that referendum based on cheating  where #voteleave broke electoral law  #voteleavebrokethelaw 
we pledge our support to the @standup4brexit campaign  it is vital that we deliver the #brexit the country voted for  take action as outlined below   let your mp know your views  #standup4brexit 
“we will only sign up to a deal that respects the referendum result”can we take from that that you support ditching the deeply unpopular #chequersplan we’re looking forward to receiving your pledge to #standup4brexit  
hi @nigelmp we don t know if you have seen us yet  but we have a feeling that you will agree with our #standup4brexit campaign to reject the #chequersplan in favour of the #brexit we were promised we would love to see you join the growing list of mps who have pledged support   
it is awfully good of those people over at @peoplesvote uk to remind everyone that the majority of the british public want us to honour the referendum and just get on with brexit  cheers guys #brexit #standup4brexit 
exactly  so jeremy  please can you tell us why you are backing this absolute sellout called the #chequersplan  it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever  it is not the #brexit that we were promised at lancaster house  #chequers is not brexit#standup4brexit 
if jeremy hunt doesn t believe no deal is better than a bad deal  then he is unfit to be foreign secretary  we need cabinet ministers who respect the will of the british people and believe in britain   not project fear pessimists  #standup4brexit #brexit  
good news   brussels says brexit will not be discussed at eu summit there is nothing to discuss we are leaving 29th march 2019   eu are the weakest link   goodbye #brexit #leave #eu 
hey there @dkshrewsbury we wondered if you would #standup4brexit and join our grassroots campaign to reject the #chequersplan  because as you know  #chequers is not #brexit a lot of mps already support us  it would be wonderful to get a pledge of support from you    
project fear planning meeting   we told them they d starve to death and get super herpes and we re still leaving the eu  what next   tell them their football team will be absolutely rubbish   like burnley   worse  #brexit #projectfear #standup4brexit 
hi conorwe seem to have missed that 2nd referendum too    in the meantime let’s get on with delivering the result of the first one  will you join your colleagues   such as @patel4witham @stevebakerhw   @andreajenkyns   in pledging to #standup4brexit 
hi @abridgen  we know that you are pro #brexit so we cannot figure why you have not replied to my tweet earlier in the week will you join the other mps and join our #standup4brexit campaign to reject the #chequersplan i   the other activists would love it if you did  
setting the breathtaking hypocrisy   fuckwittery of this tweet aside    a reminder that stuart was  along with gove  johnson  elliott   cummings  privy to   responsible for  the deepest  darkest recesses of a mendacious  xenophobic and ultimately illegal #voteleave scam campaign  
more and more we hear about how the eu don t want the uk to diverge from its rules and  gain a competitive advantage   that s the point  sticking to brussels rules puts us at a disadvantage  we need to diverge #brexit #standup4brexit 
chris grayling admits that theresa may s #brexit plans are  not easy to sell  to the public that s an understatement so why is he  a supposed #brexiteer  still supporting this shambles time to #chuckchequers#standup4brexit 
#projectfear is nothing but an attempt to scare the public into accepting #chequers #brinoit didn’t work during the referendum and it won’t work now#standup4brexit 
“details of eu meeting that blew away may s brexit plan were suppressed before crucial chequers summit”in summary the original plan would have hurt the eu so @theresa may and @ollyrobbins came up with the #chequersplan  oh dear #standup4brexit 
the eu’s #brexit negotiators fear that they are being bugged by the british secret service  the telegraph understandsnot only are they now running scared of a no deal brexit  they are showing paranoia on a cold war scale#standup4brexit  via @telegraph 
theresa may is preparing a sell out on freedom of movement after brexit and is close to agreeing to a system which is almost identical to the current deal  mep claimsso much for may s oft repeated lie that under her #brexit meant brexit#standup4brexit 
“eurosceptic tories are planning to defy @theresa may by publishing their own alternative blueprint for #brexit”“a paper setting out a framework is set to be published by the european research group of mps and peers next month”#standup4brexit 
“stop worrying   prepare for a no deal brexit  that s how we ll get the best deal possible”says the ⁦@telegraph⁩ as i’ve just said to somebody  there is another way than the #chequersplan  it’s called negotiating #standup4brexit 
which blindingly bonkers unworkable  unviable  and unachievable barking mad brexit are you asking people to stand up for  #standup2brexit not #standup4brexit 
theresa may and the eu hope to dupe the voters with their next #brexit fudge we are not stupid thoughthe public weren t fooled by the #chequersplan they won t be taken in by may s next  inevitable  #brexit capitulation#standup4brexit via @telegraph 
“henry viii managed to pull us out of a distant european bureaucracy    english independent mindedness has served us pretty well in defending our freedoms  today’s brexit is about precisely the same thing”#standup4brexit 
 @theresa may is drawing up a plan to keep key european union rules for longer after #brexit in order to break the deadlock in negotiations  a move that risks angering euroskeptics in her party  now do you see why we need to #standup4brexit folks  
brexiteers plan to challenge may next month by publishing their own positive blueprint for #brexit  which allows for a possible canadian style free trade agreementthe paper is expected to have the backing of 60 to 80 conservative mps#standup4brexit 
hi there @andrew4pendle  we have tweeted you a few times to ask if you will #standup4brexit and reject the #chequersplan  we’re upset that we have not heard from you please can you let us know if you will back our campaign and tell us if you will respect the #brexit vote   
mp for #aberdeensouth @rossthomson mp pledges to #standup4brexit because “the #chequersplan does not deliver the #brexit that the people of the united kingdom voted for” if you want your mp to #standup4brexit make your voice heardfind their email here   
party conference is going to be an interesting affair       conservative brexiteers plan to challenge theresa may directly by publishing their own “positive” blueprint for a #brexit  #standup4brexit 
 bloc of 50 moderate tory mps forms to challenge the brexiteers amid fears of party split so  the question should be  why are they not going to #standup4brexit and why are they not respecting democracy #brexit 
a simply brilliant #standup4brexit pledge video from the great @andreajenkyns“we need to believe in britain  #standup4brexit  god save the queen ” #chequers is not #brexit   #andreajenkyns #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc @borisjohnson @conhome @conservatives @dcbmep

very insulting of phillip lee to call the majority of party members  brextremists   a desire to leave the eu is what the majority of members want  either he should accept that or go the same way as sophie and join the lib dems #brexit #standup4brexit 
report by @mandrews star of an online poll for the shropshire star  shows the county  voted #leave in 2016  now supports a #peoplesvote yet another sign the tide has turned when will may   corbyn face up to the politcal reality on #brexit   
 the immediate consequences of a “no deal” #brexit in march could be worse for the #eu than for britain  senior brussels figures have said  so  why do we have this #chequersplan which is an outright capitulation #standup4brexit 
our @staffmoortories team had a stand at manifold show  everyone who visited us was very angry about the pm s #chequersplan  they didn t see it as real #brexit   now prefer no deal  staffordshire moorlands voted 64 7  to leave the eu so let s #standup4brexit  #chequersmeanscorbyn

in 1975 we gave our consent to a minor operation called a common market  then over 41 years a whole series of major operations took place  single european act  maastricht  amsterdam  nice and lisbon without ever getting our consent and we then voted leave#brexit #standup4brexit 
hi @jacob rees mogg now  of course we know the ins and outs of your position on #brexit    but will you give our campaign your support and publicly pledge to #standup4brexit  the british public would be extremely grateful  #chequers is not brexit

gabby  we had a  people s vote  on 23 june  2016  the #leave side won 52  48   a total of approximately 17 4 million  and a winning majority of 1 3 million  since then  the eu withdrawal bill has been passed and the uk will leave the eu on 29 march 2019 at 11pm  #brexit  
some tory mps will boycott the conservative party conferencethe remainers among them who have been trying to sabotage #brexit are too chicken to talk face to face with grassroots members angry over the #chequersplansuch cowardice #standup4brexit 
in 1975 young people voted en masse for  yes  to stay in the common market  in 2016 those 20 and 30 something pro europeans had become the 60 and 70 year olds who turned out in droves to vote leave people become more eurosceptic as they grow older #brexit #standup4brexit 
“@mariacaulfield has pledged her support to #standupforbrexit – a campaign to raise awareness of the discontent among voters over the chequers deal – calling on the government to #chuckchequers ask your mp to #standup4brexit too#chequers is not brexit

i admire   respect @deborahmeaden so much 4speaking up  really on behalf others  because she’s financially secureso many r self serving but more r speaking out now  #brexit dominates my thinking but wonder how so many #leave politicians just don’t care 
let s be honest this govt is cancelling all police leave from next march onwardsbecause it knows the most rabid #leave voters will riotwhen they see how badly #brexit turns out for them  these people will burn down mps  homes  set fire to their cars and punish their lies   
thanks to @henrysmithuk for this great video pledging his support for #standup4brexit  and his reasons whywe need more mps like henry  who are prepared to stand up against the #chequersplan in order to ensure that the #brexit we were promised is delivered  
 we can harden #brexit after we leave the european union  says deputy chairman of the #conservative party there we have it  they want us to accept the #chequersplan knowing it fails to meet what was promised  it is time to #standup4brexit 
“we will not have truly left the european union if we are not in control of our own laws” @theresa may   lancaster houseask your mp to #standup4brexit and support mrs may’s original promises #chequers is not #brexit  let’s get brexit back on track   
“revealed  detail of exclusive russian deal offered to arron banks in brexit run up”brexit must be stopped  it is based on lies  cheating   law breaking  #voteleavebrokethelaw#voteleave 
in the last 24 hrs  the @conservatives campaign against the one man who could rescue #brexit has demonstrated beyond doubt that  right from the start  may s premiership was always about deceiving voters and delivering remain  #maymustgonow #standup4brexit 
first letters to party members  then eu makes a new offer  then downing st chooses to stoke the boris row  anecdotal yes  but watch the #brexit pea very carefully  this could be a moment of danger for leavers  #maymustgonow #standup4brexit 
i agreed to be interviewed to explain more about the grassroots #standup4brexit campaign   my input into it  here is the result our goal is simple  we seek the #brexit that we were promisedto bring together those of us that oppose the #chequersplan 
this is not about the burka  it s all about #brexit does anyone doubt this phoney outrage is being orchestrated against@borisjohnson by 10 downing street #standup4brexit

when the #brexit #chequersplan is so much of a #brexitbetrayal they spend around £70k writing to party members with spin   lies there will be movement of people  ecj will have a hold over us   we will still pay  i can’t believe the absolute lies in this #standup4brexit

fascinating how just when #voteleavebrokethelaw   electoral commission reporting to police  boris johnson starts making abusive comments that usefully dominate the news on him  clever move  often used by trump  link  —   steve bannon#brexit #voteleave 
#greatyarmouth voted 71 5  to leave the eu  does @brandonlewis understand why  he should #chuckchequers it’s not too late to change tack   embrace the opportunities of brexit  if you live there #standup4brexit help brandon to understand  use  
great to see so many picking up the #standup4brexit hashtag  we need to keep going to get the positive brexit we voted for and not the watered down “leave limitation” being put forward by olly robbins via his puppet theresa may  #brexitnowornever#chequersmeanscorbyn 
this is the man who should be leading our #brexit negotiations @borisjohnson is the man who should be the next #conservatives leader and prime minister #standup4brexit 
if you want to see a true #brexit delivered and not the #chequersplan fudge please follow @standup4brexit and use #standup4brexit   remember to email your #mps   local #chairman and make your voices heard   #bbc #sky #itv #lbc @lbc @conhome @andreajenkyns @nadinedorries @dcbmep 
it took 23 years to get a referendum on membership of the european union  don’t expect those ardent europhiles to accept the result  we all need to get back into campaign mode and show them the tide hasn’t turned the majority still want brexit  it’s time to #standup4brexit 
if there were a general election tomorrow  who would you vote for  #conservative #labour #ukip #libdem #generalelection #globalbritain #bbc #brexit #brexitclock #leave 
if you fancy a laugh   need a bit of cheering up this #sundaymorning then tune into @nigel farage on @lbc   listening to his desperate whining about #brexit   putting forward his nonsensical arguments really drives home how weak the #leave side is   how #brexitisdead  
caught again   condescending christopher montgomery of #voteleave  pro eu ministers are saying we won t get insulin sandwiches or whatever rubbish they re coming out with    the warnings actually came from the uk medicines   healthcare regulator and the european medicines agency  
#theresamay stated many times over  we will #takebackcontrol of our #laws and leave the jurisdiction of the #europeancourtofjustice when we #leave the #eu  the deal she makes with the eu must honour this   #bbc #sky @lbc @conhome @cchqpress @dcbmep #brexit 
high priest of project fear jacob rees mogg  “mark carney has long been the high priest of project fear whose reputation for inaccurate politically motivated forecasting has damaged the reputation of the bank of england ”#brexit #leave #eu 
this superb letter appeared in our local paper @hertsad today i recommend everybody adapts it and emails sends to their own mp we have to counter the #leave campaign lies  the growing influence of #reesmogg   his fascists and together stop a #nodealbrexit #brexit #stopbrexit 
3 3 fact  the majority of people eligible to vote in #eu referendum did not vote #leave                          13 million ppl didn’t vote     16 million voted remain     17 million voted leave   a huge number but it cannot   should not be described as “the will of the people” 
so there it is   #remain did not break the law and #leave did  what next  when will a halt be called to this illegal fiasco   #stopbrexit 
#brexit has prod higher inflation  no growth   now another interest rate rise  we are all poorer thanks to the lies pedalled by those supporting #voteleave  time to take back control   reverse this madness #fbpe #peoplesvote 
i voted to remain in #europe   am very anti #brexit but the public cast their vote   there shouldn t be a 2nd chance #democracy is a responsibility   if some #leave voters now regret their decision  tough shit  that s what you get for believing the media   @nigel farage   
a vital thread  something we   others have looked at in the past  yet  as with other strands in the #brexit #voteleave #tory #trump #scl #cambridgeanalytica #aiq story the msm have pretty much ignored the connection  article below may help your research   
on tomorrow’s @telegraph front page  as part of their pledge to #standup4brexit “dozens of senior tory grassroots members  including more than 30 conservative association chairmen  warn the prime minister that her plan ‘doesn’t deliver the brexit that we were promised’”#cpc18 
boris johnson“unlike the prime minister i campaigned for #brexit  unlike the prime minister i fought for this  i believe in it  i think it’s the right thing for our country and i think that what is happening now is  alas  not what people were promised in 2016”#standup4brexit 
as it is #cpc18 eve  let s remember last #cpc when the pm promised a #brexit deal that was based on lancaster house instead we got given #chequers do remember that chequers isn t the lancaster house vision   #standup4brexit #cpc18 #chuckchequers 
now there s a coincidence  all the main uk car makers have       er       completely independently       made project fear warnings re brexit which remoaner business secretary greg clark just happens to agree with   on the eve of the tory conference  fancy that  #standup4brexit 
thought of the daysix months to go #brexit #leaveeu #letsgo #fcukeu#remoaners #crybabies #sheep pic twitter com br1z3cdsah 
80  of #conservative members want @theresa may to go unelected prime minister who screwed up majority in parliament by calling a general election doesn t believe in #brexitfor the good of our party and our country   resign #standup4brexit #conservatives #cpc18 
remainer rebel mp  dr philip lee has been caught red handed trying to shore up amber rudd’s claim that there are 40 mps prepared to block brexit  as promised in the conservative manifesto  ie that “new and ambitious trade deal” fta #standup4brexit 
jacob explains why parliament won t vote again on brexit if no deal is agreed with eu then we #leave   trade on wto tariffs mps will not be able to stop that happening why aren t #remoaner media   mps telling you that because they want us to #remain  
“mrs may will be inclined to be just as dismissive  but she is playing with fire in being so blithe about the desire among brexiteers like @borisjohnson for a bolder brexit because voters   especially tory ones   tend to feel the same”#standup4brexit 
“our partners around the world cannot understand why we’d want to stay locked in the orbit of the euthis is the moment to change the course of the negotiations   do justice to the ambitions   potential of brexit” @borisjohnson#standup4brexit #planaplus

before the 2016 referendum there were leaflets telling us what #leave means  before the 2016 referendum many people did their research and gave a good thought on the matter  #brexit is not an accident  it is not a mistake  it s a choice #peoplesvote is a waste of time

may says that it’s chequers or no dealwe disagree  given the eu have admitted that technological solutions can solve the ni border  may must move to an fta  position like #planaplus we must deliver the brexit promised in our manifesto#standup4brexit 
 @amberruddhr needs to remember that supporting a #peoplesvote to prevent a #nodealbrexit would go against the will of the british people and the @conservatives manifesto  #standup4brexit #brexit

this is worrying  mrs may is doggedly pursuing #chequers which is reviled  doesn t honour the referendum vote to leave the eu   isn t a good deal for the uk  yet chancellor angela merkel is pushing to get it locked down in october something very sly is going on  #standup4brexit

#brexiteer mp mark francois warned theresa may that the eurosceptic european research group would vote against  the final deal if it is based on chequers because we believe it doesn’t represent #brexit well  someone has to #standup4brexit

why does the pm dismiss canada plus is it because it beats chequers in every conceivable way and she doesn t want to admit that she should have gone with canada  from day one irresponsible and wrong decision  canada  is the way #standup4brexit #brexit 
thank you for pledging to #standup4brexit to @jwhittingdale  vice chair of the exiting the eu select committee   former secretary of stateour aim is to ensure the delivery of the brexit promised at lancaster house  the @iealondon s #planaplus achieves that  chequers does not 
so keir starmer leaves open the option of remain and an extension to article 50he has no place being the shadow #brexit secretary when he is actively subverting the 2016 referendum result#standup4brexit 
we’re really pleased to announce that @richardbaconmp has pledged to #standup4brexit thank you for your support richard#standup4brexit’s aim is to ensure the delivery of full brexit  that means leaving the cu  sm   ecj#planaplus is the only proposal that achieves that pic twitter com fswqaktybm 
 the #remainers who want another #referendum hold #democracy in contempt   they lost and they should grow up   #jacobreesmogg says  the people who are campaigning for a #secondreferendum want to stop us leaving the #europeanunion    @conhome #standup4brexit 
following the outright rejection of may’s chequers plan  a majority of her cabinet now supports moving towards a canada style fta which represents the “clean brexit” that leave supporters voted for#standup4brexit

the #kendal #cumbria #brexitometer results are in  good conversations with people of all views  many #leave voters  green dots  having doubts about #brexit and wanting a #peoplesvote 
really sorry to see this response to @andreajenkyns from the mp for #thurrockwe’d really like to see you pledge to #standup4brexit jackie  on behalf of your electorate who voted overwhelmingly to leave the euchequers is not brexit  
the resolve   determination of #brexiteers   #leave voters solidified into cast iron yesterday the #fbpe #peoplesvote pipe dream is dead now  having witnessed the eu bully boys   gangsters in action only the most extreme #remainer could vote for this eu #brexit #standup4brexit 
thank you to @martinvickers for pledging to #standup4brexit it’s so important that we keeping pushing to ensure the brexit we voted for is deliveredif your mp hasn’t pledged yet please email them and ask them to  
great to see you tweeting on brexit penny  your comments regarding the eu’s behaviour and people’s determination to see the referendum result enacted are spot on  time to pledge to #standup4brexit  
#brexit was never going to work the way the #leave liars said it would why would anyone ever believe the uk could have all the benefits of eu membership for trade  but not have to pay and not have to follow the rules it was cleary a lie  
we do not need another referendum on #brexit  we already had a #peoplesvote in 2016  if politicians don t deliver the will of the british people  then trust in politics will be permanently destroyed  #bbcqt #standup4brexit #respecttheresult 
may must deliver a ceta  fta as promised at lancaster house  any move to keep the uk in the single market via norway style deal would be a complete betrayal of the brexit vote“i want to be clear  what i am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market”#standup4brexit 
thanks so much to mike penning for pledging to #standup4brexit todaychequers may be dead in the water  but a real brexit is still far from a certainty  if your mp hasn t pledged yet  please email them and ask them to #standup4brexit 
no  we voted for brexit and we have a viable option which is @dexeugov’s canada    norway is not #brexit#standup4brexit 
so the realisation that the uk is leaving   or rather our massive financial contribution is leaving and they will all need to cough up   is dawning on them  tough  you had a chance to offer reform and did nothing so deal with it #standup4brexit #brexit no to a   #peoplesvote   
a #leave voting friend just posted this on my fb timeline  the whole leave campaign was based on lies so i believe that my vote is null   void  i don t think i m the only one that believes they were lied to either  i want a 2nd referendum  #remainernow @conservatives @uklabour 
 the people have voted twice already  they voted in a #referendum to #leave  and then they voted in a general election where both #labour and #tories promised to leave the #singlemarket    #nigelfarage on top form   #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc @conhome @dcbmep #uk 
momentum are supporting a #peoplesvote   well if that bunch of revolutionary trots think something is a good idea then we know it s anything but #brexit #standup4brexit 
chequers “will need to be reworked and further negotiated” @donaldtusk if by reworked you mean turned into a canada  fta  then yes we agree donaldchequers is less popular than the poll tax  doesn’t deliver brexit   is a very bad deal#standup4brexit 
190 days to go next stop #brexit#standup4brexit 
why are the government being so tin eared to the popular   workable fta  solution that delivers the brexit we voted for what promises have the government made to the eu  or automotive manufacturers for example  that prevents them from delivering real brexit #standup4brexit 
chequers is unpopular with the public  tory mps and the party membership at large and also unacceptable to the eucanada  is popular with the public  tort mps and party members and on offer from the eu which one should we go for #brexit #standup4brexit 
good god  how arrogant and out of touch are you chequers is a sellout and breaches each of the governments own red lines  its time to #standup4brexit for the canada plus brexit that we were promised   
which do you prefer for #brexitplease retweet after voting#brexit #standup4brexit #conservatives 
this is exactly what brexiteers have been arguing for months  irish border is an easily solvable problem with a little imagination and has been shamelessly politicised by the eu  good to hear them starting to come to their senses#brexit #standup4brexit 
there’s a deal on the table that respects  1  the referendum result  2  the lancaster house speech  3  manifesto and election promises  4  the eus red lines  5  the uks red lines  the eu made the offer in march  we should take it as a starting point  #standup4brexit 
it’s amazing how weak the second referendum argument is “this is a vote on how we leave”   so no need for a remain option then  ids clearly enjoyed watching @chukaumunna fail to convince the remain supporting @piersmorgan#standup4brexit 
may says that it’s chequers or no dealgiven that chequers is brino   less popular than the poll tax  we disagreethe eu have admitted that technological border solutions are possible  therefore so is an ftawe must deliver the brexit promised in our manifesto#standup4brexit 
“#standup4brexit activist @joeporteruk delivered a passionate speech outlining why the uk should not submit to a second referendum on the final brexit deal  claiming that if the referendum was re run ‘people would never trust politicians again’”

as confirmed by the government’s own economic impact assessments  and it will be places like the #eastmidlands that will suffer the most especially our manufacturing sector but the #leave leaders won’t be losing their jobs #brexit more reasons to have a @peoplesvote uk 
mrs may plans to continue her strategy of selling chequers to brexiteers as the least worst way of delivering what they wanted  despite over twice as many voters preferring brexit without any deal to a deal based on her chequers proposals#standup4brexit

hi @robertsyms we would really appreciate it if you’d join our campaign to #standup4brexit the referendum must be respected as well as the conservative party manifesto  please let us know    
to mps demanding compromise from leave voters 1  what was the compromise after the 75 referendum  2  what was the compromise for the maastricht treaty  3  what was the compromise for lisbon treaty  for 41 years you failed to compromise  why should we  #standup4brexit 
should be breaking news and trending everywhere the gove has effectively admitted he’s selling out brexit to “compromise” with the hope to change later  shameful  he should resign and #standup4brexit 
 @michaelgove admits pm’s plan for #brexit is temporary – and could be changed in years to come unbelievable  so why are brexiteers in government backing this #chequers nonsense if #chequers is no good  stand by your principles and #standup4brexit 
chequers isn t #brexit  it s time to #chuckchequers and for mps to deliver on what was promised  #standup4brexit #marr 
#italian deputy pm @matteosalvinimi confirms that he stands with the british people on #brexit and opposes the #eu s stubborn negotiating position   the people s mandate must be  followed       #bbc #sky @lbc @conhome @dcbmep #standup4brexit 
the eu has done nothing in any region of the uk that a sovereign self governing uk gov  could not have done the eu has no money  this is uk taxpayers money returned after a 50  tax by the eu institutions  often spent on vanity projects #brexit #standup4brexit 
wow it looks like there are 17 4 million on that queue  better cancel brexit    oh wait it s just a handful of bitter remoaners who don t accept the result  #brexit #standup4brexit 
#leavers claim a #peoplesvote would cause rioting people can now see #brexit is an act of monumental stupidity that will damage the economy  jobs and people lives  i doubt if #leave could muster enough rioters to fill a minibus in the event of #brexit being overturned  
thank you so much to @bernardjenkin for pledging to #standup4brexit  the british people voted very clearly to leave the eu and that was the policy of the british government  but the so called chequers proposals will not deliver the brexit that the british people voted for   
how the #brexit vote was tainted  ⁦@jolyonmaugham⁩ explains yesterday’s court judgment   the implications for #voteleave   the #dup  it’s time to ask how a vote procured by lies   illegality can be allowed to stand 
well you know what  i m 35 and i ve been in the eu eec my whole life and no one asked me until 2016 whether i wanted to be part of it  we voted leave and it would be crazy to re run the vote without enacting it first  #bbcqt #brexit #standup4brexit 
we already knew #voteleave cheated  now the high court rules that they were also wrongly allowed by the electoral commission do things they shouldn’t  the basis for #brexit looking ever dodgier   
main reasons for a #peoplesvote now proven wrong   @electoralcommuk confirmed #voteleave s actions  £350m week will go to the #nhs  roaming charges unchanged after #brexit     but don t worry  utlra remainers will find another  democratic  reason to try to overturn #brexit 
even the pound has shrugged off carney’s no deal brexit warning and stayed on course to deliver its best week in seven months #standup4brexit 
so a no deal brexit means house prices will crash  we won t be able to fly or drive abroad  our car industry will cease to exist  we ll run out of sandwiches  we won t have passports  we ll suffer bubonic plague etc   etc        but nobody believes a word of it  #standup4brexit

good to see david trimble at launch of #erg border plan go on  someone have the nerve to suggest one of the architects of the good friday agreement  who fought for it  costing him lots politically  is risking that agreement by backing the erg   #brexit      #standup4brexit

we re very happy to share that @jacob rees mogg has pledged to #standup4brexit  @theresa may rightly said that brexit would mean brexit  in her lancaster house speech said she didn t want a solution that was 1 2 in 1 2 out  i m backing the lancaster house vision  not chequers   
 it s time to #standup4brexit and put democracy first  we must #chuckchequers  respect the referendum and believe in britain  @patel4witham thanks so much for all your support priti  
the main argument against brexit seems to be “no one voted to be poorer” no  we voted for cheaper food  for cheaper clothes  for a trade policy that benefits the average person not the cooperate elite  we voted for change  not the status quo  #standup4brexit

uk served a50 notice to #leave  gina miller aided that by insisting it became law after parliamentary vote rather than executive authorisation  the withdrawal act 2018 repeals the european communites act 72  the eu is expunged on 29 mar 2019  that’s the law  #peoplesvote #brexit

“the responsibility of the hoc to #standup4brexit is so much greater  i appeal to colleagues to reflect on the punishment the people would rightfully inflict on those who promised to honour the result of the referendum  only to betray their trust   do the opposite” lord shinkwin

inspiring time with @hackneylabour comrades on #peoplesvotemarch yesterday  standing up for our 40 000 eu nationals  all those in hackney who voted #remain   those who ve had enough of this shambles of a #brexit whether they voted for #leave or #remain no one voted to be poorer  
i voted #remain there shouldn t be a second vote on #brexit because that would make a mockery of #democracy but if there is a second vote i ll be voting #leave #euhaveyoursay 
because they have no arguments left  #brexit is a disaster managed by the incompetent   won in 2016 by fraud and lies  now we have the facts  they know they would lose because the next #leave campaign couldn t lie    they d just get laughed at with a slow hand clap to failure   
@warren oates  do you speak for 17 4m uk  citizens who voted with fully open eyes and considered judgment  happily we live in a democracy  please celebrate that  and respect the vote of the majority  uk  #brexit #leave #out 
i m puzzled   they keep telling us that remain will ultimately prevail b c all the old  white people voted leave   will be dead soon    #peoplesvotemarch #peoplesvote #peoplesmarch #peoplesmarchvote #brexit #leave #remain #london 
i voted leave and would still vote leave if the 2016 eu referendum were tomorrow voting to leave the european union doesn t make anyone less european  in fact people will be the same level of european after brexit as they were before the eu existed #standup4brexit #losersmarch 
in the last year no fewer than 75 official polls were carried out on #brexit  out of those 75  only 2 showed a lead for #leave  our politicians have simply run out of excuses  public opinion has changed  we must not leave the eu  the british people unequivocally reject it  
and it has shown that there is more passionate will for the uk to #remain in the #eu than there is for #brexit  #leave simply cannot  and have not  motivated this level of public support  #farage may bribe a few into a scruffy pub with the offer of a free beer  but that s it  
nearly 700 000 people march against #brexit   in favour of a #peoplesvote in #london  1 200 attend a #leave event in #harrogate  a town which voted #remain       @bbcnews give them equal coverage  meanwhile many #brexiters still claim bbc is  pro remain   
if the figures are to be believed  bucket of salt   700 000 people attended the #losersmarch in london today 16 141 241 voted remain in 2016  so that means remain have lost 15 4 million supporters 11 334 226 voted conservative in 2015 to gain the eu referendum #standup4brexit

“a backstop would tie us to a customs union  therefore not being able to exercise the real benefits of brexit  of setting our own tariffs or trade policy  i think the pm needs to pivot when it comes to chequers   look at #supercanada” @rossthomson mp#standup4brexit #bbcqt 
john pienaar @jponpolitics says gov is in a #brexit maze with no way out he is wrong  jacob explains why parliament won t vote again on brexitif no deal is agreed with eu then we #leave   trade on wto tariffsmps will not be able to stop that happening  
brexit was never about shutting ourselves off from europe  brexit was the realisation that the eu was shutting europe out from the rest of the world  a world where 85  and 90  future growth can be found  which is why we must leave the protectionist cu #brexit #standup4brexit 
hi @liamfox staying in a customs union is not brexit   it takes away all motivation for the eu to offer us any deal please encourage the pm to #chuckchequers   #standup4brexit  so that she can deliver the brexit she promised at lancaster house   in our manifesto  
the big con is on  @theresa may trying to force #cabinet #ministers to back her using her #projectfear the utter lie that if she fails the government fails  wrong if she goes a real #brexit will happen  #theresamay is an eu stooge  #standup4brexit @andreajenkyns @dcbmep #tory #uk

interesting that no brexit supporting ministers are amongst may’s “war cabinet” which has been summoned to meet at 5pm this afternoononly the ‘inner’ faithful  lidington  hunt  hammond  javid  gove  williamson  karen bradley  greg clark   cox#standup4brexit 
people’s frustration is growing justifiably  louder  but please understand the mathematics70  of our mps voted remain   wouldn’t support a change in leader  so brexit mps can only use their numbers as leverage against bad policyemail your mp with your views#standup4brexit 
“the backstop has often been described as an insurance policy by the government  it is  in fact  a hidden trap that could lead to the complete evisceration of the benefits of brexit  giving us the worst of all worlds” @shankerasingham#standup4brexit 
“there’s only one outcome which would honour the referendum result apart from a world trade brexit  a comprehensive free trade agreement along the lines of the one canada has negotiated with the eu  the time has come to take that option” #standup4brexit 
my reaction to any suggestion that the uk could remain locked inside the customs union #standup4brexit #brexit 
“it’d be infinitely better if the tories could come to terms with brexit  find a new language to sell capitalism and reinvent themselves  the question is  do they have the guts to listen to voters  or do they have a political death wish ”#standup4brexit 
on thursday may will ask her brexit war cabinet to agree a backstop that would keep uk in eu customs union until a trade deal can be agreedwe all know that any incentive for the eu to negotiate a deal will evaporate the minute they do#standup4brexit

hi @michaelgove the british public is rather confused by your brexit position please encourage the prime minister to #chuckchequers and #standup4brexit  so that she can deliver the true brexit  as promised at lancaster house and in our manifesto  
no  #brexit is 100  the responsibility of the british government  this government chose to #leave   the eu have set out the choices available  there are literally 100 s of legal agreements both with the #eu27   globally that cannot be broken for the sake of uk demands  #finalsay 
which #brexit option is your preference #standup4brexit #leavemeansleaveretweet for large sample 
as predicted the dup will not stand by and let the #chequersbetrayal go through it’s time for no 10 to #standup4brexit and pivot to #supercanada to deliver the brexit the british public voted for  
the british public is rather confused by your brexit position  @brandonlewis we ask you to encourage the prime minister to #chuckchequers and #standup4brexit  so that she can deliver the true brexit  as promised at lancaster house and in our manifesto  
there are no technical barriers to a #supercanada deal  the eu is endlessly flexible when it wants to bewe urgently need to #chuckchequers   apply the principles of negotiating in order to achieve the brexit the british people voted for#standup4brexit 
may is preparing to bind her cabinet before her trip to brussels where she’ll make a commitment to keep uk in a customs unionwe call on @pennymordaunt @dominicraab @trussliz   @sajidjavid to reject thisremaining in a cu isn’t brexit #standup4brexit 
senior cabinet minister @pennymordaunt has refused to explicitly support the chequers proposal  as former brexit secretary @daviddavismp warned it could lose the conservatives the next election#standup4brexit 
this is brilliant   sums it all up perfectly  #brexit #leave #remain #remoaners 
“it is in our party’s interest  and crucially our national interest  that we reset our negotiating position immediately and deliver a brexit that meets the demands of the referendum and interests of the british people” @daviddavismp#standup4brexit 
ex brexit minister @stevebakerhw who resigned over chequers betrayal in july  has suggested that “powerful forces” in government are seeking to keep the uk in arrangements similar to the single market and customs union#standup4brexit 
rt if you believe you have been lied to by the #leave campaign    the entire #brexit process  and also if you would vote #remain if you were given a #finalsayforall #peoplesvote if you want a #peoplesvote please continue to spread the message    
government whips can rally as many labour mps as it likes  it won t change the fact that the deeply unpopular and unworkable chequers is unacceptable to the eu canada  is perfectly acceptable to the eu and infinitely more popular with the british people #standup4brexit #brexit  
please remember one thing #johnnymercer  politicians such as yourself and sarah are the political servants of the people  so kindly get over yourself and get on with the democratic mandate of the people namely   #brexit or step aside and let others do the task  #standup4brexit

the only thing theresa may has been honest about in relation to brexit is  she is a “bloody difficult woman” the mistake we all made was thinking that was aimed at the eu and not her own party and the electorate    #standup4brexit 
correct we want @theresa may to stand aside  so that we can appoint a leader of the conservative party who will honour the conservative party manifesto promise to #leave the eu  sm   cu  every current tory mp stood for the hoc on in the 2017ge we must deliver #brexit promise  
don’t know about everyone else but i didn’t vote leave for a ‘compromise #brexit’  i wanted 2b free from the e u    take back control of our borders law waters trade etc instead we are going 2b ruled by an an overseas body #sellout #betrayal #standup4brexit #withdrawalagreement

this brexit deal is exactly what i feared  a hotel california brexit where we check  out and never leave is going to be the worst of both worlds  conservative members and officers need to join the mps that have already pledged to #standup4brexit and voice there genuine concern  
says the minister who worked for #deutschebank  then who instead of voting #leave as his conscience said      decided to vote #remain for his career prospects  #sajidjavid is another #careerpolitician  he is a fake   a phony  p ss off sajid  #standup4brexit #brexit #tory @dcbmep

i wonder when the high majority  in post tory mps who ve been  told  to promote this farce of a #brexit deal  will take notice of what people are telling them    realise that they are shockingly out of touch with those who elected them #standup4brexit 
self  self  self  never mind about the country  need to resign  put their letters in   when the no confidence vote comes about  shortly after deal being voted down  install a new #pm   change of direction  the #conservative party is suffering a slow death  #brexit #standup4brexit 
with possibility of a no deal brexit increasing by the day  the machinery of government needs to urgently step up its pace to prepare for this outcome  the serious lack of preparation by ministers   civil servants is shocking   a betrayal of national duty  #standup4brexit #marr 
enoch told us in 1976 of the lying politicians who took us deeper into eec eu  morass  whilst at the same time telling us the complete opposite sound familiar this is the 2018 version  brexit means we stay in   #leave means we #remain don t be fooled again enoch was right

this is what #standup4brexit is about    to show those that leant the conservatives their vote  as well as loyal conservative voters   members  that a significant proportion of conservative mps will honour their commitments   fight for the brexit that was promised #ditchthedeal

“this is not a good and fair brexit  it is not fair to the 17 4 million people who voted to leave in 2016  and isn t good enough for many who voted to remain either  a deal that delivers on the referendum is possible  and this isn t it ” @teamranil#standup4brexit

brexiter elite looking like the establishment figures they are i hope those voters who thought voting #leave in the #brexit referendum was sticking one up to the establishment  take a long hard look at this it s why we need #peoplesvote #finalsay to #exitfrombrexit   #remain 
we were the ones out there leafleting and knocking on doors in the pouring rain  this was not the #brexit we voted for pleased to have signed this open letter to the @telegraph alongside 18 other #leave groups asking mps to vote this horrendous  deal  down  
it doesn t matter if you voted #remain or #leave   the continuity act would mean devolved welsh powers currently operated at eu level would come to wales not westminster after brexit  we urge welsh government not to repeal it today to protect welsh powers  
just when exactly did remain voting mps accept the result of the referendum  and your threat that we accept being a satellite state of the eu or we remain isn’t democratic  #standup4brexit

irish pm leo varadkar has said that theresa may will not be allowed to make any changes to the eu withdrawl agreement  ireland  backed by eu  now tells the uk what it can and cannot do  the eu have clearly always been in control of the brexit negotiations  #standup4brexit 
52 tory mps have said publicly they will #standup4brexit yet 48 letters have not gone in to graham brady  so some still think may can deliver brexit  are they mad  
“you can’t say let’s have a referendum and then run it again because you don’t like the result    you’ve got to be careful how you treat people    this line ‘they didn’t know what they were doing’  it’s very rude to say that to people by the way” alexander downer#standup4brexit 
well   there should be a first referendum on the final deal   commonly known as a #finalsay or a #peoplesvote   we had the 2nd referendum #leave lost the 1st one by a supermajority in 1975 #stopbrexit

some who voted #leave re #brexit did so because they believe conspiracy theories about secretive international organisations ironically  if there is one  it’s a right wing one   bannon   banks are key players  those leave voters are their useful idiots

out in #nottingham campaigning for @peoplesvote uk this is ian from ilkeston  he voted #leave #brexit he’s changed his mind he wants a  #peoplesvote   backs us staying in #eu

you ll be doing nothing of the sort  your role is to take orders from unelected remainer civil servant olly robbins  if you really believe in #brexit then  please stand down  may s lashed herself to the mast  you don t have to suffer her fate too  #standup4brexit #maymustgonow 
#theresamay said that keeping britain in the #customsunion  would betray the vote of the #british people  @theresa may lied to all of us  time for the #conservativeparty to sack this liar   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #maymustgo #chuckmay @andreajenkyns #brexit

the nation will never forgive you if you fail to deliver the brexit the public voted for and the for breaking your manifesto commitment  shackling us to the eu in perpetuity is not brexit #standup4brexit #brexit #changeleader 
this morning bbc radio 4 went chatting to people in mansfield about #brexit these 2 voters opted for #leave in 2016 #euref  they are getting older and were concerned about nhs funding  but now they see the £350 pledge is not possible they are #remainernowrespect #peoplesvote

“the only way we’re going to get the brexit that the people voted for is to change the policy  and the only way to change the policy now is to change the prime minister i think no deal is better than a bad deal  and this is a bad deal” @peterboneuk#standup4brexit 
why the pm’s deal is not #brexit  we will be rule takers not rule makers we won’t control our laws we won’t have control of our money we won’t have control of our borders it stops us agreeing trade deals#standup4brexit details  
“all along  it feels like this has been characterised by timidity ”the eloquent @portilloandhen sums up the problem with the pm’s #brexit plan   that trust is now a big issue   suggests that the backstop could be handled differently#standup4brexit 
the perfect explanation from @timothy stanley  as to why a #nodeal outcome is better than #theresamay s faux brexit   the eu could potentially do a lot of things to us that could do some harm    and if we want to walk away  we can t    #standup4brexit 
“we had the referendum and it was a significant majority  today it is perfectly clear that parliament is not going to accept the withdrawal arrangements that theresa may has negotiated” @billcashmp#standup4brexit 
so another #brexit secretary resigns   joins @stevebakerhw   @daviddavismp who resigned from the same department see the similarities  there’s clearly an issue in that the ministry is disregarded by the leadership it must stop now #standup4brexit 
 @dominicraab has put principles and country above party and resigned as brexit secretary  “i don’t want to submit to the blackmail of my country”  the pm s deal does not deliver brexit  #standup4brexit 
read how the cabinet came to sell out the country  and remember who said what the prime minister  on the steps of no 10  then threatened the nation with ‘accept this utter monstrosity of a deal’ or have no brexit at all email your mp #standup4brexit 
as a life long conservative voter the electorate are not fools  those mps   ministers who back the unmitigated disaster  which is the pms #brexit plan    consequently sellout the uk   democracy  will feel the wrath of the electorate at the ballot box #standup4brexit #brexit  
any cabinet member that refuses to resign over this shambles and sell out will never have a chance for the leadership when the inevitable happens   theresa may is gone  not just for the sake of their country  but for their own political careers they need to resign #standup4brexit 
i m with @jacob rees mogg  the prime minister shouldn t have said that  no deal is better than a bad deal  if she didn t truly believe it  threatening people with not delivering brexit is deeply undignified   #standup4brexit 
no deal is better than a bad deal  @theresa may has said this umpteen times herself  she has came back with a bad deal so mps have a duty to turn this deal down   ensure we get a quick  clean exit from the european union on march 29th 2019 and revert to wto terms  #standup4brexit 
as a lifelong member   voter of the @conservatives and a true blue #tory  large t  i am truly disgusted by the complete #treachery of @theresa may  i hope you are condemned by your actions and your lies #theresamay forever  #standup4brexit @dcbmep @andreajenkyns @conhome #brexit  
“the proposal presented to cabinet is a capitulation  if you believe people voted for brexit to restore surrendered sovereignty  reform our economy and change the country  you will find it a horror show” nick timothy#standup4brexit 
but it s not #brexit in any form #standup4brexit 
very disappointed in the prime minister for threatening that  if this deal doesn t get through parliament there may be no brexit   you clearly never believed that  no deal is better than a bad deal   the british people will never forgive this dishonesty  #standup4brexit

jacob rees mogg  brexit has become an issue of trust – and this government has lost it    #moggmentum #standup4brexit 
if conservative mps were serious   genuinely want to #standup4brexit and the will of the british people  then start handing letters into the 1922 committee  immediately  less talk  more action  if something isn t done imminently then no conservative mp will ever be elected again  
if the pm s #brexitdeal keeps us locked in the eu through the backdoor  then that wouldn t be brexit  we would be rule takers  instead of our own rule makers  this isn t what people voted for  politicians shouldn t underestimate the scale of anger there would be  #standup4brexit 
the dup have been the only consistent party in relation to brexit  thanks arlene  we share the want to defend the integrity of the united kingdom  #standup4brexit 
i totally agree with @jacob rees mogg on the pm s brexit deal   she hasn t so much struck a deal as surrendered to brussels and given in to everything they want  it is not so much the vassal state anymore as the slave state   #standup4brexit 
#brexit so we the 17 4million voters who respect and protect our freedom  sovereignty and democracy  fought for across two world wars in modern times  expect ll members of our goverment to resign for anything less than  #leave as voted for  
conservative cabinet ministers should understand that  should they fail to stand up for the brexit that the british people voted for  they will never be forgiven  #standup4brexit

sure many millions of uk citizens would agree with this johnson   yet  perhaps we should hold off with the unbridled praise   if he flipped and laid bare the criminality behind the #voteleave campaign  led by his brother  now that would make him an mp with real ‘principles ’

as a disabled person and fan of steam trains  as relevant as your credentials   i believe people like you should give it a rest and accept the result  you were elected as mp on basis of an general election manifesto pledge which respected the eu referendum result  #standup4brexit 
theresa may has been forced to abandon plans for an emergency cabinet meeting to approve a brexit deal  after fresh opposition from her cabinet and brussels plunged her timetable into turmoil #standup4brexit #binthebackstop 
hi @dominicraab please remember the manifesto promises that were made to loyal supporters  and those lending their vote for the first time  a backstop that leaves us tied to the eu indefinitely  and is harder to leave that the eu  is not brexit #standup4brexit #binthebackstop

phillip  you were elected on a manifesto that promised to deliver #brexit you have reneged on that pledge you think you know better than the 17 4m who voted to #leave how arrogant is that you should take time to reflect on what you have done  
 @theresa may has been plunged into a deeper crisis after brussels rejected her key #brexit proposal which was intended to avoid the uk being trapped in the customs union 2 years to bring us to this point  how much time have we wasted somebody #standup4brexit   sort this mess 
 @justinegreening says @theresa may is ‘handing power to eu’ in brexit deal  may is accused of planning the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times”when remainers   leavers join to say #chequers is wrong  then its very wrong #standup4brexit 
“mps will block may’s brexit plan” “eu turn off life support”if only a group of well researched mps had warned the prime minister this would happen    oh wait  they did  they also pledged to #standup4brexit

#katehoey blasts desperate #remoaners peddling  ridiculous  myths of huge delays at #dover  the whole thing is another part of this determination by those who did not win the referendum to thwart and delay #brexit     #standup4brexit @dcbmep @andreajenkyns 
theresa may has been warned by cabinet ministers she will have to quit if her brexit deal is defeated in the commons next week and she then fails to “fundamentally renegotiate” #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
 your decision  not politicians  not parliament  just you   this is what we were told by @david cameron   @conservatives and the @ukparliament voted and agreed it in both law and word  @theresa may   #bbc #sky #bbc #sky @lbc #standup4brexit @dcbmep #brexit 
i’ve received this mock up of the ballot paper for another referendum on our membership of the eu#standup4brexit 
 the referendum result was the nation throwing a leash back around its  government  what people wanted was a government that said what it meant  and meant what it said    @johnnymerceruk speaks out against @theresa may s warped #brexitdeal   #standup4brexit 
theresa may could have to resign next week over brexit @dominicraab has admitted “she has got to be willing finally to say to brussels ‘no’” #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
“i want the pm to say ‘i accept my deal is dead  i’m going to negotiate a free trade deal’  if we get that  we’ll be very happy  if we can’t  we’ll have a clean global brexit  which is trading on wto terms  like we trade with the rest of the world” @peterboneuk#standup4brexit 
17 4 million people voted #leave  so if #labour blocks #brexit we will be wiped out and the tories will remain in power indefinitely @uklabour is starting to rebuild trust with the public after iraq  it simply cannot afford to break trust a second time #generalelectionnow 
wow  david cameron saying if we vote to #leave we will leave and no second referendum  
#mail   #express telling their readers that the #brexitbetrayal is the only #brexit in town they know full well that the #brexitbetrayal is not #brexit in fact  the #brexitbetrayal is worse than our current membership of eu at least now we can serve notice to #leave 
i response to hammond’s claim that a clean brexit is an “extreme option” @simonclarkemp “i’m suspicious of politicians who stand on manifestos saying one thing  and then end up doing another in a way which doesn’t meet the expectations of the public”#standup4brexit 
a second referendum will divide us  so will her deal  the only option to unite the country is a no deal brexit which deliveries on the wishes of the 17 4m who voted to leave  #standup4brexit hugo   #leavemeansleave 
the voices of the british people were heard in 2016  now the establishment is trying to distort the result of the referendum  because they have more important things than the people of this country  but it s not how it should be #leavemeansleave #standup4brexit 
“how many more absurd scare stories are they going to run it is time the government moved on from seeing brexit as some problem to be managed  to seeing it as full of opportunity for more jobs  more growth and prosperity” @johnredwood#standup4brexit

“we’ve seen it this evening  the political establishment hates brexit  the media establishment hates brexit    northern ireland will be under a different regime  that’s a breach of the act of union 1801  it is extraordinary that this has been allowed through” #standup4brexit 
 17 4 million people voted leave   the largest vote in #british history on any single subject     @owenpaterson reminds the commons that the will of the people must be respected  time to ditch @theresa may s warped #brexit sabotage   #standup4brexit @dcbmep 
 1 2  which #brexit deal did you vote for julia  the answer is none as no concrete plan was even published nevermind put to any vote  this greatly helped to achieve the narrow #leave win as lack of specifics meant brexit could be sold as all things to all people  #brexitshambles 
despite what the screaming headlines would have you believe  the grieve amendment is not legally binding  no 10 are spinning that it s a disaster for brexit in order to push that it’s may’s deal or a 2nd ref there’s still 0  chance of a 2nd ref #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
and so it starts   the slow drip drip drip of the media  suggesting  we could withdraw #article50 began on @bbcnews at   now continues   is this a conspiracy to start to truly undermine #brexit   to brainwash us we need to stand firm   we voted to #leave and #leavemeansleave 
the bbc’s decision to call off the brexit tv debate between theresa may   jeremy corbyn is thanks to brexiteer mps  clearly the bbc felt unable to ensure that the “views of those who voted leave were represented at the same level as others”#standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
@jolyonmaugham @joannaccherry making very strong point that #leave ran 2 contradictory campaigns aimed at different groups promising different things  there was never a workable single brexit plan that commanded a majority  this was the major dishonesty perpetrated on the people 
if your constituency voted 70  for brexit @johnnymerceruk  you should vote against the pm s deal  it doesn t deliver what the british people voted for  we need a real brexit where we become a sovereign  independent  free trading country #politicslive #ditchthedeal #standup4brexit 
that’s convenient timing    just as well polling shows the british public just want to get on with clean brexit #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
former #labour minister @frankfieldteam is clear that if the withdrawal agreement goes through then the #eu can use the #backstop to demand any ransom to gain our exit   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #labourparty #brexit #leavemeansleave @andreajenkyns

funny  #leave campaign said #brexit would save money  which wld all go to the #nhs  turns out it costs a fortune    
nothing has happened since the eu referendum to make me regret my decision to #voteleave  if anything the eu s stance has vindicated me 
voters were grossly misinformed about the issues in the #brexit referendum  much to the benefit of #leave   1#leavelies #stopbrexit 
the #leave option was a catch all slogan which covered a huge mess of incompatible and mostly completely unworkable proposals #brexit  1 
@conservatives  #brexit s first major bankruptcy  #monarch s revenue was in £ while all its costs were in us   thanks #leave 
#euwithdrawalbill claims that the #leave campaign said that #brexit must mean leaving the #singlemarket are certainly not true of all their campaigners  
as a #patriotic #british #jew who voted #leave  this is how i see the so called #europeanunion which was founded by ex #nazis such as #walterhallstein founding president of the #brussels #eucommission  #uk #eu #news #bbc #sky #tory #labour #ukip #libdems #usa #brexit #itv

my late dad worked 40 years on an assembly line making tin cans at night because the night  shift paid more money and he was our sole provider  so  yeah  i get why people voted #leave  and why folks voted #trump too but they made a mistake  #brexit  and trump is against them

#leave has become a farce  spending more on #brexit than the #nhs   where did that come from  who voted for that  nobody i know who s sane and willing to stick their head above the parapet  
so far #brexit has cost us £700m #philliphammond is expecting it to cost another £3bn where is that money for the #nhs #leave campaign was funded by tax dodgers because the #eu was clamping down on #tax havens #brexit is the biggest con ever perpetrated on the british public  
does anyone know if its legal for govt to hand over taxes raised in uk to a foreign govt without any concrete independent verification that the monies are owed  #ukip #brexit #leave 
spot on  the uk media and their #brexit puppets are focusing on the #brexit divorce bill to wind up #leave voters and retain their support  ireland and the rights of eu citizens are the crunch issues  as member states  interests directly affected  
 @electoralcommuk   new information has come to light  re  #voteleave   it is possible that during the course of the investigation  the commission will identify potential contraventions   #nullification#brexit 
a register for #leave voters  not a bad idea at all  and they would be levied with an extra #brexittax  and same thing for companies who are supporting and pushing for brexit  like #wetherspoons  #dyson  rupert #murdoch s newspaper group etc  they should make up the shortfall

disgraceful   it is not their brexit  it is ours the people s   we instructed them to deliver whatever we decided which was #leave   they are trying to railroad it   i will never trust mps again  
we have been airbrushed out of the debate entirely  your scripts   commentators start with the assumption we will #leave  yet the referendum was vanishingly close   advisory  time to rethink this   we are going nowhere  we will #stopbrexit  then what will you do for news  not to

the latest world economic league table states that britain has recovered from an initial economic blip after the vote to #leave and now looks set to maintain its position in the rankings and improve by 2020 after #brexit  
the rich #brexit donors who bankrolled the #leaveeu campaign now want an exemption for the tax they owe  
remember all the times #leave leaders promised we wouldn t leave the single market  they were lies designed to win over wavering voters and win the referendum by deceit no mandate for a #brexit built on a mountain of #leavelies #stopbrexit #fbpe 
the #leave campaign was funded by vast amounts of money from the super rich  £7 5m from arron banks alone  our pro eu campaign is all volunteer effort plus a little crowd funding  we are the real popular  grassroots resistance #stopbrexit #brexit #fbpe 
why   despite pre referendum claims from the #leave camp   small fishing communities stand to lose out due to #brexit  just like everyone else  #stopbrexit

in under an hour begins #stopbrexithour  this is #stopbrexit2018  and here s 1 reason why  the referendum did not specify what #leave would mean  and given that the result was so close there is certainly no mandate for #hardbrexit  #fbpe #finalsay 
here is paul  he voted #leave but now regrets it  like many he feels his vote has been hijacked   is yet another #bregretter calling for a #finalsay #brexit referendum when the facts are clear  @bravehartley thanks for acting like your name suggests   speaking out on this issue  
oh usa what hv u done  conned by  populist  #trump who didn t want to win   hasn t a clue on delivery  sounds familiar  #brexit #leave et al

well  thank goodness #leave won the referendum and the nhs is now receiving that additional £350m a week    one of the many brexit benefits we re all now enjoying

back in 1973   1975 british citizens were told they would be £5 per week each  better off as a member of the eec  eu   our trade deficit with the eu has risen year upon year  strange how germany benefit the greatest   uk the least  #brexit #leaveeu 
if honda go then so will toyota and nissan  those who maintain that we should still #leaveeu like to call themselves patriots  but #brexit is turning out to be the most treacherous and cowardly act of national destruction  #stopbrexitsavebritain #stopbrexit #fbpe 
suddenly  no deal  #brexit has reared it s head again   become a very real possibility  even though it was never #leave s stated intention to leave the eu without a deal and leavehq said it would be  so catastrophic  no responsible govt would do it   scary  demand #finalsay  
well said @terrychristian on #bbcqt  #brexit is simple   only for simple people  struggling to recall richard tice or anyone else from #leaveeu telling british public about  benefits  of having irish border reinstated or uk financial sector losing eu trading passports  
so the uk region that voted strongest for #leaveeu is to be worst hit economically by #brexit  whilst remainer london  will be least hit  quelle surprise  as michel barnier might say  
if the referendum had proposed a specific form of brexit as the leave option then #leave would almost certainly have lost  #leave won because the option was 4 words which could mean almost anything to anyone  and what gave leave victory is causing chaos now  #stopbrexit #fbpe 
walk away now     and give the eu 30 days to reconsider their position #leaveeu #leave #nodeal #brexit 
this guy is bang on the money  we didn’t vote #leave to regain some sovereignty  we voted to leave to regain all sovereignty  #brexit #bbcqt

we are looking for #european mods that want to #leaveeu and stand against #eurabia  dm me if that sounds like you    #mega #newright #brexit @euroskeptic 
some in the #leave camp are definitely getting concerned that #brexit isn t going to happen  the clearer it becomes that it s going to be an unmitigated disaster  there also appears to be a correlation between how abusive they are and the amount of racism in their twitter feeds 
i’ve spent many a christmas away from my home and family  reassured by the fact i was serving my country  what is see out of my window now  with the left wing  tree hugging  pc dipsticks gets to me  however #brexit for me makes it all worth while  dont let us down #leave #torys 
why  if you care about our democracy  regardless of your views on #brexit  the #cambridgeanalytica #facebook #voteleave scandal matters  my latest @expressandecho column

this is a must read  more excellent work by @peterkgeoghegan   @adamramsay on dodgy spending by #leave   #dup  investigative  journalism at its best #brexit #fbpe 
devastating that the admission of cheating by the #leaveeu campaign in the #referendum are made by a #brexit campaigner  
#jacobreesmogg  some have told us that we were stupid   didn’t know what we were doing   in truth  the vote to #leave was made by those who believed in #democracy   #bbc #lbc #sky @conservatives #tory @conhome @theresa may #conservativeparty #tories #brexit

 i wrote about the use of #bigdata a year ago in the @theneweuropean re  #voteleave  
i think this should read that #leave voters in england care more about #brexit than the  precious union  of @theresa may  s imagination   they would be happy to see n i and scotland break away  
brexit   when rule britannia became fool britannia   we always knew #voteleave was full of lies   now there may have been fraud as well  #cambridgeanalytica   a great democracy like britain s shouldn t be undermined like this   a full inquiry needed   criminal charges if proven  
translation  while the government  the bbc  almost every politician   most of the media knew the right thing was to vote remain  and connived to achieve it   a handle of people i disapprove of argued for #leave  we therefore must vote again  until we get the right answer  #brexit  
no one likes a cheat so when they get caught out there are consequences #balltampering #resign #stevesmith  as the truth emerges about #leave dodgy funding  abuse of social media  fake claims   phoney promises  let’s make sure the voters they cheated hold them to account #brexit 
poor isobel oakshot desperately trying to shut down @carolecadwalla on #marr over the #cambridgeanalytica story  she knows her #leave   #tory mates are in the soup  carole’s conclusion that electoral spending law needs looked at 100  right #brexit #fbpe

the margin that trump won in the places that he won was minuscule   like the #leave win  another clue that #bigdata micro analytics may have played a part

if i lived in #grimsby and relied on #fisheries for my living i d sue  hm government  the motto of #leave was  #takebackcontrol 
these images were  targeted  to those people whose harvested data showed they were the most susceptible to voting #leave

#nigelfarage  every single major player of that referendum said that if we #voteleave we are leaving the #singlemarket   by implication the #customsunion  unless we leave we will not be able to go global and get the benefits that ought to come from #brexit  
didn’t take #farage long to tell his first fib on #bbcqt when he said everyone in referendum campaign said we’d exit the #singlemarket if we #brexit   several prominent #leave campaigners said the opposite  
these outright lies are why farage and the #leave camp were able to get the gullible to vote for #brexit 
remoaners draw up  aggressive  tactics handbook in bid to halt brexit  #fbpe #stopbrexityep   i ve stopped saying  please  to anyone i think voted #leave   that should swing it

awkward conversation with #leave voter today   i grimaced at the  get rid of all immigrants after #brexit  comment but foolishly pointed out his irish wife is an immigrant  that made him really angry   apparently  i am a racist to call her an immigrant  
#leave voters think #brexit isn t turning out as well as they hoped  poll finds  
a gentle word to #leave leaders and supporters who blantantly used #immigration   told lies to win the #eu referendum and now turn their attacks on the current and former home secretary  stop it  no one is fooled by your hypocrisy  
is there anything involved in #brexit that wasnt a scam “twitter account from former #wetherspoon socialmedia team claims they were shut down   deleted because the firm was “in fear of being caught for data ‘misuse’” connected to #voteleave   
#brexit divorce cost uncertain  say national auditors  but likely to be around £35bn £39bn so much for the #leave lie that it would save money that would all go to the #nhs   
that moment when you get caught out on a little fib     #brexit #leaveeu

vote leave figureheads boris johnson   michael gove had a distinctly queasy look on the morning of june 24th 2016 can t help wondering what was going through their minds #brexit #voteleave #peoplesvote 
 @theresa may  @borisjohnson and @michaelgove must all resign  this scandal is already massive  and it s only just beginning   #brexit #stopbrexit #voteleave #eureferendum #overspending #fraud 
#brexitshambles update qcs appointed by the @commonscms say there is a  prima facie case  that #voteleave broke uk electoral laws in the eu referendumthe result was likely illegally obtained #stopbrexit #bbcaq @lbc #finalsay 
the more #brexit seems doomed to abject failure  the more the racists and xenophobes seem to be getting angrier and nastier about those of us who oppose it  why is it that the #leave camp seems to have been so deeply infiltrated by these bile filled hate mongers  
i wonder if the 250 celebrities who wrote their daft letter to brainwash kids to vote remain will be voting for tony blair s #toxicswampparty  #brexit #leaveeu 
nearly 1 million more people were granted eu citizenship in 2016  who knows how many last year     all with carte blanche to come to the uk while we re twiddling our thumbs during this barmy transition period #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu 
theresa may     you re giving away too much #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu #hardbrexit 
some tory politicians claim that people were well informed before the #brexit vote  they won t  they were radically misinformed on some of the main issues  massively to the advantage of #leave a vote based on misinformation is scarcely democratic  #stopbrexit #voteeu 
significant that a key #leave campaigner now thinks there is no democratic mandate for #brexit   
also interesting to reflect on what #leave voter #chriswylie said on #marr today   a man who despite being canadian had a say on the fate of our #eu27 citizens because he s from a commonwealth country  whereas #eu27 citizens themselves did not  #brexit is trashing #britishvalues  
blair  germany will stop brexit and force britain to stay in the eu well  i suppose germany is about as an elected representative as the house of lords bring on the next battle #brexiteers#brexit #leaveeu #democracyindanger

 if a general election elects a gov on a  leave ticket  i would abide by it  in 2017 general election 90  of mps were elected on a manifesto that promised to #leave tory gov    dup who support them  were both elected promising to deliver #brexitwhy not abide by the result jon   
in 2017 90  of the mps were elected on a manifesto promising to make #brexit happen they should stop all the faffing about and honour their promise if they don t  the 17 4 million who voted #leave will vote them out at the next election  
shameful that the assessment   views #brexit of people running vital british businesses like #pharma which employ thousands of workers are routinely ignored by media  these great firms will shift production  jobs  when we #leave #eu unless we secure #customsunion #singlemarket

rees mogg  sir nick has missed the point when we leave #eu we will be out of the protectionist customs union customs union applies tariffs of 22  on food   over 11  on clothing   footwear that s why it s so essential to #leave customs union  #brexit 
great to see you working cross party to make the case that mps parliament must take control of our #brexit future  there is a consensus and way to deliver #leave that secures our economic future   peace in n ireland  #efta #eea #customsarrangement #customspartnership #getonwithit

something is shifting in the #brexit #leave sphere  my auntie from east anglia who has avoided the topic for the past 2 years asked me today whether how we would be affected by brexit and acknowledged how bad things are going  we had an actual conversation  i see change

jacob rees mogg  so either uk govt or irish govt has to decide that it wants to implement a hard border both govts have said they do not wish to  so who is going to do this is it some sort of phantom govt that s going to do this  #brexit #leave #eu 
we knew the #brexit #referendum was  narrowly  won on the basis of a pack of lies and with a questionable franchise  we recently learned about data abuse  and now we know the #leave campaign cheated on the spending

another russian #facebook ad  dated 14 01 2016  and targeting fb users in the us  and  the uk  remember fb told @commonscms they only had evidence of £1 of russian money spent in the uk     would have #voteleave or #leaveeu balked at using this type of propaganda  answer  no  
had a great time as joint guest of the day on @daily politics  brexit means leaving the customs union   it s time to get on with it  #bbcdp #takecontrol 
just one example of thousands of russian #facebook ads groups   it s no great leap to imagine this propaganda translated to  issues  pushed by the likes of #voteleave   #leaveeu prior to the #euref  @damiancollins @carolecadwalla @profcarroll @peterjukes @podehaye @fascinatorfun

if you cheat in the olympics  you lose your medal  if you cheat in an exam  you don t get your grade  if you cheat in a referendum or election  you get to walk away with a minuscule fine and slap on the wrist  #leaveeu 
be under no illusion   these are serious charges and include personal and corporate fraud  how can @theresa may not question the legitimacy of the referendum  #leaveeu 
it s official #leaveeu cheated during the eu referendum  if you add #voteleave lies   #cambridgeanalytica and #aiq data saga into the mix we can conclude there was nothing democratic about the outcome of the #euref vote  #brexit was and is a fraud   
i m not sure how many times i can say this before it starts to lose its meaning  the referendum result is now unequivocally null and void  we must not leave the #eu  #leave cheated and lied  the majority of uk citizens now want to stay in the eu  clear enough  
has house of lords apologised to the eu yet for the #brexit vote have the lords of lords apologised yet for 17 4m of us who obviously did not know what we were doing when we voted to #leave it is good job we have those wise people in the house of lords to correct our mistakes

if you google  #brexit benefits  how come you just get some forlorn right wing newspaper articles from 2017 about wooly nothingness  surely  if it was such a good idea  the #leave camp would have the media littered with multitudes of benefits by now      unless there aren t any  
the #leave camp garnered 37  of the electorates vote in the referendum  sensing a hard sell in the hoc  may called a general election on a #brexit ticket  the country replied by removing her majority  how on earth is #brexit therefore still called the will of the people  
#piersmorgan hits out at the same old pro #euro campaigners banging on about #europe   explains why we must now get on #brexit  “we had a #referendum  everybody had a chance to have their say and we voted democratically to #leave ”  #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc 
the vote that  @conservatives have now is largely a #leave vote they have an expectation  #brexit has cast a shadow people say that it s not mentioned on the doorstep  but it was such a very big choice so lab and cons have matched each other point to point   #johncurtice #wato

1 000 jobs at risk as jacques vert owner collapses  the collapse makes calvetron the latest in a lengthening line of retail casualties nothing to do with #brexit of course  none of the recent collapses are  according to the #leave camp  
that #brexit uk was merely a  test run  for putin  trump and #cambridgeanalytics is a measure of how unimportant they consider us that various #leave campaigns so openly colluded with one another is a measure of how weak our policing and legal systems are  #stopbrexit pic twitter com 2ylwu9opl1 
house of lords are trying to scupper #brexittheir arrogance is mind blowing they think they know better than the 17 4m of us who voted to #leave if they want to run the country they should stand for election if they don t want to do that  they should zip it #abolishthelords

jacob rees mogg  june 23  the anniversary of brexit referendum vote  will be remembered as a big moment of change in british history as big as the great reform act of 1832  victory at waterloo in 1815 or the glorious revolution of 1688 #brexit #leave #eu

jo cox was murdered on the 17th june 2016  the referendum campaigns were halted for three days out of respect  all campaigns were told to stop the time stamp on this message  7 46pm on 17 06 16 #euref #brexit #voteleave #leaveeu #beleave #finalsay #finalsayforall #peoplesvote 
and those investigations uncovered exactly how #leaveeu and #voteleave won  unexpectedly   they broke the law  pumped £600 000 illegally into illegal social media adverts  even ignoring the 3 day moratorium due to the murder of jo cox  that s how they won  unexpectedly   #brexit  
1  suddenly there s talk about disaster socialism  to me this is an equivalence thing from the #leave campaign  and to be clear  if #brexit happens and the capitalist fundamentalists takeover there will be no future socialism  because there will be no elections  no democracy    
funny how many of those currently criticising the bbc s coverage of #brexit and #voteleave were happy to mock corbynites when we had similar complaints about the bbc s coverage of corbyn  
my guess here is that @bbcnews won t admit that #voteleave broke the law until people are physically arrested  charged and found guilty in court  so  just now they re only prepared to use the word  allegations   i m in no way defending them because #voteleavebrokethelaw#brexit 
the #voteleave #brexit campaign been evidenced to have been a criminal conspiracy backed by dark money and the #altright    orchestrated by a lot of posh boys   backed by the daily mail   notice the similarity  
before the #eu #referendum  #johnmajor said it s  not politically credible  to hold another referendum after a #vote to #leave  couldn t agree more    #rightthefirsttime   #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty #tory @andreajenkyns #tories 
apparently in the uk to win a referendum you need to run a dodgy campaign and lie  #voteleave #bettertogether 
not on your nelly   there is no way we #brexiteers will accept ignoring the referendum which said  would be implemented    one hell of a stink would result if this was to happen   we voted #leave and it must be delivered 
remember  #voteleave campaigners repeatedly said that #brexit would be dead easy and simple    
that this sham of a govt is considering  stockpiling food   medicines  in the event of “no deal”   in britain  in 2018  demonstrates just how locked into dangerous tunnel vision they are brexit was based on cheating  #voteleavebrokethelaw #voteleave 
we voted #leave because we didn t want to be ruled by unelected bureaucrats   now we have eu loving unelected bureaucrat olly robbins placed in sole charge of #brexit negotiations by the useless may   i despair  
   because @jeremycorbyn and @johnmcdonnellmp are old style hard left no deal brexiteers  they will sell out “remainers” and sensible #leave voters who  want a #brexit that protects jobs  prosperity and peace in n ireland   
#nadinedorries   is this some sort of bullying  do we say to the #british people  we don t trust you on your last vote  you ve got to vote again    we had the #referendum  #leave won   therefore we have to implement  leave     #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome

4 000 disgruntled tory brexit voters joined ukip since may s stitch up 2 500 new #ukip members in the last week alone all because eu  associate membership  is not leaving the eu   17 4 million voters voted to leave   so leave #brexit #leave #eu go #wto 
yet another “honest mistake” by this govt in normal parlance   cheating  what this govt will do to push through brexit   #brexitmeansbrexit #voteleave #voteleavebrokethelaw 
#bbc  state of play  today  @electoralcommuk confirmed #voteleave  led by the  big beasts  of the #tory party  cheated  lied   broke the law in order to upend democracy   trigger the biggest constitutional crisis in modern times yet  not one single utterance on @bbcnewsnight 
it s not about labour or tories it s about whether our government  whichever party is in power  actually respects the democratic voice of the people #brexit means #leave 
“   a result won with cheating and law breaking can not  be said to represent the will of the people in june 2016” please sign and share this petition  @hackneyabbott   please  we need you and @uklabour to step up and speak up   the referendum must be annulled #brexit #voteleave 
so  even though brexit referendum was advisory the advisory result of it must be implemented against all reason  but because it was advisory any associated wrongdoing  cannot be challenged in the courts   #voteleave really are having their cake and eating it  
excellent thread from @adamwagner1 on why it will be very difficult to legally challenge #euref result on basis of #voteleave cheating  i agree with him that ultimately what we do about this is a political rather than a legal decision #brexit #fbpe 
by cheating on spending rules #voteleave broke the law  but the referendum was advisory  so the courts likely cannot intervene  so  it is up to parliament to decide if the result is void  we need a vote in this house   
the reason why the #voteleave cheating is so important is because it s not some minor technicality  that money was used to buy advertising that sought to deliberately mislead the public into thinking they would be better off with #brexit  they won t  it s a compounded fraud 
i ll just leave this here shall i  you outspent us 2 1  had the machinery of government behind you and still lost  #brexit #voteleave 
the magnificent @nsoames in the wake of the #electoralcommission report on #leave gross and illegal over spend has just called for the #eu #referendum to be re run  i agree with him  
brexit summary brexit voters wanted more control but brexit is leaving us bound by eu law but no longer influencing itreferendum wasn t just filled with lies but #voteleave broke the law3 months left to negotiate and the government still doesn t know what it wants 
very good point  if vote leave broke the law to win the referendum  and the government is pursuing brexit knowing that  they re aiding and abetting the original crime by ensuring that it bears  poisoned  fruit     accessories after the fact  #voteleave 
if you have any respect for the integrity of british democracy  you cannot find out that the biggest political shift in half a century was achieved by criminal action and just shrug your shoulders there must be a people s vote on the brexit deal #voteleave 
it s official  #voteleave lied   cheated in the referendum  so   engineer  designer  ux  data scientist  social influencer  the great british hack off will aim at brexit   july 21 22  london  by @techforuk   @bestforbritain #gbhackoff #fbpe pls share  
yesterday  no deal  brexit became the most likely outcome  today we see confirmed that #voteleave broke the electoral law and has  therefore  now been fined and referred to the policy  so when will responsible politicians stop this madness  
if only there was some evidence of massive over spending by the remain campaign then i am sure the electoral commission would investigate it     #voteleave #brexit #tuesdaythoughts 
disgraceful that vince cable and tim farron did not show up to debate and vote on brexit  last night they had the opportunity to vote against theresa mays brexit plan  they have misled their party and voters and should be ashamed of themselves  #voteleave 
jacob rees mogg is working theresa may from the back#voteleave cheated yet the #brexit result still standsthe scottish tory mps voted against @scotparl having any saywhy is scotland still in this uk union  this is not democratic  #indyref2 
#voteleave clearly doesn t give a crap about the integrity of british democracy  we believe brexit voters do  so surely you agree that there should at least be a people s vote on the deal   
i’ve never been a ‘let’s have a second referendum’ person but surely if #voteleave have been fined and referred to the police for breaking the law over their #brexit campaign there needs to be another one or this whole brexit thing stopped  
how many #voteleave mps have money in off shore tax havens  is this why they want #brexit because eu was going to clamp down on them  asking for a friend  
all the headlines about #voteleave being fined £61k for breaching spending limits feels like a storm in a teacup when you compare it to the £9m of taxpayers money spent by david cameron on sending #brexit project fear leaflets to each household   
i warned in february 2016 that #voteleave was not the right vehicle for the referendum given ⁦@matthew elliott⁩’s penchant for dodgy behaviour  today their groups were fined by the electoral commission and referred to the police  
#voteleave broke the law  have been fined and referred to the police  the referendum should be declared null and void  not only was it advisory anyway  the campaign was illegal  why on earth should the uk #brexit in light of this  #stopbrexit 
#soubry    nobody voted #leave on the basis that somebody with a gold plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them   #brexit 
#isabeloakeshott corners #remoaner #dominicgrieve on his anti #brexit meddling   you stood on a #manifesto which said we would #leave the #eu  the #singlemarket  and the #customsunion    #maymustgo #bbc #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty @dcbmep 
andrew marr   it’s fake sovereignty  it’s not real sovereignty in theory  we can go to brussels and say ‘do you mind if we change these rules’ in practice  once the common rulebook is in place  we can’t  not in the real world  #brexit #leave #eu 
pm says we can #leave in name only  or we don t #leave at all  there is a third way theresa you could deliver the #brexit we voted for no more single mkt or customs union no ecjno open door immigrationno payments to euget all our fish backno more eu laws   regulations  
polls carried out before david cameron announced the #eu ref showed #leave were trailing by up to 13 points  nobody wanted it now  hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition asking for a #peoplesvote and it is being denied  this is wrong #brexit#finalsay 
 @markdrakeford is right a hard #brexit  that makes wales poorer  that creates barriers to trade and collaboration  has no mandate join us to oppose this shambolic mess #takecontrol and demand a #peoplesvote on the final #brexitdeal

1 2  the investigation into #cambridgeanalytica is tugging at a loose thread that is connected to the very fabric of our society  this scandal isn t just about #facebook  #trump  #brexit  #voteleave etc  it is about the way corporate power subverts our democracy to its own ends  pic twitter com xcibj5dnmi 
it is clear the #euref result was achieved by massive illegal data fraud   breaking the law in multiple ways by #voteleave   #leaveeuhow long will it take before @bbcnews stops respecting fraud   illegal acts on our democracy #voteleavebrokethelaw #voteleavecheated #brexit  
over 12 months there have been no fewer than 35 opinion polls carried out  with about 60 000 participants  how many of these have shown a lead for #leave that s right  two  out of 35 no longer the  will of the people #peoplesvote#noconfidence#brexit#brexitshambles 
i don t care why you voted to #leave the #eu in june 2016  if you still support #brexit knowing everything you know now  then you want to harm the #uk   #standup2brexit #stopbrexit #fbpe @remainingkind @loubinwally @lunaperla @stopbrexitmarch @acgrayling @marieannuk 
sir james dyson has urged the government to be bold on brexit or squander a unique chance to “supercharge” the economy“it would be unforgivable if the government does not grab this opportunity with both hands”#standup4brexit 
if you haven’t already  please follow @standup4brexit and please make sure you’re asking your mp to respect the referendum and to #standup4brexit this campaign will save more than brexit  it’ll save the u k  from marxism  so please get involved and back it  
absolutely correct shahmir  also it is no coincidence craig mackinlay was part of the forerunner of #voteleave   conservatives for britain  set up by matthew elliott in june  15  cfb was headed by co chairs campbell bannerman and steve baker  of course steve baker   #brexitscam 
the @telegraph’s europe editor peter foster has claimed that no one has answered his key questions on brexit“in fact  they’ve been answered ad nauseam  sadly  some people are just not listening” say @jlongworthlml   iain duncan smith#standup4brexit 
amongst all the rhetoric and posturing from the #leave campaign  i ve never heard an economic case for #brexit having been made  lots of soundbites  but no actual numbersand no case for #brexit delivering a tightening of border controls  if indeed they re neededit s pointless 
 6 6  so it turns out young grimes s  beleave  was not the first teenager s  fake  company formed with a singular aim by the execs at the very top of the #voteleave campaign  perhaps darren can take some solace from being  given  £675 000 by dominic cummings     or maybe not    pic twitter com x8pt3zlsoa 
 5  of course   lyon shephard web solutions  was a bogus company  set up by  #voteleave solely to enable two teenagers to interrupt a pm s key speech to business leaders  the cheap but effective stunt was defended at the time by none other than vote leave s daniel hannan     
you know anna soubry is constantly on about a second referendum has she forgotten that she said that she accepts the referendum result and people are moving on i m confused  maybe she will change her mind again and #standup4brexit be a shame if you spread this 
‘@astonmartin ceo @andyataston has said today that any tariffs that came in as a result of wto #brexit would  even itself out  and that britain s economy would benefit from a weaker poundit’s time to ditch the shackles of #chequers and #standup4brexit

it’d be great if you could share our #standup4brexit campaign tom we’re calling for all mps to reject #chequers as it doesn’t deliver the #brexit promised at lancaster house or in our manifesto if you could share for us  that would be great

 the government is delivering a brexit for the people are you kidding me  the #chequersplan breaches each of the three red lines  it fails to give control on borders  laws rules and it provides a backstop that would destroy the uk union please  support #standup4brexit 
the government is delivering nothing  chequers isn’t brexit  it’s a continuation of the status quo wrapped up in some fancy jargon  mps need to #standup4brexit or corbyn will be the next pm  marxism is a heavy price to pay for a deal no one wants  
hi @andrewrosindell we have an feeling that you’re pro #brexit  we wondered if you would join the growing number of mps to #standup4brexit and join our grassroots campaign to reject the #chequersplan it would be great if you joined us  we’d love a video from you too  
i ll thinl you ll find that the promise of an in out referendum on our membership of the eu was an essential part of our 2015 win  if we don t honour it it will lead to inevitable defeat at the next election #brexit #standup4brexit 
if you haven’t already follow @standup4brexit and please make sure you’re asking your mp to respect the referendum and to #standup4brexit chequers leads to corbyn and we all know how damaging that will be to the u k  
why is nobody on the #leave side trumpeting the benefits of leaving the eu  before the referendum they were happy to spin any old lie to sell the dog  now they are silent  could it be because every lie has now been exposed and the dog has already died #stopbrexitsavebritain 
remember when we were promised that #brexit would mean control of our borders  money   laws then we got the #chequersplan which delivers none of itwant the #brexit we were promised  then please support @standup4brexit   tell your mp#standup4brexit 
it is now patently clear that the promises and the assurances made by the #leave campaign were never deliverable  so why on earth is the government pressing on with the bankrupt #brexit project  the lives of millions will be negatively impacted  nobody wins  everybody loses  
hi @mike fabricant we know that you re pro #brexit  how about you support our #standup4brexit campaign to reject the #chequersplan  we re grassroots   have pledges of support from the likes of @patel4witham @andreajenkyns @bbradleymp   others we d love to have you onboard 
longworth fumes ‘#chequersplan is a massive fraud on the electorate’ as leave means leave plots  the battle of #brexit  tory donors are starting to ask   why should we continue to support this party that is trying to sell us a pup #standup4brexit 
sadly it s clear that there are millions of racists in the uk and #brexit has given them carte blanche to say what they want with impunity many that voted to #leave did so as they had genuine concerns the tipping point was the racist minority  leaving gives them what they want

it is awfully good of those people over at @peoplesvote uk to remind everyone that the majority of the british public want us to honour the referendum and just get on with brexit  cheers guys #brexit #standup4brexit 
exactly  so jeremy  please can you tell us why you are backing this absolute sellout called the #chequersplan  it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever  it is not the #brexit that we were promised at lancaster house  #chequers is not brexit#standup4brexit 
if jeremy hunt doesn t believe no deal is better than a bad deal  then he is unfit to be foreign secretary  we need cabinet ministers who respect the will of the british people and believe in britain   not project fear pessimists  #standup4brexit #brexit

hey there @dkshrewsbury we wondered if you would #standup4brexit and join our grassroots campaign to reject the #chequersplan  because as you know  #chequers is not #brexit a lot of mps already support us  it would be wonderful to get a pledge of support from you    
project fear planning meeting   we told them they d starve to death and get super herpes and we re still leaving the eu  what next   tell them their football team will be absolutely rubbish   like burnley   worse  #brexit #projectfear #standup4brexit 
hi conorwe seem to have missed that 2nd referendum too    in the meantime let’s get on with delivering the result of the first one  will you join your colleagues   such as @patel4witham @stevebakerhw   @andreajenkyns   in pledging to #standup4brexit 
hi @abridgen  we know that you are pro #brexit so we cannot figure why you have not replied to my tweet earlier in the week will you join the other mps and join our #standup4brexit campaign to reject the #chequersplan i   the other activists would love it if you did  
setting the breathtaking hypocrisy   fuckwittery of this tweet aside    a reminder that stuart was  along with gove  johnson  elliott   cummings  privy to   responsible for  the deepest  darkest recesses of a mendacious  xenophobic and ultimately illegal #voteleave scam campaign  
more and more we hear about how the eu don t want the uk to diverge from its rules and  gain a competitive advantage   that s the point  sticking to brussels rules puts us at a disadvantage  we need to diverge #brexit #standup4brexit 
chris grayling admits that theresa may s #brexit plans are  not easy to sell  to the public that s an understatement so why is he  a supposed #brexiteer  still supporting this shambles time to #chuckchequers#standup4brexit 
#projectfear is nothing but an attempt to scare the public into accepting #chequers #brinoit didn’t work during the referendum and it won’t work now#standup4brexit 
“details of eu meeting that blew away may s brexit plan were suppressed before crucial chequers summit”in summary the original plan would have hurt the eu so @theresa may and @ollyrobbins came up with the #chequersplan  oh dear #standup4brexit 
the eu’s #brexit negotiators fear that they are being bugged by the british secret service  the telegraph understandsnot only are they now running scared of a no deal brexit  they are showing paranoia on a cold war scale#standup4brexit  via @telegraph 
theresa may is preparing a sell out on freedom of movement after brexit and is close to agreeing to a system which is almost identical to the current deal  mep claimsso much for may s oft repeated lie that under her #brexit meant brexit#standup4brexit 
“eurosceptic tories are planning to defy @theresa may by publishing their own alternative blueprint for #brexit”“a paper setting out a framework is set to be published by the european research group of mps and peers next month”#standup4brexit 
“stop worrying   prepare for a no deal brexit  that s how we ll get the best deal possible”says the ⁦@telegraph⁩ as i’ve just said to somebody  there is another way than the #chequersplan  it’s called negotiating #standup4brexit 
which blindingly bonkers unworkable  unviable  and unachievable barking mad brexit are you asking people to stand up for  #standup2brexit not #standup4brexit 
theresa may and the eu hope to dupe the voters with their next #brexit fudge we are not stupid thoughthe public weren t fooled by the #chequersplan they won t be taken in by may s next  inevitable  #brexit capitulation#standup4brexit via @telegraph 
“henry viii managed to pull us out of a distant european bureaucracy    english independent mindedness has served us pretty well in defending our freedoms  today’s brexit is about precisely the same thing”#standup4brexit 
 @theresa may is drawing up a plan to keep key european union rules for longer after #brexit in order to break the deadlock in negotiations  a move that risks angering euroskeptics in her party  now do you see why we need to #standup4brexit folks  
brexiteers plan to challenge may next month by publishing their own positive blueprint for #brexit  which allows for a possible canadian style free trade agreementthe paper is expected to have the backing of 60 to 80 conservative mps#standup4brexit 
hi there @andrew4pendle  we have tweeted you a few times to ask if you will #standup4brexit and reject the #chequersplan  we’re upset that we have not heard from you please can you let us know if you will back our campaign and tell us if you will respect the #brexit vote   
mp for #aberdeensouth @rossthomson mp pledges to #standup4brexit because “the #chequersplan does not deliver the #brexit that the people of the united kingdom voted for” if you want your mp to #standup4brexit make your voice heardfind their email here   
party conference is going to be an interesting affair       conservative brexiteers plan to challenge theresa may directly by publishing their own “positive” blueprint for a #brexit  #standup4brexit 
 bloc of 50 moderate tory mps forms to challenge the brexiteers amid fears of party split so  the question should be  why are they not going to #standup4brexit and why are they not respecting democracy #brexit 
a simply brilliant #standup4brexit pledge video from the great @andreajenkyns“we need to believe in britain  #standup4brexit  god save the queen ” #chequers is not #brexit   #andreajenkyns #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc @borisjohnson @conhome @conservatives @dcbmep

very insulting of phillip lee to call the majority of party members  brextremists   a desire to leave the eu is what the majority of members want  either he should accept that or go the same way as sophie and join the lib dems #brexit #standup4brexit 
report by @mandrews star of an online poll for the shropshire star  shows the county  voted #leave in 2016  now supports a #peoplesvote yet another sign the tide has turned when will may   corbyn face up to the politcal reality on #brexit   
 the immediate consequences of a “no deal” #brexit in march could be worse for the #eu than for britain  senior brussels figures have said  so  why do we have this #chequersplan which is an outright capitulation #standup4brexit 
our @staffmoortories team had a stand at manifold show  everyone who visited us was very angry about the pm s #chequersplan  they didn t see it as real #brexit   now prefer no deal  staffordshire moorlands voted 64 7  to leave the eu so let s #standup4brexit  #chequersmeanscorbyn

some tory mps will boycott the conservative party conferencethe remainers among them who have been trying to sabotage #brexit are too chicken to talk face to face with grassroots members angry over the #chequersplansuch cowardice #standup4brexit 
in 1975 young people voted en masse for  yes  to stay in the common market  in 2016 those 20 and 30 something pro europeans had become the 60 and 70 year olds who turned out in droves to vote leave people become more eurosceptic as they grow older #brexit #standup4brexit

i admire   respect @deborahmeaden so much 4speaking up  really on behalf others  because she’s financially secureso many r self serving but more r speaking out now  #brexit dominates my thinking but wonder how so many #leave politicians just don’t care 
let s be honest this govt is cancelling all police leave from next march onwardsbecause it knows the most rabid #leave voters will riotwhen they see how badly #brexit turns out for them  these people will burn down mps  homes  set fire to their cars and punish their lies   
thanks to @henrysmithuk for this great video pledging his support for #standup4brexit  and his reasons whywe need more mps like henry  who are prepared to stand up against the #chequersplan in order to ensure that the #brexit we were promised is delivered  
 we can harden #brexit after we leave the european union  says deputy chairman of the #conservative party there we have it  they want us to accept the #chequersplan knowing it fails to meet what was promised  it is time to #standup4brexit 
“we will not have truly left the european union if we are not in control of our own laws” @theresa may   lancaster houseask your mp to #standup4brexit and support mrs may’s original promises #chequers is not #brexit  let’s get brexit back on track

first letters to party members  then eu makes a new offer  then downing st chooses to stoke the boris row  anecdotal yes  but watch the #brexit pea very carefully  this could be a moment of danger for leavers  #maymustgonow #standup4brexit 
i agreed to be interviewed to explain more about the grassroots #standup4brexit campaign   my input into it  here is the result our goal is simple  we seek the #brexit that we were promisedto bring together those of us that oppose the #chequersplan 
this is not about the burka  it s all about #brexit does anyone doubt this phoney outrage is being orchestrated against@borisjohnson by 10 downing street #standup4brexit

when the #brexit #chequersplan is so much of a #brexitbetrayal they spend around £70k writing to party members with spin   lies there will be movement of people  ecj will have a hold over us   we will still pay  i can’t believe the absolute lies in this #standup4brexit

great to see so many picking up the #standup4brexit hashtag  we need to keep going to get the positive brexit we voted for and not the watered down “leave limitation” being put forward by olly robbins via his puppet theresa may  #brexitnowornever#chequersmeanscorbyn

this superb letter appeared in our local paper @hertsad today i recommend everybody adapts it and emails sends to their own mp we have to counter the #leave campaign lies  the growing influence of #reesmogg   his fascists and together stop a #nodealbrexit #brexit #stopbrexit

i voted to remain in #europe   am very anti #brexit but the public cast their vote   there shouldn t be a 2nd chance #democracy is a responsibility   if some #leave voters now regret their decision  tough shit  that s what you get for believing the media   @nigel farage   
a vital thread  something we   others have looked at in the past  yet  as with other strands in the #brexit #voteleave #tory #trump #scl #cambridgeanalytica #aiq story the msm have pretty much ignored the connection  article below may help your research   
on tomorrow’s @telegraph front page  as part of their pledge to #standup4brexit “dozens of senior tory grassroots members  including more than 30 conservative association chairmen  warn the prime minister that her plan ‘doesn’t deliver the brexit that we were promised’”#cpc18 
boris johnson“unlike the prime minister i campaigned for #brexit  unlike the prime minister i fought for this  i believe in it  i think it’s the right thing for our country and i think that what is happening now is  alas  not what people were promised in 2016”#standup4brexit 
as it is #cpc18 eve  let s remember last #cpc when the pm promised a #brexit deal that was based on lancaster house instead we got given #chequers do remember that chequers isn t the lancaster house vision   #standup4brexit #cpc18 #chuckchequers 
now there s a coincidence  all the main uk car makers have       er       completely independently       made project fear warnings re brexit which remoaner business secretary greg clark just happens to agree with   on the eve of the tory conference  fancy that  #standup4brexit

why does the pm dismiss canada plus is it because it beats chequers in every conceivable way and she doesn t want to admit that she should have gone with canada  from day one irresponsible and wrong decision  canada  is the way #standup4brexit #brexit 
thank you for pledging to #standup4brexit to @jwhittingdale  vice chair of the exiting the eu select committee   former secretary of stateour aim is to ensure the delivery of the brexit promised at lancaster house  the @iealondon s #planaplus achieves that  chequers does not

really sorry to see this response to @andreajenkyns from the mp for #thurrockwe’d really like to see you pledge to #standup4brexit jackie  on behalf of your electorate who voted overwhelmingly to leave the euchequers is not brexit  
thank you to @martinvickers for pledging to #standup4brexit it’s so important that we keeping pushing to ensure the brexit we voted for is deliveredif your mp hasn’t pledged yet please email them and ask them to  
great to see you tweeting on brexit penny  your comments regarding the eu’s behaviour and people’s determination to see the referendum result enacted are spot on  time to pledge to #standup4brexit  
#brexit was never going to work the way the #leave liars said it would why would anyone ever believe the uk could have all the benefits of eu membership for trade  but not have to pay and not have to follow the rules it was cleary a lie  
we do not need another referendum on #brexit  we already had a #peoplesvote in 2016  if politicians don t deliver the will of the british people  then trust in politics will be permanently destroyed  #bbcqt #standup4brexit #respecttheresult 
may must deliver a ceta  fta as promised at lancaster house  any move to keep the uk in the single market via norway style deal would be a complete betrayal of the brexit vote“i want to be clear  what i am proposing cannot mean membership of the single market”#standup4brexit 
thanks so much to mike penning for pledging to #standup4brexit todaychequers may be dead in the water  but a real brexit is still far from a certainty  if your mp hasn t pledged yet  please email them and ask them to #standup4brexit 
no  we voted for brexit and we have a viable option which is @dexeugov’s canada    norway is not #brexit#standup4brexit 
so the realisation that the uk is leaving   or rather our massive financial contribution is leaving and they will all need to cough up   is dawning on them  tough  you had a chance to offer reform and did nothing so deal with it #standup4brexit #brexit no to a   #peoplesvote

momentum are supporting a #peoplesvote   well if that bunch of revolutionary trots think something is a good idea then we know it s anything but #brexit #standup4brexit 
chequers “will need to be reworked and further negotiated” @donaldtusk if by reworked you mean turned into a canada  fta  then yes we agree donaldchequers is less popular than the poll tax  doesn’t deliver brexit   is a very bad deal#standup4brexit 
190 days to go next stop #brexit#standup4brexit 
why are the government being so tin eared to the popular   workable fta  solution that delivers the brexit we voted for what promises have the government made to the eu  or automotive manufacturers for example  that prevents them from delivering real brexit #standup4brexit 
chequers is unpopular with the public  tory mps and the party membership at large and also unacceptable to the eucanada  is popular with the public  tort mps and party members and on offer from the eu which one should we go for #brexit #standup4brexit 
good god  how arrogant and out of touch are you chequers is a sellout and breaches each of the governments own red lines  its time to #standup4brexit for the canada plus brexit that we were promised   
which do you prefer for #brexitplease retweet after voting#brexit #standup4brexit #conservatives 
this is exactly what brexiteers have been arguing for months  irish border is an easily solvable problem with a little imagination and has been shamelessly politicised by the eu  good to hear them starting to come to their senses#brexit #standup4brexit 
there’s a deal on the table that respects  1  the referendum result  2  the lancaster house speech  3  manifesto and election promises  4  the eus red lines  5  the uks red lines  the eu made the offer in march  we should take it as a starting point  #standup4brexit 
it’s amazing how weak the second referendum argument is “this is a vote on how we leave”   so no need for a remain option then  ids clearly enjoyed watching @chukaumunna fail to convince the remain supporting @piersmorgan#standup4brexit 
may says that it’s chequers or no dealgiven that chequers is brino   less popular than the poll tax  we disagreethe eu have admitted that technological border solutions are possible  therefore so is an ftawe must deliver the brexit promised in our manifesto#standup4brexit 
“#standup4brexit activist @joeporteruk delivered a passionate speech outlining why the uk should not submit to a second referendum on the final brexit deal  claiming that if the referendum was re run ‘people would never trust politicians again’”

 @michaelgove admits pm’s plan for #brexit is temporary – and could be changed in years to come unbelievable  so why are brexiteers in government backing this #chequers nonsense if #chequers is no good  stand by your principles and #standup4brexit

#leavers claim a #peoplesvote would cause rioting people can now see #brexit is an act of monumental stupidity that will damage the economy  jobs and people lives  i doubt if #leave could muster enough rioters to fill a minibus in the event of #brexit being overturned  
thank you so much to @bernardjenkin for pledging to #standup4brexit  the british people voted very clearly to leave the eu and that was the policy of the british government  but the so called chequers proposals will not deliver the brexit that the british people voted for   
how the #brexit vote was tainted  ⁦@jolyonmaugham⁩ explains yesterday’s court judgment   the implications for #voteleave   the #dup  it’s time to ask how a vote procured by lies   illegality can be allowed to stand 
well you know what  i m 35 and i ve been in the eu eec my whole life and no one asked me until 2016 whether i wanted to be part of it  we voted leave and it would be crazy to re run the vote without enacting it first  #bbcqt #brexit #standup4brexit 
we already knew #voteleave cheated  now the high court rules that they were also wrongly allowed by the electoral commission do things they shouldn’t  the basis for #brexit looking ever dodgier   
main reasons for a #peoplesvote now proven wrong   @electoralcommuk confirmed #voteleave s actions  £350m week will go to the #nhs  roaming charges unchanged after #brexit     but don t worry  utlra remainers will find another  democratic  reason to try to overturn #brexit 
even the pound has shrugged off carney’s no deal brexit warning and stayed on course to deliver its best week in seven months #standup4brexit 
so a no deal brexit means house prices will crash  we won t be able to fly or drive abroad  our car industry will cease to exist  we ll run out of sandwiches  we won t have passports  we ll suffer bubonic plague etc   etc        but nobody believes a word of it  #standup4brexit

remoaners last week jumped on a report last week that said uk citizens could need a visa to visit france  sensible people knew this to be more project fear nonsense  it s wonderful to see another brexit scare story trashed #marr #brexit #standup4brexit #peoplesvote 
because they have no arguments left  #brexit is a disaster managed by the incompetent   won in 2016 by fraud and lies  now we have the facts  they know they would lose because the next #leave campaign couldn t lie    they d just get laughed at with a slow hand clap to failure

in the last year no fewer than 75 official polls were carried out on #brexit  out of those 75  only 2 showed a lead for #leave  our politicians have simply run out of excuses  public opinion has changed  we must not leave the eu  the british people unequivocally reject it  
if the figures are to be believed  bucket of salt   700 000 people attended the #losersmarch in london today 16 141 241 voted remain in 2016  so that means remain have lost 15 4 million supporters 11 334 226 voted conservative in 2015 to gain the eu referendum #standup4brexit

“the treasury predicted all sorts of things in the run up to the referendum  including over 800 000 people being made unemployed  growth declining rapidly  and actually we’ve seen over the last 2 years a very healthy and stable economy” @patel4witham#standup4brexit #projectfear 
“if ministers spent time preparing for a no deal scenario  rather than dreaming up silly scare stories  we could all make a success of our post brexit future  let’s be optimistic – we have a great future ahead of us” @patel4witham#standup4brexit #ditchthedeal #projectfear 
today  philip hammond will announce  project fear mk2   the latest treasury figures that will surprisingly show the govt s deal is best  we ve seen this somewhere before    #brexit #standup4brexit 
“the withdrawal agreement is not intended to be the final stage of a transition to a “softer brexit”  but rather the next stage in the establishment’s campaign – which began the day after the referendum – to reverse brexit”#standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
buckle in folks  cabinet are unleashing #projectfear mk99999 today  problem is all treasury #brexit predictions have been rubbish   they refuse to provide assumptions   data moreover  government refuse to publish legal advice     #ditchthedeal #standup4brexit 
no one voted to be poorer   if con mps vote for pms #brexit deal they’ll be doing it for them  govt set to publish yet more evidence that which ever way you cut it #brexit will make us all poorer   well apart from the well heeled #leave leaders 
“look  it may be a pile of poo  but everyone’s bored with brexit so the sooner we can get it done  the less time people have to notice i’ve handed over 39 billion quid to barnier for nothing…” #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
remember what the #leaveeu campaign promised about #brexit   
if theresa may s brexit betrayal somehow gets through parliament  how would you vote in the next general election please vote and retweet #standup4brexit 
we’re very happy to announce that @stevedouble has become the 58th mp to pledge to #standup4brexit  a brexit that honours the government’s manifesto promises of leaving the customs union  single market and ecj thanks for your support steve   
erg members bleating that brexit  was never about freedom of movement  after such a xenophobic #voteleave campaign is very hard to swallow although it is true the real prize for them was always the low tax uk economy undermining eu standardseither way we re not having it  
 may´s #brexit deal is worst of all worlds and doomed to fail  says may loyalist sir michael fallon#ditchthedeal#standup4brexit 
theresa may s brexit deal is  the worst of all worlds  and  is doomed   q  is mrs may doomed  a  that s up to my colleagues q  i don t take that as a warm endorsement  a  take it as you wish #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
thoughtful  considered   logical from @normanlamb representing a heavily #leave voting constituency he’s well placed to conclude may’s #brexit deal won’t heal the nation he’s voting against the deal   backing a #peoplesvote #finalsay 
“unless the tories change leader  change tack and make brexit a success  they are doomed to defeat whenever an election is held”#standup4brexit #ditchthedeal #voteitdown 
bwahahaha  theresa may  if you don t back my deal we will risk delivering on our manifesto of leaving the eu what you need to do is accept my deal  remaining  or risk not leaving  remaining  goodbye conservatives  hello ukip #brexit #peoplesvote #standup4brexit 
brexit con  the fact that arch remainer ken clarke has said he will vote for theresa may s deal tells you all you need to know about the deal s real pro eu nature  it is not the freedom from eu interference and control for which that we voted  #liberty #standup4brexit 
may’s aim to push her awful deal through via labour mps will not go down well with conservative mps  members or those who lent their vote in order to see brexit delivered #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal #voteitdown 
i don t want to be in a political union with those doing massive natural gas deals with russia whilst underfunding nato and planning a pan continental army  may is entrenching our defence policy within an expansionist group of corrupt megalomaniacs #brexit #standup4brexit 
retweet this if you support the united kingdom leaving the european union without a deal let s show the westminster bubble just how many of us there are  #standup4brexit 
the only thing theresa may has been honest about in relation to brexit is  she is a “bloody difficult woman” the mistake we all made was thinking that was aimed at the eu and not her own party and the electorate    #standup4brexit 
correct we want @theresa may to stand aside  so that we can appoint a leader of the conservative party who will honour the conservative party manifesto promise to #leave the eu  sm   cu  every current tory mp stood for the hoc on in the 2017ge we must deliver #brexit promise  
don’t know about everyone else but i didn’t vote leave for a ‘compromise #brexit’  i wanted 2b free from the e u    take back control of our borders law waters trade etc instead we are going 2b ruled by an an overseas body #sellout #betrayal #standup4brexit #withdrawalagreement 
breaking  #brexit twist   #mep #danhannan reveals crippling flaw in #theresamay s plan that no one has noticed   listen to what dan has to say  to think  the @conservatives welcome this stupid imbecile running the country   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #nodeal 
this brexit deal is exactly what i feared  a hotel california brexit where we check  out and never leave is going to be the worst of both worlds  conservative members and officers need to join the mps that have already pledged to #standup4brexit and voice there genuine concern  
warning to all #brexiteers  the 27 #europeanunion leaders just took under 40 minutes to officially endorse #theresamay s #brexitplan  that s how bad it is for #britain  the #eu wants this deal so much  we must now #brexit with a #nodeal  #standup4brexit @dcbmep @andreajenkyns 
i wonder when the high majority  in post tory mps who ve been  told  to promote this farce of a #brexit deal  will take notice of what people are telling them    realise that they are shockingly out of touch with those who elected them #standup4brexit 
self  self  self  never mind about the country  need to resign  put their letters in   when the no confidence vote comes about  shortly after deal being voted down  install a new #pm   change of direction  the #conservative party is suffering a slow death  #brexit #standup4brexit 
with possibility of a no deal brexit increasing by the day  the machinery of government needs to urgently step up its pace to prepare for this outcome  the serious lack of preparation by ministers   civil servants is shocking   a betrayal of national duty  #standup4brexit #marr 
being told philip hammond will resign if there s no deal is like hearing gary lineker will delete his twitter account if england win the world cup #wtobrexit #brexit #standup4brexit 
‘@dupleader arlene foster has announced her party will not back theresa may’s brexit deal when it goes to a vote in the commons in a massive blow to the prime minister on the eve of a crunch eu summit #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
theresa may abandoned northern ireland  and now gibraltar whilst giving into every single eu demand  enough is enough  #maymustgo and tory mps must #standup4brexit  she is turning the uk into a vassal state   has caved into every single eu demand whilst giving them £39bn on top  
this is what #standup4brexit is about    to show those that leant the conservatives their vote  as well as loyal conservative voters   members  that a significant proportion of conservative mps will honour their commitments   fight for the brexit that was promised #ditchthedeal 
“there can be no doubt that the british people  and their representatives in the house of commons  think that brexit should go ahead  we made a promise  now let’s stick to that promise” @andreajenkyns#standup4brexit 
we’re very happy to announce that @rehman chishti has become the 57th mp to pledge to #standup4brexit  a brexit that honours the government’s manifesto promises of leaving the customs union  single market and ecj thanks for your support rehman  
“nothing in this political declaration changes the hard reality  we should junk forthwith the backstop  upon which the future economic partnership  according to this political declaration  is to be based    which makes a complete nonsense of brexit” @borisjohnson#standup4brexit 
spot on @tnewtondunn it will take years to deliver #brexit more   more #leave voters now know they were sold lots of phoney promises eg we’d get a deal in a day which would deliver “the exact same benefits of the customs union and single market” truth is #brexit is undeliverable  
“this is not a good and fair brexit  it is not fair to the 17 4 million people who voted to leave in 2016  and isn t good enough for many who voted to remain either  a deal that delivers on the referendum is possible  and this isn t it ” @teamranil#standup4brexit 
“in the referendum people voted to take back control of our fish  yet now the prime minister wants to commit us to stay in the common fisheries policy in all but name  she seeks to enter a new fisheries agreement on access to waters   quota shares” @sheryllmurray#standup4brexit 
theresa may has focused so much on the eu side of the negotiations that she s forgotten about her own uk side  her deal cannot command the support of parliament  she has literally no idea how angry the british people are  what happened to brexit means brexit  #standup4brexit 
“the message to the tories is simple  if you stop brexit  if you betray the voters’ trust  you will end up with corbyn  the country will be wrecked  and you will be to blame  tory mps  it’s now up to you” @allisterheath#standup4brexit 
“the people of romford are deeply unhappy with the proposed eu deal  which does not represent the brexit they voted for  will the pm now think again    and cut away the tentacles of the eu over our cherished island nation once and for all” @andrewrosindell#standup4brexit #pmqs 
ridiculous that amber rudd can be reappointed to cabinet and then be allowed to publicly dismiss the idea of a no deal brexit   #standup4brexit 
“i think the first point that needs to be made is that the eu offered an free trade agreement back in march with zero tariffs on goods    the delivery of sovereignty  which i believe is what most brexit voters wanted  is worth it” #standup4brexit activist @peterward09 
thanks to julian lewis mp for pledging to #standup4brexit  taking the number of mps supporting a true brexit to 56 “if this goes through  and if brexit is sold out in this way  there is no doubt in my mind that the conservative party will be annihilated at the next election”  
we’re very happy to announce that @desmondswayne has become the 55th mp to pledge to #standup4brexit  a brexit that honours the government’s manifesto promises of leaving the customs union  single market and ecj thanks for your support desmond   
“we have been led by the nose and we’ve ended up conceding this dreadful backstop as a result  it’s clear to me there was a referendum mandate  we have to honour it  and if that means there isn’t a deal  then we will leave without one” @simonclarkemp#standup4brexit 
we were the ones out there leafleting and knocking on doors in the pouring rain  this was not the #brexit we voted for pleased to have signed this open letter to the @telegraph alongside 18 other #leave groups asking mps to vote this horrendous  deal  down  
just when exactly did remain voting mps accept the result of the referendum  and your threat that we accept being a satellite state of the eu or we remain isn’t democratic  #standup4brexit 
we’re very happy to announce that @timloughton has become the 54th mp to pledge to #standup4brexit  a brexit that honours the government’s manifesto promises of leaving the customs union  single market and ecj thanks for your support tim   
after mps had gone back to their constituents over weekend was expecting more letters calling @theresa may to go  mps must  be looking after themselves on the gravy train it will not be forgotten or forgivenon next ge day #brexit #brexitbetrayal #maymustgo#standup4brexit 
having read @brexitcentral summary of the #withdrawalagreement   makes me rather sick  we have given away almost every trump card  1  39 bil  2  #fishing  3  right to be part of future decisions and 4  the right to leave #eu when we want   this is suicide #brexit#leaveeu 
irish pm leo varadkar has said that theresa may will not be allowed to make any changes to the eu withdrawl agreement  ireland  backed by eu  now tells the uk what it can and cannot do  the eu have clearly always been in control of the brexit negotiations  #standup4brexit 
52 tory mps have said publicly they will #standup4brexit yet 48 letters have not gone in to graham brady  so some still think may can deliver brexit  are they mad  
“you can’t say let’s have a referendum and then run it again because you don’t like the result    you’ve got to be careful how you treat people    this line ‘they didn’t know what they were doing’  it’s very rude to say that to people by the way” alexander downer#standup4brexit 
well   there should be a first referendum on the final deal   commonly known as a #finalsay or a #peoplesvote   we had the 2nd referendum #leave lost the 1st one by a supermajority in 1975 #stopbrexit 
i have never before wanted to leave the eu as much as i do now  i hope other brexiteers feel the same and it s not just me #standup4brexit #maymustgo #brexit 
#suellabraverman who resigned as #brexit minister says that the final ahreement document included clauses that neither she nor #dominicraab the #brexitsecretary had ever seen  clearly only #theresamay and #ollyrobbins knew what was going on  #standup4brexit @dcbmep #brexit #tory 
this is from may this year  but it is relevant    whitehall brexit adviser olly robbins ‘held back key advice’ on tech that could solve the irish border issue why did he hold it back what was done about it #standup4brexit #brexit 
down 5 points  i suspect that will get worse  we were once 20  points ahead  this #brexit plan is not working  a marxist  communist  anti semitic nutter is 3 points ahead  just think on that  thing is  this could be fixed if government would listen #standup4brexit 
i would like to thank every single one of these #conservative #mps who are standing up for the 17 410 742 who voted for #brexit  and putting their country  first  we all thank you   @theresa may must go   letters to the #1922  #bbc #sky #lbc #standup4brexit @conhome @dcbmep 
as a lifelong member   voter of the @conservatives and a true blue #tory  large t  i am truly disgusted by the complete #treachery of @theresa may  i hope you are condemned by your actions and your lies #theresamay forever  #standup4brexit @dcbmep @andreajenkyns @conhome #brexit  
“brexit remains the most salient local issue i’ve encountered on the doorstep  the single greatest risk today to our local election success next year  is sticking with theresa may’s current brexit deal  i’ve read it  and it does not deliver brexit” @robbielammas#standup4brexit 
some who voted #leave re #brexit did so because they believe conspiracy theories about secretive international organisations ironically  if there is one  it’s a right wing one   bannon   banks are key players  those leave voters are their useful idiots  
the consensus among all brexit campaign groups now is that we must reject may s proposal  #standup4brexit and democracy and demand a true brexitso please write to your mp asap and demand that they seek a true brexit  and please join afb  @leavers britain and other groups today  
out in #nottingham campaigning for @peoplesvote uk this is ian from ilkeston  he voted #leave #brexit he’s changed his mind he wants a  #peoplesvote   backs us staying in #eu 
the top 40 horrors lurking in the small print of theresa may’s brexit deal this deal is an act of treason her majesty @queen uk surely can not grant this royal asset #brexit #standup4brexit 
72 per cent of surveyed conservative members are against the prime minister’s draft deal  preferring a clean brexit #standup4brexit 
if you do not hand your letter into the 1922 committee  i will have no choice as my local mp to do everything in my power to ensure you are never elected again  backing theresa may on this is just as traitorous as her signing it off  hugo  #standup4brexit and send in your letter  
“frenetic efforts to save pm   her #brexit plan”“government whips told to exert extreme pressure on mps”“downing st operation in overdrive”can’t they see it is so unpopular it has gone down like a bucket of cold sick  please just #standup4brexit 
#tory #brexiteer @abridgen questions whether #grahambrady has invested in a  deluxe shredding machine    are we there yet   i personally would not trust graham with my pet hamster      he is a @theresa may loyalist   so hiding things comes naturally  #standup4brexit #brexit #tory 
200 #city bosses have written to #mps demanding they vote down @theresa may’s deal as ‘the greatest act of national humiliation in this proud nation’s recent history ’ quite so  pathetic treacherous @theresa may  #standup4brexit @dcbmep @brexitstewart @andreajenkyns #brexit #uk 
more than 200 chief executives have called on conservative mps to vote down theresa may’s brexit deal  describing it as “the worst of all worlds”   accusing it of “offering the eu carte blanche”   “selling british business down the river”#standup4brexit 
you ll be doing nothing of the sort  your role is to take orders from unelected remainer civil servant olly robbins  if you really believe in #brexit then  please stand down  may s lashed herself to the mast  you don t have to suffer her fate too  #standup4brexit #maymustgonow 
#theresamay said that keeping britain in the #customsunion  would betray the vote of the #british people  @theresa may lied to all of us  time for the #conservativeparty to sack this liar   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #maymustgo #chuckmay @andreajenkyns #brexit

the nation will never forgive you if you fail to deliver the brexit the public voted for and the for breaking your manifesto commitment  shackling us to the eu in perpetuity is not brexit #standup4brexit #brexit #changeleader

“the only way we’re going to get the brexit that the people voted for is to change the policy  and the only way to change the policy now is to change the prime minister i think no deal is better than a bad deal  and this is a bad deal” @peterboneuk#standup4brexit 
why the pm’s deal is not #brexit  we will be rule takers not rule makers we won’t control our laws we won’t have control of our money we won’t have control of our borders it stops us agreeing trade deals#standup4brexit details  
“all along  it feels like this has been characterised by timidity ”the eloquent @portilloandhen sums up the problem with the pm’s #brexit plan   that trust is now a big issue   suggests that the backstop could be handled differently#standup4brexit 
the perfect explanation from @timothy stanley  as to why a #nodeal outcome is better than #theresamay s faux brexit   the eu could potentially do a lot of things to us that could do some harm    and if we want to walk away  we can t    #standup4brexit 
“we had the referendum and it was a significant majority  today it is perfectly clear that parliament is not going to accept the withdrawal arrangements that theresa may has negotiated” @billcashmp#standup4brexit 
so another #brexit secretary resigns   joins @stevebakerhw   @daviddavismp who resigned from the same department see the similarities  there’s clearly an issue in that the ministry is disregarded by the leadership it must stop now #standup4brexit 
 @dominicraab has put principles and country above party and resigned as brexit secretary  “i don’t want to submit to the blackmail of my country”  the pm s deal does not deliver brexit  #standup4brexit 
read how the cabinet came to sell out the country  and remember who said what the prime minister  on the steps of no 10  then threatened the nation with ‘accept this utter monstrosity of a deal’ or have no brexit at all email your mp #standup4brexit 
as a life long conservative voter the electorate are not fools  those mps   ministers who back the unmitigated disaster  which is the pms #brexit plan    consequently sellout the uk   democracy  will feel the wrath of the electorate at the ballot box #standup4brexit #brexit  
any cabinet member that refuses to resign over this shambles and sell out will never have a chance for the leadership when the inevitable happens   theresa may is gone  not just for the sake of their country  but for their own political careers they need to resign #standup4brexit 
i m with @jacob rees mogg  the prime minister shouldn t have said that  no deal is better than a bad deal  if she didn t truly believe it  threatening people with not delivering brexit is deeply undignified   #standup4brexit 
no deal is better than a bad deal  @theresa may has said this umpteen times herself  she has came back with a bad deal so mps have a duty to turn this deal down   ensure we get a quick  clean exit from the european union on march 29th 2019 and revert to wto terms  #standup4brexit 
as a lifelong member   voter of the @conservatives and a true blue #tory  large t  i am truly disgusted by the complete #treachery of @theresa may  i hope you are condemned by your actions and your lies #theresamay forever  #standup4brexit @dcbmep @andreajenkyns @conhome #brexit  
“the proposal presented to cabinet is a capitulation  if you believe people voted for brexit to restore surrendered sovereignty  reform our economy and change the country  you will find it a horror show” nick timothy#standup4brexit 
but it s not #brexit in any form #standup4brexit 
very disappointed in the prime minister for threatening that  if this deal doesn t get through parliament there may be no brexit   you clearly never believed that  no deal is better than a bad deal   the british people will never forgive this dishonesty  #standup4brexit

jacob rees mogg  brexit has become an issue of trust – and this government has lost it    #moggmentum #standup4brexit 
if conservative mps were serious   genuinely want to #standup4brexit and the will of the british people  then start handing letters into the 1922 committee  immediately  less talk  more action  if something isn t done imminently then no conservative mp will ever be elected again  
if the pm s #brexitdeal keeps us locked in the eu through the backdoor  then that wouldn t be brexit  we would be rule takers  instead of our own rule makers  this isn t what people voted for  politicians shouldn t underestimate the scale of anger there would be  #standup4brexit 
the dup have been the only consistent party in relation to brexit  thanks arlene  we share the want to defend the integrity of the united kingdom  #standup4brexit 
i totally agree with @jacob rees mogg on the pm s brexit deal   she hasn t so much struck a deal as surrendered to brussels and given in to everything they want  it is not so much the vassal state anymore as the slave state   #standup4brexit 
#brexit so we the 17 4million voters who respect and protect our freedom  sovereignty and democracy  fought for across two world wars in modern times  expect ll members of our goverment to resign for anything less than  #leave as voted for  
conservative cabinet ministers should understand that  should they fail to stand up for the brexit that the british people voted for  they will never be forgiven  #standup4brexit

sure many millions of uk citizens would agree with this johnson   yet  perhaps we should hold off with the unbridled praise   if he flipped and laid bare the criminality behind the #voteleave campaign  led by his brother  now that would make him an mp with real ‘principles ’

as a disabled person and fan of steam trains  as relevant as your credentials   i believe people like you should give it a rest and accept the result  you were elected as mp on basis of an general election manifesto pledge which respected the eu referendum result  #standup4brexit 
theresa may has been forced to abandon plans for an emergency cabinet meeting to approve a brexit deal  after fresh opposition from her cabinet and brussels plunged her timetable into turmoil #standup4brexit #binthebackstop 
hi @dominicraab please remember the manifesto promises that were made to loyal supporters  and those lending their vote for the first time  a backstop that leaves us tied to the eu indefinitely  and is harder to leave that the eu  is not brexit #standup4brexit #binthebackstop 
hi @liamfox please remember the manifesto promises that were made to loyal supporters  and those lending their vote for the first time  they voted conservative in order to see brexit delivered  please make the right decision #standup4brexit 
thank you shahmir for exposing mathew elliott s right wing vipers nest pulling strings @10downingstreet and @bbc   not only a collection of opaque #voteleave entities   but also #leaveeu spin off  leave means leave  the epicentre of the #brexitscam     
phillip  you were elected on a manifesto that promised to deliver #brexit you have reneged on that pledge you think you know better than the 17 4m who voted to #leave how arrogant is that you should take time to reflect on what you have done  
 @theresa may has been plunged into a deeper crisis after brussels rejected her key #brexit proposal which was intended to avoid the uk being trapped in the customs union 2 years to bring us to this point  how much time have we wasted somebody #standup4brexit   sort this mess 
 @justinegreening says @theresa may is ‘handing power to eu’ in brexit deal  may is accused of planning the biggest giveaway of sovereignty in modern times”when remainers   leavers join to say #chequers is wrong  then its very wrong #standup4brexit 
“mps will block may’s brexit plan” “eu turn off life support”if only a group of well researched mps had warned the prime minister this would happen    oh wait  they did  they also pledged to #standup4brexit 
bad news for the #referendum #sorelosers who desperately want another vote   both #theresamay and #jeremycorbyn have ruled out stopping #brexit  now we need to stand up and demand the proper brexit we voted for   #standup4brexit @dcbmep @brexitstewart

remainer resigns from government stating all the issues the brexit mps have said for months  perhaps now more mps will #standup4brexit and push the gov to deliver its mandate  negotiating a bad deal won’t make us want to remain  it’ll make us want to change the party of gov

a second referendum will divide us  so will her deal  the only option to unite the country is a no deal brexit which deliveries on the wishes of the 17 4m who voted to leave  #standup4brexit hugo   #leavemeansleave

 1 2  which #brexit deal did you vote for julia  the answer is none as no concrete plan was even published nevermind put to any vote  this greatly helped to achieve the narrow #leave win as lack of specifics meant brexit could be sold as all things to all people  #brexitshambles 
despite what the screaming headlines would have you believe  the grieve amendment is not legally binding  no 10 are spinning that it s a disaster for brexit in order to push that it’s may’s deal or a 2nd ref there’s still 0  chance of a 2nd ref #standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
and so it starts   the slow drip drip drip of the media  suggesting  we could withdraw #article50 began on @bbcnews at   now continues   is this a conspiracy to start to truly undermine #brexit   to brainwash us we need to stand firm   we voted to #leave and #leavemeansleave 
the bbc’s decision to call off the brexit tv debate between theresa may   jeremy corbyn is thanks to brexiteer mps  clearly the bbc felt unable to ensure that the “views of those who voted leave were represented at the same level as others”#standup4brexit #ditchthedeal 
@jolyonmaugham @joannaccherry making very strong point that #leave ran 2 contradictory campaigns aimed at different groups promising different things  there was never a workable single brexit plan that commanded a majority  this was the major dishonesty perpetrated on the people 
if your constituency voted 70  for brexit @johnnymerceruk  you should vote against the pm s deal  it doesn t deliver what the british people voted for  we need a real brexit where we become a sovereign  independent  free trading country #politicslive #ditchthedeal #standup4brexit

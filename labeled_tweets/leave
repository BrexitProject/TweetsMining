the #leave vote was for a ragbag of incompatible proposals  there is no majority for any final #brexit deal democracy in crisis #remain
two sorts of people voted to #leave  those who believed the lies and those who told the lies  #leavelies #brexit #meaningfulvote @thetimes
if you voted #leave  but have little or no cash wealth  you may wish to read about profiteers and arbitrage as you pay the price of #brexit 
whatever the final #brexit deal  many #leave voters will say  this is not what i voted for the folly of government by a 4 word slogan 
some of my family voted #leave because they believed leave campaign that their relative wouldn t be #brexit #bargainingchip  rude awakening

strong @nytimes piece  was #brexit suicide  no  #leave deceived voters  but it would be suicide to continue with it 
the head of vote #leave had close russian ties including to a suspected russian spy #stopbrexit #brexit
this     nail on the head a percentage of those who didn t vote did not vote out of complacency  as most of the #brexit news has been negative  non voters will turn to #remainadd in those who are #remainernow   elderly #leave voters now deceased     #stopbrexit #fbpe
the latest world economic league table states that britain has recovered from an initial economic blip after the vote to #leave and now looks set to maintain its position in the rankings and improve by 2020 after #brexit 
delia here decided to talk about her #brexit regret first thing christmas morning  she sets out her reasons for her #leave vote in a number of tweets which i will thread below  all good reasons but now wants to #remain   reason 1  #fbpe #stopbrexit
russian campaigning for #leave and #trump was not inconsequential  it was part of #putin’s strategy to expand russian power by undermining cooperation between real democracies  by pursuing #brexit we’re doing exactly what putin wants  
because #leave is not about #economics  it would be dead in the water if it were makes no economic sense  leave is uk s very own  rightwing #populism  like trump  #afd  #frontnational the eternal tory #proxywar re  europe has had many manifestations this one is called  #brexit 
my mother voted #leave because she trusted the commitment to £350m for the nhs  she is angry that promise will not happen  she’s not online  so persuaded by press   bus  mum wants another referendum  she feels she’s been lied to  #brexit
if you voted #leave in #euref and feel like julie  be brave admit you are wrong and start taking steps to let mps and lords know  come forward and help change #brexit course  #remainernow #exitbrexit #fbpe
11 conservative mps placed the wellbeing of their country before the undemocratic power grabbing aspirations of their party  they deserve our gratitude  that they numbered only 11 is shameful #stopbrexit #brexit #withdrawalbill #exitfrombrexit #ukpolitics #leave #meaningfulvote

britons were massively misinformed on the main #brexit issues  in all cases to the advantage of the #leave campaign john major said  if they decide to leave on the basis of inaccurate information     then i regard that to be deceitful #stopbrexit #fbpe
if you voted #leave   you still think #brexit is a good idea  please think about whose interests the leaders of the two leave campaigns serve   it s not the interests of the ordinary people who voted leave  
#marr there are plenty of other #leave campaigners in #brexit referendum who did say we should stay in #singlemarket
post may s brexit  a romanian working in mcd can still bring over his wife 4 kids and parents to live in britain with better rights than us brits  and they can take their case all the way to the ecj  how is this fair  #brexit #nodeal #leaveeu pls rt and like if you agree
i discovered today that some generally well informed anti #brexit #labour voters were unaware that even in #leave voting lab seats  majority of lab voters chose #remain  i shared this    
question for #leavers  as the uk government didn t know what the consequences of #brexit would be  and they still don t apparently  how can you claim you made an informed decision when you voted to #leave the eu 
this is what pisses me off more than anything about #brexit   there was no consensus on what #voteleave actually meant  still isn’t   these options should have been on ballot paper for clarity  uk being pushed off a cliff when the majority was actually for #remain  #stopbrexit
 brexit is not the answer to social injustice that many poor #leave voters wanted  on the contrary  #brexit is a deepening part of a continuing problem   #stopbrexit  #toriesout   #solveukpoverty  simples 
     poll      since the brexit referendum have you become more  pro eu  or more  anti eu    #brexit #marr  #bbcsp #smallbizsatuk #labour #conservatives #jeremycorbyn #theresamay #leave #remain
even without the “divorce bill”  the rising #costofbrexit dwarfs our net contribution as members #leave lied to us #brexit will cost us jobs  tax revenue    income    
if we had a #referendum on the final deal   how would you vote  #brexit #fbpe #leaveeu #remainplease rt poll after you vote 
by 2019  about 1 5 million people over 60 will have died since #eureferendum  data shows 70  backed #leave so say 1 1m  we are on course for 2 5m 18 34s to register to vote  if 70  back #remain that s 1 75m  crucially  no more majority for #brexit by default #remainernow 
read and rt  in a hard hitting speech to be delivered this evening  @jacob rees mogg is to call for the government to change its tone on brexit or risk the #uk s freedom and prosperity  #brexit #betteroffout #freedom #booeu
in a second eu referendum  as suggested by nigel farage last week  how would you vote   rt please #opinions #polls #youth #remain #leave #politics #brexit #stopbrexit #haveyoursay #nigelfarage #eu #euref2 #secondreferendum #eu27 #rt
2 3 majority in on line twitter poll on whether a #newreferendum is required on closed conservative cabinet cabal’s proposed #leaveeu terms  #waton #brexit @labour4eu @uklabour
interesting piece from a #leave voter who would like a chance to reconsider #brexit   
the consensus now is that #brexit is no longer inevitable  the eu wants us to stay  a huge #remain community wants to stay   the #leave camp is running scared  let s make the most of this opportunity   pull out all the stops to #stopbrexit@libdems @thegreenparty @snp @labour4eu
#bbcqt whatever else  it’s false to say that all #leave campaigners said #brexit means leaving the #singlemarket
aaron banks   #nigelfarage   want a #2ndreferendum on the #brexit deal fine okay if you insist i won t put up a fight seems like a very sensible idea to me very democratic in fact let s do it  landslide for #leave  they say they say   #stopbrexit #fbpe
is it me     or is the @bbc ignoring the public support for jacob rees mogg becoming leader of the @conservatives  it s like they don t want the @conservatives to win the next election or something #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu #euref
seriously  what is the point of #brexit will it give £350m extra to #nhs  nowill it maintain exact same rights   benefits as we have now  nowill it make us better off  noall the #leave promises are broken  #brexit isn t what we thought  we can change our minds  #finalsay
as someone who voted #leave i regret it massively and would vote #remain if we got another vote but i also think we need to stop blaming #corbyn for #brexit  heres why 
#fbpe #stopbrexit #brexit #leavers #leaveeu if there were a second ref would you change your vote  or if you didn t vote last time  
the #pm @theresa may is hellbent on keeping us in the filthy #eu hatchery  where nothing grows and everything stagnates  the pm wants to #leave in name only  for her #brexit is a damage limitation job not the golden opportunity we voted for @conservatives
in light of misleading information exposed  accurate information obtained  a deeper realisation   understanding of the complexities   consequences   because it affects the destiny of millions  it is wise   our duty to reconsider brexit #stopbrexit #brexit #remain #leave #fbpe
happy new year all  it’s going to be a big 2018 for the #remainernow movement as we work to make it clear to the govt that their #brexit policy is not wanted by so many that voted #leave in #euref but also those that did not and could not vote  #finalsayforall #exitfrombrexit

walk away now     and give the eu 30 days to reconsider their position #leaveeu #leave #nodeal #brexit
it really is very  very simple  we cannot leave the #eu without causing significant damage to our economy  that has been proven beyond reasonable doubt  people need a chance to re evaluate their #leave positions now this crucial fact is known #stopbrexit#fbpe#brexit#remain
are you listening #labour voters  @jeremycorbyn along with keir starmer don t give a  tinker s whatsit  that many labour voters voted for #brexit   @uklabour intend to keep uk in the #eu ignoring your vote to #leave 
cost of #brexit continues to rise    #brexitreality is not what we were promised by the #leave campaign   via @infactsorg  
if you only read the #leave #brexit  supporting press  you won t know that the #eu27 has moved on  their stance   #noparalleleu  that was on the table at the beginning the #euro is becoming a reserve currency  and the eu region is growing #brexit 
this guy is bang on the money  we didn’t vote #leave to regain some sovereignty  we voted to leave to regain all sovereignty  #brexit #bbcqt
uk enters as sick man of europe  now uk appears to be leaving it’s becoming sick again  it appears the eu has treated and continues to treat the uk fairly and proportionately  #brexitimpact #brexit #leaveeu #fbpe #waton #brexitreality #brexitshambles #stopbrexit
why has #brexit opinion polling stopped  8 10 december #remain had a 10 point lead  one more poll released a week later  also showing uk doesn t want to #leave  then nothing for 2 months what don t they want you to know    #fbpe#stopbrexit
us patriots with irish    british roots please help our nations to break free of europe  the eu is dictatorial  corrupt and disfunctional #leave #irexit #brexit #euiscorrupt #eu
we are looking for #european mods that want to #leaveeu and stand against #eurabia  dm me if that sounds like you    #mega #newright #brexit @euroskeptic
some in the #leave camp are definitely getting concerned that #brexit isn t going to happen  the clearer it becomes that it s going to be an unmitigated disaster  there also appears to be a correlation between how abusive they are and the amount of racism in their twitter feeds
i’ve spent many a christmas away from my home and family  reassured by the fact i was serving my country  what is see out of my window now  with the left wing  tree hugging  pc dipsticks gets to me  however #brexit for me makes it all worth while  dont let us down #leave #torys
so   #remain was right about the costs  but #leave decided they wanted out anyway say  can you guys be the  ones who pay for  #brexit then all of it for starters  #markcarney has the  estimated financial cost   it ll be billions cheers 
new evidence that illegitimate russian pro #brexit influence on #euref dwarfed that of #leave campaign  surely no uk government or true british  patriot can stand behind a result engineered by a foreign power intent in weakening our country  #fbpe #waton #remain #stopbrexit
so here’s another #leave voter who has now looked at who #brexit will actually benefit and has changed their mind  brexit cannot be for the many   just the few  those few being elite   rich already respect @wafu23rn for speaking out as a #remainernow  there are so many like you  
dear #leave votersyou were promised you d be no worse off  cos we d have a relationship with eu that gave us the exact same benefits   if you re not happy to  take the #brexit hit  then you can change your mind  it s not too late  but time is short  see  @remainernow #finalsay
if honda go then so will toyota and nissan  those who maintain that we should still #leaveeu like to call themselves patriots  but #brexit is turning out to be the most treacherous and cowardly act of national destruction  #stopbrexitsavebritain #stopbrexit #fbpe
suddenly  no deal  #brexit has reared it s head again   become a very real possibility  even though it was never #leave s stated intention to leave the eu without a deal and leavehq said it would be  so catastrophic  no responsible govt would do it   scary  demand #finalsay 
well said @terrychristian on #bbcqt  #brexit is simple   only for simple people  struggling to recall richard tice or anyone else from #leaveeu telling british public about  benefits  of having irish border reinstated or uk financial sector losing eu trading passports 
nice for downing street to make pompous declarations to #leave customs union  but do they realise  they are in charge of governing the whole country not just the questionable #brexit ref  have they addressed the good friday agreement  #stopbrexit #cakeism #finalsay #waton #fbpe
 #blair can’t see that he s the epitome of why many working class people voted #leave  a man elected pm to help the working class  helping only himself  to lucrative jobs  a 10 strong housing portfolio and a £30million fortune   #brexit #remain #jc4pm
excellent account of #brexit promises that the #government has quietly dropped   no doubt hoping that #leave voters won’t notice they’ve been lied to 
a great article  for those questioning what links there may be between #cambridgeanalytics #scl #leaveeu #brexit #russianmoney #steeledossier #skripal #novichock #salisburyattack
one of #brexit s ironies is that those areas with the highest #leave vote will suffer most harm from #brexit  i hope political parties are being responsible   explaining the real risks to them  #carmanufacturing cld go  #sunderland #northeasthour#1yrarticle50 #countdowntobrexit
if there are any #leave voters still clinging on to their noxious dream brexit and claiming that they were not lied to  here are 11 #brexit promises the government quietly dropped #stopbrexitsavebritain
in light of evidence to suggest #leave only won #eureferendum as a result of cheating   breaking the rules pressing forward regardless with #brexit wound be deeply divisive  fundamentally undemocratic   destroy the trust of the british people #fbpe #remain #brexitgate #fairplay
this is a must read  more excellent work by @peterkgeoghegan   @adamramsay on dodgy spending by #leave   #dup  investigative  journalism at its best #brexit #fbpe
devastating that the admission of cheating by the #leaveeu campaign in the #referendum are made by a #brexit campaigner  #newsnight
if the most credible person you can wheel out to start the denials is boris johnson then you ve lost the argument before it s even begun  #cambridgeanalytica #leaveeu #brexit
pls don t listen to those who cry   why is this coming out now   i wrote about the use of #bigdata a year ago in the @theneweuropean re  #voteleave  @carolecadwalla started writing  about their shenanigans 2 years ago    and a lot others  too  #brexit
one of the biggest shocks the #westminster elite got on june 23 2016 was when the great people of #wales #voted to #leave the corrupt #europeanunion   and a new opinion poll shows that they still back #brexit   #bbc #lbc #sky #uk @conservatives @uklabour
i think this should read that #leave voters in england care more about #brexit than the  precious union  of @theresa may  s imagination   they would be happy to see n i and scotland break away 
#voteleave bollocks   someone really really wants to scupper #brexit #imaginemyshock poll  if we do get shafted   have a 2nd ref  how will you vote  
translation  while the government  the bbc  almost every politician   most of the media knew the right thing was to vote remain  and connived to achieve it   a handle of people i disapprove of argued for #leave  we therefore must vote again  until we get the right answer  #brexit 
no one likes a cheat so when they get caught out there are consequences #balltampering #resign #stevesmith  as the truth emerges about #leave dodgy funding  abuse of social media  fake claims   phoney promises  let’s make sure the voters they cheated hold them to account #brexit

#nigelfarage   in december  concessions were made and here we are in march making yet more concessions  it s very difficult for #leave voters to think we re  going to get anything other than #brexit in name only     #bbc #lbc #sky #uk @conservatives #tory
the margin that trump won in the places that he won was minuscule   like the #leave win  another clue that #bigdata micro analytics may have played a part  the beauty  for mischief makers  is that the tiny vote margins  deepens dissension #cambridgeanalytica #brexit  
these images were  targeted  to those people whose harvested data showed they were the most susceptible to voting #leave #brexit was entirely based on lies  spin and overt racism is this who we are #stopbrexit
from day 1  the whole #brexit negotiation has been a farce  it should have been barnier summoned to number10  put in a darkened room with @nigel farage  made to pay his bar bill  and given this handwritten note  #leaveeu #leadership

here’s the story of another #leave voter who did so to give much needed money to the nhs  now it’s clear that it won’t happen and #brexit puts his job at risk  he is quite rightly fuming with so many #bregretters now reality is clearer  mps must stand up   oppose #brexit 
polling shows a gradual but small shift from #leave to #remain since the referendum that we might exit the eu with a majority against  let alone the supermajority in favour required in most countries  is an affront to democracy #stopbrexit #brexit

uk   since it joined the #eu   has been consistently withdrawing from engagement with it schengen the euro rebate of contributions voting #leave is the most recent onesince 1945 #uk has been limping alongnow it’s attempting #brexit suicide
#nigelfarage  every single major player of that referendum said that if we #voteleave we are leaving the #singlemarket   by implication the #customsunion  unless we leave we will not be able to go global and get the benefits that ought to come from #brexit 
so #tonyblair now thinks there s only a 50  chance of #brexit actually  happening  that s funny  his own institute s #poll reveals 68  of 143 000 #voters  want to  #leave at whatever cost   still ignoring the will of the people  tony    #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @uklabour
didn’t take #farage long to tell his first fib on #bbcqt when he said everyone in referendum campaign said we’d exit the #singlemarket if we #brexit   several prominent #leave campaigners said the opposite 
just seen a post on facebook claiming unemployed immigrants in the uk get £29 900 p a  in benefits  comparing it to old age pensioners getting just €6000 p a these outright lies are why farage and the #leave camp were able to get the gullible to vote for #brexit #stopbrexit

i’d like to ask every #remoaner this question  #leaveeu #brexit 
a lot of ppl voted #brexit as a big  fu  to a lot of things personal  political  that s how #leave ran the campaign   just put all your stuff in the #takebackcontrol basket   vote  out   it s not calling folks  stupid  to say this  leave  used  political analytics  so did trump 
the north east of england voted #leave  fairly heavily  but people in the region are changing their minds   becoming #remainernow  majority of leavers are unhappy with the way #brexit is going and are concerned it will make them poorer #peoplesvote  
 #sunderland voted by 61  to 39  to  #leave  @msmithsonpbif the #brexit vote affected the decision this is a tragedy #nissan
#brexit divorce cost uncertain  say national auditors  but likely to be around £35bn £39bn so much for the #leave lie that it would save money that would all go to the #nhs  
nigel oakes  the scl founder said that trump whipped up fear of muslims to gain electoral advantage  the #leave and #brexit press campaigns cynically inflamed  not just fear of muslims  but fear of eu immigrants and refugees   #stopbrexit #voteeu #abtv

it’s not just the revelations that the #leaveeu campaign cheated  it’s the fact that the emerging #brexitreality bears no resemblance to what they promised  no wonder there is a clamour for a #peoplesvote on the actual #brexit deal  
here’s a message i was sent from nabila  a #leave voter who is concerned about the division in the u k    is a #remainernow  @bilared explains how her belief in #brexit is no longer intact   does not want the uk economy   the union breaking as a result of it  nabila   thanks  
two good things from this  1  the initiative of a pro eu londoner travelling to a #brexit region to listen  learn and persuade  2  video of a #leave voter explaining how he did not realise brexit would effect eastern europeans  that add much to his community    his change of mind
out of 46 million registered voters only 17 4 million voted to #leave and strip 63 million people of their eu citizenship rights  there is no majority  just a tail trying to wag a dog we will  never  support what is being attempted  #brexit  will  be stopped for the majority

more good news republic of ireland pm says  if we are not making real   substantial progress by june then we need to seriously question whether we re going to have a withdrawal agreement at all  for uk  no deal is the best deal#wto #brexit#leave #eu
no bets please  we’re british brussels on red alert   “italy were already fancied to be the next country to exit eu at 9 4   recent coalition talks have only extended their lead at the front of the queue to 6 4 ”ok  great   next #brexit #leave #eu
the more of these #brexit ramifications that become clear make me truly gutted i voted #leave  @remainernow   @peoplesvote uk crucial
 @nickboles we’re representing views of british business   tuc  it’s time for realistic solutions to deliver #leave whilst doing the least harm to our economy   maintaining peace in n ireland  as #davidmiliband observes we cannot he held to ransom by hard #brexit ideologues 
#brexit has turned out to be a shit sandwich and the #leave camp know know it  hence they re crawling from under their rocks to blame #remainers sorry chaps  it s shit sandwich of your making  you re going to have to man up and swallow it yourselves  enjoy 
the kinnocks received more than £10million during their time working at the european union in brussels now kinnock demands corbyn ignore the referendum result to leave lords must be banned from taking eu money #brexit #leave #leaveeu via @mailonline
we knew the #brexit #referendum was  narrowly  won on the basis of a pack of lies and with a questionable franchise  we recently learned about data abuse  and now we know the #leave campaign cheated on the spending   
a former #brexit supporter and #leave campaigner changes his mind and has the courage to explain why    @will dryofoc
chloe westley “we stay in the customs union  we can’t take back control of our trade it’s just that simple that’s why we’re leaving the customs union  leaving the eu #brexit means taking back control of our laws  borders  money   trade  #leave #eu
has house of lords apologised to the eu yet for the #brexit vote have the lords of lords apologised yet for 17 4m of us who obviously did not know what we were doing when we voted to #leave it is good job we have those wise people in the house of lords to correct our mistakes
if #brexit is such a brilliant idea  why do no other eu countries want to #leave 
uk voted to #leave all #eu customs arrangements     may  needs to listen to her parties   her cabinet who have given a very strong message on this issue she may not realise it  but we are on the brink here this could be the end of theresa may #brexit
the #leave camp garnered 37  of the electorates vote in the referendum  sensing a hard sell in the hoc  may called a general election on a #brexit ticket  the country replied by removing her majority  how on earth is #brexit therefore still called the will of the people 
#piersmorgan hits out at the same old pro #euro campaigners banging on about #europe   explains why we must now get on #brexit  “we had a #referendum  everybody had a chance to have their say and we voted democratically to #leave ”  #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc
the vote that  @conservatives have now is largely a #leave vote they have an expectation  #brexit has cast a shadow people say that it s not mentioned on the doorstep  but it was such a very big choice so lab and cons have matched each other point to point   #johncurtice #wato
1 000 jobs at risk as jacques vert owner collapses  the collapse makes calvetron the latest in a lengthening line of retail casualties nothing to do with #brexit of course  none of the recent collapses are  according to the #leave camp 
that #brexit uk was merely a  test run  for putin  trump and #cambridgeanalytics is a measure of how unimportant they consider us that various #leave campaigns so openly colluded with one another is a measure of how weak our policing and legal systems are  #stopbrexit pic twitter com 2ylwu9opl1
house of lords are trying to scupper #brexittheir arrogance is mind blowing they think they know better than the 17 4m of us who voted to #leave if they want to run the country they should stand for election if they don t want to do that  they should zip it #abolishthelords

this graph shows very clearly that the #leave vote was a very small blip in an otherwise clear will to stay in the eu  the lying  cheating  international interference racist undertones and total failure to make #brexit work for anyone surely means a #peoplesvote is now inevitable

and those investigations uncovered exactly how #leaveeu and #voteleave won  unexpectedly   they broke the law  pumped £600 000 illegally into illegal social media adverts  even ignoring the 3 day moratorium due to the murder of jo cox  that s how they won  unexpectedly   #brexit 
funny how many of those currently criticising the bbc s coverage of #brexit and #voteleave were happy to mock corbynites when we had similar complaints about the bbc s coverage of corbyn 
my guess here is that @bbcnews won t admit that #voteleave broke the law until people are physically arrested  charged and found guilty in court  so  just now they re only prepared to use the word  allegations   i m in no way defending them because #voteleavebrokethelaw#brexit
the #voteleave #brexit campaign been evidenced to have been a criminal conspiracy backed by dark money and the #altright    orchestrated by a lot of posh boys   backed by the daily mail   notice the similarity 
there’s fake news  electoral fraud  rule breaking  all ‘cheating’   whether you voted #remain or #leave  don’t let the privileged british establishment duck the blame for their mess  demand a vote on whether to accept or reject their poor deal no deal #brexit  
important to understand crux of #brexit is that #uk voted in #euref for the #magnacarta narrative identity it shares with #canzuk  not #eu’s charlemagnian alternative  it was a choice between two possible futures  #leave won   #remain lost  it’s time to #respecttheresult #ukpoli

fraudulent  #remain was backed by government funding  plenty of working class people voted for #leave  you all said the uk economy would fall apart once #brexit was announced  here we are with the best unemployment figures for 43 years and 21 consecutive quarters of gdp growth 
 the result in favour of #brexit was obtained  at least in part  by breaching electoral law  it cannot be allowed to stand   another vote now essential   says scottish brexit minister following #voteleave revelations
boris  after 18 months of stealthy retreat    mr speaker  it is not too late to save brexit we have time in these negotiations we have changed tack once and we can change again #brexit #leave #eu via @guidofawkes
#heartsandminds of 3 67m #50swomen their families  friends  their 732 000 plus supporters are poised to #vote in any #election equally  to influence transit of treaties @ehrc @un #cdaw @ehrcchair#pmqs #highcourt #brexit #voteleave #mandeladay #letterofintent #wednesdaywisdom
4 000 disgruntled tory brexit voters joined ukip since may s stitch up 2 500 new #ukip members in the last week alone all because eu  associate membership  is not leaving the eu   17 4 million voters voted to leave   so leave #brexit #leave #eu go #wto
shouldn t be ignored that the #dup #brexit  donation  takes #voteleave s illegal spending beyond the £1million mark 
excellent thread from @adamwagner1 on why it will be very difficult to legally challenge #euref result on basis of #voteleave cheating  i agree with him that ultimately what we do about this is a political rather than a legal decision #brexit #fbpe
the reason why the #voteleave cheating is so important is because it s not some minor technicality  that money was used to buy advertising that sought to deliberately mislead the public into thinking they would be better off with #brexit  they won t  it s a compounded fraud
if only there was some evidence of massive over spending by the remain campaign then i am sure the electoral commission would investigate it     #voteleave #brexit #tuesdaythoughts
jacob rees mogg is working theresa may from the back#voteleave cheated yet the #brexit result still standsthe scottish tory mps voted against @scotparl having any saywhy is scotland still in this uk union  this is not democratic  #indyref2
i’ve never been a ‘let’s have a second referendum’ person but surely if #voteleave have been fined and referred to the police for breaking the law over their #brexit campaign there needs to be another one or this whole brexit thing stopped 
how many #voteleave mps have money in off shore tax havens  is this why they want #brexit because eu was going to clamp down on them  asking for a friend 
all the headlines about #voteleave being fined £61k for breaching spending limits feels like a storm in a teacup when you compare it to the £9m of taxpayers money spent by david cameron on sending #brexit project fear leaflets to each household  
#voteleave broke the law  have been fined and referred to the police  the referendum should be declared null and void  not only was it advisory anyway  the campaign was illegal  why on earth should the uk #brexit in light of this  #stopbrexit
#soubry    nobody voted #leave on the basis that somebody with a gold plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them   #brexit
andrew marr   it’s fake sovereignty  it’s not real sovereignty in theory  we can go to brussels and say ‘do you mind if we change these rules’ in practice  once the common rulebook is in place  we can’t  not in the real world  #brexit #leave #eu
interesting group of people who voted #leave who regret it   and want a chance to reconsider #brexit   
polls carried out before david cameron announced the #eu ref showed #leave were trailing by up to 13 points  nobody wanted it now  hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition asking for a #peoplesvote and it is being denied  this is wrong #brexit#finalsay
a clear and consistent 10 point swing from #leave to #remain giving remain a 5 point lead @theresa may  at what point do we get a #peoplesvote   or are referendums only held to settle arguments within the #tory party #brexit
 @markdrakeford is right a hard #brexit  that makes wales poorer  that creates barriers to trade and collaboration  has no mandate join us to oppose this shambolic mess #takecontrol and demand a #peoplesvote on the final #brexitdeal 
please listen whether you voted #leave or #remain  this gave me goosebumps  of total fear  who is going to answer that question  what happens the day after  #brexit 
a #british #donaldtrump would have put britain first in #brexit negotiations  unlike the #traitor #theresamay who holds #leave voters in #contempt and has appeased #brussels at every turn with her treacherous actions  #brexit  #bbc #sky #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty

1 2  the investigation into #cambridgeanalytica is tugging at a loose thread that is connected to the very fabric of our society  this scandal isn t just about #facebook  #trump  #brexit  #voteleave etc  it is about the way corporate power subverts our democracy to its own ends  pic twitter com xcibj5dnmi
it is clear the #euref result was achieved by massive illegal data fraud   breaking the law in multiple ways by #voteleave   #leaveeuhow long will it take before @bbcnews stops respecting fraud   illegal acts on our democracy #voteleavebrokethelaw #voteleavecheated #brexit 
 the way they were trapped in a room  phones removed  in chequers meeting with t may  pm  was just like those pyramid sellers  the ponzi scheme pushers do  brainwashing people into parting with their cash  confidence tricksters manipulating    @195dal#brexit #leave #eu
from a leading #qc interpreting the phrase  ‘the #commonrulebook ’ every  person who voted to #leave should read this and understand its meaning   the #chequers turd proposal is to #remain in the #eu and we will be in a far worse position  than we are now  #maymustgo #brexit #uk
#brexit ministers drew up plans to #leave no 10 drew up a totally different brexit plan and presented it like a rabbit from a hat at chequers it is no wonder #brexit ministers resigned they were totally shafted by their own pm the pm acted despicably #maymustgo
over 12 months there have been no fewer than 35 opinion polls carried out  with about 60 000 participants  how many of these have shown a lead for #leave that s right  two  out of 35 no longer the  will of the people #peoplesvote#noconfidence#brexit#brexitshambles
so let me get this straight the #british people voted to #leave and for #brexit two years ago but  their rulers think they are smarter so are attempting to thwart the will of the people looks like their #deepstate is the same as ours #theresamay is no #thatcher #bojo
john redwood  resignation of #brexit secretarythere are only 2 sensible options 1   comprehensive free trade deal with #euor2   exit eu on wto termswe need to #leave on 29 march 2019 do the eu want free tradeordo they want to trade under wto terms 
#brexit is a foundation of sand “rain came downstreams rosewinds blew   beat against that houseit fell with a great crash ” the nation’s courage to reverse that collective eu referendum mistake would be the first bucket of concrete #stopbrexitnow #remain #leave #ukpolitics
the #brexit #daviddavis wants  as opposed to the  17m other imagined brexits in the minds of #leave voters    the people need to be given concrete options to vote on  and it needs to happen now #peoplesvote
stupid is as stupid does boris johnson “anyone defending the proposal we have just agreed will find it like trying to polish a turd luckily  we have some expert turd polishers in this government ”#brexit #leave #eu
as the plot thickens on @arron banks dealings with russia  we are perhaps starting to see who would benefit from #brexit the most  not the people  only the super wealthy  wake up  #leave voters  you have been duped
any #european leader who values the nation state should vote down any #brexit deal that sees #britain #leave in name only  #eurosceptics across #europe need to help each other in the fight against the elites like the #lying @theresa may  #maymustgo #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome
if #uklabour had not betrayed millions of their own supporters who voted #leave in the #euref  and backed the government from day one  #brexit would be delivered by now corbyn s lust for power is more important than honouring @uklabour 2017ge promises #aplagueonbothyourhouses
your leader has just sold her party members and the wider #leave electorate out  in an epic betrayal of #brexit  @theresa may is taking orders from #merkel  there is no #eu  negotiation   you lied and people found out 
we ve always suspected tory plants on #bbcqt but tonight we saw it first hand  meet the man who got 3 questions  andrew livsey  the tory candidate for wallasey in 2017 and chair of north norfolk vote #leave    #scotref #brexit #indyref2 #bbcbias

#voteleave cheated  along with the news of the #brexitbigshort  the #leave campaign was  dirty   we need the official opposition to be a watchdog re  #brexit  but they are not on the field  so we have to do this ourselves 
when does a campaign based on lies and funded by dishonesty cease to become “the will of the people”  #voteleave #brexit
the #voteleave campaign broke election law  it’s time for another referendum  #brexit
“so many people who voted #leave  having seen that #brexitreality is very different from what they thought they had voted for  have changed their minds  but #journalists   mps seem to imply no one changed their minds ” @remainernow in @pmpmagtoday  #brexit 
rees mogg  customs 3rd way is  a muddle     deeply unsatisfactory non brexitit would be a cheat on the electorate to stay in single market   leave in name only this isn t hard brexit or soft brexit  it s just being honest with voters #brexit #leave #eu

#brexit #leave #remain #chequersplan #selloutin a nutshell 
amongst all the rhetoric and posturing from the #leave campaign  i ve never heard an economic case for #brexit having been made  lots of soundbites  but no actual numbersand no case for #brexit delivering a tightening of border controls  if indeed they re neededit s pointless
erm  the eu is stopping tax avoidance  their directive comes into force on 1st april 2019 #brexit happens 29th march 2019coincidence  no #voteleave funded by virtually all the billionaire tax avoiders so they can continue to offshore their wealth without eu stopping it 
if the eu is good at securing trade deals then do we have deals with brazilchinaindiausaaustralia  many more being in the eu prevents us doing trade deals with the rest of the world  we need to free to strike good   comprehensive deals#standup4brexit #brexit 
tell that to workers in the manufacturing sector in the #eastmidlands who voted #leave on the basis we’d get a #brexit deal that would deliver a better economy and an extra £350million a week for the #nhs

“quietly somewhere there was a coup d’etat going on” @cmackinlay to the brexit select committeethe whole british public has been misled  the #chequersplan simply doesn’t deliver #brexitwould you be willing to support our campaign  craig and pledge to #standup4brexit

it is now patently clear that the promises and the assurances made by the #leave campaign were never deliverable  so why on earth is the government pressing on with the bankrupt #brexit project  the lives of millions will be negatively impacted  nobody wins  everybody loses

this superb letter appeared in our local paper @hertsad today i recommend everybody adapts it and emails sends to their own mp we have to counter the #leave campaign lies  the growing influence of #reesmogg   his fascists and together stop a #nodealbrexit #brexit #stopbrexit
#brexit has prod higher inflation  no growth   now another interest rate rise  we are all poorer thanks to the lies pedalled by those supporting #voteleave  time to take back control   reverse this madness #fbpe #peoplesvote
i voted to remain in #europe   am very anti #brexit but the public cast their vote   there shouldn t be a 2nd chance #democracy is a responsibility   if some #leave voters now regret their decision  tough shit  that s what you get for believing the media   @nigel farage  
as it is #cpc18 eve  let s remember last #cpc when the pm promised a #brexit deal that was based on lancaster house instead we got given #chequers do remember that chequers isn t the lancaster house vision   #standup4brexit #cpc18 #chuckchequers
a vital thread  something we   others have looked at in the past  yet  as with other strands in the #brexit #voteleave #tory #trump #scl #cambridgeanalytica #aiq story the msm have pretty much ignored the connection  article below may help your research  
jonathan @freedland is on the money here i also think it s a factor why some men voted #leave in the #brexit referendum  very last thing those male leavers want to admit is their vote was a result of their own insecurities  which they ll deny they have   
john major   there isn t a single intellectual argument against holding a 2nd referendum  you mean like the referendum you denied the british people for maastricht that created the european union  you utter hypocrite #standup4brexit #brexit#peoplesvote
the same mps who were elected under a manifesto to deliver #brexit  who voted for art50   the eu withdrawal bill  those mps @drphillipleemp  including you   most in the electorate are angry over this anti uk  anti democratic stance #standup4brexit   back #planaplus  canada

turn back time to last years conference when we were promised a #brexit deal that was based on lancaster house   instead we got #chequers   despite outrage  the government still persit with it remember that chequers is not the lancaster house vision   #standup4brexit #cpc18
 @amberruddhr needs to remember that supporting a #peoplesvote to prevent a #nodealbrexit would go against the will of the british people and the @conservatives manifesto  #standup4brexit #brexit
#standup4brexit supporter @rossthomson mp will be speaking at the commonwealth reception at #cpc18  we’re fairly sure that #brexit will feature date  1st october time  19 30venue  hyatt regency dolce room  
 @bernardjenkin mp will be at a #cpc18 fringe event called “what will be the outcome of #brexit”given that bernard has pledged to #standup4brexit  we are sure that this will be interesting date  1st octobertime  15 45venue  hall 8a
we re a one stop place for all #brexit related news at #cpc18 it s worth noting that there s another event at the #birmingham midland institute on 1 10 18 which is billed as the  alternate cpc    it will feature mps who have pledged to #standup4brexit 
why does the pm dismiss canada plus is it because it beats chequers in every conceivable way and she doesn t want to admit that she should have gone with canada  from day one irresponsible and wrong decision  canada  is the way #standup4brexit #brexit

how the #brexit vote was tainted  ⁦@jolyonmaugham⁩ explains yesterday’s court judgment   the implications for #voteleave   the #dup  it’s time to ask how a vote procured by lies   illegality can be allowed to stand
the high court ruling of the challenge to #leave spending brought by @jolyonmaugham and funded on @crowdjustice just found out that the elections watchdog was wrong over #brexit expenses   
we already knew #voteleave cheated  now the high court rules that they were also wrongly allowed by the electoral commission do things they shouldn’t  the basis for #brexit looking ever dodgier  
main reasons for a #peoplesvote now proven wrong   @electoralcommuk confirmed #voteleave s actions  £350m week will go to the #nhs  roaming charges unchanged after #brexit     but don t worry  utlra remainers will find another  democratic  reason to try to overturn #brexit

the petition to rescind article 50 if #leave broke election laws  they did  is to be debated in parliament on 10th september  the government initially dismissed the petition but then it reached over 190 000  so now it must be debated by mps  well done everybody #brexit #remain

why all the angst about a ‘second referendum’  we want a 1st legal  fact based #brexit referendum that treats the uk electorate with a modicum of intelligence  the electorate of the united kingdom  #leave and #remain  deserved better than the 2016 debacle  we still do  #finalsay

in the last year no fewer than 75 official polls were carried out on #brexit  out of those 75  only 2 showed a lead for #leave  our politicians have simply run out of excuses  public opinion has changed  we must not leave the eu  the british people unequivocally reject it 
and it has shown that there is more passionate will for the uk to #remain in the #eu than there is for #brexit  #leave simply cannot  and have not  motivated this level of public support  #farage may bribe a few into a scruffy pub with the offer of a free beer  but that s it

what will never be forgiven or forgotten will be selling the uk to the eu by forcing through maastricht without a referendum john major damaged the country and destroyed the party  the rebels who fought him have been vindicated #standup4brexit #brexit
the sheer contempt with which the eu is treating the uk is reason enough to #leave #brexit
switzerland is in schengen  ireland is not  it is in a common travel that is separate to the eu and existed long before it  no customs union or backstop needed  an open border is fine and all this wrangling is just an attempt to keep us shackled to the eu#standup4brexit #brexit 
what the #remoaners are saying is that #brexit is just too difficult so we ll allow the 5th biggest economy in the world to be run by the unelected eu dictators well  the 17 4m brits who voted #leave are made of sterner stuff than that   we won t let you betray us in this way

why are people acting surprised by this  had we voted remain on 23rd june 2016 we were always eventually going to   lose the rebate   adopt the €  join schengen the only version of remain was always  hard remain   this was why we had to vote leave #standup4brexit #brexit 
i m a #brexit moderate who voted #remain  but since we re going to #leave we must make it work for us  i can t therefore see that either parliament or i would vote for britain to be locked into a permanent open ended customs union arrangement 
no  #brexit is 100  the responsibility of the british government  this government chose to #leave   the eu have set out the choices available  there are literally 100 s of legal agreements both with the #eu27   globally that cannot be broken for the sake of uk demands  #finalsay

government whips can rally as many labour mps as it likes  it won t change the fact that the deeply unpopular and unworkable chequers is unacceptable to the eu canada  is perfectly acceptable to the eu and infinitely more popular with the british people #standup4brexit #brexit

we bumped into #standup4brexit supporter @peterboneuk at #cpc2018 and he gave us a short message “it’s a really important message of this #cpc18 that #chequers is dead   has been rejected by the #eu    we need to move towards a comprehensive free trade agreement ”#brexit 
brilliant to hear dcms secretary of state jeremy wright  who voted remain  defending brexit and calling on everyone to accept the result  soubry  wollaston and lee could learn something here  #brexit #standup4brexit #cpc18
the #eu   #remainers like #theresamay are colluding to stop a #realbrexit from happening  they don’t want the #uk to #leave   are using a deal to trap us under eu control so we are not really a #free nation  we must stop them for overturning #brexit  we must have a clean break 
 she s surrendering £39bn  the political declaration is full of airy fairy notions without any solid guarantees    @isaby is spot on  #theresamay is handing over massive sums of our cash in exchange for empty rhetoric   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #brexit
it s come to something when the chief #economist of #germany s largest #bank has more confidence in the #uk #economy than the #british chancellor of the exchequer @philiphammonduk  don t believe #projectfear   #standup4brexit #tory @andreajenkyns #brexit
no one voted to be poorer   if con mps vote for pms #brexit deal they’ll be doing it for them  govt set to publish yet more evidence that which ever way you cut it #brexit will make us all poorer   well apart from the well heeled #leave leaders
remember what the #leaveeu campaign promised about #brexit  
thoughtful  considered   logical from @normanlamb representing a heavily #leave voting constituency he’s well placed to conclude may’s #brexit deal won’t heal the nation he’s voting against the deal   backing a #peoplesvote #finalsay
the pm and her #brexit deal in today s sun cartoon this weakening of the uk position must not be allowed to pass #ditchthedeal #standup4brexit #voteitdown
correct we want @theresa may to stand aside  so that we can appoint a leader of the conservative party who will honour the conservative party manifesto promise to #leave the eu  sm   cu  every current tory mp stood for the hoc on in the 2017ge we must deliver #brexit promise 
breaking  #brexit twist   #mep #danhannan reveals crippling flaw in #theresamay s plan that no one has noticed   listen to what dan has to say  to think  the @conservatives welcome this stupid imbecile running the country   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #nodeal
says the minister who worked for #deutschebank  then who instead of voting #leave as his conscience said      decided to vote #remain for his career prospects  #sajidjavid is another #careerpolitician  he is a fake   a phony  p ss off sajid  #standup4brexit #brexit #tory @dcbmep
pretty decent here from charles moore  #brexit mp’s must stand firm in withdrawal agreement votes  britain’s future is at stake in avoiding ‘vassalage’  ni backstop is key  sign this   our country is defunct as sovereign  ⁦#standup4brexit 
brilliant #nodeal is a scary word that remoaners use to divert people from the concept behind it  and the concept is simple  just #leave the eu  get back to how things were before we joined the bloc #brexit #brexitshambles #fridaymotivation
brexiter elite looking like the establishment figures they are i hope those voters who thought voting #leave in the #brexit referendum was sticking one up to the establishment  take a long hard look at this it s why we need #peoplesvote #finalsay to #exitfrombrexit   #remain
we were the ones out there leafleting and knocking on doors in the pouring rain  this was not the #brexit we voted for pleased to have signed this open letter to the @telegraph alongside 18 other #leave groups asking mps to vote this horrendous  deal  down

genuine question for any #brexiter out there it s now clear russia helped fund the #brexit #leave campaign  do you think it did so  a  because it s beneficial for the uk to leave the eu or b  because it s bad for the uk to leave the eu 
the best deal with the eu is the deal we currently have  and the govt has failed to deliver the promised “deal”  the negotiations are about the wdrawal agreement we are set to #leave with no future trade deal in place  no one voted for a blindfold #brexit @peoplesvote uk
ni backstop in withdrawal agreement should mean at least 51 mps representing #standup4brexit vote against may’s treachery to put uk into eu’s negotiating trap  it should also mean that #brexit cabinet ministers resign  how many times has it been made clear about this f’in issue

even before yesterday’s news about the investigation into #voteleave   the @lsepoliticsblog concluded that fraud in the referendum means #brexit is voidable and article 50 can be revoked  
former #bbc reporter asks the question that current bbc reports hesitate to   does the referral to the national crime agency  not just the met   more serious  to investigate allegations of illegality by the #leave campaign  mean that the #brexit process should be put on hold  
not really  left wing #remainers  centrist remainers   right wing remainers will never reconcile themselves with #brexit because they fundamentally don t understand why working people voted  at the risk of jeopardising their own economic interests  #leave and to #brexit the #eu 
let’s clear up these questions about the #eureferendum  is #brexit the  decision  of the british people  or was the #eu referendum advisory only  if so  who made the decision for britain to #leave the #eu  share @jon danzig’s report  link

17 4 million people voted #leave  so if #labour blocks #brexit we will be wiped out and the tories will remain in power indefinitely @uklabour is starting to rebuild trust with the public after iraq  it simply cannot afford to break trust a second time #generalelectionnow
of course arron banks’ firm has  no address   who expected otherwise source of finance of #leave campaign as transparent as may’s #brexit deal is in interests of uk case for #peoplesvote #finalsay an #exitfrombrexit   #remain is becoming unchallengeable 
in other words they can’t afford no deal or want u k  to be free from eu so get rid of traitor may   get decent supercanada at very least with decent #brexit pm  eg @borisjohnson @dominicraab etc  #standup4brexit #managednodeal
 1 2  which #brexit deal did you vote for julia  the answer is none as no concrete plan was even published nevermind put to any vote  this greatly helped to achieve the narrow #leave win as lack of specifics meant brexit could be sold as all things to all people  #brexitshambles
80 000 sign petition against uk signing un migration pact signretweet#leave #brexit #london #wales #england #westminster #victoria #city #town #liverpool #united #boris #jeremy #may
and so it starts   the slow drip drip drip of the media  suggesting  we could withdraw #article50 began on @bbcnews at   now continues   is this a conspiracy to start to truly undermine #brexit   to brainwash us we need to stand firm   we voted to #leave and #leavemeansleave
former #labour minister @frankfieldteam is clear that if the withdrawal agreement goes through then the #eu can use the #backstop to demand any ransom to gain our exit   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #labourparty #brexit #leavemeansleave @andreajenkyns
let s make this the largest twitter eu referendum poll to date and settle this once   for all  what would you back if there was a peoples vote tomorrow please vote   retweet #peoplesvote #standup4brexit #brexit #eureferendum #backthebrexitdeal #ditchthedeal #leavemeansleave
hysterical predictions about what happens when we leave the eu is part of #projectfear and part of a concerted effort by establishment forces to make the whole process as difficult and unpalatable as possible   #standup4brexit @dcbmep @andreajenkyns #brexit
both are a total betrayal of 17 4 million british voters  so stop the baiting and remember who lost his historical vote  leave won  cold hard #brexit is exactly what we voted for  not remain by lies   duplicitous acts  @theresa may must goa leaver must be pm#leave now
in 117 days from now we ll be ending the madness when we stop putting money in the pocket of the eu when we leave it  followed by a good old knees up at #jdwetherspoon s up   down the country   first drink is on tim martin #brexitpartyatspoons  #standup4brexit #brexit

this is what pisses me off more than anything about #brexit - there was no consensus on what #voteleave actually meant (still isn’t), these options should have been on ballot paper for clarity. uk being pushed off a cliff when the majority was actually for #remain! #stopbrexit
'brexit is not the answer to social injustice that many poor #leave voters wanted. on the contrary, #brexit is a deepening part of a continuing problem.' #stopbrexit =#toriesout = #solveukpoverty. simples.
*****poll***** since the brexit referendum have you become more 'pro-eu' or more 'anti-eu'?  #brexit #marr  #bbcsp #smallbizsatuk #labour #conservatives #jeremycorbyn #theresamay #leave #remain
even without the “divorce bill”, the rising #costofbrexit dwarfs our net contribution as members.#leave lied to us.#brexit will cost us jobs, tax revenue, & income... 
reading comments on #brexit threads from #leavers, they make little or no attempt to engage with the numbers, it's all "project fear" or "we voted to leave get on with it". but you can definitely hear them getting shriller and shriller. it almost sounds like...well, panic.
remove the customs union surrender clause in the cross-border bill or we will table amendments - jacob rees-mogg, to govt. eu customs union will not let britain sign its own trade deals and thus negate #brexithow can brexit mean brexit then, pm may?#leavecustomsunion
the tory right want a #brexit that delivers an ultra-free market economy. but that should have been put to the public in an election manifesto & properly debated, not smuggled in under the pretence that brexit is all about sovereignty & immigration. #stopbrexit #fbpe #leavelies
when the entire uk cabinet can't agree what #brexit is and the majority of mps together with the @dexeugov don't yet know what the implications of #brexit are, how come #leavers #quitlings and #brexiters claim they knew what they voted for. are they some sort of higher beings?
if we had a #referendum on the final deal - how would you vote? #brexit #fbpe #leaveeu #remainplease rt poll after you vote.
by 2019, about 1.5 million people over 60 will have died since #eureferendum. data shows 70% backed #leave so say 1.1m. we are on course for 2.5m 18-34s to register to vote. if 70% back #remain that's 1.75m. crucially, no more majority for #brexit by default.#remainernow?
the #brexit dividend is not just a myth. it is another huge #brexit lie. there can be no real democratic decision making if people are grossly misinformed by fake news. #leavelies are destroying our democracy. they must be stopped & their promoters jailed. #stopbrexit #fbpe
this government response to a petition refers to the "the instruction of the british people". this is a lie, and not just a normal political lie. it's a lie about the legal status of the most important political decision since ww2 #leavelies #brexit #stopbrexit #fbpe
in a second eu referendum, as suggested by nigel farage last week, how would you vote? (rt please)#opinions #polls #youth #remain #leave #politics #brexit #stopbrexit #haveyoursay #nigelfarage #eu #euref2 #secondreferendum #eu27 #rt
noticed that #leavers are getting angrier and angrier and more vitriolic in their defence of #brexit, as it becomes clearer the majority of the country never wanted to leave the eu. 
only 18% of brits are ok with britain "following some eu rules and giving up some controls" to maintain "best possible trade links" - survation poll.sorry cbi/remainers, there's no support for a customs union or other eu institutions that deny us #brexit#leavecustomsunion
put simply and straightforwardly. why #brexit  means we must #leavecustomsunion &  get out of the single market.
this literally cannot be retweeted often enough. #brexit #leavelies #fbpe
2/3 majority in on-line twitter poll on whether a #newreferendum is required on closed conservative cabinet cabal’s proposed #leaveeu terms. #waton #brexit @labour4eu @uklabour
if "we must choose between europe and the open sea, we shall always choose the open sea”the eu is a binary choice.but outside eu commercial policy and customs union, britain can choose to trade and cooperate both with europe and the wider world. #brexit #leavecustomsunion
billions squandered, families torn apart, jobs lost, lives destroyed, a country split in two; and for what, to keep the tories in power for a little longer. #leavers you need your heads examined for falling for the #brexit con. 
interesting piece from a #leave voter who would like a chance to reconsider #brexit : 
the consensus now is that #brexit is no longer inevitable. the eu wants us to stay, a huge #remain community wants to stay & the #leave camp is running scared. let's make the most of this opportunity & pull out all the stops to #stopbrexit@libdems @thegreenparty @snp @labour4eu
#projectreality macron: uk will have to pay for post #brexit city access to the eu. there you have it #leavers. you can't have your cake and eat it, despite what moron may and dimwit davis have lied to you.
back in 1973 & 1975 british citizens were told they would be £5 per week(each) better off as a member of the eec (eu). our trade deficit with the eu has risen year upon year. strange how germany benefit the greatest & uk the least. #brexit #leaveeu
andrew - if only you were so keen to hold conservative cabinet ministers & farage to account with their litany of #leavelies and #brexit baloney. then there could be no justifiable accusations of #bbcbias4brexit made. however, as it stands... you leave yourself exposed. @ofcom
this about sums up madness of #brexit #fbpe #leave
#bbcqt whatever else, it’s false to say that all #leave campaigners said #brexit means leaving the #singlemarket
aaron banks...#nigelfarage...want a #2ndreferendum on the #brexit deal?fine.okay.if you insist.i won't put up a fight.seems like a very sensible idea to me.very democratic in fact.let's do it."landslide for #leave" they say.they say...#stopbrexit #fbpe
we voted to leave the european union. now let’s get on with it. i will not support a call for a second referendum. #brexit #brexitmeansbrexit #leavemeansleave @ukip @ukipwales
is it me ... or is the @bbc ignoring the public support for jacob rees-mogg becoming leader of the @conservatives ?it's like they don't want the @conservatives to win the next election or something #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu #euref
a reminder of some of the #leavelies that were sold to the uk. now that they have used up all of the credibility people assigned to them it's time for a new #brexit referendum to test the 2018 “will of the people.”  if you want one then lobby your mp to bug their party leadership 
seriously, what is the point of #brexit?will it give £350m extra to #nhs? nowill it maintain exact same rights & benefits as we have now? nowill it make us better off? noall the #leave promises are broken. #brexit isn't what we thought. we can change our minds. #finalsay
if #leavers are so sure #brexit is the will of the people, why are they so vehemently against a vote on the final deal which included a no-brexit option?
as someone who voted #leave i regret it massively and would vote #remain if we got another vote but i also think we need to stop blaming #corbyn for #brexit. heres why:
#fbpe #stopbrexit #brexit #leavers #leaveeu if there were a second ref would you change your vote (or if you didn't vote last time):
the #pm @theresa_may is hellbent on keeping us in the filthy #eu hatchery, where nothing grows and everything stagnates. the pm wants to #leave in name only. for her #brexit is a damage limitation job not the golden opportunity we voted for @conservatives
in light of misleading information exposed, accurate information obtained, a deeper realisation & understanding of the complexities & consequences & because it affects the destiny of millions, it is wise & our duty to reconsider brexit.#stopbrexit #brexit #remain #leave #fbpe
happy new year all! it’s going to be a big 2018 for the #remainernow movement as we work to make it clear to the govt that their #brexit policy is not wanted by so many that voted #leave in #euref but also those that did not and could not vote! #finalsayforall #exitfrombrexit

#brexit has irrevocably opened an unhealable chasm between #leavers and #remainers in the uk.that idiots like fox, johnson, gove and may cannot see it, is a crying shame. they have allowed a flawed referendum result to stand without challenge.history will not be kind to them
it really is very, very simple. we cannot leave the #eu without causing significant damage to our economy. that has been proven beyond reasonable doubt. people need a chance to re-evaluate their #leave positions now this crucial fact is known.#stopbrexit#fbpe#brexit#remain
here's a little *game* for all the #leavers:go to your local supermarket.check where your favourite products come from (incl ingredients not grown here)now add 20% to the pricedone that?welcome to post #brexit britain
are you listening #labour voters? @jeremycorbyn along with keir starmer don't give a *tinker's whatsit* that many labour voters voted for #brexit,  @uklabour intend to keep uk in the #eu ignoring your vote to #leave.
cost of #brexit continues to rise.   #brexitreality is not what we were promised by the #leave campaign. (via @infactsorg )
if you only read the #leave/#brexit -supporting press, you won't know that the #eu27 has moved on..their stance:  #noparalleleu. that was on the table at the beginning.the #euro is becoming a reserve currency! and the eu region is growing.#brexit 
imagine if the #brexit ref result had been to stay.the nhs could have had the squandered billions, eu staff wouldn't be leaving in droves and waiting lists for operations would be far shorter.nice job #leavers, contrary to the big red bus message, you screwed the nhs big time
this guy is bang on the money. we didn’t vote #leave to regain some sovereignty, we voted to leave to regain all sovereignty. #brexit #bbcqt
uk enters as sick man of europe. now uk appears to be leaving it’s becoming sick again. it appears the eu has treated and continues to treat the uk fairly and proportionately. #brexitimpact #brexit #leaveeu #fbpe #waton #brexitreality #brexitshambles #stopbrexit
"no-one is proposing we would ever leave this trade bloc"leave eu publicity video before the referendum.now leave eu and the other hard brexiters deny that soft #brexit was ever proposed as an option! #leavelies #stopbrexit #fbpe
before the referendum the brexit campaigners presented norway as a model for brexit. now they deny they mentioned any such option. it was clearly a cynical trick to con wavering voters into voting for #brexit.#leavelies #stopbrexit #fbpe
a message to all #leavers that claim it's unreasonable for the #remain camp to want a vote on on the final deal, including an option to exit from #brexit.the uk holds general elections every five years so the public can change its mind on who runs the country. #democracy
why has #brexit opinion polling stopped? 8-10 december #remain had a 10 point lead, one more poll released a week later, also showing uk doesn't want to #leave, then nothing for 2 months.what don't they want you to know?!?!#fbpe#stopbrexit
us patriots with irish  & british roots please help our nations to break free of europe. the eu is dictatorial, corrupt and disfunctional #leave #irexit #brexit #euiscorrupt #eu
#leavers now threatening civil unrest if they don't get their way. but what is their way, there seem to be dozens of different versions of leaving the eu upon which nobody agrees.may talks about uniting the country behind #brexit. you'd have more chance unscrambling an egg.
we are looking for #european mods that want to #leaveeu and stand against #eurabia! dm me if that sounds like you... #mega.#newright #brexit @euroskeptic
some in the #leave camp are definitely getting concerned that #brexit isn't going to happen, the clearer it becomes that it's going to be an unmitigated disaster. there also appears to be a correlation between how abusive they are and the amount of racism in their twitter feeds
i’ve spent many a christmas away from my home and family, reassured by the fact i was serving my country. what is see out of my window now, with the left wing, tree hugging, pc dipsticks gets to me, however #brexit for me makes it all worth while. dont let us down #leave #torys
andrea leadsom shamelessly parroting the lie that leaving the eu means quitting the single market. the caller very rightly states that there is no mandate for #brexit#stopbrexit #fbpe #leavelies
the #brexit vote was, in part, built on the loudly peddled myth that the eurozone economy was teetering on the edge of collapse. now it's surging ahead while brexit britain falls behind#brexitbetraysbritain#stopbrexit #fbpe #leavelies
so...#remain was right about the costs, but #leave decided they wanted out anyway?say, can you guys be the  ones who pay for  #brexit then-all of it?for starters: #markcarney has the  estimated financial cost. (it'll be billions)cheers!
new evidence that illegitimate russian pro #brexit influence on #euref dwarfed that of #leave campaign. surely no uk government or true british  patriot can stand behind a result engineered by a foreign power intent in weakening our country? #fbpe #waton #remain #stopbrexit
so here’s another #leave voter who has now looked at who #brexit will actually benefit and has changed their mind. brexit cannot be for the many - just the few. those few being elite & rich already.respect @wafu23rn for speaking out as a #remainernow  there are so many like you! 
dear #leave votersyou were promised you'd be no worse off 'cos we'd have a relationship with eu that gave us the exact same benefits...if you're not happy to "take the #brexit hit" then you can change your mind. it's not too late, but time is short. see .@remainernow #finalsay
if honda go then so will toyota and nissan. those who maintain that we should still #leaveeu like to call themselves patriots, but #brexit is turning out to be the most treacherous and cowardly act of national destruction! #stopbrexitsavebritain #stopbrexit #fbpe
suddenly *no deal* #brexit has reared it's head again & become a very real possibility, even though it was never #leave's stated intention to leave the eu without a deal and leavehq said it would be "so catastrophic, no responsible govt would do it." scary. demand #finalsay!
well said @terrychristian on #bbcqt :#brexit is simple...only for simple people. struggling to recall richard tice or anyone else from #leaveeu telling british public about "benefits" of having irish border reinstated or uk financial sector losing eu trading passports.
something stands out in this daily mail headline: tory mp henry smith saying soros should stop telling the uk to remain under eu yoke. the claim that there is a eu 'yoke' is a lie, the kind of big lie told by totalitarian regimes. #leavelies#stopbrexit #fbpe #brexit #waton
when firms start to lay off staff as a result of #brexit, #leavers should be made to lose their jobs first. after all they knew what they were voting for, as they keep telling us.
oh, come on brexiters, how long can you pretend to yourselves that this is a good idea?are you nuts? we should abandon brexit and remain in the eu.#fbpe #waton #brexit #leaveeu
let me summarise what the #remoaners are saying about #brexit17.4 million voted to #leavebut that is all too difficult to do.so we will ignore the biggest vote in britain's history and #remainhow about we get some politicians who can deliver the #brexit we voted for in 2016?
many leavers believe that immigration harms the #nhs. perhaps they read the article for which the daily mail was forced to write the apology below. #leavelies #stopbrexit #brexit #fbpe

anyone out there heard from a #leaver who's been able to cite a measurable, tangible benefit they will gain personally after #brexit. or any eu rule forced upon the uk, that has detrimentally impacted their lives. all i get is flatulent soundbites and we won you lost get over it
is #brexit all about corporate tax evasion? is it coincidence that the #dup, #torys and #ukip all voted against the #eu corporation tax clampdown in 2015? @open_britain #stopbrexit #waton #fbpe @labour4eu #leavelies #remain @ofocbrexit @isitworthitbus
we have reached the stage where most people are turning off when #brexit comes on the media.they have had enough of the endless dither and delay.'we the people' gave the politicians a clear instruction.#leavethey should stop messing about,just get us out.
theresa may's big speech today ... i wonder what the eu are thinking right now !tell them to take or leave it theresa !#brexit #leaveeu #leave @theresa_may @conservatives
uk - since it joined the #eu - has been consistently withdrawing from engagement with it-schengen-the euro-rebate of contributions-voting #leave is the most recent onesince 1945 #uk has been limping alongnow it’s attempting #brexit suicide
#nigelfarage: every single major player of that referendum said that if we #voteleave we are leaving the #singlemarket & by implication the #customsunion. unless we leave we will not be able to go global and get the benefits that ought to come from #brexit 
so #tonyblair now thinks there's only a 50% chance of #brexit actually  happening. that's funny, his own institute's #poll reveals 68% of 143,000 #voters  want to "#leave at whatever cost". still ignoring the will of the people, tony..? #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @uklabour
didn’t take #farage long to tell his first fib on #bbcqt when he said everyone in referendum campaign said we’d exit the #singlemarket if we #brexit.  several prominent #leave campaigners said the opposite:
just seen a post on facebook claiming unemployed immigrants in the uk get £29,900 p.a. in benefits; comparing it to old age pensioners getting just €6000 p.a.these outright lies are why farage and the #leave camp were able to get the gullible to vote for #brexit.#stopbrexit
eire has different vat on pretty much everything compared to britain. but there is no 'hard' border in northern ireland. why would a different customs regime in the countries make a hard border inevitable?#brexit#leavecustomsunion
bravo! we urge more decent mps who voted remain to take britain's side against the eu bully#brexit#leavecustomsunion
why is it that all the bond villains look like eu commissioners ?#brexit #leaveeu #leave #jamesbond
i would like to know exactly who we have acting on our behalf in parliament.we have been told that we were not intelligent enough to vote on the subject of eu membership ... so just how intelligent are our politicians ?#brexit #leaveeu

personally, i think racism is a accusational tool used by government to beat the public with. most of us respect other races, what we resent is having no control over successive government's immigration policy ...#brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu
this week gives us a last big chance to influence the direction this country is headed. if you can vote, please do. have no regrets. if you are against #brexit vote #abtv. don't let the "big 2" spin your vote into a vote for #leave. give them a kick in the ballots. #stopbrexit
regardless of if you voted #leave or #remain in the 2016 referendum, it is the people who should make the final decision on #brexit. that is why we are demanding a #peoplesvote and will be marching to parliament on june 23rd.
a #leaver once told me they voted for #brexit because french farmers are lazy and do nothing for their money. it's 10 pm and our neighbour, a french farmer, is still in his tractor spraying his crops in the fields adjacent to our garden. he's been at it since daybreak.
i’d like to ask every #remoaner this question. #leaveeu #brexit 
a lot of ppl voted #brexit as a big "fu" to a lot of things-personal/ political. that's how #leave ran the campaign...just put all your stuff in the #takebackcontrol basket & vote "out". it's not calling folks "stupid" to say this."leave" used  political analytics. so did trump.
the north east of england voted #leave (fairly heavily) but people in the region are changing their minds & becoming #remainernow  majority of leavers are unhappy with the way #brexit is going and are concerned it will make them poorer.#peoplesvote ?
it appears @jacob_rees_mogg has finally stopped all the sickening niceness towards @theresa_may ... it's about time someone took these one-sided 'negotiations' by the scruff of the neck. #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu
a shameless lie from @sajidjavid. an advisory referendum cannot result in an instruction. and 37% isn't enough for a public sector strike according to your government. it certainly is not the british people. these #leavelies  are perverting democracy. #stopbrexit #brexit 
. @sajidjavid and @michaelgove both shamelessly lying:1. the result of an advisory referendum cannot be an instruction2. there was no reference to staying in or quitting the customs union on the ballot paper.so more #leavelies perverting our democracy.#stopbrexit #brexit 
your rank and file #leaver doesn't care about the cu, sm or sovereignty, indeed many probably don't even understand what they are. #brexit for the masses was only about curtailing immigration because right wing propoganda sold them a none existent problem. #brexit has no benefits
consider yourself warned @theresa_may. this is not what we voted for. #leavemeansleave #brexit 
"#sunderland voted by 61% to 39% to  #leave-"@msmithsonpbif the #brexit vote affected the decision-this is a tragedy.#nissan

nigel oakes, the scl founder said that trump whipped up fear of muslims to gain electoral advantage. the #leave and #brexit press campaigns cynically inflamed, not just fear of muslims, but fear of eu immigrants and refugees.  #stopbrexit #voteeu #abtv
given sheer number of issues & cock-ups this #tory gov't are currently  "handling"- windrush, syria, sex pests, #leave fraud, russia, nhs & (still) grenfell - i wonder when we'll get round to the small matter of organising an orderly #brexit? confident? yah. me too.#abtv
proud to have stood protesting against the idea of a second referendum with some brave, calm and collected democrats & general public from across the political spectrum this weekend. some of them had never been to a protest before. #brexit #leavevoters
it’s not just the revelations that the #leaveeu campaign cheated, it’s the fact that the emerging #brexitreality bears no resemblance to what they promised. no wonder there is a clamour for a #peoplesvote on the actual #brexit deal !
here’s a message i was sent from nabila, a #leave voter who is concerned about the division in the u.k. & is a #remainernow. @bilared explains how her belief in #brexit is no longer intact & does not want the uk economy & the union breaking as a result of it. nabila & thanks. 
spanish woman dragged by hair on tube and told speak english when in england' another example of broken #brexit britain. #leavers, you created this septic atmosphere.  i hope you're pleased with yourselves. via @metrouk
two good things from this (1) the initiative of a pro-eu londoner travelling to a #brexit region to listen, learn and persuade. 2) video of a #leave voter explaining how he did not realise brexit would effect eastern europeans (that add much to his community) & his change of mind
here are the unicorn promises that were made about #brexit here is another day for you #nationalunicornday. #leavers look at the promises that were made now ask yourself, why they have been broken! they lied to you time to #stopbrexit use your #abtv in may show them that #waton
out of 46 million registered voters only 17.4 million voted to #leave and strip 63 million people of their eu citizenship rights. there is no majority. just a tail trying to wag a dog.we will *never* support what is being attempted. #brexit *will* be stopped for the majority.

like a frenzied supremacist lynch mob the scottish press goes after a female msp while totally ignoring a huge story about #richardcook #tory who appears with #dup #voteleave to have broken several laws & undermined democracy #brexitvia @spotlightni ‘scotland, dark money, dup’
dear friends and #leavers. this of course is a lie to provide cover for the true purpose of #brexit to establish a capitalist fundamentalist authoritarian regime post a no deal exit.  nothing to do with benefitting you or the country. he's a remorseless liar this one #30/03.
this graph shows very clearly that the #leave vote was a very small blip in an otherwise clear will to stay in the eu. the lying, cheating, international interference racist undertones and total failure to make #brexit work for anyone surely means a #peoplesvote is now inevitable
the levels of shysterism on display in last nights #spotlightni programme will come as no surprise to a local audience; here in london however increasing chorus of folk asking “who are these people?!” #brexit #voteleave #dup
mogg loses the plot completely, claiming #leavers in treasury are coordinating business attacks on #brexit.if he pulled his head from his own arse he'd realise that businesses like bmw and airbus don't scaremonger, it could affect their share price.
according to #leavers, uk job losses are not the result of the #brexitshambles. they are either the fault of the eu, or the fault of #remainers for not getting behind #brexit.wake up #leavers, jobs lost will be entirely your fault. own it, don't try passing the buck.
do you remember when half a million people marched on the capital to #leave the eu? me neither.@theresa_may#stopbrexit#brexit#peoplesvote
@anna_soubry speaks for me. gerrymandered advisory referendum was not intended to mandate #brexit according to 2015 referendum bill. brexit is unconstitutional. @theresa_may will give #leavers what they want. british economy crushed & citizens facing decades of hardship & misery.
the tactics used here are frightening. arron banks had access to 'police databases for fraud prevention purposes.' #brexit #cambridgeanalytica #leaveeu
started work straight from school and worked my entire life paying uk taxes. took early retirement and sold up and moved to france. apparently, according to #leavers, having exercised fom means my opinion about #brexit is now worthless.

if #brexit is still the will of the majority of the people, why are #leavers dead against a vote by the public on the final deal, now we are better informed, which includes an option to exit from #brexit?it's been two years since the original vote. the mood has changed.
the #peoplesvote was on 23rd june 2016, in which 17,410,742 voted for #brexit - the biggest mandate in uk political history. as a #voteleave campaigner, i’d have respected a remain victory. why can’t #remoaners?
if #brexit is such a bloody good idea, then why the f... are so many people dead against it; and why is the pm trying every trick in the book to force it through parliament without proper scrutiny.wake up #leavers, you've been conned into supporting a hard right take over.

funny how many of those currently criticising the bbc's coverage of #brexit and #voteleave were happy to mock corbynites when we had similar complaints about the bbc's coverage of corbyn.
my guess here is that @bbcnews won't admit that #voteleave broke the law until people are physically arrested, charged and found guilty in court. so, just now they're only prepared to use the word 'allegations'. i'm in no way defending them because #voteleavebrokethelaw#brexit
the #voteleave #brexit campaign been evidenced to have been a criminal conspiracy backed by dark money and the #altright....orchestrated by a lot of posh boys...backed by the daily mail...notice the similarity.
steve bannon - trump’s chief strategist in 2016 election - now in close liaison with farage, johnson, gove & rees-mogg in anti-eu campaign... one might almost think the two things might be related. #brexit #voteleavebrokethelaw
there’s fake news, electoral fraud, rule-breaking. all ‘cheating’.  whether you voted #remain or #leave, don’t let the privileged british establishment duck the blame for their mess. demand a vote on whether to accept or reject their poor deal/no deal #brexit. 
the sheer brokenness of remainers wanting second and third goes at a #brexit referendum when they lost the one that mattered, despite remain having had all the support of the modern media/establishment & all its spivvish, blairite hangers-on #leavemeansleave
we must not normalise what this sham govt are doing. they are caught in dangerous tunnel vision, desperately clinging to power no matter the consequence to the people of this country. #brexit #voteleavebrokethelaw
important to understand crux of #brexit is that #uk voted in #euref for the #magnacarta narrative identity it shares with #canzuk, not #eu’s charlemagnian alternative. it was a choice between two possible futures. #leave won & #remain lost. it’s time to #respecttheresult #ukpoli

steve bannon & boris johnson. steve bannon & nigel farage. steve bannon & jacob rees-mogg. notice a pattern developing? #brexit #voteleavebrokethelaw
now that #brexit is unravelling and the truth of the impossibility of the #leave promises are dawning on #brexiters, you can bet the eu will be blamed for the negative consequences. hunt has already tried it on in germany. no wonder davis ran away.
wonder if costa del sol #brexit voters realised they were voting themselves out of being able to receive their future insurance based pensions. of course they didn't, none of the downsides were on the ballot paper, despite #leavers claiming to have known the consequences.
...because @jeremycorbyn and @johnmcdonnellmp are old style hard left no deal brexiteers! they will sell out “remainers” and sensible #leave voters who  want a #brexit that protects jobs, prosperity and peace in n ireland. 
with mogg admitting it will take 50 years for the uk to see any benefits from #brexit, how can any #leavers still support it. the majority will be long dead by then and our children and grandchildren will have lost half a century of opportunities.

#tories #cheating to get votes through parliament. tory cabinet on the board of the #leave campaign that cheated to obtain the #brexit result.how can #may continue as #pm unless she sacks those conspiring to #cheat in both votes. by doing nothing she is condoning their actions.
fraudulent? #remain was backed by government funding. plenty of working class people voted for #leave. you all said the uk economy would fall apart once #brexit was announced. here we are with the best unemployment figures for 43 years and 21 consecutive quarters of gdp growth.
"the result in favour of #brexit was obtained, at least in part, by breaching electoral law. it cannot be allowed to stand - another vote now essential," says scottish brexit minister following #voteleave revelations

a reality check: leave spent £13.5 million. remain spent £19 million. that's not including the £9 million the government spent of taxpayers’ money on their pro-remain booklet. so take the biased electoral commission with a very large pinch of salt #brexit #leave

4,000 disgruntled tory brexit voters joined ukip since may's stitch-up.2,500 new #ukip members in the last week alone.all because eu 'associate membership' is not leaving the eu !!17.4 million voters voted to leave - so leave!#brexit #leave #eu go #wto
shouldn't be ignored that the #dup #brexit 'donation' takes #voteleave's illegal spending beyond the £1million mark.
it's not about labour or tories it's about whether our government, whichever party is in power, actually respects the democratic voice of the people.#brexit means #leave
“...a result won with cheating and law breaking can[not] be said to represent the will of the people in june 2016” please sign and share this petition. @hackneyabbott - please, we need you and @uklabour to step up and speak up - the referendum must be annulled #brexit #voteleave
#voteleavebrokethelaw #voteleavecriminals #thismatters #peoplesvote a corrupt referendum confers no mandate.mrs may is operating in a hung parliament, so now the electoral commission has found voteleave broke the law, her pursuit of #brexit is illegal. 
excellent thread from @adamwagner1 on why it will be very difficult to legally challenge #euref result on basis of #voteleave cheating. i agree with him that ultimately what we do about this is a political rather than a legal decision #brexit #fbpe
the reason why the #voteleave cheating is so important is because it's not some minor technicality. that money was used to buy advertising that sought to deliberately mislead the public into thinking they would be better off with #brexit. they won't. it's a compounded fraud
i'll just leave this here shall i? you outspent us 2-1, had the machinery of government behind you and still lost. #brexit #voteleave
a reminder that @anna_soubry received £6,000 from pro #eu more united ltd 8th may 2017 according to the mps register financial interests. she is receiving money to defy #brexit, the government and the will of the nation.just think on that#voteleave#chequersmeanscorbyn
if only there was some evidence of massive over-spending by the remain campaign then i am sure the electoral commission would investigate it.... #voteleave #brexit #tuesdaythoughts
jacob rees mogg is working theresa may from the back#voteleave cheated yet the #brexit result still standsthe scottish tory mps voted against @scotparl having any saywhy is scotland still in this uk union? this is not democratic! #indyref2
i’ve never been a ‘let’s have a second referendum’ person but surely if #voteleave have been fined and referred to the police for breaking the law over their #brexit campaign there needs to be another one or this whole brexit thing stopped?
how many #voteleave mps have money in off shore tax havens? is this why they want #brexit because eu was going to clamp down on them? asking for a friend.
all the headlines about #voteleave being fined £61k for breaching spending limits feels like a storm in a teacup when you compare it to the £9m of taxpayers money spent by david cameron on sending #brexit project fear leaflets to each household ?
#voteleave broke the law, have been fined and referred to the police. the referendum should be declared null and void. not only was it advisory anyway, the campaign was illegal. why on earth should the uk #brexit in light of this? #stopbrexit
#soubry:  "nobody voted #leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them." #brexit
#brexit is now just an internal battle within the tory party. jobs will be destroyed and families wrested apart just to satisfy the egos of a few multi millionaires. they don't give a toss about the public or the carnage they create.#leavers you are the enablers of this madness
andrew marr: "it’s fake sovereignty, it’s not real sovereignty!in theory, we can go to brussels and say ‘do you mind if we change these rules’.in practice, once the common rulebook is in place, we can’t, not in the real world."#brexit #leave #eu
interesting group of people who voted #leave who regret it - and want a chance to reconsider #brexit :

"the way they were trapped in a room, phones removed, in chequers meeting with t.may, pm. was just like those pyramid sellers, the ponzi scheme pushers do: brainwashing people into parting with their cash, confidence tricksters manipulating" - @195dal#brexit #leave #eu
from a leading #qc interpreting the phrase, ‘the #commonrulebook.’ every  person who voted to #leave should read this and understand its meaning - the #chequers turd proposal is to #remain in the #eu and we will be in a far worse position, than we are now! #maymustgo #brexit #uk

your leader has just sold her party members and the wider #leave electorate out, in an epic betrayal of #brexit. @theresa_may is taking orders from #merkel. there is no #eu 'negotiation'. you lied and people found out.
eu is a dead thing, it's just a matter of time. but it's toxic, it's like abusive relationship you can't get out of.but you know what? i think britain is the only country mentally strong enough to break up with the abuser.#brexit #leavemeansleave#fridayfeeling #chequers

#brexit #leave #remain #chequersplan #selloutin a nutshell.
theresa may spouting drivel intended to mislead. there is absolutely no evidence that #brexit  in any form will increase british exports, and there is plenty of evidence indicating that it will have a negative impact on our exports. #leavelies #brexit #peoplesvote
#leavers. the uk isn't in schengen. the uk chose not to have the euro. your elected mep gets to vote on eu rules/laws. the uk has a special rebate on its membership fee, but still has full entitlement to all the benefits of membership and all eu trade deals. so why #brexit
amongst all the rhetoric and posturing from the #leave campaign, i've never heard an economic case for #brexit having been made. lots of soundbites, but no actual numbersand no case for #brexit delivering a tightening of border controls, if indeed they're neededit's pointless
erm. the eu is stopping tax avoidance (their directive comes into force on 1st april 2019)#brexit happens 29th march 2019coincidence? no.#voteleave funded by virtually all the billionaire tax avoiders so they can continue to offshore their wealth without eu stopping it.
may's threat to launch a rival satellite system proves how pointless #brexit is. total costs will run into billions to achieve nothing. the government squanders tax payers money as though there's a bottomless pit. #leavers, did you vote for this waste?
so #leavers we've established the uk trades all over the world, parliament is sovereign, democratically elected meps represent the people, uk already has control over its borders,eu migration is essential, there's no £350 a week for the nhs. so why #brexit and damage the economy?
tell that to workers in the manufacturing sector in the #eastmidlands who voted #leave on the basis we’d get a #brexit deal that would deliver a better economy and an extra £350million a week for the #nhs
once again the brexiters are wailing that the eu is bullying the uk. we warned them that the eu was the stronger party & would look after the 27 not us, but they said that was project fear and that the uk held all the cards. yet more stinking #leavelies!#peoplesvote #brexit

no deal #brexit.  time to face this.  every deal uk has to trade or fly or do anything across borders is currently done thro eu.  #leave with no deal & uk cannot do any of those things. uk doesn't get to keep them.  nothing "reverts".  it all stops  there is more..... #fbpe 1/2

theresa may has missed & ignored the whole point of the referendum it was a vote for ‘independence’ & ‘sovereignty’chequers is neither of these working men & women have said no to the elites. this is going to destroy the conservatives#leavemeansleave #brexit @conservatives
but...if the majority  vote #leave again (which is very likely). isn't that ok?we'll all be better informed. it's a referendum. they aren't written in stone and brought down from the mountaintop. i don't understand #labour.#brexit 
guess #leavers are genuinely looking forward to sitting in a shivering ring round rusty petrol drums in which they can burn rubbish, eating turnips and singing patriotic songs. i am disgusted with the xenophobic ranting that has characterised their vile #brexit campaign. #fbpe

what have we learned since #euref2016 ?- there is no #brexit dividend - there is a £39 bn divorce bill- there are no trade deals- businesses are leaving- jobs are going- facebook data was stolen - individuals were targeted with ads with lies- many #leavers are #remainnow
they say remainers are the elite. £16.7m of the £24.4m spent by the brexit campaign came from just 10 men, with a combined wealth in excess of £11.5 billion. #leavelies#stopbrexit #brexit #peoplesvote
it is now patently clear that the promises and the assurances made by the #leave campaign were never deliverable, so why on earth is the government pressing on with the bankrupt #brexit project. the lives of millions will be negatively impacted, nobody wins, everybody loses.

#leavers, imagine waking up one morning to find that the inhabitants of the next village had had a vote on your future. they'd decided that you may, or may not be able to stay in your home. you'd have to ask permission to stay and nothing was certain. that is what #brexit is.

the reality of tory #brexit. they just want to keep taxes low for their big business backers and the mega-rich. it was never about sovereignty, just about making the uk a low tax haven and hang the consequences for the public. #leavers you were conned.
it is imperative that the people realise that the #erg are not doing this for the good of the country, they are doing it only for the good of themselves. nothing good can come out of #brexit for most of us. #leavers must realise that the #erg are in it for the money.
six months to go and the tories still don't have concensus on their #brexit approach.any #leaver claiming they knew what they were voting for should take their crystal ball and get a job as a clairvoyant in blackpool.#peoplesvote

there's been a solution to #brexit staring may in the eyes ever since the vote. just emulate norway. it keeps the #leavers happy as the uk will have 'left the eu' and keeps #remainers happy as the benefits are broadly the same as membership.and ignore the erg protestations.
#brexit was never going to work the way the #leave liars said it would.why would anyone ever believe the uk could have all the benefits of eu membership for trade, but not have to pay and not have to follow the rules.it was cleary a lie.
i'm a #remainer &i feel betrayed by the democratic process, #newsnight. remember the lies. i know s.o. who changed her vote because of turkey. now we know #voteleave broke the law. #may didn't try to a find consensus. #brexit will damage our country. #peoplesvote #finalsay #fbpe

#bbcnews has just graciously allocated a wee bit of time to #scotland and #brexit - and implications of a #peoplesvote and #indyref2.who do they choose to talk about this? some #leaver touting britain's trading wonders and #kezia.from #snp or #yes - zilch.this is balance, bbc?
jaguar putting workers on a three day week is not #projectfear, it is #projectreality. #brexit is slowly breaking britain. when will #leavers wake up? when will the #pm wake up? when will #parliament wake up?
there is no #brexit deal whatsoever that is more beneficial to the people of the uk, uk jobs or the uk economy than #remaining in the eu.this is an irrefutable fact. i defy any #leavers to provide evidence to the contrary.#stopbrexitsavebritain
this is their plan a political agreeement of warm words of good intentions a new leader will rip up. we will #brexit  w no deal - no certainty for biz, another broken #leave  promise & more tory squabbling. business & ppl must speak out or this will be our future @peoplesvote_uk

how the #brexit vote was tainted. ⁦@jolyonmaugham⁩ explains yesterday’s court judgment & the implications for #voteleave & the #dup. it’s time to ask how a vote procured by lies & illegality can be allowed to stand
the high court ruling of the challenge to #leave spending brought by @jolyonmaugham and funded on @crowdjustice just found out that the elections watchdog was wrong over #brexit expenses.  
we already knew #voteleave cheated. now the high court rules that they were also wrongly allowed by the electoral commission do things they shouldn’t. the basis for #brexit looking ever dodgier  
main reasons for a #peoplesvote now proven wrong:- @electoralcommuk confirmed #voteleave's actions- £350m/week will go to the #nhs- roaming charges unchanged after #brexit ... but don't worry, utlra-remainers will find another 'democratic' reason to try to overturn #brexit

tory infighting demonstrates how stupid #brexit is. they can't even agree amongst themselves what #brexit means. there are supposed to be 17.4million #leavers out there who claim they knew what it meant when they voted for it, can't one of you give them a clue 
we’ve worked for two years to build this case to #prosecuteboris. this is about fighting #fakenews and dishonesty in politics. focussing on #leave or #remain with #brexit is a mistake. we need to deal with the misconduct that divided us first. #boris
#leavers it won't all be alright if you just close your eyes, put your fingers in you ears and sing lala.#brexit is going to break britain's economy, cost jobs, put prices up and starve the nhs of funding.the writing is on the wall. ffs get behind a #peoplesvote to stop may.

how can #leavers expect anyone to believe they knew what they were voting for, when the tory party still haven't all got behind a single vision of what #brexit looks like. the only people who spoke as one were the #remainers.
refusal (inability) of #leave leaders & those who bang on for #nodeal #hardbrexit #erg #chuckchequers to provide their #brexit plan notably on how to avoid a hard border #nireland is height of irresponsibility. time to see off these people & back #peoplesvote @peoplesvote_uk

starting today w @bbcnorthampton at 7.40 to explain why @wep_uk conference is in kettering, where #voteleave launched & tory council wouldn't invest in care - and now expects women to work unpaid and in poverty to compensate. a foretaste of a no-deal #brexit. #joinwe #we2018
the petition to rescind article 50 if #leave broke election laws (they did) is to be debated in parliament on 10th september. the government initially dismissed the petition but then it reached over 190,000. so now it must be debated by mps. well done everybody.#brexit #remain
one of these politicians is on the right side of history**it's @darrenpjonesthe other is an ex member of matthew elliott's #voteleave campaign committee. promoted to #brexit minister he appointed the director of comms at elliott's iea, stephanie lis, as his 'special adviser.' 
it isn’t the govt, isn’t bank of england, isn’t an economist, isn’t a politician.it’s a swiss investment bank & financial services co. advising its clients, but i’m sure #brexit #leave fanatics’ll be along to tell us it’s all project fear & they know more about banking than ubs.
as the truth has emerged about #brexit the country has turned against it & against the #leave campaign that used #brexit to achieve its own agenda of a far right takeover. the ref was a coup. the country can see that now and we must have a peoplesvote for democracy #fbpe

with the election of bolsonaro in brazil we can see yet again the us alt right in action. they are the acid in the blood of humanity right now. same people behind #brexit. so any #leavers that still don't believe that, bolsonaro is another example. the uk has a chance to stop it.
uk served a50 notice to #leave. gina miller aided that by insisting it became law after parliamentary vote rather than executive authorisation. the withdrawal act 2018 repeals the european communites act 72. the eu is expunged on 29 mar 2019. that’s the law! #peoplesvote #brexit 
why all the angst about a ‘second referendum’! we want a 1st legal, fact based #brexit referendum that treats the uk electorate with a modicum of intelligence. the electorate of the united kingdom (#leave and #remain) deserved better than the 2016 debacle. we still do. #finalsay

@warren_oates  do you speak for 17.4m uk  citizens who voted with fully open eyes and considered judgment? happily we live in a democracy. please celebrate that, and respect the vote of the majority. uk  #brexit #leave #out
in the last year no fewer than 75 official polls were carried out on #brexit. out of those 75, only 2 showed a lead for #leave. our politicians have simply run out of excuses. public opinion has changed. we must not leave the eu. the british people unequivocally reject it.
and it has shown that there is more passionate will for the uk to #remain in the #eu than there is for #brexit. #leave simply cannot, and have not, motivated this level of public support. #farage may bribe a few into a scruffy pub with the offer of a free beer, but that's it.
love all the #brexiters with sour grapes over the #peoplesvotemarch, trying to talk down the numbers attending and talk up the couple of hundred that attended fartages dismal pro-leave shambles. #brexit was procured through cheating and we won't be silenced by more #leave lies.
so after today’s #peoplesvotemarch where sore losers took to the streets to demand a second vote in the hope that they’ll win this time - the people’s vote result still stands - we won! we’re leaving #brexit#leavemeansleave
if you voted #brexit to stop eu migrants coming to the uk and claiming benefits you were conned. eu migrants that cannot support themselves and their family after being in the uk for 3 months can be removed. the #leave campaign lied to you, eu migrants come to study & work.

theresa may is willing to look at extending the transition period for brexit to three years, the eu parliament president has suggested.this would mean we’d be subject to eu rules without having a say in them#maymustgo#brexit#leavemeansleave
#leavers, the uk sat at the top table of the eu. it was a rule maker, not a rule taker. it had opt outs from what it didn't like, had a huge discount on its membership, enjoyed all of the benefits and always controlled it's own bordersunlike #brexit, there were no downsides.
17.4 million people already #voted #leave love.#brexit #uk
the sheer contempt with which the eu is treating the uk is reason enough to #leave.#brexit
to #remainers it has come as no surprise that the govt cannot deliver #brexit. a promise based on lies will always flounder when reality kicks in. i just wonder how long it will take for the penny to drop in the minds of dogmatic #leavers who refuse to believe they were conned.
the electoral commission passed its findings(that #voteleavebrokethelaw in #brexit referendum) to the police. #police cannot now fail to investigate because it’s politically sensitive! ..

i don't understand why #leavers are so against the eu. the eu has agreed many employment and other rights that the people of the uk enjoy. the uk didn't chose secure these rights before it joined the eu and the tories want to remove them after #brexit.remaining makes sense.
i hope every mp will get this message loud & clear. your job depends on you doing your job, i.e. protect the national interest. #brexit is russia's foreign policy. that should tell you all you need to know about it, but #voteleavebrokethelaw should convince you if it doesn't.
everytime the government releases the #brexit impact papers #leavers leap to defend their position by claiming it's all #projectfear. apparently the report of the m26 being prepared as an emergency car park is untrue too, it's just scaremongering.#brexit ostriches
government warns #eurostar could stop under no-deal #brexit#projectreality again. well done #leavers, more chaos at your hands.
i'm a #brexit moderate who voted #remain, but since we're going to #leave we must make it work for us. i can't therefore see that either parliament or i would vote for britain to be locked into a permanent open-ended customs union arrangement!
#leavers. if #brexit is a good idea, why are the govt closing the m26 to carry out works to turn it into a car park for lorries trying to take uk goods and food stuffs into the eu after march?why aren't you campaigning to know the truth, or do you just not care#brexitshambles
dithering former #brexit secretary david davis has claimed that the “benefits” that #leavers were hoping for when the uk leaves the eu are starting to vanish.there never were any benefits, he's just getting his excuses in early !!
no. #brexit is 100% the responsibility of the british government. this government chose to #leave - the eu have set out the choices available. there are literally 100's of legal agreements both with the #eu27 & globally that cannot be broken for the sake of uk demands. #finalsay
which #brexit option is your preference?#standup4brexit #leavemeansleaveretweet for large sample
many #leavers wanted #brexit so the uk could control the numbers of eu citizens coming to the uk. in other words so it could say no to applicants.by doing so, they have deprived 65million brits of the right to study, work or retire in the eu, as they too can now say no.
raab #bbcr4today reported saying reversing #euref2016 would diminish confidence in the democratic process. it is #leave law breaking, foreign interference and the greed of politicians who stand to benefit from #brexit that undermine democracy. check what we think now #peoplesvote
this is brilliant & sums it all up perfectly! #brexit #leave #remain #remoaners
with brexit negotiations entering their final stretch and just 5 months until brexit day. if there was a second referendum. what would be your vote now? #brexit #remain #leave
when manufacturing jobs are inevitably moved to the eu post #brexit, british workers will have not the right to follow the work. eu citizens living in the uk will not be similarly hampered. another #leaver own goal.#brexitshambles

with #brexit we'll get our idependence back & our economy will boom. trouble with the #remoaners is that they only like democracy when the vote goes their way.there won't be 2nd #eurefbut if there was the #leave majority would be huge.us brits don't like being told what to do

#brexit throws 'spanner in the works' of global growth. the warnings which #leave dismissed turn out to be reality:
why are #brexiteers so against a referendum on any #brexit deal? if #leave is such a good idea, they've nothing to fear, right?
'the eurosceptics whined for 41 years. so why does everyone expect #remain to just accept #brexit?' #voteleave
the fogeys embrace foreign cultures, but why we have to sacrifice ours to do it is beyond us.#euref #brexit #leave

vote leave said #brexit would be good for the economy. but the city expects the impact to be "horrible" #leavewatch

#leave voters have been deceived on the cost of #brexit      it’s wasting money  not bringing it in for the #nhs or anything else 
funny  #leave campaign said #brexit would save money  which wld all go to the #nhs  turns out it costs a fortune   
voters were grossly misinformed about the issues in the #brexit referendum  much to the benefit of #leave   1#leavelies #stopbrexit
the #brexit right want a tax haven for the rich  english nationalist hysteria is their tool  #leave voters are their dupes  #stopbrexit
the #leave option was a catch all slogan which covered a huge mess of incompatible and mostly completely unworkable proposals #brexit  1
my late dad worked 40 years on an assembly line making tin cans at night because the night  shift paid more money and he was our sole provider  so  yeah  i get why people voted #leave  and why folks voted #trump too but they made a mistake  #brexit  and trump is against them

#leave has become a farce  spending more on #brexit than the #nhs   where did that come from  who voted for that  nobody i know who s sane and willing to stick their head above the parapet 
so far #brexit has cost us £700m #philliphammond is expecting it to cost another £3bn where is that money for the #nhs #leave campaign was funded by tax dodgers because the #eu was clamping down on #tax havens #brexit is the biggest con ever perpetrated on the british public 
 @electoralcommuk   new information has come to light  re  #voteleave   it is possible that during the course of the investigation  the commission will identify potential contraventions   #nullification#brexit

voters were massively misinformed on major issues before the #brexit referendum  in every case in favour of #leave  john major said it would be deceitful if a vote for brexit was based on inaccurate information #stopbrexit
people who backed #brexit included  those using tax havens  those deceived by #leave  putin  trump  #exitbrexit
strong @nytimes piece  was #brexit suicide  no  #leave deceived voters  but it would be suicide to continue with it 
the head of vote #leave had close russian ties including to a suspected russian spy #stopbrexit #brexit
this     nail on the head a percentage of those who didn t vote did not vote out of complacency  as most of the #brexit news has been negative  non voters will turn to #remainadd in those who are #remainernow   elderly #leave voters now deceased     #stopbrexit #fbpe
the latest world economic league table states that britain has recovered from an initial economic blip after the vote to #leave and now looks set to maintain its position in the rankings and improve by 2020 after #brexit 
delia here decided to talk about her #brexit regret first thing christmas morning  she sets out her reasons for her #leave vote in a number of tweets which i will thread below  all good reasons but now wants to #remain   reason 1  #fbpe #stopbrexit
russian campaigning for #leave and #trump was not inconsequential  it was part of #putin’s strategy to expand russian power by undermining cooperation between real democracies  by pursuing #brexit we’re doing exactly what putin wants  
because #leave is not about #economics  it would be dead in the water if it were makes no economic sense  leave is uk s very own  rightwing #populism  like trump  #afd  #frontnational the eternal tory #proxywar re  europe has had many manifestations this one is called  #brexit 
my mother voted #leave because she trusted the commitment to £350m for the nhs  she is angry that promise will not happen  she’s not online  so persuaded by press   bus  mum wants another referendum  she feels she’s been lied to  #brexit

britons were massively misinformed on the main #brexit issues  in all cases to the advantage of the #leave campaign john major said  if they decide to leave on the basis of inaccurate information     then i regard that to be deceitful #stopbrexit #fbpe
if you voted #leave   you still think #brexit is a good idea  please think about whose interests the leaders of the two leave campaigns serve   it s not the interests of the ordinary people who voted leave  
#marr there are plenty of other #leave campaigners in #brexit referendum who did say we should stay in #singlemarket
post may s brexit  a romanian working in mcd can still bring over his wife 4 kids and parents to live in britain with better rights than us brits  and they can take their case all the way to the ecj  how is this fair  #brexit #nodeal #leaveeu pls rt and like if you agree
i discovered today that some generally well informed anti #brexit #labour voters were unaware that even in #leave voting lab seats  majority of lab voters chose #remain  i shared this    
question for #leavers  as the uk government didn t know what the consequences of #brexit would be  and they still don t apparently  how can you claim you made an informed decision when you voted to #leave the eu 
this is what pisses me off more than anything about #brexit   there was no consensus on what #voteleave actually meant  still isn’t   these options should have been on ballot paper for clarity  uk being pushed off a cliff when the majority was actually for #remain  #stopbrexit
 brexit is not the answer to social injustice that many poor #leave voters wanted  on the contrary  #brexit is a deepening part of a continuing problem   #stopbrexit  #toriesout   #solveukpoverty  simples 
     poll      since the brexit referendum have you become more  pro eu  or more  anti eu    #brexit #marr  #bbcsp #smallbizsatuk #labour #conservatives #jeremycorbyn #theresamay #leave #remain
even without the “divorce bill”  the rising #costofbrexit dwarfs our net contribution as members #leave lied to us #brexit will cost us jobs  tax revenue    income    
if we had a #referendum on the final deal   how would you vote  #brexit #fbpe #leaveeu #remainplease rt poll after you vote 
by 2019  about 1 5 million people over 60 will have died since #eureferendum  data shows 70  backed #leave so say 1 1m  we are on course for 2 5m 18 34s to register to vote  if 70  back #remain that s 1 75m  crucially  no more majority for #brexit by default #remainernow

interesting piece from a #leave voter who would like a chance to reconsider #brexit   
the consensus now is that #brexit is no longer inevitable  the eu wants us to stay  a huge #remain community wants to stay   the #leave camp is running scared  let s make the most of this opportunity   pull out all the stops to #stopbrexit@libdems @thegreenparty @snp @labour4eu
#bbcqt whatever else  it’s false to say that all #leave campaigners said #brexit means leaving the #singlemarket
aaron banks   #nigelfarage   want a #2ndreferendum on the #brexit deal fine okay if you insist i won t put up a fight seems like a very sensible idea to me very democratic in fact let s do it  landslide for #leave  they say they say   #stopbrexit #fbpe
is it me     or is the @bbc ignoring the public support for jacob rees mogg becoming leader of the @conservatives  it s like they don t want the @conservatives to win the next election or something #brexit #brexiteers #leaveeu #euref
seriously  what is the point of #brexit will it give £350m extra to #nhs  nowill it maintain exact same rights   benefits as we have now  nowill it make us better off  noall the #leave promises are broken  #brexit isn t what we thought  we can change our minds  #finalsay
as someone who voted #leave i regret it massively and would vote #remain if we got another vote but i also think we need to stop blaming #corbyn for #brexit  heres why 
#fbpe #stopbrexit #brexit #leavers #leaveeu if there were a second ref would you change your vote  or if you didn t vote last time  
the #pm @theresa may is hellbent on keeping us in the filthy #eu hatchery  where nothing grows and everything stagnates  the pm wants to #leave in name only  for her #brexit is a damage limitation job not the golden opportunity we voted for @conservatives
in light of misleading information exposed  accurate information obtained  a deeper realisation   understanding of the complexities   consequences   because it affects the destiny of millions  it is wise   our duty to reconsider brexit #stopbrexit #brexit #remain #leave #fbpe
happy new year all  it’s going to be a big 2018 for the #remainernow movement as we work to make it clear to the govt that their #brexit policy is not wanted by so many that voted #leave in #euref but also those that did not and could not vote  #finalsayforall #exitfrombrexit

walk away now     and give the eu 30 days to reconsider their position #leaveeu #leave #nodeal #brexit
it really is very  very simple  we cannot leave the #eu without causing significant damage to our economy  that has been proven beyond reasonable doubt  people need a chance to re evaluate their #leave positions now this crucial fact is known #stopbrexit#fbpe#brexit#remain
are you listening #labour voters  @jeremycorbyn along with keir starmer don t give a  tinker s whatsit  that many labour voters voted for #brexit   @uklabour intend to keep uk in the #eu ignoring your vote to #leave 
cost of #brexit continues to rise    #brexitreality is not what we were promised by the #leave campaign   via @infactsorg  
if you only read the #leave #brexit  supporting press  you won t know that the #eu27 has moved on  their stance   #noparalleleu  that was on the table at the beginning the #euro is becoming a reserve currency  and the eu region is growing #brexit 
this guy is bang on the money  we didn’t vote #leave to regain some sovereignty  we voted to leave to regain all sovereignty  #brexit #bbcqt
uk enters as sick man of europe  now uk appears to be leaving it’s becoming sick again  it appears the eu has treated and continues to treat the uk fairly and proportionately  #brexitimpact #brexit #leaveeu #fbpe #waton #brexitreality #brexitshambles #stopbrexit
why has #brexit opinion polling stopped  8 10 december #remain had a 10 point lead  one more poll released a week later  also showing uk doesn t want to #leave  then nothing for 2 months what don t they want you to know    #fbpe#stopbrexit
us patriots with irish    british roots please help our nations to break free of europe  the eu is dictatorial  corrupt and disfunctional #leave #irexit #brexit #euiscorrupt #eu
we are looking for #european mods that want to #leaveeu and stand against #eurabia  dm me if that sounds like you    #mega #newright #brexit @euroskeptic
some in the #leave camp are definitely getting concerned that #brexit isn t going to happen  the clearer it becomes that it s going to be an unmitigated disaster  there also appears to be a correlation between how abusive they are and the amount of racism in their twitter feeds
i’ve spent many a christmas away from my home and family  reassured by the fact i was serving my country  what is see out of my window now  with the left wing  tree hugging  pc dipsticks gets to me  however #brexit for me makes it all worth while  dont let us down #leave #torys
so   #remain was right about the costs  but #leave decided they wanted out anyway say  can you guys be the  ones who pay for  #brexit then all of it for starters  #markcarney has the  estimated financial cost   it ll be billions cheers 
new evidence that illegitimate russian pro #brexit influence on #euref dwarfed that of #leave campaign  surely no uk government or true british  patriot can stand behind a result engineered by a foreign power intent in weakening our country  #fbpe #waton #remain #stopbrexit
so here’s another #leave voter who has now looked at who #brexit will actually benefit and has changed their mind  brexit cannot be for the many   just the few  those few being elite   rich already respect @wafu23rn for speaking out as a #remainernow  there are so many like you  
dear #leave votersyou were promised you d be no worse off  cos we d have a relationship with eu that gave us the exact same benefits   if you re not happy to  take the #brexit hit  then you can change your mind  it s not too late  but time is short  see  @remainernow #finalsay
if honda go then so will toyota and nissan  those who maintain that we should still #leaveeu like to call themselves patriots  but #brexit is turning out to be the most treacherous and cowardly act of national destruction  #stopbrexitsavebritain #stopbrexit #fbpe
suddenly  no deal  #brexit has reared it s head again   become a very real possibility  even though it was never #leave s stated intention to leave the eu without a deal and leavehq said it would be  so catastrophic  no responsible govt would do it   scary  demand #finalsay 
well said @terrychristian on #bbcqt  #brexit is simple   only for simple people  struggling to recall richard tice or anyone else from #leaveeu telling british public about  benefits  of having irish border reinstated or uk financial sector losing eu trading passports 
nice for downing street to make pompous declarations to #leave customs union  but do they realise  they are in charge of governing the whole country not just the questionable #brexit ref  have they addressed the good friday agreement  #stopbrexit #cakeism #finalsay #waton #fbpe
 #blair can’t see that he s the epitome of why many working class people voted #leave  a man elected pm to help the working class  helping only himself  to lucrative jobs  a 10 strong housing portfolio and a £30million fortune   #brexit #remain #jc4pm
excellent account of #brexit promises that the #government has quietly dropped   no doubt hoping that #leave voters won’t notice they’ve been lied to

one of #brexit s ironies is that those areas with the highest #leave vote will suffer most harm from #brexit  i hope political parties are being responsible   explaining the real risks to them  #carmanufacturing cld go  #sunderland #northeasthour#1yrarticle50 #countdowntobrexit

in light of evidence to suggest #leave only won #eureferendum as a result of cheating   breaking the rules pressing forward regardless with #brexit wound be deeply divisive  fundamentally undemocratic   destroy the trust of the british people #fbpe #remain #brexitgate #fairplay
this is a must read  more excellent work by @peterkgeoghegan   @adamramsay on dodgy spending by #leave   #dup  investigative  journalism at its best #brexit #fbpe

pls don t listen to those who cry   why is this coming out now   i wrote about the use of #bigdata a year ago in the @theneweuropean re  #voteleave  @carolecadwalla started writing  about their shenanigans 2 years ago    and a lot others  too  #brexit
one of the biggest shocks the #westminster elite got on june 23 2016 was when the great people of #wales #voted to #leave the corrupt #europeanunion   and a new opinion poll shows that they still back #brexit   #bbc #lbc #sky #uk @conservatives @uklabour
i think this should read that #leave voters in england care more about #brexit than the  precious union  of @theresa may  s imagination   they would be happy to see n i and scotland break away 
#voteleave bollocks   someone really really wants to scupper #brexit #imaginemyshock poll  if we do get shafted   have a 2nd ref  how will you vote  
translation  while the government  the bbc  almost every politician   most of the media knew the right thing was to vote remain  and connived to achieve it   a handle of people i disapprove of argued for #leave  we therefore must vote again  until we get the right answer  #brexit 
no one likes a cheat so when they get caught out there are consequences #balltampering #resign #stevesmith  as the truth emerges about #leave dodgy funding  abuse of social media  fake claims   phoney promises  let’s make sure the voters they cheated hold them to account #brexit

#nigelfarage   in december  concessions were made and here we are in march making yet more concessions  it s very difficult for #leave voters to think we re  going to get anything other than #brexit in name only     #bbc #lbc #sky #uk @conservatives #tory
the margin that trump won in the places that he won was minuscule   like the #leave win  another clue that #bigdata micro analytics may have played a part  the beauty  for mischief makers  is that the tiny vote margins  deepens dissension #cambridgeanalytica #brexit  
these images were  targeted  to those people whose harvested data showed they were the most susceptible to voting #leave #brexit was entirely based on lies  spin and overt racism is this who we are #stopbrexit

polling shows a gradual but small shift from #leave to #remain since the referendum that we might exit the eu with a majority against  let alone the supermajority in favour required in most countries  is an affront to democracy #stopbrexit #brexit

uk   since it joined the #eu   has been consistently withdrawing from engagement with it schengen the euro rebate of contributions voting #leave is the most recent onesince 1945 #uk has been limping alongnow it’s attempting #brexit suicide
#nigelfarage  every single major player of that referendum said that if we #voteleave we are leaving the #singlemarket   by implication the #customsunion  unless we leave we will not be able to go global and get the benefits that ought to come from #brexit 
so #tonyblair now thinks there s only a 50  chance of #brexit actually  happening  that s funny  his own institute s #poll reveals 68  of 143 000 #voters  want to  #leave at whatever cost   still ignoring the will of the people  tony    #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome @uklabour
didn’t take #farage long to tell his first fib on #bbcqt when he said everyone in referendum campaign said we’d exit the #singlemarket if we #brexit   several prominent #leave campaigners said the opposite 
just seen a post on facebook claiming unemployed immigrants in the uk get £29 900 p a  in benefits  comparing it to old age pensioners getting just €6000 p a these outright lies are why farage and the #leave camp were able to get the gullible to vote for #brexit #stopbrexit

regardless of if you voted #leave or #remain in the 2016 referendum  it is the people who should make the final decision on #brexit  that is why we are demanding a #peoplesvote and will be marching to parliament on june 23rd 
i’d like to ask every #remoaner this question  #leaveeu #brexit 
a lot of ppl voted #brexit as a big  fu  to a lot of things personal  political  that s how #leave ran the campaign   just put all your stuff in the #takebackcontrol basket   vote  out   it s not calling folks  stupid  to say this  leave  used  political analytics  so did trump 
the north east of england voted #leave  fairly heavily  but people in the region are changing their minds   becoming #remainernow  majority of leavers are unhappy with the way #brexit is going and are concerned it will make them poorer #peoplesvote  
 #sunderland voted by 61  to 39  to  #leave  @msmithsonpbif the #brexit vote affected the decision this is a tragedy #nissan
#brexit divorce cost uncertain  say national auditors  but likely to be around £35bn £39bn so much for the #leave lie that it would save money that would all go to the #nhs  
nigel oakes  the scl founder said that trump whipped up fear of muslims to gain electoral advantage  the #leave and #brexit press campaigns cynically inflamed  not just fear of muslims  but fear of eu immigrants and refugees   #stopbrexit #voteeu #abtv
given sheer number of issues   cock ups this #tory gov t are currently   handling   windrush  syria  sex pests  #leave fraud  russia  nhs    still  grenfell   i wonder when we ll get round to the small matter of organising an orderly #brexit  confident  yah  me too #abtv
it’s not just the revelations that the #leaveeu campaign cheated  it’s the fact that the emerging #brexitreality bears no resemblance to what they promised  no wonder there is a clamour for a #peoplesvote on the actual #brexit deal  
here’s a message i was sent from nabila  a #leave voter who is concerned about the division in the u k    is a #remainernow  @bilared explains how her belief in #brexit is no longer intact   does not want the uk economy   the union breaking as a result of it  nabila   thanks  
two good things from this  1  the initiative of a pro eu londoner travelling to a #brexit region to listen  learn and persuade  2  video of a #leave voter explaining how he did not realise brexit would effect eastern europeans  that add much to his community    his change of mind
out of 46 million registered voters only 17 4 million voted to #leave and strip 63 million people of their eu citizenship rights  there is no majority  just a tail trying to wag a dog we will  never  support what is being attempted  #brexit  will  be stopped for the majority 
blair  germany will stop brexit and force britain to stay in the eu well  i suppose germany is about as an elected representative as the house of lords bring on the next battle #brexiteers#brexit #leaveeu #democracyindanger

good news italian political crisis may halt #brexit negotiations with eu as brussels prioritise protecting eurozone over a deal with uk let s take this excellent opportunity for a clean break with eu#wto is responsible for 95  of world trade#leave #eu

the republic of ireland’s referendum result  66 4  to 33 6  in favour of overturning the abortion ban  deserves to be respected as “the voice of the people”  the uk eu referendum result of 51 9  to 48 1  in favour of brexit does not #stopbrexit #ukpolitics #leave #remain #brexit
michael portillo govt allowed irish issue to dominate brexit this suits british civil service  who never wanted to #leave eu in the first place  it suits eu   it suits the irish i also think it is now beginning to suit the prime minister  #brexit #eu

 if a general election elects a gov on a  leave ticket  i would abide by it  in 2017 general election 90  of mps were elected on a manifesto that promised to #leave tory gov    dup who support them  were both elected promising to deliver #brexitwhy not abide by the result jon  
in 2017 90  of the mps were elected on a manifesto promising to make #brexit happen they should stop all the faffing about and honour their promise if they don t  the 17 4 million who voted #leave will vote them out at the next election 
shameful that the assessment   views #brexit of people running vital british businesses like #pharma which employ thousands of workers are routinely ignored by media  these great firms will shift production  jobs  when we #leave #eu unless we secure #customsunion #singlemarket

we knew the #brexit #referendum was  narrowly  won on the basis of a pack of lies and with a questionable franchise  we recently learned about data abuse  and now we know the #leave campaign cheated on the spending   
a former #brexit supporter and #leave campaigner changes his mind and has the courage to explain why    @will dryofoc
chloe westley “we stay in the customs union  we can’t take back control of our trade it’s just that simple that’s why we’re leaving the customs union  leaving the eu #brexit means taking back control of our laws  borders  money   trade  #leave #eu
has house of lords apologised to the eu yet for the #brexit vote have the lords of lords apologised yet for 17 4m of us who obviously did not know what we were doing when we voted to #leave it is good job we have those wise people in the house of lords to correct our mistakes
if #brexit is such a brilliant idea  why do no other eu countries want to #leave 
uk voted to #leave all #eu customs arrangements     may  needs to listen to her parties   her cabinet who have given a very strong message on this issue she may not realise it  but we are on the brink here this could be the end of theresa may #brexit
the #leave camp garnered 37  of the electorates vote in the referendum  sensing a hard sell in the hoc  may called a general election on a #brexit ticket  the country replied by removing her majority  how on earth is #brexit therefore still called the will of the people 
#piersmorgan hits out at the same old pro #euro campaigners banging on about #europe   explains why we must now get on #brexit  “we had a #referendum  everybody had a chance to have their say and we voted democratically to #leave ”  #bbc #sky #lbc @lbc
the vote that  @conservatives have now is largely a #leave vote they have an expectation  #brexit has cast a shadow people say that it s not mentioned on the doorstep  but it was such a very big choice so lab and cons have matched each other point to point   #johncurtice #wato

that #brexit uk was merely a  test run  for putin  trump and #cambridgeanalytics is a measure of how unimportant they consider us that various #leave campaigns so openly colluded with one another is a measure of how weak our policing and legal systems are  #stopbrexit pic twitter com 2ylwu9opl1
house of lords are trying to scupper #brexittheir arrogance is mind blowing they think they know better than the 17 4m of us who voted to #leave if they want to run the country they should stand for election if they don t want to do that  they should zip it #abolishthelords

thanks to @commonscms @damiancollins for publishing my new evidence on #brexit #leave eu #eldoninsurance and us insurance industry #ai at #olemiss ahead of my testimony tomorrow in mississippi court case  @uni of essex @acmcu @smpagwu #cambridgeanalytica 
john redwood civil service had 2 years to prepare for uk to #leave #eu without a deal or negotiate good deal if possible they have 9 months to complete their work   been instructed clearly by ministers we are leaving single market   customs union#brexit
we buy and sell oil on the international markets  we refine oil products  we distribute fuel  there is no question of running out of such products  pure unadulterated #remain propaganda designed to “terrorise”  think about that word ppl  #fbpe #brexit #leave #remain #lordhawhaw
mr barnier  what is sometimes hard for british to understand is that we don t want to negotiate  we don t want to compromise on who we are  britons also don t want to compromise on who we are uk wants to #leave  it is our choice to #leave#brexit #eu
#leave people who are upset with #garylineker walkers have produced some crisps just for you #brexit #fbpe #peoplesvote
and those investigations uncovered exactly how #leaveeu and #voteleave won  unexpectedly   they broke the law  pumped £600 000 illegally into illegal social media adverts  even ignoring the 3 day moratorium due to the murder of jo cox  that s how they won  unexpectedly   #brexit 
funny how many of those currently criticising the bbc s coverage of #brexit and #voteleave were happy to mock corbynites when we had similar complaints about the bbc s coverage of corbyn 
my guess here is that @bbcnews won t admit that #voteleave broke the law until people are physically arrested  charged and found guilty in court  so  just now they re only prepared to use the word  allegations   i m in no way defending them because #voteleavebrokethelaw#brexit
the #voteleave #brexit campaign been evidenced to have been a criminal conspiracy backed by dark money and the #altright    orchestrated by a lot of posh boys   backed by the daily mail   notice the similarity 
there’s fake news  electoral fraud  rule breaking  all ‘cheating’   whether you voted #remain or #leave  don’t let the privileged british establishment duck the blame for their mess  demand a vote on whether to accept or reject their poor deal no deal #brexit  
important to understand crux of #brexit is that #uk voted in #euref for the #magnacarta narrative identity it shares with #canzuk  not #eu’s charlemagnian alternative  it was a choice between two possible futures  #leave won   #remain lost  it’s time to #respecttheresult #ukpoli
pro eu campaigners posing as  removals ltd  offer to help @borisjohnson vacate his grace and favour london home   more than two weeks after he resigned as foreign secretary  #brexit #leaveeu #remainread the full story here  
now that #brexit is unravelling and the truth of the impossibility of the #leave promises are dawning on #brexiters  you can bet the eu will be blamed for the negative consequences  hunt has already tried it on in germany  no wonder davis ran away 
   because @jeremycorbyn and @johnmcdonnellmp are old style hard left no deal brexiteers  they will sell out “remainers” and sensible #leave voters who  want a #brexit that protects jobs  prosperity and peace in n ireland  
theresa may has finally succeeded in uniting the uk     we now all think that she must resign #gotheresago #brexit #leaveeu @conservatives @uklabour @thesnp @libdems @duponline @ukip

john major puts it in a nutshell  vote leave promised things that could never have been realised if you voted #leave  please watch this   #brexit can’t be done  
1  absurd to say #voteleave illegal spend didn t affect #brexit results  ads were highly coordinated   decades of advertising science were behind that campaign 2  comparing legal govt spend with your illegal spend is like comparing the car i bought to the one you stole  #c4news
if you were given a #finalsayforall #peoplesvote   how would you vote   #leave #remain #eu #brexitplease rt after you vote for a larger sample 
#c4news unearths south african court documents that may shed light on the origin of the mystery millions that @arron banks poured into #leaveeu and #brexit who d have guessed #brexitrussia #peoplesvote
john redwood  thank the irish pm for showing us how absurd project fear is there are international agreements allowing overflights irish planes will still fly over uk once we have left eu   uk planes will still fly over ireland   #brexit #leave #eu
#tories #cheating to get votes through parliament  tory cabinet on the board of the #leave campaign that cheated to obtain the #brexit result how can #may continue as #pm unless she sacks those conspiring to #cheat in both votes  by doing nothing she is condoning their actions 
fraudulent  #remain was backed by government funding  plenty of working class people voted for #leave  you all said the uk economy would fall apart once #brexit was announced  here we are with the best unemployment figures for 43 years and 21 consecutive quarters of gdp growth 
 the result in favour of #brexit was obtained  at least in part  by breaching electoral law  it cannot be allowed to stand   another vote now essential   says scottish brexit minister following #voteleave revelations
boris  after 18 months of stealthy retreat    mr speaker  it is not too late to save brexit we have time in these negotiations we have changed tack once and we can change again #brexit #leave #eu via @guidofawkes
#heartsandminds of 3 67m #50swomen their families  friends  their 732 000 plus supporters are poised to #vote in any #election equally  to influence transit of treaties @ehrc @un #cdaw @ehrcchair#pmqs #highcourt #brexit #voteleave #mandeladay #letterofintent #wednesdaywisdom
4 000 disgruntled tory brexit voters joined ukip since may s stitch up 2 500 new #ukip members in the last week alone all because eu  associate membership  is not leaving the eu   17 4 million voters voted to leave   so leave #brexit #leave #eu go #wto
shouldn t be ignored that the #dup #brexit  donation  takes #voteleave s illegal spending beyond the £1million mark 
excellent thread from @adamwagner1 on why it will be very difficult to legally challenge #euref result on basis of #voteleave cheating  i agree with him that ultimately what we do about this is a political rather than a legal decision #brexit #fbpe
the reason why the #voteleave cheating is so important is because it s not some minor technicality  that money was used to buy advertising that sought to deliberately mislead the public into thinking they would be better off with #brexit  they won t  it s a compounded fraud
if only there was some evidence of massive over spending by the remain campaign then i am sure the electoral commission would investigate it     #voteleave #brexit #tuesdaythoughts
jacob rees mogg is working theresa may from the back#voteleave cheated yet the #brexit result still standsthe scottish tory mps voted against @scotparl having any saywhy is scotland still in this uk union  this is not democratic  #indyref2
i’ve never been a ‘let’s have a second referendum’ person but surely if #voteleave have been fined and referred to the police for breaking the law over their #brexit campaign there needs to be another one or this whole brexit thing stopped 
how many #voteleave mps have money in off shore tax havens  is this why they want #brexit because eu was going to clamp down on them  asking for a friend 
all the headlines about #voteleave being fined £61k for breaching spending limits feels like a storm in a teacup when you compare it to the £9m of taxpayers money spent by david cameron on sending #brexit project fear leaflets to each household  
#voteleave broke the law  have been fined and referred to the police  the referendum should be declared null and void  not only was it advisory anyway  the campaign was illegal  why on earth should the uk #brexit in light of this  #stopbrexit
#soubry    nobody voted #leave on the basis that somebody with a gold plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them   #brexit
andrew marr   it’s fake sovereignty  it’s not real sovereignty in theory  we can go to brussels and say ‘do you mind if we change these rules’ in practice  once the common rulebook is in place  we can’t  not in the real world  #brexit #leave #eu
interesting group of people who voted #leave who regret it   and want a chance to reconsider #brexit   
polls carried out before david cameron announced the #eu ref showed #leave were trailing by up to 13 points  nobody wanted it now  hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition asking for a #peoplesvote and it is being denied  this is wrong #brexit#finalsay
a clear and consistent 10 point swing from #leave to #remain giving remain a 5 point lead @theresa may  at what point do we get a #peoplesvote   or are referendums only held to settle arguments within the #tory party #brexit
 @markdrakeford is right a hard #brexit  that makes wales poorer  that creates barriers to trade and collaboration  has no mandate join us to oppose this shambolic mess #takecontrol and demand a #peoplesvote on the final #brexitdeal 
please listen whether you voted #leave or #remain  this gave me goosebumps  of total fear  who is going to answer that question  what happens the day after  #brexit 
a #british #donaldtrump would have put britain first in #brexit negotiations  unlike the #traitor #theresamay who holds #leave voters in #contempt and has appeased #brussels at every turn with her treacherous actions  #brexit  #bbc #sky #lbc @conhome @cchqpress #conservativeparty
thank you to @realdonaldtrump #maga #mbga #brexit #leave voters support you #wwg1wga
1 2  the investigation into #cambridgeanalytica is tugging at a loose thread that is connected to the very fabric of our society  this scandal isn t just about #facebook  #trump  #brexit  #voteleave etc  it is about the way corporate power subverts our democracy to its own ends  pic twitter com xcibj5dnmi
it is clear the #euref result was achieved by massive illegal data fraud   breaking the law in multiple ways by #voteleave   #leaveeuhow long will it take before @bbcnews stops respecting fraud   illegal acts on our democracy #voteleavebrokethelaw #voteleavecheated #brexit 
 the way they were trapped in a room  phones removed  in chequers meeting with t may  pm  was just like those pyramid sellers  the ponzi scheme pushers do  brainwashing people into parting with their cash  confidence tricksters manipulating    @195dal#brexit #leave #eu
from a leading #qc interpreting the phrase  ‘the #commonrulebook ’ every  person who voted to #leave should read this and understand its meaning   the #chequers turd proposal is to #remain in the #eu and we will be in a far worse position  than we are now  #maymustgo #brexit #uk
#brexit ministers drew up plans to #leave no 10 drew up a totally different brexit plan and presented it like a rabbit from a hat at chequers it is no wonder #brexit ministers resigned they were totally shafted by their own pm the pm acted despicably #maymustgo
over 12 months there have been no fewer than 35 opinion polls carried out  with about 60 000 participants  how many of these have shown a lead for #leave that s right  two  out of 35 no longer the  will of the people #peoplesvote#noconfidence#brexit#brexitshambles
so let me get this straight the #british people voted to #leave and for #brexit two years ago but  their rulers think they are smarter so are attempting to thwart the will of the people looks like their #deepstate is the same as ours #theresamay is no #thatcher #bojo
john redwood  resignation of #brexit secretarythere are only 2 sensible options 1   comprehensive free trade deal with #euor2   exit eu on wto termswe need to #leave on 29 march 2019 do the eu want free tradeordo they want to trade under wto terms 
#brexit is a foundation of sand “rain came downstreams rosewinds blew   beat against that houseit fell with a great crash ” the nation’s courage to reverse that collective eu referendum mistake would be the first bucket of concrete #stopbrexitnow #remain #leave #ukpolitics
the #brexit #daviddavis wants  as opposed to the  17m other imagined brexits in the minds of #leave voters    the people need to be given concrete options to vote on  and it needs to happen now #peoplesvote
stupid is as stupid does boris johnson “anyone defending the proposal we have just agreed will find it like trying to polish a turd luckily  we have some expert turd polishers in this government ”#brexit #leave #eu
as the plot thickens on @arron banks dealings with russia  we are perhaps starting to see who would benefit from #brexit the most  not the people  only the super wealthy  wake up  #leave voters  you have been duped
any #european leader who values the nation state should vote down any #brexit deal that sees #britain #leave in name only  #eurosceptics across #europe need to help each other in the fight against the elites like the #lying @theresa may  #maymustgo #bbc #sky @lbc #lbc @conhome
if #uklabour had not betrayed millions of their own supporters who voted #leave in the #euref  and backed the government from day one  #brexit would be delivered by now corbyn s lust for power is more important than honouring @uklabour 2017ge promises #aplagueonbothyourhouses
your leader has just sold her party members and the wider #leave electorate out  in an epic betrayal of #brexit  @theresa may is taking orders from #merkel  there is no #eu  negotiation   you lied and people found out 
we ve always suspected tory plants on #bbcqt but tonight we saw it first hand  meet the man who got 3 questions  andrew livsey  the tory candidate for wallasey in 2017 and chair of north norfolk vote #leave    #scotref #brexit #indyref2 #bbcbias

toxic  brexit funder arron banks faces police probe into his finances  #eu #brexit #voteleave #peoplesvote
newsflash  #voteleave cheated  the #referendum result in  invalid   #brexit is  cancelled   any future referendum must be transparent and lawful  #cancelbrexit #newbrexitreferendum
#voteleave cheated  along with the news of the #brexitbigshort  the #leave campaign was  dirty   we need the official opposition to be a watchdog re  #brexit  but they are not on the field  so we have to do this ourselves 
when does a campaign based on lies and funded by dishonesty cease to become “the will of the people”  #voteleave #brexit
the #voteleave campaign broke election law  it’s time for another referendum  #brexit
“so many people who voted #leave  having seen that #brexitreality is very different from what they thought they had voted for  have changed their minds  but #journalists   mps seem to imply no one changed their minds ” @remainernow in @pmpmagtoday  #brexit 
rees mogg  customs 3rd way is  a muddle     deeply unsatisfactory non brexitit would be a cheat on the electorate to stay in single market   leave in name only this isn t hard brexit or soft brexit  it s just being honest with voters #brexit #leave #eu
letter from 30  mpsdear prime minister our departure must be absolute we must not remain entangled with eu’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation britain must stand firm #brexit #leave #eu
i don t care why you voted to #leave the #eu in june 2016  if you still support #brexit knowing everything you know now  then you want to harm the #uk   #standup2brexit #stopbrexit #fbpe @remainingkind @loubinwally @lunaperla @stopbrexitmarch @acgrayling @marieannuk
#brexit #leave #remain #chequersplan #selloutin a nutshell 
amongst all the rhetoric and posturing from the #leave campaign  i ve never heard an economic case for #brexit having been made  lots of soundbites  but no actual numbersand no case for #brexit delivering a tightening of border controls  if indeed they re neededit s pointless
erm  the eu is stopping tax avoidance  their directive comes into force on 1st april 2019 #brexit happens 29th march 2019coincidence  no #voteleave funded by virtually all the billionaire tax avoiders so they can continue to offshore their wealth without eu stopping it 
if the eu is good at securing trade deals then do we have deals with brazilchinaindiausaaustralia  many more being in the eu prevents us doing trade deals with the rest of the world  we need to free to strike good   comprehensive deals#standup4brexit #brexit 
tell that to workers in the manufacturing sector in the #eastmidlands who voted #leave on the basis we’d get a #brexit deal that would deliver a better economy and an extra £350million a week for the #nhs

why wait  leave now  uk would be a net winner of order £650 billion under wto rules if we leave now we advance benefits of leaving   we do not pay £39 billion as we haven’t done a deal leaving under wto rules is the way we should go  #brexit #leave #eu

i defy anyone to read this and conclude anything other than that a canadastyle agreement with the eu is vastly superior to chequers in every conceivable way #brexit #standup4brexit #chequersplan #chequers
“quietly somewhere there was a coup d’etat going on” @cmackinlay to the brexit select committeethe whole british public has been misled  the #chequersplan simply doesn’t deliver #brexitwould you be willing to support our campaign  craig and pledge to #standup4brexit 
did you #standup4brexit @dominicraab or did you discuss the #chequersplan farce which is nowhere near the #brexit that we were promised  
hi @eddiehughes4wn we re sad that we haven t heard from you about joining the 17 other mps who have pledged to #standup4brexit   reject the #chequersplan we re grassroots   we think that #chequers is not #brexit  we would love to have you on board please let us know

hi @alewermbe i have a feeling that you are pro #brexit   like us  think that the #chequersplan does not deliver the brexit that we were promised will you pledge to #standup4brexit   join the other mps who have pledged their support it would be great to have you on board 
remember that feeling when the #chequersplan was first announced @owenpaterson was first off the blocks to convey how clearly it would not deliver the #brexit that we voted for  or were promised at lancaster house or in our manifesto will you pledge to #standup4brexit owen 
it’d be great if you could share our #standup4brexit campaign tom we’re calling for all mps to reject #chequers as it doesn’t deliver the #brexit promised at lancaster house or in our manifesto if you could share for us  that would be great
“if it’s the #chequers deal #brexit doesn’t mean brexit” @jacob rees mogg will jrm be sending us a pledge soon make sure you email your mp and ask them to reject chequers and #standup4brexit you can find their email here

hi @andrewrosindell we have an feeling that you’re pro #brexit  we wondered if you would join the growing number of mps to #standup4brexit and join our grassroots campaign to reject the #chequersplan it would be great if you joined us  we’d love a video from you too 
thank you so much to iain for recording this video  pledging to #standup4brexit  and backing our grassroots campaign #standup4brexit seeks to amplify the voices of everyday people  so that our lawmakers can’t help but hear them and go on to deliver the #brexit we voted for 
i haven t had a #poll yet on the #bigissue of the day         so here goes #poll #brexitpoll #remainpoll if there were another vote how would you vote #brexit  #leave #remain #ivevotedonce #inevervote  #europeanunion #eu #ukvotes
hi nigel we agree  that is why we formed #standup4brexit  we believe that the #chequersplan does not deliver #brexit and should be rejected mps like @stevebakerhw and @patel4witham have pledged their support to our grassroots campaign  it would be great if you did too
it is now patently clear that the promises and the assurances made by the #leave campaign were never deliverable  so why on earth is the government pressing on with the bankrupt #brexit project  the lives of millions will be negatively impacted  nobody wins  everybody loses

hey there @lee4ned we have a feeling that you will #standup4brexit  we wondered if you will join the growing number of mps and back our grassroots campaign to reject the #chequersplan and deliver the #brexit that we were promised  it would be great to have you on board  
amazingly all the talk of a  no deal  brexit has spurred on the eu to actually engage with talks  and then hunt comes out this nonsense that harms our choice of a smooth deal  stop talking us down #standup4brexit #brexit 
if jeremy hunt doesn t believe no deal is better than a bad deal  then he is unfit to be foreign secretary  we need cabinet ministers who respect the will of the british people and believe in britain   not project fear pessimists  #standup4brexit #brexit 
good news   brussels says brexit will not be discussed at eu summit there is nothing to discuss we are leaving 29th march 2019   eu are the weakest link   goodbye #brexit #leave #eu
hey there @dkshrewsbury we wondered if you would #standup4brexit and join our grassroots campaign to reject the #chequersplan  because as you know  #chequers is not #brexit a lot of mps already support us  it would be wonderful to get a pledge of support from you   
hi @abridgen  we know that you are pro #brexit so we cannot figure why you have not replied to my tweet earlier in the week will you join the other mps and join our #standup4brexit campaign to reject the #chequersplan i   the other activists would love it if you did

hi @nigelmp we have a feeling that you are pro #brexit but we were wondering if you will be backing our #standup4brexit campaign and reject the #chequersplan lots of mps have pledged their support  it would be fantastic to have your backing too

this superb letter appeared in our local paper @hertsad today i recommend everybody adapts it and emails sends to their own mp we have to counter the #leave campaign lies  the growing influence of #reesmogg   his fascists and together stop a #nodealbrexit #brexit #stopbrexit
#brexit has prod higher inflation  no growth   now another interest rate rise  we are all poorer thanks to the lies pedalled by those supporting #voteleave  time to take back control   reverse this madness #fbpe #peoplesvote
i voted to remain in #europe   am very anti #brexit but the public cast their vote   there shouldn t be a 2nd chance #democracy is a responsibility   if some #leave voters now regret their decision  tough shit  that s what you get for believing the media   @nigel farage  
as it is #cpc18 eve  let s remember last #cpc when the pm promised a #brexit deal that was based on lancaster house instead we got given #chequers do remember that chequers isn t the lancaster house vision   #standup4brexit #cpc18 #chuckchequers
a vital thread  something we   others have looked at in the past  yet  as with other strands in the #brexit #voteleave #tory #trump #scl #cambridgeanalytica #aiq story the msm have pretty much ignored the connection  article below may help your research  
jonathan @freedland is on the money here i also think it s a factor why some men voted #leave in the #brexit referendum  very last thing those male leavers want to admit is their vote was a result of their own insecurities  which they ll deny they have   
john major   there isn t a single intellectual argument against holding a 2nd referendum  you mean like the referendum you denied the british people for maastricht that created the european union  you utter hypocrite #standup4brexit #brexit#peoplesvote
the same mps who were elected under a manifesto to deliver #brexit  who voted for art50   the eu withdrawal bill  those mps @drphillipleemp  including you   most in the electorate are angry over this anti uk  anti democratic stance #standup4brexit   back #planaplus  canada

turn back time to last years conference when we were promised a #brexit deal that was based on lancaster house   instead we got #chequers   despite outrage  the government still persit with it remember that chequers is not the lancaster house vision   #standup4brexit #cpc18
 @amberruddhr needs to remember that supporting a #peoplesvote to prevent a #nodealbrexit would go against the will of the british people and the @conservatives manifesto  #standup4brexit #brexit
#standup4brexit supporter @rossthomson mp will be speaking at the commonwealth reception at #cpc18  we’re fairly sure that #brexit will feature date  1st october time  19 30venue  hyatt regency dolce room  
 @bernardjenkin mp will be at a #cpc18 fringe event called “what will be the outcome of #brexit”given that bernard has pledged to #standup4brexit  we are sure that this will be interesting date  1st octobertime  15 45venue  hall 8a
we re a one stop place for all #brexit related news at #cpc18 it s worth noting that there s another event at the #birmingham midland institute on 1 10 18 which is billed as the  alternate cpc    it will feature mps who have pledged to #standup4brexit 
why does the pm dismiss canada plus is it because it beats chequers in every conceivable way and she doesn t want to admit that she should have gone with canada  from day one irresponsible and wrong decision  canada  is the way #standup4brexit #brexit

how the #brexit vote was tainted  ⁦@jolyonmaugham⁩ explains yesterday’s court judgment   the implications for #voteleave   the #dup  it’s time to ask how a vote procured by lies   illegality can be allowed to stand
the high court ruling of the challenge to #leave spending brought by @jolyonmaugham and funded on @crowdjustice just found out that the elections watchdog was wrong over #brexit expenses   
we already knew #voteleave cheated  now the high court rules that they were also wrongly allowed by the electoral commission do things they shouldn’t  the basis for #brexit looking ever dodgier  
main reasons for a #peoplesvote now proven wrong   @electoralcommuk confirmed #voteleave s actions  £350m week will go to the #nhs  roaming charges unchanged after #brexit     but don t worry  utlra remainers will find another  democratic  reason to try to overturn #brexit

in the last year no fewer than 75 official polls were carried out on #brexit  out of those 75  only 2 showed a lead for #leave  our politicians have simply run out of excuses  public opinion has changed  we must not leave the eu  the british people unequivocally reject it 
and it has shown that there is more passionate will for the uk to #remain in the #eu than there is for #brexit  #leave simply cannot  and have not  motivated this level of public support  #farage may bribe a few into a scruffy pub with the offer of a free beer  but that s it

switzerland is in schengen  ireland is not  it is in a common travel that is separate to the eu and existed long before it  no customs union or backstop needed  an open border is fine and all this wrangling is just an attempt to keep us shackled to the eu#standup4brexit #brexit 
what the #remoaners are saying is that #brexit is just too difficult so we ll allow the 5th biggest economy in the world to be run by the unelected eu dictators well  the 17 4m brits who voted #leave are made of sterner stuff than that   we won t let you betray us in this way

why are people acting surprised by this  had we voted remain on 23rd june 2016 we were always eventually going to   lose the rebate   adopt the €  join schengen the only version of remain was always  hard remain   this was why we had to vote leave #standup4brexit #brexit 
i m a #brexit moderate who voted #remain  but since we re going to #leave we must make it work for us  i can t therefore see that either parliament or i would vote for britain to be locked into a permanent open ended customs union arrangement 
no  #brexit is 100  the responsibility of the british government  this government chose to #leave   the eu have set out the choices available  there are literally 100 s of legal agreements both with the #eu27   globally that cannot be broken for the sake of uk demands  #finalsay
which #brexit option is your preference #standup4brexit #leavemeansleaveretweet for large sample
raab #bbcr4today reported saying reversing #euref2016 would diminish confidence in the democratic process  it is #leave law breaking  foreign interference and the greed of politicians who stand to benefit from #brexit that undermine democracy  check what we think now #peoplesvote
this is brilliant   sums it all up perfectly  #brexit #leave #remain #remoaners
rt if you believe you have been lied to by the #leave campaign    the entire #brexit process  and also if you would vote #remain if you were given a #finalsayforall #peoplesvote if you want a #peoplesvote please continue to spread the message   
government whips can rally as many labour mps as it likes  it won t change the fact that the deeply unpopular and unworkable chequers is unacceptable to the eu canada  is perfectly acceptable to the eu and infinitely more popular with the british people #standup4brexit #brexit 
former prime minister  sir john major  has said that the promises made about #brexit by the #leave campaign were  pie in the sky  and were not going to be met  watch this 2 minute video of his compelling case for a #peoplesvote  facebook link  
with #brexit we ll get our idependence back   our economy will boom  trouble with the #remoaners is that they only like democracy when the vote goes their way there won t be 2nd #eurefbut if there was the #leave majority would be huge us brits don t like being told what to do
#standup4brexit supporter @cgreenuk on the #cpc2018 #chuckchequers cruise this evening chris spoke about #brexit and those who voted leave did so to regain control of our democracy from unelected bureaucrats #chequers #cpc18
#standup4brexit supporter @rossthomson mp on the #cpc2018 #chuckchequers cruise this evening ross spoke about #brexit being the opportunity for national self renewal and self determination #chequers #cpc18
great interview by @kayburley on @skynews earlier with #standup4brexit supporter @stevebakerhw at #cpc2018steve points out that #chequers is not in the national interest  there is insufficient mp support    it does not enable our own international trade policy#brexit #cpc18
 @borisjohnson speaking earlier today at #cpc2018 #chequers  is a constitutional outrage  instead of reasserting our ability to make our laws  the uk will effectively be paraded in mannacles #standup4brexit #brexit #cpc18

 @daviddavismp talking at #cpc2018  the commission will not accept #chequers as it is  they will either reject it or they ll load on more conditions  if they load on more conditions  the house of commons won t accept it  #standup4brexit #brexit #cpc18
look who we bumped into at #cpc2018 thank you to #standup4brexit supporter @patel4witham who had this short message for you all “we need to #chuckchequers because #chequers will not give us the independence freedom that the british public voted for ”#cpc18 #brexit 
bill cash mp has pledged at #cpc2018 to #standup4brexit   reject #chequers he points out that in his 33 years that he has been on the european scrutiny committee  “not once has a decision that has been made by the eu ever been overturned in parliament ”#brexit #cpc18
we bumped into #standup4brexit supporter @peterboneuk at #cpc2018 and he gave us a short message “it’s a really important message of this #cpc18 that #chequers is dead   has been rejected by the #eu    we need to move towards a comprehensive free trade agreement ”#brexit 
brilliant to hear dcms secretary of state jeremy wright  who voted remain  defending brexit and calling on everyone to accept the result  soubry  wollaston and lee could learn something here  #brexit #standup4brexit #cpc18
the #eu   #remainers like #theresamay are colluding to stop a #realbrexit from happening  they don’t want the #uk to #leave   are using a deal to trap us under eu control so we are not really a #free nation  we must stop them for overturning #brexit  we must have a clean break 
 she s surrendering £39bn  the political declaration is full of airy fairy notions without any solid guarantees    @isaby is spot on  #theresamay is handing over massive sums of our cash in exchange for empty rhetoric   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #brexit

no one voted to be poorer   if con mps vote for pms #brexit deal they’ll be doing it for them  govt set to publish yet more evidence that which ever way you cut it #brexit will make us all poorer   well apart from the well heeled #leave leaders
remember what the #leaveeu campaign promised about #brexit  
thoughtful  considered   logical from @normanlamb representing a heavily #leave voting constituency he’s well placed to conclude may’s #brexit deal won’t heal the nation he’s voting against the deal   backing a #peoplesvote #finalsay
the pm and her #brexit deal in today s sun cartoon this weakening of the uk position must not be allowed to pass #ditchthedeal #standup4brexit #voteitdown
correct we want @theresa may to stand aside  so that we can appoint a leader of the conservative party who will honour the conservative party manifesto promise to #leave the eu  sm   cu  every current tory mp stood for the hoc on in the 2017ge we must deliver #brexit promise

brexiter elite looking like the establishment figures they are i hope those voters who thought voting #leave in the #brexit referendum was sticking one up to the establishment  take a long hard look at this it s why we need #peoplesvote #finalsay to #exitfrombrexit   #remain
we were the ones out there leafleting and knocking on doors in the pouring rain  this was not the #brexit we voted for pleased to have signed this open letter to the @telegraph alongside 18 other #leave groups asking mps to vote this horrendous  deal  down

the best deal with the eu is the deal we currently have  and the govt has failed to deliver the promised “deal”  the negotiations are about the wdrawal agreement we are set to #leave with no future trade deal in place  no one voted for a blindfold #brexit @peoplesvote uk
ni backstop in withdrawal agreement should mean at least 51 mps representing #standup4brexit vote against may’s treachery to put uk into eu’s negotiating trap  it should also mean that #brexit cabinet ministers resign  how many times has it been made clear about this f’in issue

even before yesterday’s news about the investigation into #voteleave   the @lsepoliticsblog concluded that fraud in the referendum means #brexit is voidable and article 50 can be revoked

varadkar gives the game away  the eu hopes to bounce the uk into revoking or extending art 50 by insisting on this unacceptable backstop  time to step up no deal preparations and call the bluff  #brexit #standup4brexit #theresamay
i remember those signs  i lived with them as a child  as a little boy i knew they meant me  thus begins societal abuse  deny it they might but during the referendum i recognised it from farage  boris johnson   their co liars  sad  pathetic but no surprise #brexit #leave #remain

#jacobreesmogg  the whole handling of this is incompetent   the negotiations have been incompetent  the parliamentary handling incompetent  the press briefings incompetent   i said a fortnight ago i thought she should go and this proves the point   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #brexit 
i am not convinced the political class is fully aware of the gravity of its position on #brexit 17 4 million people   65  of constituencies voted #leave  it only takes 13m to win a ge mps who overturn the decision will pay the price at the ballot box #kamikazeparliament
i’m the only one who wants to stick with what was voted for  people voted for #brexit  and it should be delivered  will politicians do what they promised  or will they run away from their promises  #jacobreesmogg   #standup4brexit #maymustgo #chuckmay

17 4 million people voted #leave  so if #labour blocks #brexit we will be wiped out and the tories will remain in power indefinitely @uklabour is starting to rebuild trust with the public after iraq  it simply cannot afford to break trust a second time #generalelectionnow
of course arron banks’ firm has  no address   who expected otherwise source of finance of #leave campaign as transparent as may’s #brexit deal is in interests of uk case for #peoplesvote #finalsay an #exitfrombrexit   #remain is becoming unchallengeable 
in other words they can’t afford no deal or want u k  to be free from eu so get rid of traitor may   get decent supercanada at very least with decent #brexit pm  eg @borisjohnson @dominicraab etc  #standup4brexit #managednodeal
 1 2  which #brexit deal did you vote for julia  the answer is none as no concrete plan was even published nevermind put to any vote  this greatly helped to achieve the narrow #leave win as lack of specifics meant brexit could be sold as all things to all people  #brexitshambles

former #labour minister @frankfieldteam is clear that if the withdrawal agreement goes through then the #eu can use the #backstop to demand any ransom to gain our exit   #standup4brexit @dcbmep #labourparty #brexit #leavemeansleave @andreajenkyns

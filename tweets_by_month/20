The #Brexit campaign was a tragedy for evidence-based reasoning, truth-telling and knowledgeable civic engagement. 
To throw that away by going ahead with #Brexit is the worst decision ever, and one which Labour should challenge fiercely, not support.
There is no #Brexit arrogance - it was the democratic vote of the majority - but their is a profound arrogance being exhibited by #Remoaners
Brexit is of course putting our country before 27 others - clearly #selfserving #Brexit
This is why its mental to have voted #Brexit. A 10hr delay & the euro contingent have finally had enough & formed a human massage chain

Good news. I met TD in Toronto y'day to discuss this expansion in Dublin. Proof there can be upsides to #Brexit for Ireland 
Quarter of #Leave voters believe they were duped into voting #Brexit by lies. 7% would now vote remain.
Unfortunately there is not one political party, not even the @LibDems, seriously exposing the democratic failings of the #Brexit process.
The two leaders pledge to work together to stop a #Brexit power grab by the Tories.
We still need to inform some #Remain supporters of the degree to which #Brexit is deeply flawed as a democratic process.
Andrea Leadsom tweets an article criticising key planks of the Government's #Brexit strategy 
This has to be one of the most disgusting attempts at #Brexit scaremongering I've seen yet.

Do the expat! #brexit billionaires actually want to crash economy so they can use offshore billions 2 snap up national assets 4 peanuts
But it hasn't. 84% voted for #Brexit manifestos in genelxn. Repeat after me, Remainers: "Corbyn is a eurosceptic..." 
Very serious. #Brexit impact on Scotland who voted 62% remain. A democratic deficit consequence of being in UK. 
Congrats to @J_amesp and his important book on Putin's Alternative War via #Brexit and #Trump

Agree with @SteveRichards14. #Labour should pull out of #Brexit. #EU27 is eating UK's lunch . #LabourOutOfBrexit
Nobody said that voting for #Brexit would lead to #BigBen being silenced! Why were we not warned!
Remember the predicted #Brexit "domino effect"? It didn't happen! But we still must reform the EU together!

Absolutely; shameful lack of due diligence & scrutiny. Won't forgive Corbyn 4 his failure to stand up for the 63% who did not vote 4 #Brexit 
What metaphor. Britain is shutting down until it understands #Brexit was utter bollocks. 
It's true - I do have a binder of all the official #Brexit documents. It's my pride and joy. 
It's important we immediately restrict our information sharing with the EU, massively weakens our position#Brexit 
Dear Stuart Andrew MP @StuartAndrewNow it's clear voters were misled over #Brexit, please would you vote against Sept EU Withdrawal Bill?

At the @UKLabour party conference we need to expose the madness of #Brexit and commit ourselves to a European and internationalist future.
My old friend Minford has a record of being right: a hard #Brexit will boost UK economy.

Good point. Would you care to answer the question @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer @Labour4EU How will our lives be better? #Brexit 
The Tories once had a reputation for managing the economy. And yet they threaten the UK with #Brexit to keep their right wingers happy.
The UK is the supplicant .It is the UK who has decided to leave. Not vice versa.  EU has the cards: requests are being made of IT. #Brexit 
Being saying similar since June 2106 #Brexit will destroy the UK & Scotland will be independent soon! 
If - before UK voted #Brexit - another EU country’d proposed an expensive replication of what EU already had, UK would have screamed WASTE! 
On the day the BBC publishes claims that a hard #Brexit "offers £135bn boost to economy", it's worth remembering @philippullman's words.
Minford's claims that Britain will gain from #Brexit has already been debunked #StopBrexit #Remain #Brexit
What exactly does #GreatBritain want from #brexit, let alone how will it get there?

Farage & the #Leave campaigns' transatlantic links with Trump, Mercer, Bannon and Cambridge Analytica - diagram by @carolecadwalla#Brexit 
#Brexit was just the tip of the uncertainty iceberg. Companies must prepare for the uncertainty of ABCD environments 
@Telegraph why do you continue editorial line-#UK history in Ireland. #Ireland will not leave #EU just to make you feel better about #Brexit
I think the effect on the island of Ireland is the biggest disgrace of #Brexit, even though I weep too for England, Scotland & Wales 
The so-called left-wing argument for #Brexit doesn't stand up: 
I, for one, will never forget that the people of our country, by a convincing majority, voted in a democratic poll to leave the EU. #Brexit
More #Brexit fallout. Brits chop their nuts off. Prefer to get Whip'd. Nation of geldings, castratos, ponces, and @piersmorgan 
2) and OK, so what, apparently this is normal behaviour for politics.Only, in the meantime, the Gov. are making a hash of #Brexit
Govt confirms FOM will continue in all but name after #Brexit, with no visa's or entry requirements for EU citizens.
Handy graphic to illustrate the immigration nonsense spouted by #Brexit supporters...UK Govts to blame not EU! Hands of my right to FOM!

We need a full-blooded assault on the bogus democratic legitimacy of the #Brexit mandate. For example reference to this: 
This is the kind of thing we need from @vincecable and the @LibDems, not wibble about preventing a hard #Brexit. 
.@vincecable says "unravelling" politics and "sheer practical difficulties" means #Brexit may not happen.
I was happy to set out for @NaomiOhReally our experience @IrelandEmbGB of the increased demand for Irish passorts caused by #brexit. 
So let me get this straight. "Control of our borders" means, between the UK & the EU, not having one. Clever.#Brexit: Now almost #Remain
We need to cease the"unstoppable" & "Will Of The People tropes. It's crap.  UK can call a halt...the EU27 can agree, and that's it#Brexit 
Best take #Alevels2017 #Brexit 
Isn't this the understatement of the decade? Senior Brexiters now saying (anonymously,of course) it'll take 20-30yrs to recover from #Brexit 
So 'control' means after #Brexit anyone from the EU can come here but we want fewer of them to work and pay taxes 
One of the finest #Brexit commentators around, @fotoole, on the UK’s border proposals for Ireland: "absurd". 
3rd highest #Leave area- has only 3% #immigrant population. Our "leaders" need to nail #Brexit. It's hurting the UK

Before I leave @IrelandEmbGB next week, here is a reprise of one of my #brexit blogs from earlier this year. 
Interesting new CFO survey from @Reuters - #Brexit hasn't affected strategic plans of most businesses #despiteBrexit 
NEW REPORT: A deal on customs is important to reducing post #Brexit trade friction, but that is only half the story 
We are still in the EU and, as @Jacob_Rees_Mogg should know, unemployment is a lagging indicator. #Brexit #StopBrexit
Corbyn isn't with Tories on #Brexit at all. He gave 123 appearances to Remain, but he's a democrat. He will fight for workers 24/7 now! Q
The British people are being conned by @theresa_may on #Brexit just like Cameron tried to Con us over the negotiations & Osborne on economy 
Theresa May is terrified about the symbolism of Big Ben falling silent as we move into the #Brexit period. 
If this is true, it is a massive step in the right direction and EU will reciprocate. But what is point of #Brexit?! 
Or: Britain is begging the EU to save Ireland from the hard border that is a consequence of British #Brexit (there, I fixed your headline) 
The world looks at the US in disbelief at choosing Trump. The world looks at the UK in disbelief at choosing #Brexit
#Brexit:UK to Scotland: "You're coming out whether you like it or not."UK to Ireland: "It's all fine, don't worry... OH LOOK A SQUIRREL!"
Following the #jameschapman incident its high time for a root & branch inspection of all those working on #Brexit on behalf of UK government

"The UK wants to continue its current customs arrangements with the EU for several years after #Brexit"-@FTApparently this story is true. 
This really needs explaining: why does Corbyn ally himself on #Brexit with the Tories, Farage, Trump and the far right? Doesn't make sense.
UK government suggests 'temporary customs union' with EU after #Brexit 
Americans are asked where North Korea is. The results are both funny and shocking#korea #brexit #pmht

#Brexit is looking bad for us in every single sense. @theresa_may must wake-up before it is too late and grant the public a final say on the deal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit.
I suspect this won’t be the last of these civil service leaks. They’ve been stretched to the limit with the @theresa_may net migration targets & #Brexit. Being blamed for #Windrush & the treatment of Olly Robbins probably the last straw
Ending #Austerity is not compatible with #BrexitThe sooner #Corbyn realises this the better.#StopBrexit
"You paddies". The mask slips... #brexit 
#AmberRudd has done the right thing in resigning after misleading parliament; but what of all the other ministers in this government who have misled parliament, sometimes repeatedly, over #Brexit & other issues? When will they go? 
Dear .@AmberRuddHRI realise you're hurting. After all, you've been bullied by your own party + the press & hung out to dry by a PM you sheilded & whose back you covered when you stepped into a TVdebate 2 days after your dad died.Want to atone for #Windrush? Vote against #Brexit
 Any final UK-EU withdrawal agreement will need to win the approval of the European Parliament according to Article 50. If it doesn't, there will be no deal.Watch our video to find out more about the European Parliament's role in the #Brexit negotiations. #Article50
Has #Brexit produced more crazy views? Or were they always there just waiting to find the issue & moment? 
'Brexodus' postponed and London city stations getting quiet. Reuters tracks #Brexit  via @ReutersTV Read the report from @AndyMacaskill 
#Rudd resignation is great news for #Brexiteers - Rudd is a committed #Remainer & clearly a big support to #May also a Remainer in our #Brexit negotiations
Rudd, May et al knew all along about #windrush and the possible consequences. They went along knowingly against people who contributed so much to the UK. What a shame! And what can #EU people expect if that is the way #windrush generation is being treated? #brexit
How's that going Mrs May? #AmberRudd #Brexit 
The #brexit government is now #Rudd erless
Anyone thinking that #TheresaMay going will trigger a GE is deluded There's no way the #Tories would risk calling another election after what happened last time, plus they want to ensure #Brexit happens and on their terms So the #MayMustGo crowd should think again
A very important few days 2 go until the people of West Tír Eoghain can elect @OrfhlaithBegley as their next MP; a new & dynamic voice 2 join a winning All-Ireland Team standing for prosperity, progress & unity & against unwanted disaster of #Brexit impacting our economy & rights 
Now that Rudd has gone, she can vote against #Brexit as she is a REMAINER. As a minister, she would have been constrained to vote for the disaster.of #Brexit. Double whammy, #May, the author of Windrush scandal now exposed.
Some of the Tory MPs who have received donations from wealthy Russians. By pushing through #Brexit and by weakening democracy with a torrent of lies the Tories and the right-wing press are helping Putin's hybrid war against democracy.#BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #VoteEU
Does UK want a radical break w/neo liberalism? Polls suggest a good number do, but also vast majority of same voted remain. #brexit is primarily an economically hard right, Uber liberalism project. Liam Fox is head of a Brexit dept for a reason... 
How many lives could this save? How many operations carried out? How much research undertaken?How many doctors employed?How many nurses trained? #brexit is beyond embarrassing and utterly contemptible. 
Still can’t get used to seeing EasyJet planes with an OE- Austrian reg. especially on internal flights. #Brexit #AvGeek

Excellent thread on the EU and #Brexit misconceptions. Hthe approach state-nation vs international organisation is the right one: 
In Ireland for a two day #brexit download. Michel Barnier already trowelling it on a bit thick with the EU family stuff... no doubt the Greeks feel that warm glow; and Mr Macron as he does his Eurozone reboot. Nord Stream II anyone?

Does Defra want Food Security or a Green #Brexit ? Here’s why it could be difficult for farmers to deliver both... 
This could be the most chaotic week yet for government infighting over #Brexit One thing for sure, the national interest and concerns of business and individuals will once again be ignored as Tory infighting takes precedence. 
Please only vote for anti-#Brexit parties in the upcoming council elections! 
A huge relief to the country - the woman was incompetent and a denier of democracy #Brexit 
Monday’s Express urges Mrs May to stand firm against EU bullies on #Brexit. They would rather push Britain into full scale economic depression, bankrupt huge no of companies and dump millions on to the dole, than give up on their ludicrous utopia of ‘Global Britain’. 
Merkel, May and Macron talking about reviving TTIP.I am confused.Has #Brexit been called off?Well, that’s good news.
Let that sink in. Our socialist party, @UKLabour , is allowing its leadership to see financial hardship inflicted upon the least well off in our society. Unless we stop this #Brexit madness, we will never be forgiven. And rightly so too. 
Boris Johnson's brother on @channel4news refusing to show any sympathy or understanding of the #windrush citizens' harrowing plight.Post #Brexit: there will be 3 million #EU citizens also scrambling for their #humanrights But what do they care? #ToriesMustGo #fbpe #Racism

David Davis, 2016: “There will be no downside to #Brexit, only a considerable upside”2018: 
The final days of campaigning before the #LocalElections are here. Let's send Labour and the Tories a message on #Brexit #WindrushGeneration policies are not acceptable
If #TheresaMay is replaced as Tory leader and thus PM, all that does is make an extreme #Brexit far more likely because it will either be an ideologue like Rees-Mogg or a self-serving fraud like #BorisJohnson replacing her - neither of which will put the country first
I agree."Jobs first #Brexit"Just like"Better #Brexit for Young People"Is a sick joke.#Stopbrexit
If there are any of you our there who are losing hope over #Brexit the please do watch this presentation by Gina Miller.@thatginamiller is amazing & her speech is truly inspiring. In fact everyone should watch this.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #ABTV #LE2018 #FBPE #FinalSayForAll
#Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: Remaining in customs union must be on EU’s terms & means UK will not have independent trade policy; also UK should expect an EU trade agreement like Japan, Canada (very limited unfettered access for financial services) 
Amber Rudd is gone?!!! Thank goodness now the #Windrush #NHS and #Brexit scandals are over and Britain can get back to normal. Wonder if there were explosions like at the end of a American action film

In case you haven't yet decided who to vote for in the local elections on Thursday, #Labour front bench don't want to give us a final say on the #Brexit deal. That should help you make up your mind. #ABTV #PeoplesVote #LibDems #Greens
#PeoplesVote is democracy#Brexit is dictatorship
Totally nonsensical stance from our ‘Remoaning’ Politicians. Taking away UK’s negotiating option of ‘No Deal’. Effectively means we’d have to accept any deal. #abolishthelords #Brexit
Tories don't need a single vote never mind seat in Scotland to govern us set our budget & foist their awful policies on us. ie #Brexit #Austerity #Trident #RapeClause #Syria etc etc Now they want to strip powers from our parliament.. #OanYerBikeMrsMay #WeDemandDemocracy 5th May
The emperor is stark naked and no amount of lizard tongued lies are going to make us pretend to see the shabby, threadbare underpants of Tory #Brexit spin. It's all relative, see and on mainland EU they're strutting fine garments in an array of sumptuous colours, top to toe.
There are three candidates in my ward this Thursday. Two from #Brexit supporting Parties plus a Lib Dem. So that's quite an easy choice. Lib Dem it is then @vincecable @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn @DanJarvisMP. #NotASingleVoteForABrexitParty #stopbrexit #FBPE
The idea that Theresa May's government can implement #brexit is laughable. It would take even the most competent of administrations decades.But one of the most incompetent? No chance.That's why many people now think Brexit may happen in name, but definitely not in substance.
Great piece by Ruth Wishart and a very salient point or two about not hanging about when things look like they are about to become irretrievably bad. #PowerGrab #Brexit #Selfdetermination 
This is the thing.. May has not only got away with her part in the Windrush scandal, but she can now replace Rudd with a Brexiteer! #Brexit 
Laziness, envy and fear: the handmaidens of Brexit.Fearful people want swift, simple solutions — and woe betide any pointy-headed intellectual who gets in the way with pleas for calm or evidence#StopBrexit #VoteEU.#Brexit #ABTV

EU style 'democracy' is Supreme!Brussels "motivate" naughty Poland & Hungary for falling short of EU 'democratic values'"The proposal will include temporary freezing of funds in order to motivate a change of behaviour among [Eastern #EU] states"#Brexit
Anger over customs 'partnership' where UK is EU's tax collector, unable to make Free Trade deals & ties Britain to #EU rules.“If [May] does not listen to Brexiteers on Wednesday & goes with these ridiculous proposals then there will be trouble.”#Brexit
Let’s be clear, there’s a majority of @UKLabour members and voters who *do not back any part of #Brexit*Our ‘democratic’ party is deaf to our views because they’re not Seumas Milne’s views@jeremycorbyn wants Labour Lords to abstain tomorrowI’m a Corbynite, or was, until Brexit
Bollox, why support a red #brexit instead of a blue one? Only sensible choice is #stopbrexit

Well @theresa_may, UK media have rid you of another cabinet member.They'll come for you now, they've few others left.UK media want to avoid #Brexit, they'll bring your govt down to ensure it doesn't happen, like true 'friends' of UK democracy.
#ReesMogg for Home Secretary? Maybe not yet but surely a place in the cabinet now! And a #Brexit supporter for Home Secretary!
#AmberRudd The RESIGNATION OF INCOMPETENT RUDD could now signal a chain of shock political events, but POSITIVE ones for brexiteers.Theresa May is now exposed. Highly vulnerable.If the Tory brexiteers want RID, now is the time to launch a leadership challenge.#Brexit

@Nigel_Farage   *please* can you RT this.Fishing petition deadline is 3RD MAY.Whatever people think about #brexit, these are the UK's fish to take back, not the government's to give away.34,000 signatures still needed. URGENT.
The weasel mayor of London #SadiqKhan says it's right to 'Give preferential rights to EU citizens after Brexit'! No it's most certainly not, that was one of the points of #Brexit, we choose who comes in not Politicians. 
Personally, I think racism is a accusational tool used by government to beat the public with. Most of us respect other races, what we resent is having no control over successive government's immigration policy ...#Brexit #Brexiteers #LeaveEU
Had Amber Rudd been a Brexiteer she would have been sacked on Friday ... I think the sooner Rudd & Hammond step away from the cabinet the better. They seem to be courting chaos in an attempt to bring down the government and by extension #Brexit.
The EU has been taking advantage of the UK too for the past 45 years but no more. We want control of our own country back & if that means no deal, then its no deal. #EnoughIsEnough #Brexit
There should be no majority in the House of Commons for leaving the EU without robust data to show the country can be socially and economically better off after #Brexit.As an MP you have a responsibility to safeguard the national interest.
Not a single vote for any of the pro-#Brexit parties. We need 16 million #Remainers to go out and #vote. Make Thursday 3/5/18 a blue and yellow day... #Vote for #Remain parties! - #StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON #ABTV #LE2018 #The3MillionVote #Resist #Hope

Great to be interviewed by @BuzzFeedUK @BuzzFeedUKPol @HannahAlOthman on how #BAME Voters are leaving the @Conservatives & how the lurch to the right & #Brexit has been a factor in this.
The United Kingdom has chosen to #Brexit this is an amazing year for progressive business across the Country as @Jefferson_MFG @ZenootUK & @RedHotSquirrel @tradegovuk are highlighting do follow them for all the UKs Progression. 
Lords vote tomorrow on Lib Dem amendment to the EU withdrawal bill which if carried would allow a public vote on the final #Brexit deal. Not surprised you’re confused since @BBCNews reports so little on this life-changing catastrophe.
This would be a dismal reply to the #Brexit vote and would give way to a new UKIP-style partyA big reason why Britain voted for Brexit, and why Cameron's "renegotiation" failed, is because a majority of voters want meaningful reform of immigration

This is shocking situation, and we should be grateful to @Andrew_Adonis for raising it. Ofcom's leadership is tainted by open bias on #Brexit. This discredits the organization and makes its oversight of the #BBC a joke.

This is crossing NI/ROI border. Invisible. It symbolises the success of the journey we've all been on. No fortifications, no checkpoints.  Anything less than this will reverse one of the most obvious gains of peace, prosperity, reconciliation and co-operation #Brexit #OurFuture
Tomorrow’s vote could pave way for a #peoplesvote on the #Brexit deal, stop us crashing out if there’s no deal and prevent May dragging her heels.
1/ Billionaire Trump donor, owner of Palantir, Peter Thiel has openly said he considers democracy to be incompatible with the kind of capitalism he and many on the Trump-#Brexit Right want. One wonders how many of the others believe the same #StopBrexit
What does #Brexit say to future politicians?  Keep your head down, disregard any interest for your country, obey the whip and you'll have a long and happy career with a gold-plated pension at the end.Kick out all of the Brexit slackers at the next UK GE to avoid that precedent.
Both Houses of Parliament will continue to look under the skin of Brexit. Recent votes in both Commons & Lords on #CustomsUnion demonstrate there is no majority for a hard walk-away #Brexit because it would be so damaging.
Writing in today’s Sunday Independent, the EU’s Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier lays out the #Brexit scenario in crystal clear terms - it’s time for London to get real. Dublin must also remain firm in the national interest! #SpecialStatus
Not just the civil service & House of Lords. Uncomfortable truths on #Brexit also being set out in the analysis from Select Committees incl @CommonsBEIS @CommonsHealth @CommonsNIAC These are essential to understanding that ‘no deal’ would have very serious adverse consequences
EU Blocks Free TradePresident Trump:"When we take on China or the EU, which has tremendous blocks, it's very hard for us to sell stuff into the EU.[#EU tariffs] put there to take advantage of United States, OK.Not anymore.Those days are over!"#Brexit
I oppose #Brexit but if #Brexiteers & David Davis really want Olly Robbins fired that is is bad news for everyone. Sacking him because he is telling the truth about the Customs Union is madness & would confirm to #EU27 the impossibility of any rational conclusion to negotiations.
Kemi Badenoch MP - "The US and Canada, with all the trade they have, do not have a customs union. Neither do Australia and New Zealand. These are countries that co-operate closely."There is no reason for the UK to be in a customs union." #Brexit 
"Britain's members of parliament are mostly opposed to #Brexit, yet can't bring themselves to do their jobs and act on that conviction. The country and its legislators are therefore left squabbling over the choice between a bad result and a terrible one."

If the UK stays in a Customs Union, the #Brexit Right won't rest. They and the tax-dodging Brexit billionaire press will rage on and on about vassal status. A soft Brexit is bound to be unstable because the UK will be a rule-taker. It's far better to stay in the EU.#StopBrexit
I am more worried by the political than the economic consequences of #Brexit. If Brexit happens it will demonstrate that a wealthy and powerful elite can use the politics of lies, fear, hate, scapegoating & nationalist hysteria to manipulate British politics.#StopBrexit #VoteEU

I voted for a Common Market not a EU Superstate. Numerous EU treaties have been forced upon us without a vote. The EU is anti democracy, people holding power cannot be removed via the Ballot Box. Time for #brexit
So sad when I feel unable to vote Labour whilst Corbyn, McDonnell, Abbott, Momentum etc are in charge of the party. Corbyn has claimed every vote for Labour is an endorsement of him personally. No thanks. Labour should never be supporting the Tory Party created #Brexit. Shameful. 
Did you notice ANY of the two main parties supporting #EU citizens in the Referendum? ANY of them praising us? Any condemning the abuse we get in the press? ANY of them saying how important we are? So don't *reward* them for their stance on #Brexit with your vote #ABTV #WATON

‘The view in Dublin is that six months after the backstop idea....first emerged, London has not yet left the starting gate.’ More 1st rate #brexit analysis from RTE’s man in Brussels. Tellingly based on first hand sources written straight and avoiding political theatre. 
This is an absolutely superb analysis of #Brexit by Prof. Chris Grey “The tragedy of Brexit: When simple ideas meet complex realities.” via @PoliticsMeans

An irony of #Brexit is that the Leavers most concerned by sovereignty are backing a wealthy right-wing elite who want to strip the state of many of its powers and hand them to large companies & a global super-rich elite who care nothing for the British people.#StopBrexit
The representative for the 17.4 Million enters the House of Lords #Brexit 
We need some #Brexit reality. The hard Brexiters are continually absent, lacking courage and are refusing to be held accountable. @theresa_may must change her stance before it is too late and grant the public a vote on the deal with a chance to #ExitFromBrexit.
I’d like to ask every #Remoaner this question. #LeaveEU #Brexit 
The bottom line is that Leave never intended to win. It was all just a lark.If only the likes of Johnson, Gove, Stuart et all would simply admit that, we could bin #Brexit tomorrow.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#FaceDownTheFruitcakes#PeoplesVote
Parliament must remember that we knew what we were voting 4 when we voted to leave the EU - it meant leaving the ECJ, single market and customs union and controlling borders. Anything less is a blatant betrayal #Brexit
Kate Hoey MP - "There are a lot of people here today who I am afraid are using the issue of the customs union as a way of being able to start the process again of trying to stay in the EU. They won’t achieve that." #Brexit 
Now this is strange:"Dutch delay spending on new port facilities at Rotterdam amid hope of British U-turn on customs union".But in UK, #Brexit leaders remain completely oblivious to any required changes to UK ports if UK leaves the Customs Union.
#Brexit is bad for the #NHS. No. of nurses coming to work from the EU has plunged by 89% while the number leaving the NHS has risen by 67%. 20% of EU doctors are considering leaving due to #Brexit. 
#Galileo satellites illuminate EU-UK divorce tensions and how #British industry is likely to lose out if we go ahead with #Brexit
In the #CustomsUnion debate we heard voices from both sides of the House, explaining what a terrible act of self-harm #Brexit is.On May 3rd, we can send a strong signal to the powers that be, Govt & Opposition alike: we want to #StopBrexit!#ABTV Vote only for pro-#EU parties.
Over 40 years of #EU progress into the dustbin. Please RT our guest article today by Gerald Stubbs: ‘We’re throwing away our EU benefits’ Link:  Because #Brexit is so unnecessary. 
But I guess #Brexit is about "feelings" not "facts" and facts don't matter anymore.
Post-#Brexit trade isn’t looking good. Without the EU’s clout behind us, we risk being bullied. America is clear any deal with us would be on its terms – including forcing us to take chlorine-washed chicken. Australia wants us to import hormone-treated beef.
I believe the Tory Brextremists are the willing tools of a transatlantic kleptocratic elite which is seeking to use lies, fear, hate, nationalism and xenophobia to turn the UK and the US into ultra-free market versions of Putin's 'managed democracy'.#StopBrexit #VoteEU#Brexit
David Jones MP - "What we are seeing at the moment is the last ditch attempt on the part of the Remainers to ensure that we do not leave the European Union." #Brexit  
#TomasBaert one of the #EU’s chief #Brexit negotiators just passed by. Steve of course filled him in on the fact that #Brexit is not the actual #WillOfThePeople #StopBrexitSaveBritain #SODEMaction #Parliament #PeoplesVote
This is a thread worth reading : a damning external perspective on Britain’s internal  #brexit dynamics ... 
Time for them to grow some...we need the Truth the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth...long overdue..#Brexit can't be made to work in the National Interest nor that of UK citizens..Rights will be lost too..Binding #FinalSayforALL with the option to #StopBrexitSaveBritain
High street bloodbath as Carpetright, Poundworld and Fenwick’s axing jobs due to weak consumer confidence and slowing housing market impacted by #Brexit. This trend likely to accelerate as full impact of Brexit becomes clearer #FBPE
Oh dear... but never mind, with all of these countries falling over themselves to sign trade deals with the UK after #Brexit, I'm sure things will look up for the UK soon 
#Brexit stalwart #KateHoey #MP hits out at arch #Remoaner #KenClarke and others for "using the issue of the #CustomsUnion as a way of being able to start the process again of trying to stay in the #EU".   #BBC #SKY @LBC @ConHome #ConservativeParty
That's why folks who voted #Brexit are impatient. I don't blame them! #TakeBackControl implies an instant outcome.Nobody laid out what REALLY has to happen, how long it will take; the  possible scenarios. Latest: EU says that UK banks will be treated like US banks.Not good!
A lot of ppl voted #Brexit as a big "FU" to a lot of things-personal/ political. That's how #Leave ran the campaign...just put all your stuff in the #TakeBackControl basket & vote "out". It's not calling folks "stupid" to say this."Leave" used  political analytics. So did Trump.
LAUNCHED: March for a #PeoplesVote on June 23 to demand that the people have a say on the final #Brexit deal - JOIN US!Please RT.  @peoplesvote_uk
"Britain’s economy slowed to a virtual standstill in the first three months of 2018, the weakest period of activity in more than five years." And #Brexit hasn't even happened yet.
Dear Leavers and @Conservatives, thank you for making what was never Project Fear, Project Reality. UK economic growth collapses to six-year low  #brexit
-We need more doctors.-Just train them.-Takes 10 years. We need them now.-So what?-Can we recruit them from the EU?-Tricky. You know, Brexit and all.-What about India?-OK.-Great. Can you give them visas?-No. Why?#hostileenvironment #dropthetarget #Brexit #NHSlove #FBPE
Well done Brexiteers. Your stupid #Brexit hasn't even happened yet and already the UK is on course for a recession by the end of the year.
I'm with the blue & yellows! #ABTV #ABTV2018 #Stopbrexit #WATON #FBPE Don't vote for a brexit supporting party in the hope they will #stopbrexit - there is no logic in that at all.There is no social programme they can afford if #brexit happens! 
Finally, we can all agree House of Lords makes no sense!Designing 2nd legislative chamber from scratch, it is unlikely you would come up with current system -handful of bishops, hundred or so hereditary peers & over 660 appointed life peers.#Brexit #EU
George Osborne's Project Fear may have been the product of utterly incompetent and useless economists who were carried away by their own tosh:  #Brexit
On June 23rd thousands of people will be marching to Parliament to demand that the final decision on #Brexit is in the hands of people, not the politicians. Take action today and join us to march for a #peoplesvotePlease RT!
Our tiny business has slowed significantly since #brexit. We've almost ground to a halt. It's a disaster.
Whoa. Worst growth figure for 6 years - just 0.1% - as looming #Brexit effect puts brakes on Britain. (Output already down 1.5% since May 2016 predictions so we’re already £30bn worse off since referendum...)Still time to change course #CustomsUnion #SingleMarket #PeoplesVote
For all those who've rightly you can't gauge the economic impact of #Brexit yet b/c we havent left/entered into new arrangements yet, please remember that today. Pretty hard to simply pin GDP figures out on #Brexit for the exact same reason
#Brexit means losing control in the long term. The gvt, has already proposed that we will become a rule-taker in areas like fighting crime and competition policy. It is likely to agree to become a rule-taker in other areas as the talks proceed. 
If you were wondering what an Irish EU Commissioner might currently think of #Brexit negotiations: "Britain is stuck in a self-imposed contradiction on Brexit and it is trying to invent "a new type of border" that is unworkable" 
EU nurses leaving in record numbers and now this government refuses visas for 100 Indian doctors. #Brexit was never about opening up to the world, it's a retreat from it. To protect the #NHS - Labour has to stand against Brexit.
The fact that the EU still exists and sticks to its foundational principles despite #brexit is for some Brexiteers an act of bullying. 
After Nicola Sturgeon fails to turn up to a #Brexit breakfast meeeting at Bute House...staff discover her in the basement 
The bigger story here is that the #BBC investigated & reported an unfavourable #Brexit story. It's almost like they are journalists 
Jeremy Thorpe was at the centre of a 1970s scandal.There are several rather more current scandals involving the fat cats who promoted #Brexit.Will we need to wait 40 years before the BBC covers these?#r4today @BBCNews
It’s Friday.And #Brexit makes as much sense asTrying to boil an egg in the fridgeMowing the lawn in the snowLooking for a restaurant on Mount EverestCleaning the windows with vegetable fatWatering the plants with petrol.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote#NoFruitcakes
What kind of #Brexit do you prefer:A. EEA model: £260m per week (= 9% of what we spend on the NHS).B. FTA model: £875m per week (31%).C. WTO model: £1.250m per week (44%)D. Govt's hoped-for “bespoke” model: £615m per week (22%) E. No Brexit - it’s not worth it!
The UK has become the slowest growing member of the G7 thanks to Tory #Brexit. We were the fastest growing before the referendum. 
@BBCNews such a bland headline for a piece that shows how the #Brexit vote was illegally procuredHere’s hoping you get a bit more vociferous and start airing this stuff where it belongs - on primetime bulletins!
There's a massive event planned for June in support of a #PeoplesVote on the #FinalDeal. If you think the people should have the right to decide whether the negotiated #Brexit deal is worth having, please consider supporting this march and campaign.
Quote of the night last night from @TheSimonEvans “We need to get out there and take on a new adventure, rather than limp off with a half hearted version of the one we were already in and weren’t obviously satisfied with” #BBCqt #Brexit
Because owls are said to be wise while while #Brexit is known to be stupid. 
EU doesn't need the City of London, says chief #Brexit negotiatorMichel Barnier torpedoes Theresa May’s hopes of a gold-plated deal for UK financial servicesOops....
Here @UKIP How do you like this for 'will of the people' ?#Brexit #GFA
It looks as if the UK may spend up to £5bn on its own GPS satellite system because #Brexit has shut it out of the EU's Galileo project.  Yet another instance of wasteful duplication as a result of #Brexit stupidity.#StopBrexit #VoteEU#ABTV
Rather depressing how many people in the #BBCQT audience booed @CarolineLucas when she demanded a #peoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal.Looks like some people have had enough of #Democracy and are happy to lie back and accept what the Tories give them.
Green Party Caroline Lucas #bbcqt: “On Northern Ireland, how could we be so criminally reckless to be jeopardising the (Good Friday) Agreement putting it on the altar of an extreme #Brexit. It should not be allowed to happen.”
BFE thanks @CarolineLucas for her passionate argument for a #PeoplesVote on on tonight's #bbcqt Once again, the "specially selected" audience of the democratically confused, who could do nothing better than "Boo!" her looked as empty as a #Brexit promise. 
Most politicians - Tory and Labour - are spinelessly going along with something they know to be deeply damaging. Caroline Lucas is an exception, not afraid to face down the mob (or herd) mentality that's leading us to #Brexit catastrophe.This is not "anti-democratic".#bbcqt
Lucas said she doesn't understand why we are booing democracy when she suggested we should be forced to vote again on #brexitIsn't that what Europhiles have been doing for the last 18 months because they lost#bbcqt
.@MattHancock getting the biggest cheer of the evening on #BBCQT. He was absolutely right when he said that there would be nothing worse for the country than having another #Brexit referendum.
Caroline Lucas to people jeering at her call for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal:"I don't know why you're booing democracy."#bbcqt
How long is it going to take for some people to understand that #Brexit means leaving the #CustomsUnion, Single Market and ECJ jurisdiction? #bbcqt
So Scott Baugh and Dana Rohrabacher are running against each other (play fighting), yet as of 3/17, they both visit w/the same #Brexit friend FBI PERSON OF INTEREST, NIGEL FARAGE  #CA48
Great night engaging with local business community @BelTel business awards. Many concerned about the uncertainty posed for their business by #BREXIT. Thanks to @retail_ni @RetailExIreland for the company. Important that we all #buylocal
It's hypocritical of Jeremy Corbyn to use a slogan which says "for the many, not the few" whilst unwaveringly supporting #Brexit, a policy which will in fact "screw the many for the few". #ABTV #LE2018 #StopBrexit #WATON
By Jove, I think he's got it!Mr Barnier:“The UK has decided to withdraw from the Union.It wants to be sovereign & be able to set its own rulebook, to have its own supervision & enforcement system.In doing so, UK will move away from #EU rules."#Brexit
BREAKING: @SwanseaCouncil has passed a motion calling for a free and meaningful for on the final #Brexit deal in the @UKParliament.@theresa_may, time to start listening.
This customs union debate isn’t about the economy or Northern Ireland – it’s about weakening #Brexit, if not bouncing us back into the EU entirely. We must call it out for the con that it is. 
Listen up leftists!! Behold Progressive government on parade for all to see!  Leftist UK, flooded London with refugees and claim they are now helpless! And here’s Londons leader! Mayor Khan: ‘I Can’t Solve London Knife Crime,’ Blames Right Wingers #Brexit 
Make sure May/Corbyn can't use YOUR vote to claim a mandate for #Brexit.  We can vote again in 4 years but #Brexit is forever. If necessary, spoil your ballot! #Remain #Notinmyname
The North East Of England voted #leave (fairly heavily) but people in the region are changing their minds & becoming #Remainernow  Majority of leavers are unhappy with the way #brexit is going and are concerned it will make them poorer.#PeoplesVote ?
#Brexit Britain>>'No one flinched': Woman describes racist attack on her and 11-year-old son on crowded train<< We are appalled that this happened in Yorkshire to our good friend @Vie_Promo and her lovely son. We need to stand united against such behaviour

Why exactly is #KateHoey a #Labour MP She supports fox hunting & grammar schools, she's massively socially-conservative, she's for the hardest #Brexit possible & she's praised #TheresaMay - why doesn't she just cross the floor ffs? Vauxhall deserves better#CustomsUnion
Ireland's EU commissioner Phil Hogan takes wrecking ball to 'Global Britain' and 'wing and a prayer' #Brexit.  
Thank you everyone that voted leave. Your message is loud and clear. Thank you @theresa_may and @David_Cameron for making us feel like this. I am British by right. I paid for the privilege and I'm going nowhere. So fuck you! #Brexit
Two MEPs for Northern Ireland after #brexit? @M_AndersonSF thinks the north of Ireland should continue to be represented in the European Parliament. "We need the political will to make that happen", she says
So, nearly 2 years after the #Referendum , the Commons has come to the view that we should at least remain in a #CustomsUnion with the EU. The more they look at the detail of #Brexit , the more the claims  of Fox, Gove, Johnson, etc unravel. 
“Racism and flag waving delusion”You mean pride in one’s country and independence? #Brexit doesn’t just deserve a stamp, it deserves to be Britain’s Independence Day.But I will agree with you on one thing, owls are great. 
Delighted to be in Sofia today to see first-hand how the Sofia metro line has helped develop the city’s economy and connectivity. Shows the importance of respecting all commitments taken at 28 #Brexit   pic.twitter.com/cRdUGM4Jit
Let's understand that Rees-Mogg is not a Tory favourite. He's the favourite of a far-right axis extending via Farage and Breitbart from the Tory ERG to people who are outright fascists. #StopBrexit #VoteEU.#brexit #ABTV
#BREXIT Power Grab. With Labour in charge is wasn't even a 'grab' more like a present. 
In speech on #brexit and financial services @MichelBarnier stresses the openness of the single market to foreign investors, including through EU equivalence of third country regimes. He rejects that the EU desperately needs the City of London. 
The EU is 'deeply concerned' about Liam Fox's 'incompetent' handling of #Brexit No surprise there then. via @BIfrance
"Impact of the global financial crisis was a 2% hit to the GDP. The current PM's plan is projected to deliver a 6% hit." @AngusMacNeilSNP delivers a stark speech spelling out the realities of #Brexit and life outside the #CustomsUnion
The Gov't have been told by their own officials that leaving the #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion will make this country poorer - but they are pushing ahead in spite of that. The future 65m people is too important for 650 MPs to decide. We need a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. 
The whole #Brexit picture will change if @uklabour’s front bench change their stance on the issue. We must stay in the Single Market and Customs Union to protect the UK economy and thousands of jobs.
#Brexit has shaken the EU institutions from their slumber & there is a noticeable new energy & desire to get things done. Ireland should harness this energy to be at the of a brighter #FutureofEurope. Read more in my speech to Seanad Éireann:  
Ed Vaizey feels he's living in an Alice in Wonderland world & he's learning more & more about #brexit everyday... you can be in the EU & have a blue passport made by a British company... now you can be out of the EU & have a blue passport made by French company. #FBPE
We are putting public debate and transparency at the heart of our approach to #Brexit negotiations.Thanks to Bulgarian Parliament @ceaoef, European Movement @EMInternational @EvaMaydell, & @LilyanaPavlova @eu2018bg for excellent discussions in Sofia today.
When Leave voters are shown the cost of the various #Brexit scenarios - including the govt's hoped-for bespoke deal - they do not want *any* of them.There is no unicorn & cake scenario.We need a #PeoplesVote.(Analysis by @sjwrenlewis, via @GuitarMoog)
Very constructive and interesting meeting about #Brexit with HE Libor Secka , Ambassador of the #CzechRepublic : also pleased to tell him about #Czech turbine installed in new #Dalavich Community Hydro I opened on Sunday 
So, @GOVUK agrees a 21 month implementation period is all that's needed for dealing with all aspects of #Brexit, but need 7 years before @ScotParl can have all devolved powers. It makes no sense unless.......@Feorlean @IanBlackfordMP
Wow! Anna Soubry now saying she received a delegation from a pharma co. employing 750 staff, worried about #Brexit, but asked her not to mention their name, because they were afraid of abuse & threats from Brexiters - threats MPs have sadly become used to. #BrexitShambles
Rt Hon Kenneth Clarke MP has just confirmed that in his 48 years as an MP, and decades as a Minister in different Govts, he has never known a Govt to implement deliberately a policy which it knows will do great damage to the British people #Brexit #FBPE
Thank goodness our First Minister @NicolaSturgeon is standing up for Scotland and our Parliament against @10DowningStreet’s #Brexit power grab. Where are @scottishlabour and the @scotlibdems?
Kate Hoey live on parliament TV now. She accusses Sinn Fein of terrorism blackmail on #Brexit. She then pauses & says that the Irish Republic will suffer the most if we leave EU with no deal.Who is doing the blackmail here?
It may be a simplistic view, but I do think that MSPs are elected to the Scottish Parliament, by the people of Scotland and paid by them, to serve their interests.  Any MSP who is representing the wishes of Another Governmentshould resign immediately#brexit #ContinuityBill
Very strong arguments being made from across the parties now including Tory former Cabinet Minister Dominic Grieve in support of #CustomsUnion + opposing Government plan - not least impacts on Ireland border, manufacturing and trade @Open_Britain #Brexit
John Redwood makes a fool of himself after he intervenes on Yvette Cooper during the customs union after #brexit debate #StopBrexit #FBPE

Here's a highly accurate analysis of #FMQs via Facebook reactions  #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit 
Brexit. Ruth Davidson's strongest subject. Said no one ever. #FMQs #Brexit
After #Brexit, the UK will lose access to 759 low tariff international trade deals negotiated by the EU. 
"The Labour party that is running Wales has got one job and that is to defend Wales and the Welsh constitution. They are not fit to the be the government of Wales" @JonathanPlaid on Welsh Labour government's consenting to devolved Welsh powers  going to Westminster post #Brexit. 
Today I asked Michael Gove to rule out imposing UK-wide agricultural frameworks without consent of Holyrood or Cardiff Bay - he refused, and instead had a strange rant about independence and buses, neither of which are his strong point... #Brexit #NoPowerGrab
Brexiters claim to be patriotic, they think patriotism is one of Brexit's strongest cards. We know the opposite to be true. #Brexit harms Britain, it is the absolute opposite of patriotism. Patriotism is a very weak link in the Brexit chain, and we must break it!#StopBrexit
My parents came to UK from the Levant in '67. I was born in Epsom hospital. They gave me an "Anglo"name so I would fit in at school. UK was a "hostile environment" back then. Then we grew up as nation. Now, thanks to #Brexit, we are socially retarded again. #StopBrexit#ABTV
This account was set up in December 2017 to demonstrate that there is an awful lot of evidence that #Brexit is not the will of the people (if it ever really was) & share stories of leavers (& abstainers) who are looking at #brexitreality & changing their minds & are #remainernow
#brexit Today’s politicians pathetic all of them. No backbone all they do argue with each other everyday non stop. Theresa Maybe hopeless  Prime Minister. Jeremy Corbyn loves EU, hates EU, shake magic money tree  pays for everything. And old dinosaur Vince Cable Retire. 
Given #Brexit, an association agreement between the UK and the EU is in everyone’s mutual interest #FutureofEurope 
This is so #Brexit: if UK leaves the #EU, will not be able to take part fully in #Galileo satellite programme. Never mind, says UK, we'll build a similar satellite to support sat navs = reinventing the wheel & spending unnecessary millions. No launch system yet, mind you.
Honestly, very hard to suppress a giggle at @mikegalsworthy’s ‘Lords preserving British democracy’, but it’s the truth, and proof of the craziness of #Brexit.We’re doing our best to hold the fort as the people/MP cavalry ride to the rescue 
Nigel Farage says he will leave Britain if Brexit is a disaster.Far from being a patriot, Farage would be the first rat to flee the sinking ship, deserting the people he claims to care for. A con-man and a fraud.#StopBrexit #VoteEU#Brexit #ABTV
Good meeting with PM @BoykoBorissov in Sofia today, midway through dynamic Bulgarian Presidency @EU2018BGImportant #Brexit progress in March to secure citizens' rights. But much remains to be done to finalise withdrawal agreement. 
#Brexit is hurting our NHS. It’s much more costly, complicated & time consuming than people were told so let’s have a Public Vote on the Deal #PeoplesVote
I sense the widespread delight that Johnson says he'll resign over customs union & Rees-Mogg says he'll flee the UK if Tories abandon #Brexit It's therefore a crying shame that we've learnt that leading Brexiters don't keep their promises!
Who thought it was a good idea to appoint disgraced former Defence Secretary Liam Fox as International Trade Secretary?He was a liability in his former role & he's even more of one now.#Brexit
Thread. #Brexit is not going to deliver for the NHS as promised. Now everyone can see that, it’s time for a #PeoplesVote to give the people the #FinalSay on whether or not we go ahead with it.
As #brexit secretary @DavidDavisMP said recently “I simply listened to the facts, and as the facts changed I changed my mind!” Well the facts of #brexit have and are changing & the UK is looking at them changing its mind!#remainernow #peoplesvote
This slide (from @timeshighered #ResearchEx Summit) maps the research publication networks across Europe. For me, it shows how utterly stupid & self-destructive #Brexit will be. #BrexitShambles
That’s easy. Because owls are intelligent creatures that play an important and positive role in the British environment.#Brexit is a nostalgic, nationalistic construct of the extreme right and left that will damage our country for a generation.More easy hits please Chopper !
Wow pro #Brexit voice on #r4today saying Uk can be ‘a free spirit’ and won’t need to have checks w/EU but still ‘do deals around the world’. Magical thinking doesn’t even begin
#EU officials say @theresa_may must choose to leave Northern Ireland permanently aligned with the EU, or keep the whole of the #UK in a customs union. They think they will be able to undermine #Brexit and the UK by this fiction. The PM must take control of the story board.
If you're in London & have somehow missed me talking about #Brexit, there's another opportunity to do so at Kings on May 2, 4pm ... I'll be discussing how the UK govt turns citizens into migrants, from the Commonwealth Immigration Acts to Brexit to Windrush ... 
Disgraceful that last year, @philiphammonduk set up a £60 billion 'Brexit Resilience Fund' when there is a lack of cash for our #NHS, police, schools. The Conservatives must put national interest over internal party politics for once, #Brexit is damaging our economy.
VIDEO: “We do not believe we require any infrastructure between Northern Ireland and Ireland under any circumstances.” - the excellent head of HMRC.  Read our latest #Brexit "Letter to Remain Voters" and watch the video here: 
Fine thread. BBC is letting down the UK. Insufficient technical knowledge of #Brexit related matters coupled with inability/unwillingness to challenge influential figures putting faulty/false arguments. It’s not an argument about bias it’s one about quality. @BBCr4today @BBCNews
Half a million! Half a million businesses hurt by #Brexit When will businesses realise that if they don't speak out things can only get worse @Labour4EU @EK_EuropeanMove
So, another substantive disparity between Irish & British passport holders in N.Ireland arising from #Brexit... 
I’m Irish hence a European, I think the #Brexit outcome was on a par with an #Turkey4Xmas referendum. The UK superiority complex and small mindedness has always put it at odds with the EU. Unless there’s a massive attitude change the EU will be better off without the UK.
It appears our MPs haven't understood that we voted to leave the EU, which means leaving its core institutions: its single market, and especially customs union.Let's send them a reminder shall we?#Brexit#NoCustomsUnion
At #PMQ asked @theresa_may about EU nationals after #Brexit. If @ukhomeoffice cant handle 50,000 residents' status properly, how about 3 million registrations. Under #DataProtection Bill powers to hide mistakes by blocking access to files. #ExitFromBrexit
Apparently @Jacob_Rees_Mogg will flee the country if his nasty party don’t deliver on #Brexit. He would potentially flee using the benefits of his freedom of movement to another #EU country whilst having a hissy fit for not leaving and losing them. #ToryLogic
Tories & Labour won't listen to our words. So let's make them listen to our votes. Vote for pro-EU parties on May 3.Please spread the message as far and wide and as fast as you can.#StopBrexit #VoteEU.#Brexit #ABTV
We don't do high crime levels, Labour Controlled Councils or MP's .. We do smooth roads, clean beaches, blue waters, picturesque villages, leafy lanes, sunny days and 56.5% #Brexit  
The @Conservatives need to appreciate that #Brexit is an existential issue for them ... if you dare to fail, you might as well cash up your chips and go and do something less harmful instead. 
There are several options open if MPs don’t like #TheresaMay ‘s #Brexit deal - but some are more open than others... @InFactsOrg
Farage & many Tory Brexiters were clear that they would demand a 2nd referendum, a straight replay, not a #FinalSay, in the case of a #Remain victory. They weren't going to 'respect' the result. #StopBrexit #VoteEU#Brexit #ABTV
This is a superb article from @RCorbettMEP on the growing demand for a #peoplesvote on terms of #Brexit!It’s great that he refers to the group of #remainernow he met yesterday who “regret it & are demanding the right of people to reconsider” in support!
Cornwall voted leave 65% to 35% but now the Cornish have looked at the facts & have changed their minds on #brexit.Over 50% think UK will be worse off IF #brexit happens & double the % of leave voters are #Remainernow than the other way!#peoplesvote ?
For the first time since devolution, the Westminster Govt has succeeded in clawing back powers from Wales and it's all thanks to the Labour party in Wales. #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill
"When he sells this parliament and my country's democracy to Westminster, he can excuse my lack of conciliatory tone" Welsh Labour government left speechless as leader @LeanneWood delivers powerful and passionate reprimand at giving up of Welsh powers to Westminster post #Brexit.

#Referendum on actual #Brexit deal “possible” if MPs vote down #TheresaMay deal, #Labour’s  Brussels leader says: 
I hope that the government takes notice of the struggles of one of Britain's greatest brands and exports. Time for @theresa_may to wake up and grant the public a final say on the deal as the implications of #Brexit become clear.
A 26% drop in sales in the last quarter is a huge loss to Jaguar Land Rover and staff who have sadly paid the price at one of our top manufacturing companies with a large supply chain. The fact that JLR have partly blamed #Brexit for this slump and instability speaks volumes.
Full-on love-in between Labour, Tories and UKIP going on in Assembly over #Brexit power grab.
Summing up Welsh Labour position on #Brexit power grab: If UK Government and Welsh Government can't agree, then UK will be the 'backstop' and should have the final say.I will always be of the view that Wales should have final say on issues relating to Wales.

The Home Office procedure for the registration of EU citizens in the UK must be nearly automatic. If that's not the case, it will be a bureaucratic nightmare not only for EU citizens but also for the Home Office.#Brexit #FutureofEurope 
WOW. #Brexit is *SO* democratic. How many referenda will this illegal opinion poll attempt to overturn......for something that is completely undeliverable? #WeNeedTheGFA #CymruCapitulates #StopBrexitSaveBritain
For financial services, I am in favour of an equivalence regime that allows the EU to regulate and control UK financial products in the EU. Watch the full statement  #Brexit
"Is it government policy… not to be in the customs union, or a customs union?” @afneil “Yes” @andrealeadsom "Do you have the votes in the Commons to sustain that policy?” @afneil “We believe we do” @andrealeadsom#Brexit #bbcdp
“We still don’t know what the government’s preferred policy is on the Irish border, why not?” @afneil “Well, we do…. we will not have a hard border in N Ireland” @andrealeadsom “That is not a policy, that is an aspiration” @afneil#Brexit #bbcdp
Our hope must be to reach an agreement on the Irish border & related issues before June. To wait until October, as David Davis has hinted, seems too late. See the full statement  #Brexit 
#Brexit and political uncertainty may be causing a big swing in where innovation happens in Europe #ReutersRankings 
#brexit We’re leaving Customs Union & The Single Market. Labour, SNP, Lib Dem’s, stop crying  about both everyday. 17 million voted to leave Customs Union & The Single Market. We will be better off once we leave the failing, hopeless,  crumbling  EU !!!!!  Give it a rest FFS. 
Interestingly at @CommonsEUexit @DavidDavisMP has just told me that this is not an ultimatum there is still room for discussion on Clause 11 amendments & that he’s a great protector of devolution within the cabinet #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
Those seeking to force Theresa May to sell out on the EU Customs Union are Remainers trying to overturn the referendum result:  #Brexit
'Question marks' hang over UK government’s plan to register EU citizens after #Brexit, warn MEPs. 
Last #EUBudget debate w/ Fellow Commissioners in weekly meeting before decisive one next week 2 May. That day we will finally discuss + adopt  our formal proposal #EUBudget for the future beyond 2020, post #Brexit #FutureofEurope #TeamJunckerEU
So @DavidDavisMP calls 'Option C' on Ireland the 'reserve parachute'...but in point of fact, come October, it will be the ONLY operational legal text. That is why (and DD keeps dancing round that) the customs/divergence issue needs to be resolved. It is the #Brexit crucible.
Conversation with #Brexit voting Brit yesterday. Him: I voted #Brexit to shake things up. Me: But you export from the UK all over the EU, won't #Brexit impact your business?Him: No, the govt will cancel #Brexit at the last minute, they're just teaching the EU a lesson......
. @Feorlean : "The effect of the UK Government's latest proposals remains this: the @ScotParl' s powers could be restricted - for a period of up to 7 years - without its consent. That's not something the @scotgov could recommend the Parliament approves" #Brexit #scotland
Arriving in the City of Derry for a day of meetings on Politics, business development, #Brexit and Community cooperation - looking forward to it, Great City. 
Does everyone get this now? US billionaire Robert Mercer funded and rigged #Brexit vote (working for both Leave campaigns) en route to installing Donald Trump. On both occasions, he was aided by Putins army of hackers, spies and paid subverters, interfering in both elections.

Brexit blamed as record number of EU nurses give up on Britain | Society | The Guardian -  #bbcdp @daily_politics @theresa_may #c4news #bbcnews #skynews #c4news #BrexitShambles #VictoriaLive #wrightstuff #brexit @BBCRadio4
The evidence is all around us that #Brexit promotes hate. Is that really the kind of country we want #Britain to be? #EUMigrants – hug them, don’t hate them. Please RT @Jon_Danzig’s full report. Link: 
So it’s more important to save Labour Party by inflicting huge damage on the country and the people? Anyone believing this spin really needs to think again. #brexit is so easily undone, no laws have changed. 
Far from there being £350m week as promised by #Brexit leaders, the prospect of Brexit is deepening chronic staff shortages in our #NHS 
Why is it, the UK wants Parliament sovereignty, yet refuse to accept Scotland should have the same? The people of Scotland voted for the #SNP to lead and fight for Scotland, and you can't just ignore that like some petulant child.  #Brexit #Tory
"Take it or leave it" - Yet again, the #Tories show utter contempt for the Scottish Parliament and what they think of the Scottish people.You do not need 7 years to create UK frameworks, especially if you can supposedly arrange #Brexit in just 2. #Tory
Here’s a key graph from the report. Whereas EU nurses used to boost our NHS by many thousands each year, their leaving rates are now weighing heavy on weak UK & non-EU growth.Remember that we have ~40,000 nursing vacancies & staff strain encourages UK staff to leave. #Brexit 
The NHS needs more nurses fast. There are 40,000 vacancies.Until 2016, EU nurses in the NHS were growing fast (6-7,000 per year) and plugging gaps. Now their numbers are falling faster than UK & non-EU nurses are growing- meaning that we are treading water /declining. #Brexit 
#Brexit blamed as record number of EU #nurses give up on Britain #NHS #healthcare
Vital conclusion: Global Britain is facade to cover the decaying ruin that is #Brexit. Also useful info in thread about #CustomsUnion
We are questioning @DavidDavisMP from 9.15 this morning. Watch live here  #Brexit 
That’s what we did. We were lied to in 1970s “just a common market” and then experienced a 45year slow motion coup d’etat of British democracy and sovereignty. We were promised referenda and repeatedly denied them.#EnoughIsEnough #Brexit #FBPE
.@FT @peggyhollinger are back with another #Brexit #Galileo front page. Having spent €1.4bn helping to build one sat-nav system for Europe, the UK considers spending who knows how much more to build a national system. Things getting a bit silly now, me thinks.

Leaked EU #brexit memo says that EU protocol on the north may not be viable. This is a real concern if true.  The Taoiseach, however, tried to downplay it.  His flippant response couldn't go unchallenged.... 
Extremely disappointing that the #SNP have once again shown themselves to be more interested in forcing #indyref2 on Scotland than seeking agreement on the EU Withdrawal Bill. Nicola Sturgeon snubbed a last minute #Brexit deal that her ministers agreed.

#Brexit 1. The drive to keep us in the #CustomsUnion is stupid on several counts. Firstly there is no remaining in it. A separate accord has to be brokered. No decision can or will be made on it until we have formally left the EU. The NI situation remains the primary concern.

After #Brexit the UK economy will BOOM.All the working class will be better off.And when we scrap the EU's import tariffs,basics like food and clothing will be a lot cheaper. 
Of course we must leave the Customs Union on #Brexit & have freedom for new trade deals and tariff cuts. Supporters of CU would damage our future prosperity. 
Do my ears deceive me, or have proponents of leaving a Customs Union with EU got a new phrase out? It's a "protectionist racket" - seems to the new chorus line. Perhaps. But what we need is an evidenced-based cost-benefit analysis of leaving said 'racket'. #Brexit

Am I alone in expecting well paid @BBCr4today presenters to be equipped to challenge such blatant inaccuracies about #EU trade? Or is this too much to expect in #Brexit Britain? #FBPE
“All the justifications for #Brexit are being dismantled”   via @prospect_uk
John Redwood on @BBCr4today casual with the facts as ever. #EU doesn’t trade with rest of the world on #WTO terms it has free trade deals with many nations which benefit goods produced in UK particularly big exports like Scotch Whisky #Brexit #FBPE
"THE GREAT SINGLE MARKET CON-TRICK - How the figures don't stack up" A devastating #Brexit attack on the nonsense talked by Remoaner MPs about the Single Market: 
Interesting that parliamentary vote to stay in the customs union if #Brexit goes ahead will be "non binding." Just like the referendum was then...
Are BBC current affairs shows like #Marr giving the Tories too easy a ride? #Brexit #StopBrexit #Windrush #Brexitshambles #FBPE #ABTV #WATON #BrexitGate #FinalSay
The Lord's can (and do) ignore the democratic will of the people because they are not elected.The House of Lords have signed their own death warrant,by trying to overturn the biggest democratic vote in the history of our great country.#Brexit 
The #brexit ref was just the first stage of replacing democracy with feudalism. Post a brexit everything will be sold to private enterprise & rather than "taking back control" the people will have control over jack shit. Capitalist fundamentalists want to rule the 21st century
Ministers in @GOVUK have seen their own projections.  They know how damaging leaving the customs union will be.  They also know new FTAs can’t compensate for that loss yet they persist in saying the opposite merely to placate their own ideologically fixated #Brexit  extremists 
Apparently Liam Fox will say in a speech to the Financial Sector today “".....it must be acknowledged that, outside the EU, this country will enjoy a new degree of economic agility."  ....But no it mustn’t- because it isn’t true....#Brexit.
. @sajidjavid and @michaelgove both shamelessly lying:1. The result of an advisory referendum cannot be an instruction2. There was no reference to staying in or quitting the Customs Union on the ballot paper.So more #LeaveLies perverting our democracy.#StopBrexit #Brexit 
Tory Remainer MEP @CharlesTannock on the ERG's response to the government conceding Customs Union membership:"ERG Brextremists are capable of untold damage within the party and country if they don't get their way of that I'm sure."#StopBrexit #Brexit
As a general rule, distrust any political messaging on the side of a red bus. #8thref #repealthe8th #brexit 
Encouraging result of a massive #Brexit survey conducted by the @YorkshirePost - Majority now believe that the UK would be better off in the EU and “Leave voters were more likely [than Remain voters] to say they would not vote in the same way now”
NEW: A survey of 2,300 people in Wales shown 59% think we would be better off in Europe.What was promised isn’t what is being delivered.The people deserve have a say on the final #Brexit terms. 
Though the BBC, Theresa May, and mountearronbanks like Boris, Gove and Rees Mogg want me to bend to arbitrary 'will of the people' expressed in the rigged #Brexit vote...I will never accept the removal of my right to be an EU citizen by plebiscite. Demagoguery is not democracy 
A customs union with the EU would not be an off-the-shelf strait jacket.1 thing that seems to be being missed is that a customs union with the EU would be the subject of *negotiation*. Each one is different.+ interesting comment from Chair of IRL Seanad #Brexit committee  
The leader of the country’s biggest employers - who provide jobs - has to spell out to a cabinet minister what our businesses need. Quite unprecedented for this to happen so publicly but illustrative of how disastrous this Government’s approach to #Brexit is. 
A lot of leavers are also under the delusional that there is a #BrexitDividend ie. £350m for the NHS. & are the working class who voted for "sovereignty" aware the #Brexit White papers say "we never lost sovereignty". I think they were victims of a populist propaganda campaign 
A very well put case for why we must leave the Customs Union by @patel4witham It is highly protectionist and stifles opportunities for us in the global market.#Brexit #CustomsUnion
Many are amazed by the easy time @RuthDavidsonMSP gets from the press compared to other politicians. Trust @DaniGaravelli1 to turn the tide #Windrush #rapeclause #brexit #omnishambles
"The UK government has made Brexit promises it cannot keep."Said it before and I'll say it again - if you want to be kept informed about #Brexit, don't simply rely on the UK press - read the @IrishTimes too.
Don’t forget #Brexit’s transitional costs! They are additional to the other costs and they are big! @InFactsOrg @markboleat
I really don't know - but they do seem to have targetted Me. !It means *Follow back Pro Europe* but is essentally  a cover for the Lib Dems who believe if you vote for them in the local elections - you'll stop #Brexit 
Losing on the Customs Union would be a big defeat for the Brexiteers. Old wounds would open, the uneasy #Brexit ceasefire on the Tory benches would break. If the @UKLabour Party can unite behind a #PeoplesVote - we would be in a position of real strength.
With a few more thousand signatures, Parliament will be obliged to debate this. Let's bring it to 100k. Time to send the fancy-dress-cloaked Kinnocks home!#AbolishTheLords#Brexit
So we’re at 86% of the signatures we need to get this debated in HoCLet’s get this to 100k by the end of today to show the House of Lords we won’t stand for our democratic mandate being ignored. Sign & RT #BrexitLordsBetrayal #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit
You do realise that all the leavers will  turn on you once the consequences of leaving the customs union become apparent and what do you think Jeremy corbyn will do to your buy 2 let portfolio when that happens #brexit
I now support and am a member of the @LibDems after despair at the hard-left takeover of the Labour Party by the 'haters', & the impact of #Brexit on our country.I have met kind, tolerant & progressive people who would like to give you the chance to vote and say no to #Brexit
Some people are getting fatigued with #Brexit and giving up the fight. I get angrier by the minute! #PeoplesVote
The EU loves this Lords amendment, because it would keep UK law in lock-step with the EU. The people did not vote for #Brexit in name only. 
Mexico agrees trade deal with EU, another how many trade deals has EU done now since the brexit vote? 4 or 5.. How many trade deals has the UK done 0  #brexit
Your rank and file #Leaver doesn't care about the CU, SM or Sovereignty, indeed many probably don't even understand what they are. #Brexit for the masses was only about curtailing immigration because right wing propoganda sold them a none existent problem. #Brexit has no benefits
#Brexit zealots can say "we knew what we voted for" all day long, it doesn't matter.  The vast majority of leavers voted for a pain free brexit, because that's what the charlatans on Vote Leave offered.They were misled, Brexit will be painful
“We will do as instructed” @EmilyThornberry on #brexitThere was no instruction. It was an advisory referendum the result of which was “we’re not sure”.Unless the instruction she is referring to is @jeremycorbyn’s, of course. #ABTV
As the European nation with the most FDI, Britain is already a magnet for investment. Outside the EU's customs union, the UK will be an even stronger attraction for global trade and flows.This is what the EU fears. And this is what the Remainiacs want to stop?#Brexit 
I think the Labour leadership believe that even disgruntled Remainers will rally to them during the transition in order to get the least damaging #Brexit. Of course Labour might just end up like the #LibDems, hated for having colluded with the Tories. #StopBrexit #VoteEU#ABTV
So Brussels determined to play hardball.That’s not necessarily a bad thing.It means we can now press on & deliver Real #BrexitTheresa May said many times, No Deal is better than a bad deal.What #EU is trying to bully us into is very much a BAD deal.
Consider yourself warned @theresa_may. This is not what we voted for. #LeaveMeansLeave #Brexit 
Huge support for a #peoplesvote on Harpenden High St today. As the realities of #Brexit become clear, people should have the right to change their minds. We spoke to many people who have already changed theirs. @BimAfolami
Failure to fulfil the terms of the Brexit vote and leave the #customsunion in name and practice would ultimately result in a leadership challenge.#BREXIT FIGHTBACK: @DavidDavisMP 'spearheading Cabinet REVOLT over No 10 customs union plot'
It is just astonishing that so much misinformation has entered the #Brexit debate. EU gives tariff free access to African and less developed countries -  UK helped achieve this- so if we leave EU we can't offer those poor countries a better deal!! 
Jacob Rees-Mogg:"It's clear #EU is not going to accept anything short of us remaining in Customs Union but we're not going to split up UK simply to help Leo Varadkar at next election.EU is jeopardising the economic future of Republic of Ireland"#Brexit
Rees-Mogg calls for destructive trade war on Ireland unless they give UK what it wants on #brexit.Problem is this would be both legally & technically impossible as well as being a rather hateful policy in itself.

Please read this thread re #ContinuityBill & @UKSupremeCourt #brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope 
The power to refer under s.33 is discretionary. The UK Govt did not have to make this reference. Their motivation is political because they want to keep the Scottish Parliament @scotgov “in their place” in relation to #Brexit i.e. powerless

"You're an ordinary member of the public who voted Remain based on the information you were given" - Few Remain voters are Remoaners.  Read how #Brexit Facts4EU is reaching out to ordinary people: 
"The European Union produced laws in a form of gobbledygook, of stentorian sesquipedalian sentences that nobody can ever understand."#Brexit #Moggmentum
If people actually knew the extent of the corruption and manipulation used by the EU daily to force through their nationalist one-state master-plan, the vote to leave would have been an absolute landslide! Remainers need to shake off their delusions & wake up. #Brexit
This #Brexit idiocy marks the beginning of the end of Labour+Conservative dominance in the UK, even if Brexit is cancelled. Expect Parliament to remain hung for the next few General Elections until the middle ground gains enough of a share to bring proportional representation in.
I am Dutch and we are not afraid of an already dynamic economy getting more dynamic. But we are afraid of chlorinated chicken and hormone pumped up beef and God knows what other goods you will import after #Brexit. It will make thoroughgoing controls at the border necesarry.
I’ve stopped being friends with someone who has been my best friend for 8 years.He has steadily become more and more racist since #Brexit and I can no longer tolerate it.I loved the friend I had, but I despise what he has become. 
THIS. This is just one of too many reasons why Remainers are so fucking angry. If you voted #Brexit you are partly responsible for this. If you continue to support a Brexit party, you will be partly responsible every time it happens in future. Britain is better than this.

Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said that #Brexit is an incredible opportunity for Australia and Britain to lead the world on free trade.He backed Britain to make its withdrawal from the EU a success, something he said that Australia will support.

Staying in the Customs Union would be a bad deal. Our trade negotiators would be hamstrung, unable to sign comprehensive deals with big and emerging economies alike. #Brexit 
Full membership of the EU is integral to the economy of the North East, especially the manufacturing sector. #Labour cannot stand by and risk 100,000 jobs by supporting #Brexit. We must have the courage to change course.  
Historians will look back on 2016, not only as the year of #Brexit and #Trump, but also the start of the end of the undemocratic house of Lords.Fantastic.
Just spoken to my mum, she's 86 next week and voted remain. She is disgusted with Theresa May and told me very proudly she has sent off her postal vote already. #ABTV 1, #brexit parties 0 #ABTV18 good old mum 
Well I think she will go down in the History of #brexit as a self promoting harpie Witch who though nothing of betraying her own voters and 17.4million ppl who knew what they were voting for.She thinks nothing of the Democratic will of the U.K.And should be castigated forever. 
I feel very strongly about this. #Brexit will destroy the UK music industry. Do I care about the industry? Personally no. But I do care enormously about the music & the musicians: British music & musicians have had a huge worldwide cultural effect. Soft power. And that will die. 
Boris Johnson meeting with Alexander Nix from #CambridgeAnalytica Farage & Rees-Mogg meeting with Steve Bannon. But of course....they are just men of the people.....nothing to see here.....#Brexit
My *personal* view of democracy is that it's about serving the needs and the wishes of the people. If someone can convince me that 51.9% of voters are OK with making themselves and the country permanently poorer (as every analysis has shown), I'll shut my gob right now. #Brexit
The lack of attention to the impact of #Brexit on #Ireland during ref was indicative of  a  deep disregard for #UK’s neighbours. @KateHoeyMP is a doctrinaire Europhobe who cares more about exiting #EU than the place of her birth or those who will lose their jobs
The country is descending into absolute farce, the Gvt are caught lying to parliament and to us repeatedly. We are in one hell of a mess with #Brexit and what does the right-wing press talk about? The royal bloody wedding. Jeez!

This would seem to support this story which appeared on Twitter some weeks ago, claiming that Nissan would quit Sunderland because of #Brexit@bbcnewcastle#StopBrexit #VoteEU #ABTV
The longer negotiations continue, the clearer it becomes that the EU does not want a workable outcome. Its aim is, and always has been, to punish Britain for leaving:  #Brexit
If a second referendum would 'tear Britain apart' then Britain's democracy is a very frail and sickly thing indeed. Truth is a second referendum would reveal how many leavers have changed their mind. And that something which #Brexit bosses are determined to prevent.
I will be voting for this motion on Thursday for the UK to remain in a Customs Union with the EU. For many reasons, including the Northern Ireland border and maintaining the Good Friday Agreement. #GFA #Brexit 
Sensible to recognise that people have the right to reconsider #brexit , given that it’s looking very different from what was promised and likely to sink the UK economy 
European officials seem rather pleased with how sharply they rejected the UK’s proposals on how to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.Bullying the British people won't stop #Brexit. It just makes them doubt if a deal is worth it. 
Well done @Channel4News for tackling the Chancellor in Washington today over the predictions of the IMF that our economy we’ll be one of the worst performing because of #brexit. Good questioning on brexit issues and threw in one on windrush too. @BBCNews didn’t cover that either

1. I do get bored of remainers telling us "global Britain is a #Brexit fantasy". It's more than the ability to ship goods around the world. It's about Britain's place as an *independent* actor in global forums being able to use the institutions to initiate and shape global rules.
After the job losses at #JaguarLandRover, the widely predicted post #brexit job shedding starts at #Nissan.If you think that British society was polarised after Leave vote in 2016 then, trust me, its about to get a lot worse as the reality of brexit sinks in.Troubling times.

I second @Femi_Sorry We need to deal with the causes: inequality, lack of education, & Eurosceptic rhetoric drip fed to us by the right wing press... and the solution is not to Brexit. #Brexit will make the lives of the people who voted for it worse. They will be angrier still. 
That’s not my #Brexit the border’s too hard. 
This is what happens when you base your entire negotiating strategy on rainbows and unicorns... The government must surely now commit to an #EEA / #EFTA - based #brexit , incl a comprehensive agreement on customs co-operation, via Protocol 10 of the EEA Agreement. Beyond urgent.

EXC. Back to drawing board on Ireland and #brexit after EU trashed U.K. border solutions. A “forensic annihilation”. My latest. 
ConLab are denying us a #FinalSay. We have one opportunity to use our votes to say No! to #Brexit, and that's on May 3. Vote for pro-EU parties. Ask friends, relatives and colleagues to do the same. Spread the message far and wide, and fast!#StopBrexit #VoteEU #ABTV
Forced to chose between your passport and your children, your partner, your job or the place where you have lived all your life.  This is what #Brexit does to people. Unacceptable. @the3Million @EelcoKeij @catherinemep @guyverhofstadt
#Brexit THE HOUSE OF LORDS ARE TRYING TO KILL BREXITBETRAYING OUR PRECIOUS DEMOCRACYTime to fight back. Pls sign...Petition: Give the electorate a referendum on the abolition of the House of Lords 
This article is worth a read for anyone interested in #Remainernow.What a global future’s analysis shows is that leave voters (as well as remainers) really don’t think #brexit is worth it! It’s time MPs but country before party!#stopbrexit #peoplesvote
EU citizens! We cannot have illiberal democracies like Poland and Hungary in the EU. But we cannot allow the UK to leave. Even though they have voted for the far right populist #Brexit. This is the duality of EU thought, or doublethink as I like to call it. #IAmEuropean
Please RT: Nobody gave ‘informed consent’ for #Brexit. That’s because in the #EUreferendum, the electorate was not sufficiently informed. We were misinformed. That’s why we need a new vote on the final Brexit deal. The #PeoplesVote. See all our posters at 
#Brexit 17 million voted leave we’re leaving the EU. Stop putting on same bloody bores, everyday on TV. Chuka Umunna, Ken Clarke, Tony Blair, Michael Heseltine, Anna Soubry, Richard Branson, Alastair Campbell. Never ending listening to them trying to derail BREXIT.  
New poll shows even Leavers reject all #Brexit optionsIt really is time 4 the Govt & opposition to wake up to the reality that any version will damage the UK & coupled with the loss of Rights the Ppl must have a #FinalSayForALL via @politics_co_uk
Delusional cabinet brexiters desperate  to play down Lords defeat,but overwhelming Lords majority shows there is cross party commitment to prevent a disastrous #Brexit. It's up to Parl to control what happens - the country's future cannot be left to an arrogant, incompetent Govt
Just to make it clearI've repeatedly tweeted that in my view the House of Lords should be abolished & especially so after they voted to stop #Brexit & overturn the biggest democratic vote in our historyI have never said that the @ForBritainParty would abolish the House of Lords
Question. After #Brexit when the EU and the UK become competitors, who do you think will be the first to lower social and labour standards in order to stand a chance?
A significant proportion of the #British population now support a vote on the deal, and it is patently clear why: Tory negotiations have been shambolic and impact reports have exposed the devastating repercussions of #Brexit. 
Did any of Peers, who receive EU cash,declare an interest in #brexit vote?No they didn't.If MPs/Councillors vote on something they've a financial interest in they'd be getting a knock on the door from the Police.The Peers seem  to be above the laws they pass for everyone else. 
My new paper on civil society contestation of #ISDS in #TTIP/#CETA just out! Focuses on how CSOs used emotions to frame #ISDS as a threat to democracy, but were outmanoeuvred by the @EU_Commission. Has lessons for post-#Brexit/#Trump CSO trade campaigning: 
Full marks to @ScotNational for picking up on the funding angle here. I don’t see why taxpayers north or south of the border should have to pay for the Tories attempts to undermine democracy & devolution #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
Thank you @HayteratLords and @UKHouseofLords for passing an amendment to the #RepealBill yesterday to safeguard Working Time Regulations after #Brexit. This is a welcome reassurance for both healthcare workers and patients.
Does anyone actually believe elitist, rich leavers will give up THEIR EU citizenship? I doubt it. They'll wangle dual citizenship somehow. #Brexit will enable a two tier system where yet again the ones in power come out on top. 
After withdrawal bill defeats for govt we will continue to fight in the Lords. We now need #Brexit doubters in the commons to support our amendments. Our role is to amend laws that will harm the UK. It is now up to MPs  to do the same #FBPE

Govt claims of wanting to preserve “geographical indications” to protect British foods like Cornish pasties from imitation after #Brexit are hard to swallow. 
That’s because your Tory bosses in London held the meetings with #CambridgeAnalytica . You were out of the loop just like on #fisheries & #Brexit. Still, a big thank you to @RuthDavidsonMSP for entertaining us all at #FMQS today 
#Brexit is falling apart without the need for Corbyn to oppose it. The final deal will be a worst-of-both-worlds fudge that neither hardcore Leavers like Rees-Mogg nor hardcore Remainers like Soubry will want to vote for.Hate to say I told you so, but I told you so.#bbcdp
When it comes to regulating the growth industry of this century - #tech - #Brexit will be like giving up shared influence over where, when and whether it rains, in return for absolute power over a tiny umbrella.
Nigel Lawson is a climate change conspiracy theorist who lives in France. So naturally he gets invited on #bbcdp to talk bollocks about #Brexit.
If you're visiting Harpenden farmer's market this Sunday, do stop by to support our friends @HarpendenEurope, who'll be promoting a #peoplesvote on the #Brexit deal outside the library from 10am-2pm. Volunteers also very welcome - the more the merrier! 
#Brexit is about the rise of an ideology that sees people as parts of a national herd, in which individual rights & liberties are always secondary to the power of the nation and its rulers.We are not Nazi Germany but elements of fascism are now at play in our politics,#Windrush
#Brexit bill: #May under pressure after two big defeats in #Lords 
In a more civilised age a government would fall over this type of cronyism but in #brexit Britain this is just another day on our road to becoming a banana republic for corporations.  via @HeidilBlake
Just asked that the Prime Minister lead a debate in which she'd guarantee that no long term EU citizen living in the UK, when applying for settled status, will be threatened with deportation.  EU citizens who've devoted their lives to the UK need that reassurance. #FBPE #Brexit
So let's be crystal clear the House of Lords are now actively looking to undermine the will of the people and UK negotiations in an attempt to lock us inside an EU Customs Union, an EU construct used to withhold #Brexit benefits 'UK specific' trade with the rest of the world. 
Agriculture, food manufacturing, hospitality and warehousing are likely to “struggle most” after #Brexit, professor Manning told the Home Affairs Committee. Watch it here:
What else does Edward Barrett-Shortt believe in ? From his public social media accounts it would appear that he supports #Brexit, is perhaps a Tory and also appears to be fond of #NigelFarage & that’s just what’s publically available, who knows what he’s opted to keep private ?
I think it has to be said that there is something evil about #TheresaMay's actions on #immigration while she was Home Secretary. Her #xenophobic utterances to the Tory faithful as PM have reinforced this impression. #Brexit
Nigel Farage:“All I can say is House of Lords is stuffed full of former MPs, party donors & former #EU Commissioners.They are a London-based clique & most of them are mates of Blairs & Camerons.The whole place is a complete & utter disgrace.”#Brexit
Today im 18, now i can vote. Sorry #corbyn but i dont fool for you fantasy economics and hate filled campaign. I have a postive outlook for my future and thats can only happen in a capitialist soceity.So heres one more vote for theresa#Conservatives #TheresaMay #Brexit
Cost of #Brexit translated to the NHS budget. Please RT. 
Farage admits 2 of his children have German passports, giving them what he is robbing from us.   Restore justice!#StopBrexit #VoteEU#Brexit
The #Brexit blue passport will give us Freedom of Movement in 2 countriesEastern Europeans, who the Brexiters disdain as uncouth migrant hordes, will have Freedom of Movement in 31 countries. Britons will be the idiots with the worst passports in Europe. #StopBrexit #VoteEU
Can we expect #Brexit to be dropped the next time Theresa goes on holiday? Asking for lots of friends #FBPE #WATON
There’re 5 living former Cabinet Secretaries (senior civil servant in the UK). All 5 sit in the #HouseofLords. All 5 voted against the gov’t and in support of the U.K. staying in the EU Customs Union - it’s quite clear what the Civil Service’s institutional position on #Brexit is
And here is the reason so many #Tories want #Brexit; they want to turn Britain into a low tax, low regulation, low wage economy & a tax haven floating off into the Atlantic - who voted for that The idea there'll be MORE MONEY for public services is nonsense#Lycamobile #HMRC
While the UK government tried to keep its #Brexit impact studies secret, the European Parliament publishes its ones:
Never been one to shout much at the radio but the combination of a sickeningly sanctimonious Michael Gove and a complacent John Humphrys this morning on #Immigration #Windrush #Brexit was truly unbearable. 
A majority of the unelected Lords have betrayed the British people by voting to keep the UK in a Customs Union, and sabotaging the freedom to make our own trade deals and the future prosperity of the nation. The Commons must now obey the people and ensure a full #Brexit
Never forget. This man created #Brexit chaos because of an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all his mates (and f***ed off) 
David Cameron, 'I don't regret holding the #Brexit vote', I'm sure just like your relief you don't regret the hate/division/xenophobia/racism it's caused, thanks to him we'll lose influence, rights, we'll be isolated, in 8 years the tories have destroyed Britain #ToriesOut.
Huge issues and massive outrage #Windrush #Brexit so #r4today brings on Michael Gove to talk about plastic straws & cotton buds in its flagship 8.10 interview.
Let's get this up to 100k. They don't get £300 a day to thwart the democratically expressed will of the people #Lords #Brexit
Heard some fake news about a government defeat in the House of Lords on their flagship #Brexit bill. Went to the the #BBCnews website to check it out and not a mention. Guess it didn't happen then. Report the news not the government agenda BBC.
Keri Starmer: The EU Ref answered one key question do you want to stay in the EU or Leave the EU.ME: There you go...confirmation a vote for Labour = #Brexit. If you back #Remain & want to #StopBrexitSaveBritain don't vote Tory OR Labour 03/05/18.#FairVote #ABTVtoStopBrexit
Without much of the British press noticing it, #EasyJet has already left the UK and moved a chunk of its EU operations to #Austria (this will allow them to fly in the EU post #Brexit provided they meet ownership rules) 
EU does not have a trade deal with ANY of the major economic powers in the world.The dead hand of the EU has held the UK back for 45 years.Thank goodness we soon be FREE to make our own trade deals.The UK economy will BOOM after #Brexit. 
.@joannaccherry; Tory Govt wants to use the courts to overrule Scottish Parliament’s #EU #Continuity Bill because the @ScotTories couldn’t defeat it by democratic means. And they told us we had the most powerful devolved parliament in the world. #Brexit
Now you see this is where you are wrong#EUsupergirl will not die with #BrexitBrexit will be the death of the UK NOT the EU The #EU will continue its good work and I will do everything I can to support and promote it's values of Peace, Tolerance and Unity @JusticeLeagueEU
Interesting to see Brextremists calling for the abolition of the House of Lords in the name of the "Will of the People".There are historical precedents for this sort of demand.#Brexit 
We have decided as @CommonsHomeAffs today to urgently haul in Home Secretary and @ukhomeoffice officials over #Windrush scandal. I think we also need wide inquiry into “hostile environment” and chaos at Home Office - which hardly bodes well for #Brexit registration process...
Remain & leave could not have repeated enough that #Brexit = leaving single market & making own trade deals outside CUGovt pamphlet said if leave, we’d negotiate new deals not as Customs bloc, but as Sovereign State#ExitFromBrexit #EUWithdrawalBill
"Sovereign parliament" was the battle cry of leave.The House of Lords is part of parliament.For those complaining, this is how a democratic sovereign parliament works.Fun isn't it.#fbpe #StopBrexit #brexit
Tory mess on #Windrush the arrogant dismissal of parliament on #Syria bombing, a big defeat in the Lords on #Brexit tonight, Parliamentary investigation into the health secretary. A year ago the PM announced a general election after a walk, maybe time for another walk l think? 
I blame #Brexit. 
Today the @UKHouseofLords voted to try to keep us in a Customs Union after #Brexit. This isn’t what we voted for in the EU RefPlease sign this petition to support the abolition of our undemocratic upper chamber#BrexitLordsBetrayal #EUWithdrawalBill
"Whilst 17.4 million people voted to leave the EU, a handful of unelected Lords are presumptuous enough to believe they can overturn the result and keep us under EU control" - Gisela Stuart, Change Britain chair. Time to get rid of them?#Brexit 
It's been a bad day for #brexit & an awful week for the Tories. Let's keep up the pressure. #LocalElections2018
When will the British people relearn that the greatest threat to their rights and indeed basic safety and security is not an international body like the EU, but their own government?#StopBrexit #Brexit #VoteEU
To all Brexiteers: you've been fucking lied to from day one. The House of Lords is unelected in order to not be influenced in anyway and to impartially PROTECT YOU. They're doing their job. Be thankful. #Brexit #HouseofLords #thankyou
Funny I don’t recall the bit in the £9 million leaflet that said:The unelected House of Lords can & will override your decision, if they don’t like it..#AbolishTheLords#EUWithdrawalBill #CustomsUnion #Brexit 
There is no doubt that the #Windrush scandal is intrinsically and unequivocally related to the underlying ideology that helped drive the #Brexit vote.
Nigel Farage:“For Brexit voters, this whole thing is a slow, endless agony – we didn’t vote for a transition deal, we voted to Leave![#EU] is coming under sustained assault from voters everywhere, in particular the wonderful results in Hungary"#Brexit
The abolition of our unelected House of Lords should have been just as much of a priority as the #EU Withdrawal Bill itself. Voting for #Brexit was a vote to leave ALL of the EU. Keeping us in a Customs Union is contrary to our country’s democratic instruction to the government.
#Brexit supporters suffered a significant legal defeat in the House of Lords. Here's why that's a problem.@Nigel_Farage
We all benefit from the vital protection of EU equality and anti-discrimination law – we can’t let Tory #Brexit diminish it. @LibDemLords are calling for current rights to be enshrined in UK law #EUWithdrawalBill #FBPE
Why is the Lords so keen to stay in an EU Customs Union on #Brexit? Trade deals with fast growing non-EU coutnries are the way for the future. 
When presented with the realities of #Brexit - the public rejects every option tabled by Leavers by at least 3:1. (H/T @Global__Future). The country must be given the chance to vote on the facts. We must have a #PeoplesVote
I see the House Of Lords is doing its upmost to maintain its reputation. Firstly by shitting over the Elected House Of Commons and secondly but much worse showing its absolute utter contempt for the British people and for the result of the referendum. #LordsBrexitBetrayal #Brexit
Ella Whelan - "We already had our democratic say and any argument against #Brexit at this point, any call for a second referendum is nothing but an anti-democratic demand." 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May loses #Brexit legislation vote in upper parliamentary House 
First defeat for #Brexit bill. Peers vote for amendment to stay in the Customs Union. A vote for common sense. Could this be the first hole in the dam?
Just a reminder to @UKHouseofLords the British public was promised that our #Brexit vote would be finalRemaining in a Customs Union is not Brexit#BrexitLordsBetrayal #LordsOfBrexit #EUWithdrawalBill
The day of the #brexit referendum my beautiful daughter asked me what it meant and if we would have to leave the country. I reassured her and told her no. #Windrush is the cruel and shameful proof we never needed to see. What is happening to this amazing country?
The @UKHouseofLords just voted to force the UK to stay in the Customs Union post #Brexit. Let me be clear. I voted to leave the Customs Union#EUWithdrawalBill#BrexitLordsBetrayal
.@UKHouseofLords have just voted for #CustomsUnion Amendment to force UK to stay in Customs Union & block us from signing new trade deals post #Brexit... It’s worth remembering how many Lords are in receipt of EU pensions & therefore cannot criticise EU#BrexitLordsBetrayal
"The government has been clear, that the UK, in it's entirety, is leaving the customs union." @LordCallanan #Brexit #LordsofBrexit
In @Europarl_EN today I welcomed @eucopresident statement of support: no solution on Irish border means no withdrawal agreement and no transition. Issue is important to my constituents – I invited colleagues to visit to see for themselves. #Brexit 
Today in the #EUWithdrawalBill @LibDemLords are voting to protect equality, employment and health rights and environmental and consumer standards so that these cannot be weakened by Tory #Brexit. #FBPE #ExitFromBrexit
The Conservative’s extreme #Brexit will mean heavy job losses. Today in the #EUWithdrawalBill Liberal Democrats are urging the government to keep us in a Customs Union to protect these jobs and the UK economy. #ExitFromBrexit #FBPE
We have launched a new campaign for a #peoplesvote on the #Brexit deal. But we’ll only win if everybody does their bit. Here’s a list over 8 things you can do today. First thing? Follow @peoplesvote_uk
Tory UK Government wants to use the courts to overrule the Scottish Parliament’s #EU #Continuity Bill because the @ScotTories couldn’t defeat it by democratic means. And they told us we had the most powerful devolved parliament in the world. #Brexit 
"We're very happy with trade with Britain".Canada's PM @JustinTrudeau says he wants a 'seamless' trade deal with the UK that would "flip over the day after #Brexit"
#LordsQs @PTylerLords argues that any complacency from the Govt. around the alleged misuse of personal data during the EU Referendum campaign gives added voice to the demand for the public to have a free and fair vote at the end of the #Brexit process 
We all support a PEOPLE'S VOTE - SHARE if you also want a say on the final Brexit deal. @MrAndyParsons @ChukaUmunna @LaylaMoran @campbellclaret @Anna_Soubry @Femi_Sorry @albawhitewolf #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Pleased to get so much support from Labour benches for my defence of the Scottish Parliament’s #EU Continuity Bill.  @ScotTories MPs looking very upset. Seems the #BetterTogether honeymoon might finally be over? #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #Brexit
With respect, Labour are complicit in #Brexit - potentially the most damaging political event in living memoryThis line doesn't play any more 
10 fanatical Remain-backing Peers have proposed a total of 388 amendments to stop #BrexitI am thoroughly sick of un-elected Peer,who think they are so superior and think they know better than the 17.4 m Brits who voted to escape from the dictatorial EU.
Chickens coming home to roost while the unicorns are disappearing fast. #Brexit is throwing up huge political problems and complexities. Is it worth it? Let the people make that call through a #PeoplesVote on the final deal. #StopBrexit
This woman was first minister of NI and currently has the ear of the British Prime Minister over NI matters, not least the arrangements around #Brexit. Is it any wonder we are in the mess we are in right now. It’s truly frightening. 
#Windrush scandal: #Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt links row to EU citizens' fears.The Home Secretary is facing calls to resign over the growing row, amid fears of a similar "nightmare" for EU nationals. 
Just stop pandering to the UKGovt...enforce the red lines asap. You can't trust it or the ERG post #Brexit...the whole aim is to Diverge. And Labour in backing #Brexit are tacitly helping. Bring it to a head in time for us to get a #FairVote to #StopBrexitSaveBritain & the #EU!
Pleased to advise my Urgent Question on UK Govt’s legal challenge to devolved #Brexit legislation has been granted. I & other @theSNP MPs will be questioning the Attorney General on this challenge to the Scottish Parliament’s democratic legitimacy at 1.15pm

The Treasury officials responsible for Project Fear are either hopeless at economic forecasting or allowed political bias to affect their conclusions. In either case, heads should roll.  #Brexit
The misuse of Britons’ personal data by a #Brexit campaign group and other businesses owned by its founder, Arron Banks, was “rife”, according to a former employee of Cambridge Analytica.
A good indiciation that a) real trade talks with the UK will only start after it has left the EU and b) 21 months of transition will hardly be enough to negotiate and ratify such an extensive trade agreement. #Brexit

I think we are about to find out that the recent 2015 & 2017 Tory Governments, as well as #Brexit were 'won' by totally illegal means.Power stolen from the British people.What next?At what point do people of the UK rise up as one & say #EnoughisEnough ?
Let us not forget why the Lords are trying to prevent Brexit...Anti-Brexit Lords get £500k in EU pensions a year and can't criticise Brussels #EUWithdrawalBill #HouseofLords #TheresaMay #PMQs #Brexit
Gisela Stuart:"It’s deeply dissapointing peers using parliamentary procedure to pursue their own agenda of stopping #BrexitWhilst 17.4m voted to Leave #EU, a handful of unelected Lords believe they can overturn result & keep us under Brussels control."

This is bigger than #Brexit. ALL OF our rights are being attacked. In my mind it's not just about UK cits or EU cits but it's about ALL people who call the UK home. Time to come together and hold these people to account. #enoughisenough
Very interesting work by @jdportes @Global__Future and polling by Populous.Taking UK Govt’s estimated cost of each #Brexit scenario, explaining it in everyday terms, and asking voters to choose which option they’d go for.

After seething for months over #Brexit I didn't think anything could make me even angrier - and along came the utter disgrace of #Windrush and the realisation that our government is rotten to the core. May must resign.
The Nursing and Midwifery Council says applications from EU nurses to work in the UK have fallen by 89% since the referendum. There’s already a shortage of medical professionals. #Brexit will do nothing but make it worse #52brexitfacts

Access to justice in the UK for the most vulnerable citizens is appalling.  It is these EU nationals who risk being unable to confirm their status and fight possible rejections post #Brexit without adequate provisions in Withdrawal Agreement. Listen up @MichelBarnier
This is the same Digby Jones who insisted that not one single job would be lost because of #Brexit. The fact that that ship has long since sailed might be a clue as to why people want #Brexit stopped.
Britain does not have a codified constitution. Our system is very flexible & adaptable. But it relies on governments respecting certain largely unwritten limits to their actions. On #Brexit & #Windrush this government has crashed its way through those limits.

We'd be wise to listen to our friends & pay heed to our adversaries. NONE of our friends think #Brexit is a good idea. Not one. Even Pres. Trump now sees it as a danger to jobs & world trade. Meanwhile Putin is full of glee...Vote AGAINST pro-Brexit parties on May 3rd! #ABTV
#Brexit will do nothing but damage our relationship with other countries. #52brexitfacts. New figures show more than 1,000 life-saving NHS transplants in the past decade relied on the transport of organs across the Ireland-UK border.

Nigel Oakes, the SCL founder said that Trump whipped up fear of Muslims to gain electoral advantage. The #Leave and #Brexit press campaigns cynically inflamed, not just fear of Muslims, but fear of EU immigrants and refugees.  #StopBrexit #VoteEU #ABTV

@mrjamesob The more I learn about the Windrush generation and how they were/are being treated by the government, the less confident I am by the reassuranes given to the EU citizens post #Brexit. I might be paranoid and exaggerating but that's how I feel.
$/£1.437, highest since #Brexit vote, unemployment rate 4.2% (December-February), lowest since 1975. Cautiously optimistic. 
Shocking to hear of stories like this.The @Conservatives have consistently failed to guarantee the rights of EU citizens.The @libdems are the only party standing up for EU citizens. Make your voice heard on May 3, by voting for the only party actively campaigning against #Brexit. 
My daughter got into her first choice primary school yesterday. Perhaps we should thank #Brexit - the “explosion” in pupil numbers, fuelled by high migrant births is down, esp in London 
This cack-handed; "KeystoneKops"  government headed by a malign mediocrity ought to be sinking in the polls daily.It's. Not.#Windrush#Scotland#Wales#Brexit 
#Macron outlining his vision for the future of Europe to the European Parliament There are many ideas for the future of the EU, they need consensus of Member States to go forward. But if we #brexit, UK will no longer have an input, nor a veto, on future of our continent 
I've lived in London half my life. UK citizen a third of it.Accepted an honour from the  Queen. Been deputy chair of the @britishmuseum.To @cnni  (1200 BST) to discuss #windrush and the question:"What does it mean to be British.. today?"#Windrush#Brexit
#Brexit Owen Jones &  Kevin Maguire worst two journalists in . Both backed Labour lost, both backed Hillary Clinton lost, both backed stay in EU lost. Why are two dweebs on TV & Radio everyday talking bollocks both.  Stop putting them on boring us all to death.    
David Lidington says the sheer number of cases has been part of the #Windrush problem - there must be many less than 57,000.I’m sure 3 million EU citizens are feeling really confident about the government ability to sort their status come #Brexit
Both sides told lies in their EU Referendum campaigns, but the Leave side was powered by a deliberate lying machine. This is a shocking scandal that should rock the whole country to its core. #Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica
#Brexit apathy is the greatest danger: “If the UK does end up leaving the EU, the referendum result will be only half the reason. The other half will be a parliament that knew Britain was going the wrong way, yet couldn’t be bothered to lead the way back.” 
Must read from @iandunt >>”Bullying is not a mistake in the system. It is the system. This is the reality of how the British state treats immigrants” Because of #Brexit this is about to get a whole lot worse.  
George Soros funded, #PeoplesVoice plot to overturn #Brexit looks dead in the water as UK businesses refuse to back a second referendum and prolonged uncertainty 
Drip feed lies about the EU and you end up with #Brexit  Drip feed demonisation of immigrants and you end up with the #windrush scandal  These sorts of things don’t happen by accident.
The appeaser @theresa_may has wasted the support of 17,410,742 #British people who voted for #BREXIT ie leaving the #EU for Good! In favour of the Fake #Tory maggots in the @Conservatives.. What a shame & politically stupid! #BBC #LBC @LBC #SKY #UK #ConservativesParty @ConHome
Whenever you think "oh #Brexit is inevitable,let's just accept it" think of thisIt doesn't get better after Brexit, the xenophobes & alt-right populists don't go back in their boxBrexit is a stain on this country, and on *any* politician who enables it
.@theresa_may's Tories are playing a sinister game of Monopoly. With their toxic #Brexit, disdain for democracy & #HostileEnvironment for migrants, they've gone straight past Go, collected loads of dosh, gone beyond their #NastyParty image & are approaching Nazi status. TURN BACK
If you're angry at Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn & what #Brexit is doing to our country, hold on to your anger and vote #LibDems and #Greens on May 3rd. #FinalSayForAll #PeoplesVote

BREXIT: Windrush scandal 'deeply worrying' for EU citizens who fear similar #Brexit treatment, says Guy Verhofstadt 
BBC on old form with @BBCNewsnight coverage of #Windrush. Emily Maitlis not letting Tory sacrificial lamb off the hook. Now @BBCNews try to take a similar approach in holding the govt to account on #brexit.
Remind me  wasn't the rationale for #Brexit to "restore Parliamentary sovereignty". How does that square with May taking life and death decisions on #Syria without asking Parliament?
My evidence has just been published by the UK @CommonsCMS Fake News Inquiry here:  #CambridgeAnalytica #SCL #emerdata #brexit This was not easy but it was my public responsibility as an academic and matter of personal conscience to submit to the inquiry.
I had a visit today w/ one my heroes - George Mitchell. We discussed #Ireland after #Brexit & politics in the North & the Republic. His peacemaking efforts saved lives & gave new hope. I’m so proud to know him. 
We polled young people on their thoughts about #Brexit, and the results were fascinating... 
So... I’m now officially a Dutch citizen. Yay! All I need to do now is a) get a NL passport sorted & b) renounce my UK citizenship. @ukhomeoffice form for the latter needs co-signing. Methinks I’ll ask a couple of my favourite UK MEPs a favour...  #Brexit = #ExBrit
". .public opposition to govt treatment of Windrush migrants strongest among over-65s", says Dunt.The same over-65s who voted overwhelmingly for #Brexit & so had to spend the next year being told by Dunt how "racist" they were. 
Govt have no answer to #Brexit & Irish border Issue. German frgn minister now publicly supports Irish government’s refusal to accept the return of a hard border in Ireland after Brexit. DD take note - no Irish border deal, no deal at all #FBPE
#Brexit now looking bad on all fronts, hence the case for a public vote on the actual #Brexitreality deal, argues @Hugodixon :
You listen to the people regarding #Brexit @ChukaUmunna but not the 75% of people who don't support the bombing of Syria? People can see through your bullshit and know that you and many other Blarites warmongers are using this as a way to destabilise Labour. You are a selfish git
#Windrush scandal 'deeply worrying' for EU citizens who fear similar post-#Brexit treatment, says @guyverhofstadt. Confirmation of people being wrongly deported is raising concerns in Brussels. 
It’s not just #Windrush it’s endemic across the Home Office handling of visa & immigration applications. The idea it will be able to deal with applications from @The3Million due to the stupidity of #Brexit is laughable 
“Intelligence” on Chemicals Bombing "Only Govt has all the information so only Govt can decide"This approach could be applied to almost anything to bypass Parliament e.g. #Brexit, and hasn’t May done her best to bypass Parliament? #HellYes
Most infuriating "unintended consequences" of voting for the two main parties @ #GE2017 was the claim that "82% chose pro-Brexit parties" therefore they endorse #Brexit. Only way to stop this disingenuous twisting of voting intention & send a clear message is #ABTV on 3rd May.
As @Jon_Danzig writes in his latest commentary, ‘Of course we need a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Because the Brexit people thought they were voting for on 23 June 2016, isn’t the Brexit we’ll be getting on 29 March 2019.’ Please RT. Link:

I think #Trump #Russia #Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica is driven by two, often overlapping, forces1. Dark money from Russian oligarchs and hedge funds held mainly offshore2. A 'nationist' ideology which often veers to a Bannon/Dugin form of white supremacy
I am definitely a Remain. #Brexit 
No Theresa May you do not care for for Carribeans, you care about your job. And we don't buy 'deported in error', I think you meant "I got caught."These people work in our hospitals, and because of #brexit nationalism they mean less to you than the white racists supporting you.
Whether It's #Brexit or #Windrush there is one place this dishonest and abusive government whose lies are perverting democracy, and whose xenophobia is wrecking lives needs to be, and that is behind prison bars. #StopBrexit #FBPE
There is an important new piece by @carolecadwalla on #Brexit and #CambridgeAnalytica.This piece confirms both that @UKIP are in trouble and, as I have been saying, @Vote_leave are not. Those “whistleblowers” were lying.
Great coverage of activists across Wales calling for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit terms in the Western Mail today!// @WalesOnline // @Open_Britain // @peoplesvote_uk // @Cardiff4EU // @Gogs4Europe // @Swansea4Europe // @Valleys4EU
Given the appalling mess for the #Windrush generation created by @theresa_may reforms, there can be no confidence in Home Office ability to handle #EU citizen cases post #Brexit . Worse than incompetent. 
RESEARCHERS: The government have published a helpful Q&A clarifying the UK's involvement in @EU_H2020 - UK researchers can still bid for funding post #Brexit #Horizon2020 
I struggle to believe that there are people out there who still believe the garbage spouted about #Brexit. Global Britain, opportunities, huge savings etc - it’s been shown to be absolute cobblers.#PeoplesVote#StopBrexitSaveBritain#HeadsofStraw
Good talks with PM @AndrewHolnessJM including on EU-Jamaica relations after #Brexit. 
I'm in #Berlin to hear what Germans think about #Brexit & if they agree with @LibDems & the new cross-party initiative @peoplesvote_uk that there should be a 2nd public vote once we have a deal. The people should have the #FinalSay not just MPs. #ExitFromBrexit #EuropeansOnBrexit
Our favourite #Remainer @mikegalsworthy popped down to #SuperSODEM with this message! Spread the word - time for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit 
We’re told #Brexit means Britain is ‘taking back control’. •Taking back control of our borders — whilst Britain wrongly deports folk.•Parliament is taking back control — yet has no say when the PM engages military action in Syria.And people wonder why we want independence?
If only........  Labour opposed #Brexit. Then Remainers could unleash the hounds of reason and derision onto the Tories without fear of being stabbed in the back by a "jobs first Brexit" or becoming entangled in Starmer's 6 tests.If only...#StopBrexit #ABTV #VoteEU
"Madrid has already demanded joint control of Gibraltar’s airport, cross-border cooperation on smuggling and an end to what Spain sees as the Rock’s tax haven status."And Spain has a veto on the #Brexit negotiations if it doesn't get what it wants.
Proud to have stood protesting against the idea of a second referendum with some brave, calm and collected democrats & general public from across the political spectrum this weekend. Some of them had never been to a protest before. #Brexit #Leavevoters
Most Remainers welcome bregretters. If you have doubts about #Brexit don't be afraid to voice it. It's important that we all use our voices.
I will never stop fighting it. In my eyes #Brexit is illegal. Why would I ever accept it?! Democracy is a right but it's  also an obligation. It's my democratic duty to oppose it. If you think #Brexit is still OK and you're gonna still get your unicorn then good luck to you.
Around 900,000 British citizens living in the European Union are facing pension uncertainty, since receiving state pension in other countries is part of existing treaties, which are threatened by #Brexit, Aviva has warned.#StopBrexit #FBPE
So why are @BBCNews and @SkyNews running a breaking news story today about the shutting down of Weatherspoons barely active Twitter account without giving us the full facts? Where's the MSM joined up journalism on #Brexit remain campaign? Where would we be without @carolecadwalla
May 3 is approaching fast. If either of the pro-Brexit parties does well that will be taken as a sign that there is little real opposition to #Brexit. If we want to #StopBrexit we have to ensure the largest possible vote for pro-EU parties.#ABTV #VoteEU
Sir Patrick Stewart - Our country's future is at stake... if we leave the #EU #brexit will shape this country's future for decades to come... that is why I support a #PeoplesVote on the final deal. #StopBrexit #FBPE #FinalSay
A significant proportion of the UK population support a vote on the deal. The Gvt.s much trumpeted transition deal only means that the fatal moment when we reach the #Brexit cliff has been delayed.The people still deserve a final say before we fall off it. 
Dominic Grieve @ifgevents "There was the new campaign launched yesterday. I am very favourable to the idea of there being a further public consultation on #brexit - what we are heading towards is very different to what was promised" @peoplesvote_uk #PeoplesVote
If #Brexit occurs, what the Windrush Generation are going through could also be experienced by many others: "there are 146,000 non-Irish EU citizens who arrived at least 30 years ago". #HostileEnvironment
Over a month and still waiting for a reply. I thought #Brexit was going to be sunshine and rainbows @scullyp. Finally admittance that #Brexit will be a disaster? 
Fantasy characters can’t think for themselves.  The majority of us live in the real world & voted #Brexit #GetOverIt

For UK publishing, #Brexit means a fight with US over sales in EU. British publishers had this market cornered for  English-language editions of books. They could now lose a substantial share of sales and face added costs. The fallout could be dire:

No 10 refuses Caribbean request to discuss children of WindrushIf ever you needed proof this government is infected with racism, here is the evidence. This is why they'll never back down on #Brexit. 
I thought my respect for @SirPatStew couldn’t get any higher. It just did. Great speech on why we need a second referendum on #Brexit 
Sir Patrick Stewart is ignorant of the fact that the EU is not what Britain joined in 1973 and EU has deviated from trading and moved into government. Sir Patrick, #Brexit ! 
Isn't it wonderful how nobody is even talking about #Brexit now?  Simply amazing what one can achieve with a bit of war mongering.
This does not bode well for any Gov reassurances over treatment of  EU citizens post #Brexit.
A vote won by misleading the electorate is not a democratic vote. Here is Vote Leave promising that #Brexit Britain would stay in the Single Market - a promise the Brexiters denied ever making when they no longer need it to attract votes.#StopBrexit #FinalSay #VoteEU #ABTV
"I learn that, post-#Brexit, DfE officials are considering making all non-UK nationals pay for their children's education, introducing an #apartheid system into our national #education. All Brexit supporters should hang their heads in shame." (Will Hutton)
UK politics is incredibly (and damagingly) tribal.So it's refreshing to see people of goodwill from all parties coming together to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. 
Join us and campaign for #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal @peoplesvote_uk Whatever deal we get, the Govt accepts we won't be as prosperous as we would be if we stayed in #EU. Brexit is not a done deal & everyone has a right to demand a People's Vote on it.
Remainers never learn anything do they? It's because of these people we voted to leave. Preachy, vacuous, superficial, know-nothing, shallow, treacherous, narcissistic, privileged, virtue signalling tossrags.#Brexit 
The time to be heard is now! Carry the momentum of the #PeoplesVote launch today by casting an anti-#Brexit tactical vote #ABTV in the #LocalElections2018 on May3rd. #SeizeTheVote! Let the 2 main parties know we want a #FairVote on the #WithdrawalAgreement this autumn. #FinalSay
Guy on the escalators in St.P ran past and said "excuse me... Keep it up!"  can't help but think if we get a #PeoplesVote loads of people who are silent but distressed about #Brexit will come out in support of #Remain. Keep the campaign visible guys, people are noticing!
Nice to meet @SirPatStew today to discuss his support for a #peoplesvote  on the #brexit deal once #Brexitreality is known #PeoplesVote patrick stewart
Govt stats show an astonishing 32% improvement in Britain’s total trade deficit over the last 12 months. Mainly due to services exports. It also shows £94bn reasons why the EU need a frictionless free trade deal on goods with the UK! #Brexit 
Just the process of #Brexit could cost £2bn by next March, ac to @instituteforgov, mainly extra civil servants for more red tape.Cue hollow laugh recalling #Brexiteer promises to slash bureacracy & handsomely fund the #NHS.#exitfrombrexit #PeoplesVote

We did it! We've officially launched our new campaign, @peoplesvote_uk. It does what it says on the tin: calls for a People's Vote on the final #Brexit deal.But we need your help! Sign up to the latest news and chip in by following the link below.
InFacts’ @hugodixon lays out 5 new facts which mean we need a @peoplesvote_uk on the final #Brexit deal. 
That Patrick Stewart says Picard would have voted Remain reveals the narcissism and shallowness of the legacy remain movement. Gives us an insight into how they uncritically and naively bought into the EU's projected self-image.#Brexit
And @BorisJohnson et al called the #Brexit vote 'Independence Day' The irony is so heavy it could press my shirts. 
#TheresaMay you don’t need #parliamentary approval for #airstrikes on #Syria, yet you shiver & shake like an inexperienced jellyfish that you are afraid to make #Brexit decisions with the will of the 52%+ behind you, afraid to upset the minority! PATHETIC #COWARD @theresa_may!
Some people who voted for #brexit were and are racists. We cannot say how many.  People had different reasons, but to pretend that racism was not a reason undermines sense. 
Proud to support the cross party People's Vote campaign. As #LibDems have long said, it should be the people, not politicians who have the final say on the #Brexit deal.
I’m with @SirPatStew in backing the campaign for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal - #Engage! @Open_Britain
.@SirPatStew "The cold reality is that the prospect of #Brexit is already damaging our economy, our public services and the life chances of a generation." A message that will resonate with millions of #Labour voters across the country. #PeoplesVote
Great to be joining @SirPatStew to launch campaign for a #PeoplesDeal #Brexit 
Delighted to help launch #PeoplesVote campaign alongside @ChukaUmunna @LaylaMoran, @Anna_Soubry, and loads of young people who want a say on their future! #Brexit 
It’s not just the revelations that the #LeaveEU campaign cheated, it’s the fact that the emerging #Brexitreality bears no resemblance to what they promised. No wonder there is a clamour for a #peoplesvote on the actual #Brexit deal !
Dear @10DowningStreet -The British people are still expecting a pitch perfect delivery next year so don’t think we have forgotten...what with all the Russian poisonings, bombing Syria etc..etc.We want it done & we want it done well. So keep your eye on the ball.#Brexit  
Members of the British Conservative party ‘do not understand where the border is, who’s the Taoiseach, what the difference between Fine Gael and Sinn Féin are, there is a lack of understanding’ - @nealerichmond tells #twip #brexit 
Few people realise what the people behind the #Brexit coup want to do to this country.They intend to scrap regulations that protect workers & the environment & turn the UK into an tax haven run for the super-rich.And they cheated to get the result they wanted.#PeoplesVote
The reality of #Brexit is now sinking in fast. It can’t be delivered. That’s why we need another vote. The #PeoplesVote. Please RT @Jon_Danzig’s report on the urgent need for another vote on Brexit. Link:

With the #PeoplesVote campaign, British political debate on #Brexit is moving to a new phase. Namely, from buses to vans!Very important message, though. The Brexit deal influences all aspects of life in Britain. The people deserve a vote on such a major thing. 
.@CarolineLucas on why we’re calling for a #PeoplesPoll on the #Brexit deal  
More on Bannon’s #Brexit and how it was a foreign funded ‘Petri dish’ via Breitbart and #CambridgeAnalytica (from ‘Devil’s Bargain’ by @JoshuaGreen)
Chuka Umunna - I don't think that 650 politicians should be determining what we do on that(final deal) for 65 million people.. I think it's absolutely right that the people should have a #FinalSay on the #brexit deal. #PeoplesVote#StopBrexit #FBPE #marr  #bbcsp
EU (Withdrawal) Bill: Report stage in House of Lords begins on 18 April. The unelected House must respect #Brexit - out of the Customs Union and out of the Single Market. 
Whatever happened to respect for democracy? The 2016 #Brexit referendum was binding. 
Now we've established #CambridgeAnalytica did paid work, can we look at donations in kind. Steve Bannon was a friend and admirer of @Nigel_Farage from 2012. With Mercer's millions he created Breitbart and CA. Of course he was pushing for #Brexit. Key foreign influence. 
Patrick Stewart -The terms & conditions on the #Brexit separation are quite unlike the terms & conditions that were spoken of so loosely during the referendum campaign. Hence the call for a #PeoplesVote#StopBrexit #FBPE #marr  #bbcsp #FinalSay
Why do people still not understand - We pay more than we get back from the EU- They make more from trading with us than we do from them - They inflate prices of goods sold to UK consumers to prop up their industries - Stunt our trade with other countries#brexit
Sir Patrick Stewart  speaking more sense and offering more effective opposition on #Brexit than any party leader #marr #marrshow #WATON @SirPatStew
Patrick Stewart is right: we need a #PeoplesVote - not least because there is now a mountain of evidence that Vote Leave and other #Brexit campaigners cheated.#Marr
How can @FraserNelson have the audacity to say public opinion hasn't changed on #Brexit. He has the Sunday Mirror in front of him, which shows 52% support for a #PeoplesVote #Marr
A vote on "the final deal", e.g. in 2020, would be too late to stop #Brexit. We must stop EU withdrawal this year. #PeoplesVote
65% of Labour voters want a #PeoplesVote to allow the country to decide the fate of #Brexit. We must not let them down.  
Lying?Our entire EU membership is based on 50years of lies and deceit.People were sold a common market with no loss of sovereignty.What they got was a 45year coup d’etat of British sovereignty.Referenda on treaties were promised to win elections then denied.#Brexit #FBPE
EXCLUSIVE: "THE EU & THE MISSING €19 BILLION PER YEAR" - Only 86.7% of EU's 2016 spend went directly to member states.  What happened to the rest?  Read our #Brexit research & story:

So here's the proof - via @carolecadwalla - Bannon and Mercer's #CambridgeAnalytica were behind both Leave Campaigns during #Brexit. Foreign interference. And we haven't got to Putin yet!

Voted @UKLabour for thirty years but now joined @LibDems. Will not vote for them again unless their #brexit position changes.
What is also sad about #Brexit is the way it has shown that most MPs are deep down Remainers but they’re backing #Brexit because they think to do otherwise would harm their careers.Just #StopBrexit

So the news is full of talk about #Syria and missiles, with no room for #Brexit or @carolecadwalla investigations , which is convenient for the Government at this time.
It would take only one of these beasts of the #Brexit jungle to concede that the whole operation was a con to bring the #Brexit house of cards crashing down.Do it. @BorisJohnson @michaelgove
So while HMG is now busy making sure the Chemical Weapons Convention is respected, will it also be considering the Geneva Convention on Refugees while implementing this guy's #brexit agenda? 'Cause I think the two might be related. 
#SyriaStrikes reminds me why I voted for #Brexit. We have a government that does as it pleases, jumping on every bandwagon, chasing whichever harebrained scheme suits them, bypassing parliament when convenient and signing us up for things we never wanted.

I've been writing a lot about #Syria in the last few days, much very critical of self-styled antiwar campaigners. But the best way the UK can hit back at Putin is to scrap #Brexit. That would inflict a huge defeat on his hybrid war against the EU.#StopBrexit #FBPE #ABTV

If you think the public should have a say on the final #Brexit deal, we are taking signatures for the #peoplesvote outside #Streatham station until 1pm today. #peoplesvote

Watching May trying to claim the moral high ground through military action is sickening. The strike is a distraction from #Brexit and the domestic policy failings of her govt.
BREAKING NEWS: It is planned to form a new group ‘North Yorkshire for Europe’ in #Harrogate today after street campaigning as part of the nationwide Pro-European Day of Action! Be there at the very start of a new anti-#Brexit group. 11am-1pm at St Peter’s Church, Cambridge Rd. 
When he spoke our blood ran cold, we feared to leave home. Gangs of violent white youth ‘Paki bashing’ Black people had to step lightly in the streets. Police loved him too. They never failed to remind us. For some #Brexit supporters he’s the best PM they never had. #EnochPowell

Vote Leave allegedly broke referendum spending laws on an "industrial scale.'  Nigel Farage allegedly thanked Steve Bannon for #brexit. Cambridge analytica allegedly involved. This is all sounding very undemocratic. Brexit vote was a farce.
Putin is only one element in a loose ad hoc alliance involving among others Trump, Bannon, Mercer, Murdoch, Dacre, some of the ERG and the European far-right all aiming to weaken and undermine Western democracy.This alliance is our adversary. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Why should Scotland stay trapped inside a failing union when England is desperate to leave a successful one? #Brexit
Every day we move a step closer to the only people left believing #Brexit was anything but a Fraud being whack job conspiracists, Corbyn and the Tory Government.On 3rd May show your disgust and #abtv - Your country needs you!
That’s is horrendous. And it doesn’t surprise me because my friends and I got spit on our faces on the days after the #Brexit for speaking in Spanish too In Camden. And we got told to home

There's more chance of reviving Lenin with a defibrillator than there is of delivering #Brexit without damaging the economy, jobs and people's lives.
Fellow Remainers, ConLab won't give us a #FinalSay, so the May 3 local elections are likely to be our only chance to use our votes to show our opposition to #Brexit and that we Remainers are an electoral force that cannot be ignored. #VoteEU #StopBrexit #ABTV
The fact that LeaveEU are salivating at the thought of the BBC broadcasting the rivers of blood speech, tells you everything you need to know about their reason for supporting #Brexit.
Spent past 2 days in Zurich. Every single Swiss person I spoke to thought U.K. has gone collectively mad with #Brexit. Widespread puzzlement at how U.K. could spend 40 years in EU yet its ministers still don’t understand basics
It’s shocking historical ignorance like this which played a significant part in forming the delusions behind #Brexit.

The big push for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal is starting tomorrow. More than a hundred local groups will be campaigning outdoors. I'll be out in #Edinburgh - where will you be? (Bonus question: Will @BBCNews choose to cover this?) #FBPE
So six months AFTER #Brexit and one month after Trump won, the alleged “whistleblower” is eating venison with Nix and Bannon at the @Conservatives flagship private club in London?Our definitions of “whistleblowing” must be widely different, to quote Lady Bracknell cc @WikiGuido

Look on the bright side.The Jaguar Land Rover factory now closing down due to #brexit will make the prefectly sized venue to host the upcoming "Brexit Museum of Sovereignity".Its yet another fabulous "Brexit Boost" we can all be proud of.
Lack of #brexit preparedness will not fly: new notice on various aviation rules & certificates published earlier today. 
Lots of facts have emerged since the referendum showing #Brexit isn’t all it was cracked up to be. Here are 11 new facts which mean we need a People’s Vote on the deal.
 The agenda for next week’s round of #Brexit negotiations @EU_Commission is now available on our site: 1) Withdrawal Agreement, 2) Ireland/Northern Ireland, 3) framework for future relationship

The UK is the largest book exporter in the world, with total sales of over £4.7billion a year. 30,000 people are employed in book publishing - the loss of tariff-free access to the EU after #Brexit puts thousands of jobs and £billions in sales at risk:
Kate Andrews - "There are going to be a lot of Remainers in particular who are absolutely dumfounded in March 2019, when the UK does leave the EU and it doesn’t fall off a cliff." #Brexit 
"Nearly 20 banks have committed to launching new European Union hubs in Frankfurt since the #Brexit vote, according to German officials."
#JeremyCorbyn is supposedly leader of the opposition, he can make a decision to oppose #Brexit and he would have the support of at least 16 million voters. He has a real opportunity to help achieve #StopBrexit. if he doesn't he definitely won't be able to afford his bus passes
No kind of #Brexit is acceptable to me.

According to the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, 11% of manufacturing firms say that they have lost contracts due to #Brexit, whilst 46% have already increased prices to cope with extra costs linked to the #Brexit vote.
Whatever your views on #Brexit, no one would disagree that it's a big deal. It is too important for politicians alone to decide. Demand a vote on the final Brexit deal.RT if you agree!

Two good things from this (1) the initiative of a pro-Eu Londoner travelling to a #brexit region to listen, learn and persuade. 2) video of a #leave voter explaining how he did not realise brexit would effect Eastern Europeans (that add much to his community) & his change of mind

Dear @jeremycorbyn, thanks but I don't want a free bus pass. I want YOU to #StopBrexit. If we stop #Brexit damaging the economy, young people will be able to find jobs and pay for their own bus passes and YOU might be able to some of your outlandish policies. Best, @EUsupergirl
It's nice to hear @bbcworldservice reporting on the government's BS suggestion of a "Green #Brexit"... Even though the National programming probably won't cover it. #GreenBrexit is likely to be as successful #MichaelGove's policies as Education Secretary. #StopBrexit

Remember that #Brexit vote in the UK? The one that Cambridge Analytica and the Russians interfered in?Many groups are now coordinating to halt the progress of Britain's leaving the EU.
The only kind of #Brexit we're going to get is a shit coloured one.
Listen to the "Boos" from audience members when a 2nd vote on the #brexit deal is suggestedWhy on earth would any rational person say "no, I demand to *not* have my opinion heard.  I insist the government does what it likes without any input from me"This is bonkers 
Kate Andrews did her happy-clappy *#Brexit is gonna be great* act on #bbcqt again, admitting we'll lose benefits, but saying new opportunities would compensate - which ALL studies say they won't. A Brexit *expert* completely incapable of distinguishing possibility & probability.
Is there a mouthy lefty out there who can explain to me why the left, who hate big business and corporate interests support the EU? It seems to me its just because the right dont want to be a part of it. Please enlighten me #Brexit
Guardian position on #Brexit as explained on #bbcqtWe voted to leave the EU but not it's institutions.Beyond help.
The UK is a small island off the coast of Europe, from which it will finally detach itself in March 2019 #BrexitAny power & influence it may retain is derived from being a permanent member of the Security Council #TridentSo the PM is now going to send our planes to bomb Syria !

EU citizens have until 17 April to register for the #LocalElections2018 and voice their opposition to #brexit . Its time for a #finalsay and to #exitfrombrexit
Most people just have Good Friday and Easter Monday off at Easter.Not our MPs.They have TWO WEEKS off...not two days.In 2016/17 MPs were NOT sitting for 223 days.Or 61% of the year.Then MPs complain they don't have time to get #Brexit through !!!
Interesting and encouraging that despite #Brexit the Chinese are looking to strengthen their European stock exchange liberalisation via LONDON. Not Paris Dublin Frankfurt Luxembourg Amsterdam or any EU base. 
#ABTV #EURVote2018 - check this out if you need to believe this can be done. 6.5 million people voted tactically in #GE2018 - if we do that in the #LE2018 - we will send a clear #stopbrexit message  Don't vote Labour or Tory - they are #brexit parties

#Brexit reality strikes: "the US Chamber of Commerce has warned that much investment in Britain was made “so companies could seamlessly access the much larger EU single market”."  
Enoch Powell's "Rivers of Blood" speech had an impact similar to the toxic anti-immigrant rhetoric used by some Brexiters ahead of the #Brexit referendum, and Powell is a hero to the extreme right.Why does @BBC think it good idea to resurrect this poisonous diatribe now?
No, Sir Bill Cash, they are not "completely defying the British people". Only 26% of Brits voted for #Brexit, an unknown entity in itself, and that's after they were lied to and subjected to unauthorized psychological warfare operations. #StopBrexit
Next week @UKHouseofLords vote on the #withdrawalbill. This is our last chance to save the Charter of Fundamental Rights and stop ministers changing laws without proper parliamentary scrutiny after #Brexit. Here's why the Lords must add a #PeoplesClause to the Bill:
#Health community comes together in call to British Parliament: #Brexit must not endanger #PublicHealth#DoNoHarm amendment must be included in #EUWithdrawalBill  @FPH @JohnMiddleton
What on earth are the BBC doing recreating this hate speech and broadcasting it.  Sorry, I forgot the BBC are the mouthpiece of the far right these days, so no surprise they want to stir up more anti-foreigner feelings, as if #Brexit hadn't done enough damage already. 
FM @HeikoMaas after meeting @BorisJohnson: discussed status of negotiations on #Brexit and the implications for our bilateral relations. We need the UK a key partner for the future. @GermanyonBrexit @foreignoffice

Don’t be fooled; #Brexit will not be a clean break from the EU. #52brexitfacts : The UK Government is already working on 313 different programmes to implement Brexit, according to the National Audit Office #52brexitfacts
I think this whole poisoning farce is being played out to bury #Brexit It was clear Remainers would stoop as low as it takes to derail it while agreeing a deal that would undermine the whole process. Now the external threat has been created and leaving the EU looks dangerous.
The local elections are three weeks away. Let's use them as an opportunity to pass a verdict on this Government's AWFUL handling of #Brexit.The deadline to register to vote is TUESDAY 17th APRIL.Make sure your voice is heard!  #FFS
If we were to stay in and reform the EU instead of leaving, my first reform proposal would be to replace our MEPs with a single potato in that it will have a better understanding of the system works, a higher IQ - and cost substantially less. #Brexit

For a start it's not "Nicola Sturgeon's #Brexit bill" It was passed by the Scottish Parliament 95 votes to 32 with all parties supporting apart from the Tories + 1 LibDem. #continuitybill

People are starting to realise the impacts of #Brexit, with large numbers moving to mainland Europe. Surely the gvt. can’t sit by and pursue this damaging cause. They must grant the public a vote on the final deal with a chance to #ExitFromBrexit
Britain's parliament could block #Brexit divorce bill: Brexit minister David Davis 
Britain's economy - based on the hard working people of our great country - continues to boom. With a clean #Brexit our economic and global ambitions will take us even further! 
With the left going further to the left & the right lurching to the right - it is time for common sense politics in the UK. Both the @Conservatives& @UKLabour are adamant to deliver #Brexit come what may - whatever the costs!RT if you agree.

It is unacceptable that British nationals working and living on the continent are completely in the dark over their post-#Brexit status. Time for @theresa_may to provide some clarity for once.
The @europeangreens are meeting today in Brussels. Glad to meet up with my celtic cousins @patrickharvie & @Amelia_Womack and discuss the ongoing madness within British #Brexit politics. 
Some people say we shouldn't make #Brexit an issue in #LE2018. They are wrong. Brexit in any form will reduce local authority funding, just as it will adversely impact all government services including the #NHS and policing. #StopBrexit #ABTV #VoteEU
The EU are obviously worried that a truly global Britain will create a situation where we will not only undermine their Single Market but more importantly bring in to question their protectionist regime.Oh well We voted to Leave, not Leave with restrictive caveats.#Brexit 
Thorough (and damning) report from @friends_earth outlining how #Brexit will be a disaster for our environment. Make no mistake, protections are going to be torn up!  
IMPORTANT:July 2017: Asked to consider a system used in some EU countries where EU migrants are sent home if they don't find work, 55% of leave voters said they would be satisfied with this, versus only 25% who would be unhappy. #StopBrexit #Brexit #ABTV
They promised that #Brexit was about taking back control. Today, many of those Brexiteers are sitting around the Cabinet table plotting to bomb Syria without a vote at Westminister - all they were after was more power from themselves! 
I am dealing with #Brexit  by doing the right thing and stopping it. Because it wasn't just me who lost on 23rd June 2016... The whole country lost. And we will continue to lose until we #StopBrexit
In today's #Brexit news:- Nissan pulling out of Sunderland- Airbus pulling out of UK (16k+96k jobs)- UK fishing stocks to continue to be sold to foreign companies as happens now because it's a UK policy not an EU policyAny good news I can announce? #FBPE
Her record on #Brexit has demostrated beyond any doubt - that she holds Parliament in contempt !She probably suspects she will lose the vote #Syria - which is why her preference is to invoke the #CrownPrerogative
A great thread here from a #Brexit leave voter who has changed his position but explains the reasons for voting the way he did in 2016.  It takes great courage to stand up and admit to making a mistake.  If only politicians had a backbone made from the same material. 
Why does England have increasing rape, knife and acid attacks?Because They opened their borders to 3rd World Low IQ 7th Century...Pssst...but you can’t talk about it or you’ll be banned! #Brexit #Now
#Britain once had real leaders we could be proud of like Sir #WinstonChurchill. How far we have fallen! Now we have the Pathetically Weak @theresa_may enemy of #Brexit & the British people!  #BBC #LBC @LBC #SKY #EU @Conservatives @ConHome #ConservativeParty
2 years ago I was a totally 100% supporter of the BBC licence fee, didn’t consider any alternative. Now I would have to think about it, with the negative arguments - don’t make Murdoch happy - having to do more work as a determining factor. #Brexit is destroying a lot of things.
Expected growth of 0.2% for February turns into 0.2% decline. The NIESR says growth is set to fall to 0.2% in the first quarter of 2018 from 0.4% in the final three months of last year.Bad weather and/or #Brexit?#StopBrexit #ABTV #VoteEU
Thank you to @Lambeth4Europe @Open_BritainCP for organising an excellent meeting on #Brexit this evening & to everyone who came for sharing your passionate views

#Brexit is what a frightened man thinks courage looks like.#Trump is what a weak man thinks strength looks like.
Interesting....#brexit #FBPE
Paradox that #Brexit could unlock a deeper #trade deal between the EU and India, previously held up by UK government’s positions. Yet govt thinks it could do better separately!
Some encouraging news. Labour has asked 21 questions of 80,000. The most positive result is that 82% want a further referendum on #Brexit. 39% want it abandoned.The other news is that US & UK lawyers are starting a class-action lawsuit against Facebook & Cambridge Analytica.
„I’m deeply saddened that within a year Britain is going to be demoted to being a tiny little island floating around in the North Sea...“ #Brexit 
DD says he thinks he now knows what  90% of the #Brexit deal will be.  Same way he knew what his invisible impact assessments would show & how the fantasy £365m promised per week would save the #NHS. He doesn’t even know what 90% of the NI border deal will be. #FBPE
This is absolutely true. Although Airbus CEO has been totally forthright today, many firms tell us privately how dire #Brexit is but don’t state publicly cos fear a) govt ire b) drop in share price c) loss of workers if they think company at risk.So conspiracy of #Brexit silence 
Can't recommend this article enough by @GKBhambra on '#Brexit, #Trump, and ‘methodological whiteness’: on the misrecognition of #race and #class' #MustRead

Yes, there will be political chaos when #Brexit is cancelled, but it will be nothing compared to the political AND economic chaos if it is allowed to continueYou can't defeat the beast by feeding it - Brexit will empower the nativist extremes of both parties. It must be stopped 
We all knew this before we voted. #Brexit is so embarrassing and a monumental British f**k up. I blame our polarised media (especially #BBC, #bbcqt, #bbcradio4) and all those lying politicians. Bizarre so many public seem good with all this s**t.
Has anyone found a #Brexit benefit yet, apart from less tax for millionaires?
A warm welcome to Irish colleague @simoncoveney here in NL. Had good talks about our excellent bilateral relations. Repeated that we support Ireland in the #brexit negotiations and that we look forward to more realism from the UK. 
The ambassador was heckled and laughed at. And rightly so. #brexit is a disaster and the @Conservatives are a shambles! #StopBrexit2018#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Important article by @IanDunt warning that the nationalist authoritarianism and political intolerance taking hold of Hungary is also a growing threat to liberal democracy in #Brexit Britain#StopBrexit #FBPE
#BoatyMcBoatface proves a vote can be overruled, if Govt so chooses. The *will of the people* is not sacrosanct, as Tories, wearing their best #Brexit-McBrexity-Face expressions, pretend.Besides, #Brexit is NOT the will of the people, since only 37% of electorate voted for it.

Agree with this. No one is challenging the Governments position on #Brexit not the tabloid press, the Labour Party or the BBC. The public is being sleep walked to a disaster #Brexit #BrexitBroadcastingCorporation
Where are these post #Brexit trade deals? I tell the @bbcasiannetwork about my experience with the @Conservatives & that countries such as India have already slammed the door on our face - until we deal with our immigration policy with them we cannot expect any trade deal.
Andrew is absolutely right about this. It is a breach of the BBC’s duty of “due impartiality” to report #Brexit as a done deal. 
What mustn't be allowed to EVER happen again is the legal restriction of a future UK Govt chosen democratically by UK citizens to alter/change/abolish or introduce new UK laws currently existing within UK law. Any future UK Govt cannot be tied legally to maintain EU laws #brexit 
If you think the Irish border is a complex #Brexit issue wait till these incompetent nobs in charge have to confront the issues of a Scottish border.

So. #Brexit has slipped out of the headlines - but like two prizefighters, both sides are setting themselves for the fight to come. Some of the battles are EU v EU, some UK v UK. So what's going on? Here's a quick overview from what I know. 1/thread
"You might want to check your facts about politics in Ireland' - a journalist challenges UK Brexit secretary @DavidDavisMP about claims the Irish Government’s stance on #Brexit is influenced by @sinnfeinireland at a @McChrystalGroup event in @thetimes offices in London this week
"EU want to make UK sign guarantee it won’t slash environmental regulations after #Brexit" We should tell EU to take a running jumpOnce we have our freedom back WE will decide what regulations we wantWe are not going to be dictated to by the EU any more
With all the #Brexit uncertainty around the anniversary of The Good Friday Agreement here's my essay on the #NorthernIreland border, borders in #Belfast & the borders that exist in our minds. Written for @WritersCentre #GFA20
Hey @DExEUgov your problems are over, it does exist after all and only costs £1.99 at Smiths! #Brexit #sunlituplands
Norbert Röttgen Chair of the Foreign Affair Committee in the German Parliament -  The British Government has "no clue" on how to manage the "illogical impossibility"of #Brexit. #FBPE #StopBrexit
For years, the Tory right have lied to you about the EU - using newspapers & mediat to perpetuate the lies & blame their mistakes on the EU. Find out what these lies will do to our country! Then #stopbrexit & we'll be able to afford more police. ABTV don't vote #brexit in #LE2018
Peter Crosskey (former ed, The Grocer) on #Brexit. "The food industry is in no position to deal with this. It has spent the last two decades establishing a just-in-time procurement system which relies on minimal bureaucracy and little use of storage."
The biggest deficit in the UK right now is the deficit of understanding of Leave supporters of the consequences of #Brexit
So if SCL/#CambridgeAnalytica worked on Putin's election, and then #Brexit and #Trump, that might explain why the Russian bots amped the same topics and misinformation in the UK and US, and - as Zuckerberg suggested yesterday - with the same microtargeting on @facebook
In order to understand what is going on with #Brexit, here are two key tips:1. always believe the opposite of what #DavidDavis says;2. read the foreign media. #brexitreality
Sat there silently... biding her time... Aaaaaany minute now something positive will come from #Brexit and I can spring into action... Aaaaaaaany minute now. I'm afraid she's in for a looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong wait.
EU citizens! Top European Tony Blair has once again shown us the way forward. You do need a vote in Parliament and another referendum on #Brexit. However, you can bomb Syria to your heart's content on a whim. Once again he is our moral compass in dark times. #IAmEuropean
Norwegian seafood chief joins cluster call for seamless trade post Brexit on visit to @GyFishMarket  #Grimsby #Brexit 
The tories own #Brexit, nobody else, they've rubber stamped a non binding vote for reasons of ideology, so to now blame @sinnfeinireland who've been telling them for months about the border issue is dangerous incompetence from David Davis, damn the @Conservatives #ToriesOut.

#Remain supporters have been warning #Brexit will lead to a loss of Rights for over a year but not once has the media exposed it. A crucial Right we lose is that of taking our Govt to the ECJ if it removes Rights! And Corbyn & Labour back the #BrexitShambles. #FairVote #ABTV.
One of the primary motivations for Murdoch's long, hysterical pro-#Brexit campaign in his UK media was to avoid a day like this, and being held to account in this way. It's a beautiful thing. 
The obvious reply to the #Brexit vote would have been to debate how to get more workers into politics, which institutions to move out of London & how to reform immigration. But all we've talked about is what London wants .. what the City wants .. what financial services want
The European Commission has raided Rupert Murdoch's Fox headquarters in London. The tiny proportion of UK national income that goes to the EU looks more worthwhile by the day. #Brexit

Sinn Fein exercises absolutely no influence over the Irish Government. David Davis is clearly mistaken here. #Brexit 
Many of us in Europe are keen to understand how Britain was targeted by Facebook ads during the #Brexit vote. The backers of the Vote Leave Campaign own companies which harvest data & worked with Others. Sounds like corruption of democracy on a massive scale. #ZUCKERBURG
At the last General Election, Remainers voted tactically to lend their vote to Labour to prevent Theresa May having a mandate for her hard #Brexit. That has been misconstrued by Labour as support for Lexit/Brexit. Remainers will not lend their vote to Labour again #LE2018 #ABTV
“What we did not imagine 20 years ago was that the pursuit of a pure identity would return as a governing project – not in Northern Ireland, but in England...It seemed..that we had all gone beyond thinking that people could belong to only one thing.” #GFA20 #Brexit 
#Brexit is 'one of the saddest moments' in recent European history, president of European Council says 
I haven't tweeted about the threat that #Brexit poses to the #GoodFridayAgreement  because each time I think about it, I cry and become so angry that people can throw away a world shattering piece of hard work on the temple of a sordid piece of self serving hatred.
The wonderful @Suewilson91 bossing it like a pro in the #europeanparliament  sir Andrew Cook telling us we have to accept the vote, Sue from @BremainInSpain responds by saying "I will never accept #Brexit"

Why is the Government still pushing for #Brexit when their own leaked impact analysis shows that leaving the Single Market means the UK will need to find an additional £55bn in borrowing by 2033? #52brexitfacts
Pathetic that .@DavidDavisMP should blame the Irish for the lack of any solution to the Irish border #Brexit problem. He should talk to fellow Brexiter, Theresa Villiers MP, ex Sec of State for NI, I am sure she will have the answer.
Now that Yulia Skripal is up and running round like a champ I must pay tribute to the NHS in the UK. Despite austerity cuts they managed to cure a nerve agent 10 times more deadly than Sarin. A simply marvellous service. Our EU citizens will really miss it after #Brexit.
Really worrying to hear that, according to the Office for National Statistics, household spending slowed to its lowest annual growth for six years in 2017 amid #Brexit-fuelled inflation, with borrowing surging and family savings slumping to a record low.

It's obvious to everyone apart from the Labour frontbench that the only way to secure the "exact same benefits" of the Single Market is to remain in the Single Market. #Brexit 
Owen is sacked for sensibly saying we should stay in #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion Barry parrots hard Tory right on Good Friday Agreement & fears of a hard border & rubbishes Labour’s whole #Brexit policy & isn’t? Weird.
This downplaying of Good Friday Agreement and suggestion of reintroducing border is truly alarming. #Brexit was not about jeopardising peace on island of Ireland. Yet somehow it is becoming an acceptable sacrifice. UK unity is precious, not negotiable 
Labour opposing #Brexit wouldn't mean Brexit would be stopped, but it would mean there would a strong chance of stopping Brexit. While Corbyn leads Labour and supports Brexit there is no hope whatsoever.#ABTV #StopBrexit #VoteEU
#BarryGardiner, on #Brexit, saying what the rest of the country is thinking. 
One year to go and the the #Brexit project has already completely and utterly failed. The government could still call a halt in the face of this damning evidence.....but it won't because May and her cronies are interested only in theit next pay cheque. 
Funny how no #Corbyn fans are calling for #BarryGardiner to go for 'undermining the leader' All #OwenSmith did was back a vote on the final #Brexit deal, which most #Labour members want yet they hounded himOf course Gardiner has never criticised St Jeremy so...
For those who do not remember, or choose not to remember... this is not Syria, this is London 1993. You can not have both #Brexit and #GoodFridayAgreement

Quite right too. How dare the BBC effectively decide that the views of more than half the country that wishes to #Remain no longer count? It's astonishing how low #Brexit has brought many of our most valuable institutions, including the BBC. @BBCNews #StopBrexit

The best way of getting rid of the Tories is to get rid of Brexit as fast as possible, it would utterly shatter the Tory party, it would be defeated, broken and ripped apart by bitter internal conflicts. But Corbyn ain't helping!#StopBrexit #ABTV #VoteEU #Brexit
I've wrecked the UK Economy, Lost AAA Rating, Caused Race Hatred, and now off to live in France on my £75,000 a year EU pension ... Thanks #brexit Idiots 
#PCPEU people - Corbyn backs #Brexit, and as long as he does so and remains Labour leader Brexit will happen. So if you back Corbyn you're backing Brexit. And if you're doing that you're a Brexiter. Please be honest with yourselves and stop trying to have your cake and eat it.
20 years since Good Friday Agreement was concluded. These 20 years show, what a difference #GFA made for peace in the region! We all know: #Brexit negotiations have to take this into account. High stakes, high responsibility.
Here's Churchill reiterating Burke's exposition of the duties of an MP. Most of our current crop of MPs are systematically failing to carry out that duty, instead they're hiding behind the totalitarian slogan of the "will of the people"!#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
The Good Friday Agreement has allowed hope and stability to eclipse decades of violence and division. Twenty years on, nothing must be allowed to undermine it; the people of the island of Ireland can count on the Parliament's full support in protecting its achievements. #Brexit
Why is the Traitor Blair given so much time on MSMHe’s on Sky now.He should be doing prison time not trying to stop the Democratic process of #Brexit.This man is completely mad if he thinks anyone in the UKListens to his opinions.
Dutch finance minister Hoekstra - #Brexit is a tragedy & not in the interests of the EU or the UK... it's going to be the middle class that pay the bill & not Boris Johnson... if there was any way to avoid brexit I would love to but the UK are determined to push on with it#FBPE
Great to meet up with @lara_spirit and @Femi_Sorry on their visit to the European Parliament to hear from MEPs about their reactions to #Brexit@OFOCBrexit giving hope to those who understand the urgent need to #StopBrexit
Credit Suisse #Brexit report: "The takeaway here is that if your priority is economic growth and low unemployment, then everything UKIP and the Conservatives have been saying about immigration has turned out to be totally wrong."  
Quite right too. Enjoyed being present in court at #ECJ when the AG delivered this Opinion. A shame that UK Govt, Home Office & Brexiteers find these quite reasonable rules re rights of #EU citizens & their families & partners so hard to stomach #FBPE #Brexit 
So Tony Blair wants to get Angela Merkel to help him reverse Brexit.A man with a proven track record of being on the right side of history...#ERM #Euro #IraqWar #Brexit #TonyBlair
I’m sharing #52brexitfacts , revealing just how much damage it’s already caused and we haven’t even left the EU yet. #Brexit has already cost us more than £200m a week in lost growth, according to the Governor of @bankofengland.
Stand by for #BBC @BBCr4today to find a #Brexit artist as #TraceyEmin announces her new installation #StPancras #IWantMyTimeWithYou is pro #Remain (amongst other things)
The fact that public opinion is changing on #Brexit is why “the fanatical #Brexiters seem prepared to see their ‘red lines’ scratched out one by one in order to achieve their ultimate goal, which is Brexit at any cost” says @williamkeegan :
I remember the Troubles, the bombing campaign on mainland Britain. ANY MP who wants to set at nought the GFA  to get #Brexit through is denying the right to live in peace of the next generation 
20 years on from the Good Friday Agreement, we must not take for granted the peace achieved. A hard border would represent division and damage British/Irish relations. #Brexit cannot be allowed to undermine peace and there can be no return to a hard border. @fiannafailparty
In an open letter, Mandelson, Reid, Murphy, Hain & Woodward urged the Government to put peace in Northern Ireland “above its desire to have #Brexit at any cost”They said ministers should leave open the option of remaining in the EU SM & CU#FBPE 
David Davis is being deliberately disingenuous here. Anybody with slightest knowledge of Ireland knows his claim about Sinn Fein is unfounded. Actually, absurd. Almost like he is preparing for the Blame Game when inevitable collapse in #Brexit talks comes.

May goes and talks to Løkke. And Løkke tells her what Barnier and everyone else has been telling her and the UK for months, or years even.    #Brexit 
Between this, the comments by Barry Gardiner & lack of UK proposals in Brussels. Monday really has been a bizarre day for the Omni shambles that is #Brexit 
Clear implication: Britain's hostility to immigration ( of which #Brexit  Is the most obvious  expression) will actually hold it back economically ...Credit Suisse demographic report: 'a serious future challenge to the UK’s financial sustainability'... 
I expect this from militant brexiteers but not a Labour front bencher. Does he think Hugh Orde, George Mitchell,  George Hamilton, the PSNI & AGS are “playing it up”? Highly irresponsible. #brexit #gfa
Throughout the #Brexit negotiations @BarryGardiner has demonstrated an especially poor grasp of EU structures and what is at stake for Britain. His comments on Ireland are truly appalling. Untrue and dangerous.
Traveling on business in Hungary. These things I took for granted will be mine no longer in a few years if we don't stop #Brexit. #StopBrexit
A vote for the #tories is a vote for #Brexit. A vote for #Labour is a vote for Brexit. A vote for Brexit is a vote for a poorer, less welcoming, xenophobic, meaner, inward looking UK. It is a vote to destroy the #NHS and our children's futures.#StopBrexit#FBPE#ABTV

Yet the vast majority of voting Hungarians voted for him. What's your message to them Chuka? Is there something wrong with them in your view? Exactly why Labour can't be trusted to build bridges post #Brexit 
I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate #ViktorOrban on his victory in the Hungarian General Election. Now he can now start to organise an even stronger opposition to the EU  #hungaryelections #TurningRight #NigelFarage #Brexit 
Nigel Farage - "The Government has said that when we leave the EU on March 29 next year, nothing changes for at least 21 months."The fishing industry and coastal communities who voted overwhelmingly for #Brexit feel very badly let down." 
"For a long time (what we got for our data)...seemed worth it. Then came the #Trump campaign, #Brexit, a resurgence of far-right #extremism across Europe and the United States, and the widespread inability to distinguish information from disinformation..."
Nigel Farage - "80% of the British economy that has been bound - in some cases by EU rules that aren’t appropriate - we are about to give the small man and the small woman of this country a big break." #Brexit 
Dear @ConservativesIt doesn’t matter how much soft focus you put on Theresa May in your party political broadcasts, it’s crystal clear to most people that the country is in a dreadful state after 8 years of Tory nonsense.#Brexit #NHS #Austerity #HateCrime #Xenophobia

Some argue Thatcher was pro-EU, but here is a speech she gave in 1995 setting out why a free, independent Britain is not compatible with a federalist, super-state EU. Juncker and Barnier wouldn't stand a chance if she were negotiating for Britain! #Brexit

Nobody buys or sells a house unless it’s ‘Subject to Contract’ Nobody goes ahead if the survey reveals serious problems #Brexit should be no different. If the final Brexit deal turns out to be terrible, we should be able to say ‘No!’ See all our posters at 
Anyone who thinks that by voting against Labour in May's Local Elections to try to alter #Brexit is just harming vulnerable people b/c this won't prevent the pattern of withdrawal from Europe -only coming up with a New Deal for the people will and Remain won't ever do that.

Remainers call people who object to Britain staying in the EU Little Englanders. Well, Little Europeans sounds even worse in relation to Remainers because it implies betrayal of you own country for the sake of some sick federal project. #Brexit
Important thread. I've long noted the lack of female commentators on #Brexit. It's ugly the way the few prominent women are attacked by Leave men - including very well known figures! Check it out yourself. Yet again, the values around #Brexit disturb me. Bode ill.

.@BBCradio4 doing a feature on #Brexit and the #IrishBorder Claiming that "Brexit is a bittersweet moment" which will lead to great opportunities for some business.This "impartiality" really is utter BS.
More people turned out to protest against #brexit on 24 March 2018 than all working fishermen in the UK. Yet @bbcnews reports the fishermen + did't report the marches of the 52%. What kind of democracy do we live in? Shame on #BrexitBroadcastingCorporation + our trash tabloids
The average IQ of boys in England has dropped 15 points! Why?1. High IQ Upper Classes having fewer children. 2. Importing Large numbers of 3rd World Lower IQ boys to replace them. 3. Result: 85 IQ Population cannot sustain democracy. #Brexit H/T @StefanMolyneux
Does anybody get this yet? #CambridgeAnalytica is a military grade 'information operation'Along with AIQ, during #Brexit and #Trump, they automated billions of fake events (not ads/not declared campaigns/events) to change the minds of key swing voters.
Hot take from #OwenJones  and the Guardian: Hungary is killing democracy by holding elections, and then implementing the will of the people. If only #Brexit was that simple. #HungaryElection2018
Electing the Tories has been the "will of the people" in many elections yet Labour always opposed them.Apparently Brexit is the "will of the people" and will hurt the working classes the most, but Labour don't oppose this.I don't get it. #FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
This is an important piece from @DMiliband. When Britain voted (narrowly) for #Brexit, the world was very different (i.e., pre-#Trump). The people of Britain should get to vote on the final deal in the context of this very different world.
This is the kind of toxic racism Steve Bannon and @BreitbartNews patron Robert Mercer spread to swing voters. Bannon and Mercer co-founded #CambridgeAnalytica to boost hatred and fear. It worked during #Brexit too. We need to rescue our democracy from this demagoguery 
I agree with every word Roy Hattersley says here - #Labour is in danger of being in opposition for a very long time & #Corbyn should be putting his own views on #Brexit to one side & listening to party members
Why #Brexit is illegal: Please widely RT this poster and accompanying report of news about legal action against #UKGov on the #Article50 notice being invalid. Link:  Because Brexit is a sham.

Very stylish, @Andrew_Adonis, and needed to be said.If the BBC can’t or won’t do its duty under its charter, and continues to present right-wing fringe lunatics as authorities, we should divert some of the licence fee to impartial news services like @Channel4News.#brexit 
Definitely the funniest development in the #Brexit debate is the remain-o-mongs convincing themselves the BBC is pro-leave.
The torrent of #Brexit lies is undermining our democracy. When voters cannot distinguish truth from falsity, reasons and facts lose their power to persuade and people sink into confused apathy or descend into the manipulable politics of emotions and prejudice. #JailTheLeaveLiars
The investigation into #CambridgeAnalytica is tugging at a loose thread that is connected to the very fabric of our society. This scandal isn't about #Facebook, #Trump, #Brexit etc. It is about the way corporate power subverts our democracy to its own ends pic.twitter.com/8yxqjipO2N

As a consequence of Brexit, UK will no longer participate in work of EU agencies. I welcome European Chemicals Agency's #Brexit preparedness work. @EU_ECHA in Helsinki fulfills important regulatory functions for single market and a key role for environment & health protection.

#Brexit was a ground-breaking exercise in control & manipulation of an electorate, under the guise of a free & fair referendum. The masses believe it was entirely democratic in nature; those in power know otherwise, and attack anyone who questions it as 'enemies of democracy'.
Always worth looking overseas to gain an objective assessment of #Brexit >>"On the other side of the English Channel, Ms. May’s upbeat message met with near-total incomprehension. British nationalists have failed to win over European public opinion." 
I think most people know this. But if it is upheld, will the govt respect the rule of law? If there is an attempt to repeal the 2011 act will it be a free vote (like 2016) or whipped? And, importantly, what would the @UKLabour whip be? #StopBrexit #Brexit

Now that I have LITERALLY shown you what @BBCNews have been missing for the last 21 months will you please reflect on @BBCR4feedback and start to provide fair and impartial coverage of our campaignYou are directly accountable for the public perception of #BrexitAct responsibly 
GALLOWAY: Blair’s still calling the shots, we’re heading towards #Brexit in name only #Blair
Why does the BBC think that #Brexit is a done deal and keep referring to #Remainers as remoaners. More than half the country don't want it. Using derogatory terms is peurileI do wonder if they had to compete for funding, whether they would simply shrivel and wither on the vine.
Anybody else looking forward to hormone-treated beef madras or spicey-chlorinated chicken burgers from Wetherspoons after #Brexit ? 
Fear is what we #remainers feel about #Brexit Fear is what #leavers feel about the way it is being handled by the governmentNo one is getting what they wanted, so why not remove #fear from ALL of us and #StopBrexit?#StopBrexitSaveBritain #ABTV #WATON #FBPE #follow5001
Public opinion on #Brexit is shifting, albeit slowly. But let’s not be complacent. There is still a lot of work to do to build a decisive majority for #Remain ahead of any #FinalSay. Keep up the good work! #FBPE #FinalSayForAll

I remember the poverty of my youth and now kids in 2018 are living it b/c of the Tories. So, don't tell me, we are going to get the same with Jeremy Corbyn if #Brexit goes through b/c all you are doing are making bairns starve today by not voting Labour. 
Me for @guardianopinion. Please read and share. #Brexit 
Fish merchant tells @BBCWorldatOne that fishing in Cornwall has seen a revival since 1970s ( i.e while UK in EU) & that ‘Cornish sardines’ (EU ‘geog indicator’ for pilchards) are being exportedCounterweight to normal ‘#Brexit celeb’ fisheries story (not that that point was made)
Applies to #Brexit, too.There is no known model that indicates that #Brexit will be a win for the UK.#TheresaMay & #JeremyCorbyn know this. They've seen the data,the analysis and the forecasts.What's their responsibility to the nation..its standing & future?#BankHolidayMonday
George Galloway (GG) doubts that Theresa May's #Brexit deal will get through Parliament, sparking either a 2nd EU Election or a General Election:GG is on Talk Radio - Evenings 7-10pm #BrexitReality#Remain#BestOfBritish with GG on Talk Radio
It's about that time, time to implement the will & LEAVE the EU. #Brexit 
#Brexit retraction in the @Guardian yesterday of Chris Wylie’s lies about Aggregate IQ. Paper admits “It did not coordinate with #CambridgeAnalytica” “did not exploit Facebook data” (!!!) “is not involved in #CambridgeAnalytica alleged wrongdoing”. The Guardian’s own words.
A group of #French kids join our protest on #EUsuperheroday @no10vigil outside Downing Street and tell #TheresaMay what they think of #Brexit"Brexit sucks! We need to be united"Then they all shout:"ARRETEZ LE #BREXIT!"Solidarity with the European youth! #WeAreEuropean#FBPE pic.twitter.com/hBs4swxG7H
The Tories are using the term "will of the people" in a very similar way to Goebbels after a Nazi referendum victory in 1933. #StopBrexit #VoteEU #ABTV #Brexit 
My sources with links to UK intelligence, and these are senior sources, have NEVER MENTIONED Aggregate IQ as being a concern. They know Russian bots and memes targeted and threw #Brexit. Wylie is leaving Russia out of the conversation - as you’d expect from a Snowden fanboy! End.
Let’s be clear what you are NOT talking. Smoke, fire, boring distractions about alleged coordination between groups with the same aim, #Brexit - are you hearing ONE WORD ABOUT RUSSIAN INTERFERENCE? NO. 
Ask yourselves why Russia Today is promoting this “whistleblower” the liar Wylie who said he “wasn’t accusing Nix and #CambridgeAnalytica of colluding with Russia” - it’s all an attempt to exculpate Russia from #Brexit 
#Brexit was indeed interfered with by Russian targeted, Russian created  bots and propaganda. This is a massive distraction that has not mentioned that ONCE. Instead, a proven liar who retweets Ed @Snowden, Chris Wylie, who tried to work for Leave, is deflecting over legal AIQ
Worth following. I don’t condone the language (& tone is sometimes way OTT)  but he tweets from a position of knowledge & experience. His arguments on #Brexit are spot on. Govt must listen to British business - if they do by whatever name it’s #CustomsUnion #SingleMarket #EFTA
So @jeremycorbyn claims to be 'for the many not the few' yet his Brexit strategy is clearly for the few and not the many. Nearly 80% of Labour voters do not want #Brexit. #fbpe #labour #brexitshambles
John Redwood: EU gets it, and decides to become more giving & forgiving!Last time the EU succeeded in crushing a UK PM in negotiations it led directly to the vote to Leave the EU.This time it could lead to an EARLY Exit without ANY Deal.#Brexit #EU
Frank, broad & honest critique of #Brexit from Tory MEP @CharlesTannock. Why do we have to go to French media to hear from this guy?! @BBCNews @BBCr4today @bbcquestiontime @BBCNewsnight @BBCPolitics  via @FRANCE24
A lot of Leave voters say ‘Stop complaining, it’s democracy!’ Well democracy doesn’t always work. If five people democratically elect to take your iPhone, it’s a mugging.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
Chlorine-washed chicken from America. Hormone-fed beef from Australia. 'Global UK' has control of nothing. The cost of your precious #Brexit
Just catching up with this now. It's a must-read. #brexit #FBPE
The BBC has stopped being a reliable news source. It's #EU coverage has been dismal for years but it's #Brexit coverage has been relentlessly terrible from start to finish.
The UK choses an excellent time to become a minnow in a very large pond of aggressive sharks. - #Brexit @Open_Britain @FFSake_ @Scientists4EU
"In 20 years the EU has made €1 TRILLION EUROS selling goods to the UK." Read our EXCLUSIVE report here: #Brexit Facts4EU - daily, original, fact-based research and analysis.... even on Easter Monday! 
Of course the ultra #Brexiteers are afraid: their #Brexit now looks toxicThey are being forced to face Brexit realities, with red lines crossed, hefty bills to be paid and border issues unresolved#StopBrexit #FBPE
So much for accountability journalism.  The BBC & MSM is failing us. If we want the truth, we must follow the money and keep up the pressure. Don't forget to share and use the hashtags!  #CambridgeAnalytica #AIQ #SCL #LeaveEU #Brexit #RussianMoney #SteelDossier #Skripal
A referendum in Scotland without Section 30 would NOT be illegal. It just means WM wouldn't participate. But it would still be legal. And you're right, a YES vote would set us up for a constitutional crisis but we're there anyway coz of #Brexit 
The AIQ code suggests, in detail, something which both Trump, Bannon and Leave EU have always suggested - #Brexit was a trial run for the US Presidency. @chrisinsilico
I’m afraid I warned you all last week about Chris Wylie being a liar and fact-free. The paper has now corrected this absolutely false story by the self-described “whistleblower”  which everybody lapped up because of confirmation bias. #Brexit 
Make no mistake the UK Parliament cannot ignore this and wish it was shoved under a blanket.  This is huge for every single voter #Brexit #BrexitShambles @theSNP @ScotNational #AggregateIQ :the obscure Canadian tech firm and the Brexit data riddle

I've been around for 37 years. The last three have been the worst I've ever known. The fabric of our society is being eviscerated. Hatred, bigotry & intolerance is now so prevalent it has become an acceptable norm. What has happened to this country? #Brexit

Here are some very good reasons to campaign for the biggest possible vote for pro-EU parties in the May 3 local elections.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit #VoteEU
Splyce wins 3-0, the Union Jack descends from the ceiling, the national anthem is being belted out and then Barry Stanton comes out to interview them after. #brexit
Heaven forbid that the news, for once reports about the anti-Semitism in the @UKLabour and breaks its anti #Brexit agenda for a few hours  
Great article sums up reality...there is no fall back; soft #Brexit Pay & Obey No Say is a DELUSION a DECEIT for 1 simple reason. Once we Leave we're out of the EU & the protection of the ECJ.Our Rights, our Future can't be protected beyond 1 Parliament. 
This thread Moment describes the Smoking gun that should result in #Brexit  campaigners going to jail.  We are living through a coup d’etat & #BorisJohnson is the biggest villain
A top Conservative MP is deeply tied to #CambridgeAnalytica and the #Brexit cheating scandal, including their FB data theft@carolecadwalla caught the crooks, but election fraud places corrupt leaders in charge of investigating themselves#TheResistance
Theresa May has apparently granted concessions on immigration, fishing and the role of the ECJ. It makes you wonder what else there is to give away. Northern Ireland, perhaps? #Brexit
#Skripal case helped May’s govt to sideline its failure to negotiate more favorable terms for #Brexit – Russian envoy to UK 
We Remainers on Twitter are doing a great job finding yet more things wrong with #Brexit. But as a group we are failing to campaign effectively for a big pro-EU vote on May 3. This is our one chance to make votes count, let's not waste it.Please RT!#StopBrexit #VoteEU #ABTV
This tweet has rattled a few #Leavers. The more #Brexit looks doomed to abject failure, the more vociferously they complain that it's undemocratic to disagree with the result, or for people to change their minds. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
This is superb from Jurgen Klopp on #Brexit I increasingly think many of our European friends care more about the future of us Brits, than we do.We need to #ExitFromBrexit
Does Parliament needs more evidences? Here they are the documents published by Parliament that link AIQ, the firm at heart of #Brexit, to #CambridgeAnalitica!!
If you accept that BBC Scotland solely aims its propaganda news broadcasts at Scottish Unionists and Scotland's #Brexit followers in order to provide them with their much-needed confirmation and validation, then all of its coverage makes complete sense. 
The govt capitulation to trapping the UK in transition where we obey ALL EU law AFTER Brexit has left fishermen enragedIf @Anna_Soubry can flout Whips to thwart 17.5m who voted #Brexit then Brexiteer @Conservatives need to stand by #NoDealsBetterThanABadDealCOUNTRY BEFORE PARTY
If ever there was a a photo that symbolised everything that is mind numbingly stupid about #Brexit then this is it.Not a single other part of that car, when finished, will be made in UK but in EU states. It's a shell, an empty shell, just like her Brexit.#StopBrexit
Please join us in paying tribute to Eddie Izzard - the most successful contributor to the cause of #Brexit ever? 
How @Theresa_May went from zero to hero. From handling #Brexit well, to a statesmanlike response to the #Russia poisoning, to her commitment to fixing #NHS funding - she made mistakes last year but the PM is now starting to look like a winner.#ImWithMay
For @The3Million EU citizens living in the UK and a million @BritishInEurope, many of whom may now be contemplating a return to their home country because of #Brexit, language attrition could be a real problem.  
Brexit dividend for the NHS is just another lie.  It’s a political sleight of hand that is just one more disgrace to add to the litany of lies that continues to accompany the #Brexit process.#StopBrexit #FBPE
No @anandMenon1, it’s not. A #voteonthedeal is a new ballgame altogether, testing opinion once people know what ‘#Brexit means Brexit’ in fact means.Your assertion would mean that the 2017 general election was illegitimate because it might ‘overturn’ the one we had in 2015 
My guess, people, is that this savage anti-Russian campaign and the hounding of Jeremy Corbyn are preludes to May cancelling #Brexit I have never seen such hatred whipped up by a government mired in corruption and grotesque incompetence. Godless liberals who hate Britain.
Tony Blair - Here in this palace of Westminster... the birthplace of democracy... here our #brexit fate will be decided. I say to MPs.. think of our history.. think of our future.. think of the true meaning of both & make that decision according to conscience & belief.#FBPE

Theresa May tells us she’s working in the national interest, but confirms she’s prepared to prop up the pound during #Brexit by wasting a staggering  £250,000,000,000. [Erm... How much does EU membership cost us?] Sheer madness... #fbpe #ofoc @theresa_may @10DowningStreet

.@michaelsavage piece in Observer: 1 in 5 UK  manufacturing firms planning #Brexit related job cuts. Thousands at risk, especially in the North East. There is still time to change course @jeremycorbyn. Don't let this image define you - we can and must do better. 
The Chancellor is setting aside £12 Billion per year for 3 years in order to pay for some of the costs of #BrexitThat’s a huge sum, about £250 Million per weekIf you had the following options, how would you like it spent?(As always, comments welcome, retweets essential)

I love this article ... Pretty much the usual "British will change their minds on #Brexit", but the little IQ advert is artistic. My IQ comes in as 146 (tested by mensa), so I have just enough intelligence to see it as a wonderful piece of mind-control. 
I don't think it's divisive to portray Leave / Remain emoji's ... but then again our #Brexit emoji is far more cool than their starry eyed, gullible looking #Leave one

Yes, spot on, Chris. As to those further revelations, yes, they are bound to come. Both Corbyn and the Govt are hoping they can rush through #Brexit regardless, as the conspicuous absences in the Emergency Debate over CA showed

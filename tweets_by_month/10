Jon Snow C4 almost in tears over the great economic news post Brexit reveale today you have to laught don't you LOL 
Pro-EU extremists at @Channel4News seem desperate for #Nissan news to be reported in a cynical, negative light.They can't accept #Brexit 
Nissan confirm they'll make their new car models in the UK. Does the deal prove Theresa May will make a success of Brexit?  
Appears from #C4News that #TheresaMay has told #Nissan more about UKGov #Brexit negotiating position than she's told parliament. Democracy? 
So, Nissan know more about the gov't's plans for #Brexit than the country or our Parliament. And this, apparently, is "taking back control". 
Finished off today having a useful discussion with @columeastwood @patsymcglone @SDLPlive on Brexit implications 4 #SocEnt @Cjstirling59 
THERESA MAY rejects both  hard #brexit and soft #brexit and opts instead for A DOG'S BREXIT

#UK secured Nissan investment by promising "unconditional investment aid" & "further relief" from any #Brexit damage  
Great news! | BBC News - UK economy grows 0.5% in three months after Brexit vote  
Big shame as we need #brexit checks & balances going forward not just #reckless decision makers #bigloss 
SDLP Assembly members met with representatives of the business community today ahead of the all Ireland Brexit Forum  
Nissan is the smoking gun of Brexit. If it goes then Brexit is exposed. The government were always going to fix that by throwing money at it 
More money to keep car manufacturers going, but no money for the NHS - ? #Brexit is worse than stupid, it is destructive irresponsibility.  
#TheresaMay hypocrisy on #brexit laid bare by #GoldmanSachs tape: 
So Nissan have been talked through the process of Brexit. Any chance of the same courtesy for our elected representatives? 
Where do I go to get a Nissan-style Brexit shield? I'd like no tariffs on imported stuff & subsidised euros for my Greek holiday, please. 
All those workers in Sunderland who voted Brexit out of ignorance must be kicking themselves

Enda declares HE is the Brexit  Minister....great, that's 2 more years at least !! 
As Ken Clarke appears to have said (in effect) on LBC today, absurd to go ahead with Brexit without a broad policy & Parliamentary approval 
That "Brexit hotline" tho  
No bad for Nissan eh, it seems they're privately getting a running commentary from UK gov on what #Brexit means for them. 
There are no such things as hard and soft Brexit: there is only Brexit.  
Hands up who had #Brexit blues? I haven't stopped celebrating!  
The UK economy up 0.5%, and Nissan has announced new investment in its Sunderland plant. Does this prove Brexit fears were unfounded?  
Apparently, if Zac Goldsmith loses that will "send a message on Brexit". So what message did 17 million people voting to leave send. 
Britain just dropped to an all-time low in the renewable rankings thanks to Brexit  
David Mundell (Secretary of State Scotland) said last week STV - 'Awaits Nicola Sturgeon's Brexit proposals'.Now says - 'No special deal'. 
Don't listen to Remainers, people. No bank in its right mind would ever leave the City for the #Eurozone which is sinking fast. #Brexit 
Mundell "No special Brexit deal for Scotland". UKGov will however give car industry & City blank cheque. Pooling & sharing again!#indyref2 
Deluded fools in @UKLabour utterly failing to grasp that all they are doing is helping a Tory #Brexit for the rich and powerful. #Remain 
Nissan to make new car models in UK as economy defies Brexit fears Another success for #Brexit !!

WTO Head on Fast & Smooth Brexit: 'Trade will not stop, it will continue.. doesn't mean... a vacuum or disruption'  
Theresa May delighted that Nissan will build cars in post-Brexit Britain, although is unsure whether they'll be hard or soft-top. 
Twitter Remainers in July: "You've wrecked the economy!"Twitter Remainers now: "Brexit hasn't actually happened yet!" 
If electing Trump is Brexit, then Gary Johnson is Boaty McBoatface: 
Mundell says No special Brexit deals as Nissan confirm "support & assurances" received from UKGov before they decided Sunderland investment. 
Why would the EU give Brexit Britain a better deal than it has now *inside* the EU?Answer: It won't. Britain will be made an example of. 
Finally, some reassuring Brexit news.  
UK Gov Announces Referendum On Banning Tyler Oakley. Vote Like For 'Yes', Share For 'Hell Yes' #TylerOakley 
So if you're an area that voted FOR Brexit, you'll get special treatment, but if you're an area which voted Remain (Scotland), sod off.  
@theresa_may Dear Madam, If a massive company like #Nissan needs to be 'shielded' from its effects, then maybe we should reconsider #Brexit? 
.@DavidMundellDCT's approach to #Brexit is essentially "the tories got Scotland into this mess, but what are @theSNP going to do to fix it?" 
2.  'but our access to the single market can continue in a way that doesn’t  involve tariffs or barriers'...today's Brexit challenge 
Interesting thread starting here re Nissan and Brexit  
Tories have turned #brexit into an all-you-can-eat buffet for corporations. They're grabbing all the welfare they can fit in their vaults. 
Under a Brexit scenario, UK Treasury predicted growth in Q3 2016 of between -0.1% and -1%. Actual figure is +0.5%.  
Seth Meyers: Trump 'doesn't even seem to know' what Obamacare is-Like Brexit, the Crimea…He's that out of it.  
Now that the U.K. car industry is getting a Brexit Compensation Package does anybody know where small business should apply for similar? 
So Nissan & City of London to be protected from negative effects of #brexit using money from tax payers who will get no protection at all. 
Brexit must open our economy to the world – not lock it away behind protectionist barriers 
The Tories' chaotic Brexit could mean a tax dodgers' paradise - and here's why:  
How much will UK taxpayers have to stump up to keep UK jobs at Nissan? Perhaps the #NHS will never see their £350M. What a mess #Brexit is. 
BREXIT: Relief as investment by Japanese company enables Britain to take back control. 
And if #Nissan gets a post- #Brexit blank cheque, do Honda, Opel/GM, BMW, Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover/Tata get the same? 
And why not. He ran a Ukip campaign in mayoral election and a Ukip campaign on Brexit. He's a Kipper who happens to like trees.  
If I'm not mistaken Qashqai is that sort of tea which gives relief to a country straining to pass a hard Brexit. 
Sorry, Trump. You're not going to be the next Brexit.  
WATCH: Today Daily Politics took a moment to appreciate some of the sweetest treats which had been produced by the Great British Brexit.  
Hitler's biographer sees echoes of the past in the Brexit vote  
UK gives Nissan a blank cheque to stay in UK, compensating them for tariffs post- #brexit. How’s that good politics?

Here's the full @afneil @michaelgove interview where they talk immigration #Brexit and working with Lord Glasman  
A people's Brexit needs to protect jobs in a strong financial and professional services industry that funds public services through taxes. 
5. Last point - a lot of the "economists for Brexit" analysis was underpinned by a faith in the UK adopting unilateral free trade... 
Britain's mixed messages deepen Brexit rifts with EU  
End of the UK? New survey shows 59% support Scottish independence after Brexit vote  
It looks like there will be EU deals for companies as well as bankers, but not for nations that voted to Remain. #EUref #Brexit  
That would be a textbook case of a state aid (while in the EU) or a subsidy (post-Brexit) which EU could retaliate against under WTO rules.  
Those victories from #Brexit. Higher prices. More hate crime. More money to corporates to do what they used to do. More work for lawyers. 
If Brexit is so good for our manufacturing sector why *any* "assurances" to Nissan?Why, it's almost as if Brexit isn't that great  
BRITAIN SUPPORTS TRUMP, MAKE #November8th another BREXIT and vote Trump 
I'll be on @SkyNews at 3.30pm discussing the good GDP figures, the good Nissan news and all the bad Brexit predictions.

The only thing we can be confident of is that Nissan's decision isn't a vote of confidence in Brexit without *something* to sweeten the pill

The Tories want to cut special- secret #brexit deals for bankers and cut taxes for big multinationals- @uklabour Want To Prioritise People! 
Pretty awful that gov has to underwrite consequences of Brexit for an area that overwhelmingly voted Leave.Sunderland should man up. #Nissan 
Presumably equivalent offers will be available to all companies and individuals impacted by #brexit?(Who pays?) 
2016 and a desperate #brexit Tory govt underwrites Sunderland Nissan "unconditionally". Different story back in 1984 in Bathgate of course.  
If this was what @johnmcdonnellMP said today-then he nailed it.#johnmcdonnell#Brexit 
We're beginning to see what a successful Brexit looks like as far as HMG is concerned: subsidies for everyone:

So, post-#Brexit the UK's doors are open to more corp welfare, inducements, sweeteners, compensation. Wonder what that'll cost us? #Nissan

Theresa May’s own minister turns against her, as the government goes into meltdown  #brexit 
HM Treasury said a Brexit vote could mean Q3 economic contraction of up to -1.0%. The result: 0.5pc growth. My take:  
Brit Economy GROWS After Brexit...  
After #brexit dont forget to put your clocks back 47 years until when Harold Wilson devalued the pound Tories have devalued it by 168 years 
If Brexit hits manufacturers, it'll hit jobs and the public purse indirectly via tax receipts, and now directly too.  
If Reuters story true, big risk for UK gov't promising "Brexit relief" to Nissan is that every company is now going to want the same

Ah. The truth seems to be emerging UK secured Nissan investment with Brexit relief promise - source  via @ReutersUK 
British government has promised Nissan aid if Brexit harms the performance of its Sunderland plant, says Reuters.  
I think we should have a Brexit that's hard on the outside and soft inside, like one of them sweets. I like those sweets.

In fact, Heathrow expansion and Brexit are inextricably linked. Blog post coming Wednesday morning.

Business exodus! Security concerns! Leaked recordings! Can the #Brexit shambles get any worse? I suspect the answer is yes. Much worse.

Theresa May won’t tell the British electorate about what she thinks about Brexit. But she’ll tell Goldman Sachs:  
"A lot of people will invest in the UK because it is UK in Europe." Guess who said this in May 2016? #Brexit  
Guardian has leaked secret tape of May's Brexit speech at Goldman Sachs which ticks all the headline boxes  
No wonder Tories in such a mess. Boris Johnson didn't want to leave but argued for Brexit. May wanted strongly to stay but remained silent. 
Opinion: Britain must pursue a "hard Brexit" to create a more open economy

How kind of @ZacGoldsmith to offer @LibDems the opportunity to conduct a referendum on Brexit. 
Why Brexit is a poor analogy for Trump: Despite the surprise result, Leave had led in polls in the closing weeks of the British referendum  
The Brexit comparison is quite wrong. The UK 2015 general elex comparison is a better one, but no one will make it cause it's more complex. 
1. Polls in #Brexit showed a tie; polls in U.S. do not.2. U.S. has more (and better) pollsters than the UK. 
If Zac Goldsmith is re-elected MP for Richmond Park as "Independent" he'll be a Tory #Brexit wolf in sheep's clothing. Go for it, @LibDems! 
Trump citing Brexit may be the perfect @realDonaldTrump moment. Garbage in, garbage out.

Theresa May is keen for Mark Carney to stay at the Bank of England, officials say  
Trump didn't appear to know what Brexit was weeks before the vote:  
Trump continually uses “Brexit” as a symbol of “polling failure” even though it doesn’t mean that at all. **Most Brexit polls were right.** 
RichmondPark: a reminder that @ZacGoldsmith ran an obnoxious dog-whistle Mayoral campaign, & voted for Brexit in a 70% Remain constituency.  
Donald Trump: "There's going to be a lot of Brexit happening in about two weeks."  
#Brexit meet #Amexit the #Globalists like #GeorgeSoros pushing for @HillaryClinton will lose!! It's our turn to stand up & shock the world.

Interesting to see what the electoral map would've looked like had the referendum been conducted via first past the post.  
I got into this to support Nigel the best I could & help win the referendum. The level of treachery & deceit from people inside is appalling  
When will Theresa May listen to the simple fact that people no longer want Brexit?   
Worried about a hard Brexit government that wasn't your fault? Help us win in #RichmondPark join #LibDems

Zac G's decision to hold a referendum on himself evoking fond memories of the newsfest that was the David Davis For Freedom by-election 
a casual reminder as we see all the "Trump has almost no chance of winning" headlines: The UK said the same thing about Brexit. #VOTE 
Brexit, in which people ignored polls in favor of their own narrative, parallels 2016 nicely, but maybe not for the reason Trump fans think

That's interesting. In response to my question, PM backtracks on idea of "hard Brexit". Cold shoulder at EU summit must have had an effect. 
Still the PM refuses to share any detail about the kind of Brexit she seeks with supposedly sovereign U.K. parliament #PMStatement 
Brexiters: "We're the fifth largest economy, we'll be fine!"Also Brexiters: "We can't afford to take in all these refugees!"#Brexit

The great Brexit text mess: how Boris, Gove and co waged war by phone  
Spot on from @jeremycorbyn: It's not a soft Brexit or a hard Brexit, it's a chaotic Brexit. 
Sturgeon's threat of another referendum illustrates perfectly the SNP's cynical attitude towards the democratic process.  
When someone tells you that the UK government has a coherent and workable post-Brexit plan.  
"If we approach this in a constructive spirit we can ensure a smooth departure." @theresa_may on Brexit negotiations  
Corbyn: world is concluding that Britain hasnt got a clue... not soft or hard Brexit but chaotic Brexit 
Good on him. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator demands talks are in French  
"#Sturgeon tells #May she's 'not bluffing' over referendum"That's fine Nicola.. as Nike say:'Just do it'.

Failing to agree free trade with the UK post-Brexit and reverting to WTO rules would cost EU exporters £13 billion  
My pals and I have been searching far and wide for a "Brexit strategy" but have thus far found doodley-squat.  
Meaning: May told her there'll be no special deal for Scotland in UK's Brexit negotiations, and sent her away with a flea in her ear.Good.  
Nicola Sturgeon says she's not sure the government has a strategy for Brexit talks  
The First Minister's #Brexit frustrations as cited earlier by The Guardian. Difficult to argue with her, really.  
Have reached conclusion T May has no real idea what she is doing. She really needs to adopt a position - any position - to progress Brexit. 
#Brexit is just a Westminster bubble, politicians thinking 1/4 of the population, 37% of electorate, blanks everything else. Reality says..?

I keep seeing that Hillary is leading Trump in the polls. Remain was in the lead in the polls... and then Brexit won.

Tories beginning to call for an early election before the bad Brexit deal they expect Britain will get. That tells us everything. 
Good. Preferred date for #Brexit: never, or 2850 AD, whichever is later.

@TheresaMay - Just give up on Brexit now - you nearly lost one of the safest seats in the UK and are united with UKIP #RemainINUK #PMQs

The entire EU27 position, led by Merkel, appears to be based on idea that UK should be given time & space to change its mind on #Brexit  
No, I'll do my part to ensure we don't get shafted. And I hope people will unify & support us around the Brexit ambition & beyond at next GE  
Hollande in election mode, but talk of 'hard negotiations' is dribble. Even Tusk calls for Hard Brexit - as simpler  
May is politically stupid if she thinks the U.K. has any clout in any EU decision now: they're already ignoring her Brexit Tory Government 
Good from @pollytoynbee on how opinion may be turning against heard Brexit  and how politicians must adapt 
For a campaign based on 'Taking Back Control', actual #Brexit feels a lot more like Britain is losing control... of pretty much everything. 
George Osborne has admitted he made "mistakes" in the EU referendum campaign, admitting many voters felt...

Hearing from some dispirited voters they just won't vote 'cuz they're confident Trump'll lose. Um, no. See Brexit. Do the right thing. VOTE. 
I ask Corbyn if his Feb Summit is an alternative Brexit: "It's a helpful diplomatic approach where we don't hector and lecture people..."

Letter from @Keir_Starmer demanding Commons vote on Brexit plan  
Thank you to all who came to our Post-Brexit Agriculture and Rural Development Inquiry workshop at the Norwegian Church in Cardiff Bay today 
New - The public now clearly puts access to the single market (45%) over controlling immigration (39%) in #brexit - but remains split.  
To pursue hard Brexit, with such consistent polling showing public opposition before and after vote, is to hijack the referendum result. 
We will keep on saying it until we stop this or we burst a blood vessel: No mandate for hard Brexit.  
It'd appear Ruth Davidson spends more time arsing about on celeb TV shows than actually standing up for ScotCons post BrexitHead in sand

Only sensible #Brexit is soft one that keeps UK in single market. That means following all EU rules & paying, but with no say. Why bother? 
More accurately: I argue that #Brexit must be stopped by Parliament. And on rational, democratic grounds.  
"No mandate," says May. If only the Scottish Government had had the wherewithal to anticipate Brexit in their manifesto. Er. If only. Oops.  
Why accept 'we are leaving'? Stop #Brexit altogether  - that's the goal.

And as Nigel farage just said on FBN, the day before #Brexit vote, they were 10 points behind, and won!  So many under-represented voters! 
Brexit of Champions #PoliticalFoods @midnight 
Just like Brexit, Trump will win. The MSM is corrupt and deceiving the people.

GOPers arguing that HRC's election is a referendum on Trump are conceding their party's failure to carry out a top-3 task of their party. 
Exactly what is a vote for Trump? It's a vote to quit this country and its values. It's a Brexit for the American Republic. 
is dukat in league with the brexit 
America, you are a great nation. If you elect #Trump you will be the laughing stock of the world. Just as we are with #Brexit #debates

She's eating up the clock. This election isn't a referendum on the clinton foundation. #1210Debate 
Reading my timeline, I feel 100% optimistic that Trump will never be President. And yet...that's what my timeline told me about #Brexit too. 
Isn't it great that the election has become a referendum on Donald Trump's personal characteristics? A sure sign of a healthy democracy. 
This is a call to arms to women from Clinton - says the electorate's reaction to Trump's misogyny is a referendum on our country's character 
Not everyone who voted for #Brexit is a racist or a xenophobe, but every one of them handed our country to the racists & xenophobes.  
Want to laugh at America but every time I do #brexit

Calais's Benjamin Buttons only strengthen our resolve for hard #Brexit - we need a stronger stance on immigration. 
Bottom line: This race isn't Brexit, unless Trump climbs to a tie by election day.  
Brexit was shocker not because polls were off but because political class had convinced itself Remain would win.  
Trump has taken to citing Brexit: 'This is another Brexit.' Message: Polls wrong. But Brexit polls were close. Result shouldn't have shocked

As biscuits form basis of government’s Brexit trade plans, Andrea Leadsom will not say whether she favours a hard or a soft biscuit.

“If we go out and win, this is another Brexit.” Donald J. Trump says he doesn’t believe the polls any more, insisting he's “doing great”.  
Apparently, Britain's Brexit economy will now be propped up by exporting jam, tea, and biscuits.  
Brexit was proof that the media lies about polls & distorts reality so it fits the narrative they want. They manufactured fake support.

So Britain's Brexit will be built on exporting tea? Don't we have to import the tea first though? And then find people who actually want it?

Thank you so much to the hundreds of ppl who just came to our 2nd #Brexit. & Thanks to @Keir_Starmer & @TulipSiddiq

Today's Brexit news seems to be that Boris Johnson has no integrity.Tomorrow it will be announced that the Pope is a Catholic. 
If you look again at the question on the EU referendum ballot paper, you’ll see the government has a clear mandate for a hard Brexit.  
So many saying the immigration is a core issue. Nothing, of course, to do with massive #Brexit billionaire press propaganda #Remain #YesEU 
I'd find this whole #brexit thing easier to swallow if I thought that some of the Tory cabinet had a clue what they are talking about. #marr 
Now that the truth of #Brexit is emerging can we please have another referendum?  
Boris should resign as foreign secretary - will not be trusted in any diplomatic talks or #Brexit

We should stop this nonsense of respecting the #EURef result. 37% based on lies and fantasies is not a sufficient mandate. #Remain #Brexit 
Theresa May will probably get a good Brexit deal, but nobody can say so - Terrific by John Rentoul.  
Those on both sides of referendum were clear during campaign that Leave meant out of single market. Yet Remainers now ignore that reality! 
Establishment didn't like referendum result and now are seeking to overrule the British people. Disgraceful. #Brexit

Here we go again, BBC News ONLY putting the Remain point over. Your bias is the reason we WILL sell you off. #brexit  
Nick Clegg dreadful on @MarrShow - his Lib Dems promised an In/Out Referendum to avoid a Lisbon Referendum. Now want to stop Art 50. Cynical 
.@nick_clegg now has clear national role as a leader of opposition to hard Brexit - he has authority and credibility to make a difference 
"The job of the government is to deliver the result on the referendum" says @patel4witham #marr 
Priti Patel says Brexit talks are like a game of poker. Does she agree with Liam Fox that EU nationals in UK are our "main cards?" #Marr 
Brexiteers "don't have a plan on what #Brexit means in practice"- @nick_clegg tells @MarrShow

Clear majority of British people want to remain in SIngle Market. Theresa May has no mandate for hard Brexit #Marr 
The millionaire who bought Brexit and his network of tax havens

Disappointingly London-centric @MarrShow thus far after 3 days of ScotGov in conference and a rather different take on Brexit! 
What % voted Leave for extra NHS money? The Referendum gave a political mandate. But ignore its limits and you live in a world of unreality. 
.@Nick_Clegg: Leave campaigners are Breniers. They deliberately withheld a clear Brexit plan from the British people  #Marr 
#marr Any mandate from #EUref can only be to secure,as they promised,a #brexit that works without sinking economy.Otherwise should oppose it 
Return to Commonwealth? UK has chance to look for new trade deals with Caribbean and Africa after Brexit  
Chancellor excluded from #Brexit meetings because of soft stance. Shouldn't he leave if he doesn't fall in line? 
Nonsense from Clegg on #Marr. He says he accepts ref result but wants freedom of movement to continue. Remainers trying to sabotage #Brexit. 
Clegg “we accept the referendum result” is being disingenuous.He remains in the party whose leader has pledged to overturn it.#Marr 
Andrew it IS CLEAR what we voted for pls DONT jump on the Leftard bandwagon.No one mentionedHARD Brexit til after the vote, out is out #marr 
I met plenty last week in Witney. Lifelong Tory voters who've felt let down by Brexit insanity.  
Nicola Sturgeon is a glorified mayor, she doesn't have the numbers, power or the balls to call a referendum. She's just trolling.#Marr 
I'm regularly told Brexit is justified by the fact that the UK has record employment levels. A detail I know, but that's been within the EU.

Feels as appropriate to the votes happening now, as it did to the Scottish referendum back when I wrote it-

Let's get this right... multi-national company Unilever haven't raised their prices by 10%... Brexit has lowered what the £ buys by 20%  
I believe that if we voted again now, the result would be to stay. The people who lied to win have now deserted their sinking ship. #Brexit

Brexit's a religion. Brexiters show unconditional, unthinking belief in, and support for, a concept they don't fully understand. 
Labour is desperately trying to undermine Brexit negotiations. did it scrutinise Lisbon treaty like this? #BrexitDebate 
Brexit is leaving the EU. It's neither hard nor soft. We'll negotiate a new relationship with Europe. Unlike the EU it will adapt and grow. 
I think the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union just likened Brexit negotiations to buying a house... expecting a gazumping?

Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn trade blows over #Brexit and the NHS during #PMQs 
Astonishing. The distinction between "membership of" and "access to" the Single Market seems entirely lost on the #Brexit Secretary.  
WATCH: In PMQs Theresa May rebuked elements in the Labour party who want a do-over of the referendum.  
Labour's Brexit position is to maintain free movement while not committing to single market membership. 
Britain, get real: Brexit means whatever the EU says it means | Joris Luyendijk  
David Davis really floundering in the face of @Keir_Starmer & @EmilyThornberry detailed questions. Clueless 'answers' on #Brexit  
There was something dangerous about the tone of the Mail and the Express on Brexit today - and we must not ignore it. My @IndyVoices take: 
The "takes time" and "not reveal at this stage" lines for non-disclosure of Brexit strategy are cloaks for no strategy at all. 
Davis says that in aftermath of vote there was a "blame Brexit festival". Seems to be suggesting business consequences unrelated to Brexit. 
Have been a long-time fan of Davis.But no evidence of substance behind any of his Brexit answers. Flimsy. There is no hidden strategy. 
52 Labour MPs have signed a letter challenging @LiamFoxMP to answer crucial questions our future trade after #Brexit

In Commons, Sir Keir Starmer says he is “absolutely” demanding a vote on the terms of Brexit, not just the scrutiny. 
Tory Dominic Grieve savages @theresa_may for not putting major treaty change - Brexit terms - to Commons for vote 
Commons TV rarely worth watching, but @Keir_Starmer worth watching now on Brexit:  
"The referendum is not the mandate for the terms." Finally someone in parliament making the case Twitter has been making since June 24th. 
"There is no mandate for the terms of exiting the EU"  says Kier Starmer. This is whole of Labour's Brexit policy 
"Where is the mandate on the terms? There is no mandate on the terms of Brexit" @Keir_Starmer making very powerful case in Brexit debate 
Brexit and parliamentGovernment has no policySmall majorityDifficult, serious questionsSkillful, informed opponents and backbenchers 
Labour under Keir Starmer finally nailing it. It is not about stopping/holding up Brexit, but abt choosing least dangerous exit route. 
These billionaire, non-British tabloid owners are so desperate to push Brexit through you really have to ask yourself what's in it for them? 
Still angry that Corbyn was so vague about opposing Brexit. Labour should have been all over this earlier.  
Overheard in a Commons bar "The Jocks have bottled it on #Brexit - they're content with the bones we've tossed them. Big hats, no cattle!" 
Whinging MPs on both sides quote"Parliament is sovereign".NO.The people are sovereign and the Referendum instructed Gov&MPs how to proceed. 
Forensic stuff from ex DPP Starmer - going for Green Paper first - for extra scrutiny, and then perhaps a vote on Brexit plan...

Corbyn wise to speak of "shambolic Tory Brexit", rather than "hard Brexit" (which makes May sound tough). #PMQs 
I love that Brexiters whined about "taking back control" and now Brexit detail is being managed by an unelected PM without a Commons vote. 
Well done @angelaeagle. Key issue is whether there is vote on government Brexit negotiating strategy. Hoping to speak about this in debate. 
Angela Eagle asks key question- will parliament vote on their pre article 50 scrutiny on Brexit? Theresa May doesn't answer the question. 
"She has chosen a 'Hard Brexit' that was never on anybody's ballot paper, and to turn her back on British business"  
Angela Eagle asking killer question: Will 'scrutiny' of Brexit plan include a vote? 
For the sake of a lame joke, the PM misleads House saying I'm calling for a rerun of Brexit referendum. I haven't and don't. #PMQs 
Lib Dem leader Tim Farron reminded May a Hard Brexit wasn't on the ballot paper. Why she's afraid of MPs & Parliamentary sovereignty #PMQs

Boris Johnson trying to distract attention from his #Brexit failure -He should be telling us where's the £350m a day he promised to give NHS 
Good to see Labour piling on Brexit pressure. When did the Opposition last do its day job instead of fighting each other ? 
So Labour want 170 questions answering about #Brexit plans. I only need one.  When do we get out of this nightmare? 
Labour asks the Government 170 questions about Brexit. But has no answer on migration

My interview with @BBCNewsnight from 06:07:  about #Brexit 
. @EmilyThornberry & @Keir_Starmer ask the 170 questions the government must answer to avoid a chaotic Brexit  
Very good points raised here. Devolution to English regions must be part of the Brexit deal.  
Current status of Brexit negotiations:  
Remember:  #DailyMail supported #Hitler in the mid 1930s .And in the same typeface.@DailyMailUK#Brexit-#dissent

What is left of British democracy when a handful of men can at unleash such torrents of hate to be seen by millions?#Remain #Brexit #YesEU

So labour have 170 questions to put to the Tories about BREXIT I have one question for @UKLabour @labour How could you ?? 
Instead of focussing on a second referendum that isn’t wanted, it's time the SNP got back to the day job.  
This morning, govt Brexit policy finally met reality: Small majority, a lack of mandate, economic damage, strategic disadvantage. 
If the lone UKIP MP is not on the Brexit select committee, parliament will look absurdly divorced from the people.  
The one thing to read on Brexit today, by a pro-Leave Tory MP.  
Am generally neutral on Brexit - which means I have no issue if it done by parliament, rather than by PM prerogative and plebiscite.

David Cameron has accepted his first job since quitting as Prime Minister following the Brexit vote  
Brexit means .  . . another TWO YEARS of this!!!  (I've decided: I'm going to rise above it & read War and Peace.) 
And will it include the option to reject #Brexit altogether? It will be a scam if it is just 'this Brexit or that.' NB.  
Starmer move is welcome: but Parliament should FIRST debate whether to accept the 'advice' of 25% of population, before any talk of #Brexit.

Davis warns MPs they have 'DUTY' to respect EU referendum amid anti-Brexit plotting. This David should have been PM!  
Brexit Minister: We Will Reject Any Attempt To Delay EU Exit  
#Brexit Secretary @DavidDavisMP says the Government will reject any attempt to undo the result of the #EuRef 
It could still be like Brexit but with 60% of America voting for Trump to leave. 
Consumers are being warned that shop prices may have to rise substantially following Brexit  
109 days after the Brexit vote, the UKGov has published 1 flowchart, 1 letter they were sent, & the legal defence for their court date.  
The pound falls again, extending its worst weekly slide since Brexit vote  
Owen Smith has his mojo back. Reminds Brexit Secretaty David Davis he used to support a second referendum :-) 
David Davis used to support giving the British people the final say on terms of Brexit. When did he change his mind?  
A rejection of the Trans-Pacific Partnership would be America's Brexit, argues @stavridisj.  
David Davis: "The words hard Brexit and soft Brexit are designed to mislead. They are not actually meaningful in any way." 
There are a myriad of parliamentary enquiries into #Brexit: I have written to each asking if only UK passport holders need make submissions. 
Brexit is the latest manifestation of England's post-imperial inferiority complex. @johnharris1969 nails it 
Remainiac retailers say UK shoppers will have to pay more for non-EU imports. Nonsense: post-Brexit, we don't have to impose tariffs at all. 
"There will be no downside to Brexit, only a considerable upside" - David Davis, Brexit secretary, 10th October 2016 
Note what he's doing: projecting Brexit vote onto specifics of anything government does. This is massive executive power grab. Nothing more. 
Listening to Brexit debate wondering if UK's 'drive slowly&boringly into brick wall' plan better/worse than US's 'crash into it at 100mph' 
.@Nick_Clegg challenges David Davis over Government's refusal to allow proper scrutiny of its #Brexit plans  
Davis says he doesn't accept Brexit will cause economic downturn, says it has economic opportunities, does not cite any. 
Davis says it is "rich" for Remainers to interpret the Brexit vote. Amazing. 
YesEU for clarity, #Brexit is really stupid. Contrary to popular opinion, the fact that 17 million voted for it doesn't make it less stupid 
These racists, haters and bigots are being shown more respect by the government than the 48%. #Brexit tarred by hate #Remain #YesEU 
"Bathing in Remainer tears." My Brexit speech  
Liam Fox approached Norway on a new free trade deal - Norway said no.  #Brexit  Norge sa nei 
No reassurance from David Davis on the future for millions of UK & EU citizens living & working abroad in the uncertainty created by #Brexit 
Hate crimes against LGBT people in the UK have more than doubled since Brexit.  
David Davis waffling away on #Brexit statement. No decisions, no info & no plan. Utterly shambolic & disastrous for UK economy! 
Well said Sir! We (17.4m people) support you | @DavidDavisMP warns MPs they have 'DUTY' to respect EU referendum  
True people didn't vote for soft or hard Brexit. So MPs must scrutinise negotiating strategy & type of Brexit to ensure get best deal for GB  
The people EU is putting in place look all the more impressive compared to piffling nonsense we saw today from UK Brexit Minister #Wrexit 
May: 'MPs will not have a say on how Brexit negotiations are handled' I thought we were a Parliamentary democracy? My mistake... 
On what meaningful parliamentary involvement in #Brexit might look like, see this post by Prof Stephen Tierney & me  
David Davis warns MPs they have 'DUTY' to respect EU referendum amid anti-Brexit plotting  #Brexit 
For #TheresaMay to think #Brexit doesn't deserve parliamentary scrutiny mocks democracy and should worries us all. #daviddavis 
Theresa May says the 'liberal elite' is sneering at people who voted for Brexit. Well I reserve the right to sneer  
Their long cherished idea in #Commons of parliament being sovereign now gone in #Brexit smoke -people r sovereign they say now #Useful4Scot 
A shocking lack of detail from David Davis. The decision matters to every one of us, yet the Government is being utterly opaque. #Brexit 
Pound continues to fall against dollar and euro amid 'hard Brexit' fears  
"Where is the Govt's mandate for negotiations" says @ed_miliband in #Brexit statement - here's what he said this morning on @victorialive 
The #Brexit Secretary is also unable to distinguish between a mandate to leave the EU and a mandate to negotiate particular exit terms 
Becoming clear Great Repeal Bill is smoke & mirrors exercise, giving spurious impression of meaningful parliamentary involvement in #Brexit 
Ed Miliband: There is clearly a mandate for Brexit, but there is no mandate for this particular form of Brexit 
IDS disgracefully refers to Sir Keir Starmer as "a second-rate lawyer". The Nasty Party is alive & kicking #Brexit #Parliament 
"We don't know if it's a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit but we do know it's a dog's Brexit": Stephen Gethins, SNP MP 
#BREXIT: "We want a deal that is exactly like being in the European Union but without being in the European Union" David Davis tells MPs. 
Opinion sharply divided on @SNP @StephenGethins joke "not hard brexit nor soft Brexit but a Dog's Brexit" 
David Davis "Brexit a about empowering parliament""So you're in favour of putting the plan to parliament to vote on?""Christ no!" 
David Davis: Govt will reject any attempts to undo Brexit vote  
The #Brexit Secretary demonstrates his mastery of constitutional nicety by baldly asserting that "Article 50 is a prerogative power". 
.@DavidDavisMP tells MPs how he aims to implement #Brexit  
Neither those who voted Leave or Remain voted to take an axe to economy. Hard Brexit is not in national interest. Well said @Keir_Starmer 
Lots of pundits and politicos who've showed zip interest in reviving Parliament all a flutter about a Commons vote to try to dilute Brexit 
Excellent Keir Starmer asks what the point is of parl sovereignty if parl is given no role in approving the terms of Brexit. Key question. 
David Davis' 8 minutes of rehashed rhetoric on EU had barely any mention of the economy. Mandate is for Brexit, not for torching the economy 
If the Government really wanted to hear from all views and opinions then they'd have a proper debate and vote in Parliament. #Brexit 
Pound continues to fall against dollar and euro amid 'hard Brexit' fears  
David Davis starts his #Brexit statement with a lie: "the mandate to leave the EU was overwhelming." #Commons 
Britain’s economy was resilient after Brexit. Its leaders learned the wrong lesson.  
#CitizenOfTheWorld #Brexit.Mrs May has effectively called the world "nowhere". In which there are zillions of trade opportunities it seems.  
Glasgow SLab want ScotGov to replace EU funding lost by Brexit. No mention where money comes from, perhaps another Scottish Income Tax rise? 
Eurozone banks in deep trouble, warns Wall Street giant.Thanks for flying #EU!Hope we #Brexit before it crashes. 
Labour have set out our 5 red lines for Brexit negotiations but we still don't know what the Government's objectives are.  
Dear America. We really blew it in our referendum this year. Please, please, please don’t follow our lead.

Parliament should table a no confidence motion in the gov't if it won't give them a vote on our mandateless, rushed, hard Brexit. 
'A majority of those who exercised their right to vote' isn't a mandating majority in an advisory referendum- & doesn't overrule Parliament.  
Government asleep at the wheel on Brexit - Carthy 
I don't recall ANYONE voting for MAY to do ANYTHING with #Brexit?Anyone else?Odd that isn't it?Typical Tory dictator like tripe! 
#Brexit means: "The absolute right to control our own borders & freedom to negotiate our own trading arrangements with countries we choose." 
Sharon White, our chief executive, believes communications must feature at the heart of the Brexit debate.

Theresa May has said MPs will not get a vote on Brexit  
absolutely agree. Soft brexit is utterly pointless and hard brexit is suicide. Brexit and success cannot be in the same sentence 
Bar for success is lower for Trump. Like Brexit.It's not meant to actually work. It's meant to be a middle finger at the establishment. 
Goldman Sachs could move 2000 London jobs in the event of hard Brexit  
Today's call for White Paper on Brexit negotiation backed after Leave vote in July, by top Brexiteer...David Davis  
so as things stand Euro MPs will have a vote (and veto) on any UK-EU deal after #Brexit but Westminster MPs won't 
Make me PM and I'll fix the country in a day. I'll stop Brexit. The stock exchange will boom, migrants will feel welcome, I'll build bridges 
Having seen Brexit firsthand, it's sad to see how many folks believe Trump's behavior will lose him any votes. His fans love him regardless. 
Govt rejects MPs scrutiny of Brexit deal because "will of the people."MPs specific function is to represent "will of the people." 
Cry, shout & stamp your little feet as much as you like, you're not going to vote on Brexit terms. Well said Theresa  
Brexit was too close to call come the vote. Hillary is up in all national polls by large margins. It's a better sign.

Brexit "opportunity" enthusiasm - like putting your hand in the fire and then getting excited about all the ointments you can find as salve. 
Watching last nights debate. Shaking my head thinking how it reminded me of the Brexit campaigns. And, look what happened. 
People who spend all day bickering on Twitter over simple things are now experts in achieving Brexit agreements over complex matters. 
Business leaders warn May hard #Brexit would destroy Britain’s economy  
After a general election, losers still represented in Parliament. After this referendum, victors seek to deny 16.1m voters any voice at all 
Yes, about time campaign Brexit is framed in terms of what it is going to do in practice: take freedom away from millions, British included.  
This is gross. Why should Ireland facilitate this stuff? #Brexit

The pain of 'Brexit' is staring to be felt, via @Neil_Irwin 
Noticed the concern of people on #Brexit . Not many worried about #Worldexit 
Theresa May's 'Will of the People' is what fascist dictators carry out. It is wholly alien to parliamentary democracy#Brexit #Remain #YesEU 
There are two oppositions to Brexit and neither of them are Labour  
As time goes on the angrier I get about the whole referendum campaign: misinformation, lack of detail, & no further say in how it plays out 
Blows gaping hole in argument that those of us asking for parliamentary sovereignty over negotiations are re-running referendum. We are not.  
Mentioning Brexit is a good, if long-winded way, to find out all the idiots who you need to block. 
If you're comparing the US election to Brexit remind me how the Electoral College worked in the referendum. Satire is dead but so is nuance. 
"Number of UK workers looking for jobs in Ireland up by 20% since Brexit. 13% in Australia, 10% Canada & 9% in Germany" - Very interesting. 
Nick Clegg demands Commons vote on EU negotiations but refused to back referendum in 1st place. usual double standards from LibDums 
.@DavidAllenGreen @FT I keep hoping Theresa May is playing a fantastically clever game to manoeuvre the UK into rejecting Brexit completely. 
Theresa May has said MPs will not get a vote on Brexit  
Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg have demanded a parliamentary vote on Brexit. Is this necessary?

Remainers who insist Brexit voters are racist create a self-fulfilling immigration prophecy, writes @DanielJHannan 
Because 'soft #Brexit' is #Remain with less influence, it's worse than useless. Remain is the only viable option;  'Hard' is mere suicide. 
Unbelievable. During the campaign Brexiteers hailed that the UK Parliament must be sovereign... now the Government doesn't seem keen #Brexit  
Tories on target to cripple UK economy if we have Hard #Brexit on top of Austerity.#Madness 
The 'hard/soft #Brexit' rhetoric is a nonsense. The only choices are Hard and #Remain. 'Soft' is Remain with less influence over the terms.

An exciting second debate. Many polls show Trump on top. Immigration and security played major role. Obvious parallels with Brexit debates. 
This entire election is a referendum on how mean and stupid the American people are 
Hillary says this is not an "ordinary election". Why? Is that not a referendum on HER and .@POTUS? #debate 
Between this and Brexit, future historians will be like "What the FUCK was up with 2016?" 
It's exactly like w Brexit--we're all talking to other people who already agree w us.  
‘He’s not running to be Pope,’ Brexit’s Nigel Farage, ‘At least there’s an honesty about Trump…’

Let's just be clear about #Brexit. We're making a bonfire of our money and society to stop 100k migrants per year...who don't cost a penny 
In Britain the EU referendum taught us that a lot of voters don't show up in the opinion polls. Could be plenty of silent support for Trump

Absolutely right. Brexit has gone UKIP-on-steroids. We were already losing researchers - this will speed up the brain drain for sure.

U.K. votes yes to Brexit. Colombia says no to the peace process. Trump has chance of winning. What is going on in the world? 
This is Colombia's Brexit moment. Will leave the country divided, uncertain how to proceed. What a wasted chance to turn the page. 
Colombia is going through its Brexit moment. 
COLOMBIAN BREXIT: Guaranteed congressional seats, stipends FARC, amnesty for terrorism went too far. Colombians voted NO. #ColombiaDecide 
First Brexit, now this. Can we just ban all referendums, already?  
Sad to see Colombia so divided, voting against a historic peace deal. First Brexit, now this, all that's left is for Trump to win in Nov. 
Why did they even have a referendum on this?  
#BREAKING - Colombian voters reject FARC peace deal in referendum  
What a crying shame. Can we all finally agree that referendum is no way to set social policy? #farc #brexit  
From rejection of electoral reform & transit funding in BC, to Brexit, & now news from Colombia: referenda generate perversity in politics. 
First Brexit, now the Colombians. This whole rule by referendum thing not going so well. 
Juan Manuel Santos now joins David Cameron in regretting decision to stage referendum. 
Today's Colombia stunner: a Brexit-style backlash that reflects the political weakness of President Santos & depths of animosity to the FARC 
This was the scene outside #libdems hq today in Witney with people queuing to make a difference and fight brexit  
Colombia is not Brexit. Brexit is not Trump. Trump is not Colombia. Every story has its causes.Analogies are often shortcuts #ColombiaDecide 
I'm a Brit. I live in the EU, exercising my legal right to FOM. UK holds a ref, but won't let me vote. Now their Brexit takes away my FOM. 
It’s comments like this that make me wonder if Brexiteers actually understand even the basics of what Brexit is. It’s *less free trade*.  
BREAKING: Colombian public rejects president's peace deal in referendum vote to keep fighting FARC  
Terribly disappointed about the result in the Colombian referendum #Colombiadecide 
#BREAKING Colombians reject FARC peace plan in referendum: near-complete results

Voice of the Mirror: Theresa May hasn't told us any details on Brexit since she hasn't a clue herself  
#Brexit effect on #Europe's singles performance in the #RyderCup : Brits all lost and Europe's only point winners were the other Europeans! 
There’s no mandate for Brexit & never was. Tories know this full well but don’t give a damn. For them it’s just another power opportunity. 
Ex-minister Nicky Morgan says ‘hard Brexit’ risks encouraging ‘intolerance & bigotry’. The opposite is true. EU policies encourage strife. 
Says the guy from the country that used xenophobia to propagate BrexitAnd continues to stoke racial hatred...*sigh*  
Mental note: don't ever call for a referendum if you don't have a plan in case you lose #Colombia #Brexit 
Do Ruth Davidson MSP and David Mundell Secretary of State for Scotland*truly* believe #Brexit is best for Scotland?They supported  #Remain 
Farage was enraged when Obama opined on Brexit. Now he thinks he can tell Americans to vote Trump. If they knew who he was.. they might care 
A Tory PM at the @ConHome party promising to deliver #Brexit and praising @LordAshcroft. Wouldn't have happened last year. 
The PM is wholly wrong to lock Wales, Scotland & NI out of Brexit strategy and negotiations. This is our future too  
The Prime Minister: "There are journalists in the room. They ask me what Brexit means. It means we're leaving the European Union." 
Would the last business to leave Brexit Britain please switch off the lights? We'll not be able to pay the Hinkley Point electricity bill. 
#Brexit damages our health, our country, our future.  
Today the PM has rejected giving #Wales a place at the Brexit table. Now @fmwales will you strike back or remain quiet? The choice is yours. 
Three cheers for my MP, @nickherbertmp, for this courageous attack on the ideologues pushing Hard Brexit.  
The BBC are acting like remoaning idiots, like asking "are we nearly there yet" knowing its too early to ask, BBC you lost the referendum. 
I have only one question for #CPC16:How do you propose paying for Brexit? 
Although, you know, she was against brexit three months ago.  
The 7 Brits contributed 0 points today for Europe. There's a #brexit joke in there somewhere... #RyderCup

I thought referendum was about taking back power not giving it to one woman who won't let our Parliament have a say?  
Don't trust Brexit 'three blind mice', says Tory former minister  
BBC is still fighting the referendum. Will every evening news bulletin about #Brexit for 2 years sound like mourning, or will it be longer? 
It's like Brexit all over again.  
Theresa May has issued two crucial pronouncements on Brexit  
The City of London will be fine after Brexit – and a vengeful Europe would be shooting itself in the foot  
the dreadful @andrealeadsom thinks the solution to Brexit mess is for everyone to become fruit pickers 
Brexit process to begin by March with demand for clean break  Let them go.The Lib Dems will win and reverse Brexit 
Two fingers up to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland from Theresa May re Brexit. We shall be 'consulted' and kept in our lowly places. 
USA win the #RyderCup . They played truly stunning golf. No recriminations necessary for Europe. Not sure we can even blame Brexit. 
Tory MP @nickherbertmp warns party of "Brexit fundamentalism - a romanticised 1950s vision of Britain, a country of imperialist chauvinism" 
Westwood, Rose, Willett, Fitzpatrick, Sullivan, Wood - once again the English deciding they'd rather not contribute to Europe. #Brexit 
#bbcnews This seems to be what #TheresaMay thinks the 48% (and disillusioned #Brexit supporters) should do:  
BBC relief as Brexit finally delivers some bad news. :) #RyderCup Congratulations USA. 
After promising full #Brexit engagement with devolved gov.s Theresa May unilaterally announces Article 50 timetable.  
Now that PM May has said Brexit will be triggered by end of March, here are some thoughts on what it meas for nature  
Viktor Orban organized a completely meaningless referendum on EU migration to boost his standing & lost. Serves him right! He did a Cameron.

There was an 82-14% vote in referendum in Sweden against moving to driving on right but a sensible government upheld parliamentary democracy  
Theresa May gives clearest indication yet that UK is headed for a hard Brexit outside the European single market  
Nick Herbert sets out why hard Brexit would be an economic disaster. 
Brave!  Starts to feel like the resistance to a totalitarian regime.Pro-EU Tory rebels plan to fight 'harsh Brexit'  
A strong @LibDems vote in the #WitneyByElection would be a strong sign that we don't accept the #Brexit path the May government is pursuing.

Don't trust Brexit 'three blind mice', says Tory former minister  
MIke is right. We've got to be a bit more assertive in representing the Scottish interest in this disastrous Brexit.  
May on collision course with Tory backbenchers over 'hard Brexit'  
So now we know for sure: Theresa May is going for a harder edge of a Brexit, without free movement or single market  
Why didn’t Theresa May campaign for Brexit?

The people of Hungary send a positive signal by staying away from a referendum which promoted hatred against refugees. Referendum invalid.  
Peace is the only way forward-- Colombian voters poised to back peace deal with Farc in referendum

Brexit means @Brexit from now on  
"We've got an amazing plan. It's a tremendous plan." No details offered. Trump vagary and Brexit bravado are eerily similar. 
Without a parliamentary vote to trigger Article 50, Tory party will effectively dictate all Brexit terms for all UK.Sovereignty=Tory RW rule  
"Referendum to join the EU in 2003 also failed to achieve a 50 percent turnout,  yet was accepted" by the #EU as valid enough... #Hungary

UPDATE: Hungary referendum turnout 43.7%, #vote not valid – election committee  #refugee #quotas 
Fair play to the Leavers, though.  This has been their best day since the referendum result.  But it still words from May, not substance. 
Hungary referendum: 95% of Hungarians voted against the EU migrant quotas ─►  
On Brexit, huge amount of noise today. It looks like it may translate to action. But complex difficulties still there, when the noise fades. 
.@anncaswell2 In all seriousness the BBC will probably have to make some changes to its rabidly anti-Brexit staff now things are moving. 
This, from @PrivateEyeNews, putting it bluntly. #Brexit  
History will come to view #Brexit as the single greatest act of self sabotage in post war history. Absolutely no doubt about it. #CPC16 
Apologies for the lack of Brexit commentary today, I was still watching @LukeCage. Some things are more important than politics and law. 
Glad Orban's politics of fear was rejected today. Millions of Hungarians with their boycot clearly said no to hate & deception #referendum 
Lord Lawson says we should hold ratification of the Paris climate deal until after Brexit, and decide for ourselves. He's right. 
Boris Johnson: Brexit vote was a liberation  
We don't really know if BREXIT is going to be a problem yet.Same with you guys & Trump.  
If this country was granted a referendum on whether or not to scrap the BBC, there'd rapidly be a lot of witless Leftards out of a job. 
Brexit is like knowingly following a dodgy  satnav 'cos you're too embarrassed to return it to Argos.

@Jacques_Hughes One man made the referendum possible - it rhymes with Garage 
British Government has no idea what Brexit means – @M_McGuinness_SF  
Common sense from @Mike_Fabricant on how it's not as black and white as Hard V Soft #Brexit  
In five years or so Boris Johnson will look into the lens of a TV camera and confidently state: "I opposed Brexit from the start" 
the difference between a soft brexit and a hard brexit is whether you dressed as margaret thatcher like I asked 
The sheer arrogance and stupidity of "Brexit blueprint" idea of saying "take it or leave it" so soon after rejecting EU is very worrying  
In spite of incredible gov. hate propaganda, HU quota referendum well below validity treshold. My country is wiser than they thought. 
#Hungary. The anti-immigration referendum is failed. Glad that the majority of Hungarian people reject the #Orban's positions on #migrants 
More than 3 million vote no in #QuotaReferendum. That’s more than voted to join the EU in the 2003 referendum 
Boris Johnson: BBC is 'infuriatingly anti-Brexit' but remains 'single greatest ambassador of our culture'  
There's a difference between what politicians *can* do and what they *should* do. Electoral changes should be legitimized via a referendum.  
BBC still being Anti Brexit. May needs to overhaul the BBC after we are out of the EU. A divisive disgrace which hates the people of the UK. 
Hungary referendum on EU migrant quotas invalid, less than 50% turnout  
MEANWHILE: “MPs opposing #Brexit insult the British people’s intelligence” says Theresa May of a campaign which did exactly that. Every day. 
What will govt do if unempt starts to rise & firms announce cuts in investmnt & empt & close U.K Plants as they learn of Fox Brexit plans?

So presumably now PM has rejected FM's "red line" re: a Scottish opt-out from #Brexit NS will use her own conf speech to announce #indyref2? 
So Theresa May wants hard #brexit, UK having a bespoke relationship with EU. And wants this relationship negotiated in 2 years. Good luck.

Theresa May’s speech was not vacuous. It contained clear rejection of Norway/Swiss-type deals & signalled “hard Brexit” (1/5)

"Come on" says PM to those taking court case on Article 50..."Brexit means Brext and we're going to make a success of it" - massive applause 
The way Theresa May talks about Brexit--'sovereign, independent nation', 'govern ourselves'--you wonder why she voted Remain 
8. We are already speaking about the direction in which we take book 2, in a post Brexit climate. But now is not then. 
Another reason why "hard Brexit" would be bad news for #Wales. @Plaid_Cymru 
The EU27 vs the Brexit 1. Let's see how that goes....

This isn't even close to the Brexit starting gun. Triggering Article 50 will start Brexit, nothing else.

We've moved on from "Brexit means Brexit" to "How Brexit WILL mean Brexit" - conclusion to my blog on the Great Repeal Bill 
May managing Brexit is like Mao managing a 5 year plan. Everyone knows it's complete idiocy, but it's important to manage that idiocy well. 
I can't help but think that the majority of the Brexit conversations going on at number 10 are mainly how to con Scotland into accepting it. 
The Great Repeal Bill is to Brexit what scaffolding is to renovating a building. An important device, but not the renovation itself. 
Key point is that the government *doesn't* commit to further devolution in light of Brexit (but nor is it ruled out).

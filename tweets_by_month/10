Pro-EU extremists at @Channel4News seem desperate for #Nissan news to be reported in a cynical, negative light.They can't accept #Brexit
So, Nissan know more about the gov't's plans for #Brexit than the country or our Parliament. And this, apparently, is "taking back control".
EU diplomats say that Scotland has become a welcoming haven for EU nationals since the #Brexit referendum!

@theresa_may Dear Madam, If a massive company like #Nissan needs to be 'shielded' from its effects, then maybe we should reconsider #Brexit?
.@DavidMundellDCT's approach to #Brexit is essentially "the tories got Scotland into this mess, but what are @theSNP going to do to fix it?"
Tories have turned #brexit into an all-you-can-eat buffet for corporations. They're grabbing all the welfare they can fit in their vaults.
So Nissan & City of London to be protected from negative effects of #brexit using money from tax payers who will get no protection at all.
And if #Nissan gets a post- #Brexit blank cheque, do Honda, Opel/GM, BMW, Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover/Tata get the same?
When you accidentally walk into a Conservative party conference in 2016.#brexit

2016 and a desperate #brexit Tory govt underwrites Sunderland Nissan "unconditionally". Different story back in 1984 in Bathgate of course. 
If this was what @johnmcdonnellMP said today-then he nailed it.#johnmcdonnell#Brexit
With #Brexit  tories will be like  Soviets Union when it comes to speaking about our economy-all lies all the time. 
If anyone doubted the #RichmondPark election would be about #brexit they need wonder no longer! #LibDems #winninghere
It's balls to #Brexit in #Richmond. Come on @UKLabour, do the right thing. We need to choose our battles sensibly if we are to win the war.
This alone should make the gov stamp on the brakes & put any idea of #Brexit in the bin. 
So, post-#Brexit the UK's doors are open to more corp welfare, inducements, sweeteners, compensation. Wonder what that'll cost us? #Nissan
#Brexit Inflation is the wrong story says No 10, as PM struggles to control #Brexit narrative!
#Brexit economicsPM on #NHS:"There is no money"PM on #Nissan:"Please don't leave. Here, this should cover it"Nissan:"That will do nicely"
Interesting to know the final tally of costs related to compensating businesses for #Brexit. I'm sure staying in the EU would be cheaper!
After #brexit dont forget to put your clocks back 47 years until when Harold Wilson devalued the pound Tories have devalued it by 168 years
#Nissan Sunderland to become a super plant. Gold dust to the misguided #Brexit city  
Is Nissan just the tip of a very expensive iceberg?Govt must give breakdown of all costs incurred due to #Brexit& prove UK can afford.
Three big mistakes the government has made in its #Brexit talks : 
#FMQs Nicola "Scottish Tories don't want us to collaborate with the UK Gov. on #Brexit, they want us to do what they've done - capitulate!"
Bubble about to pop? Bonds slump deepens on shifting policy outlook. 10y Gilt yields at highest since #Brexit vote.

No deal with the EU will ever be as good - nowhere near as good - as staying in the EU. That is why #Brexit must be stopped. 
How about fighting against #Brexit?That would work even better for the British people
There is no business case for #brexit. 
.@johnmcdonnellMP hates a "chaotic breakfast" - becoming the latest politician to mix up #Brexit and a morning meal 
Good news for UK economy today - GDP, Nissan investment & CBI retail sales survey. But full #Brexit impact will unfold in years not months.
A decision which defies the #Brexit pessimists: @Nissan confirms it will build new Qashqai model at its plants in (Leave voting) Sunderland
Clear that May agreed to cushion #Brexit for Nissan but apparently we taxpayers & voters are not allowed to know the details. #bbcnews

#Nissan will build new Qashqai (& X-Trail SUV) in Sunderland. 1st major decision for car industry since #Brexit vote 
Taking back control of UK fishing rights and territorial waters can only be secured with a clean #Brexit via leaving the single market.

The Treasury forecast this would be -0.1% after #Brexit vote...

German papers: UK now "uncool Britannia", "UKIP-land", where "tone has changed" "mocking of foreigners"  #brexit

Ha. European Council giving May time to talk about #Brexit only during coffee after dinner!    
Feel like the British are loving this right now. #Brexit should've been the dumbest political shitting of the bed this year. But Trump.

17.4million voters is NOT to be ignored. These remoaning MPs best take note. #Brexit means Over and OUT of the Corrupt EU. No FOM. The end.

#Brexit is “opportunity”, say Scottish fishermen
And will it include the option to reject #Brexit altogether? It will be a scam if it is just 'this Brexit or that.' NB. 
Starmer move is welcome: but Parliament should FIRST debate whether to accept the 'advice' of 25% of population, before any talk of #Brexit.
Someone needs to start getting honest with the people who believed there'd be an extra £350m a week. #Brexit

If Treasury figures correct £66bn the cost of Tory and Labour deluded arrogance as they both favour hard #brexit
Conveniently surfaced documents say #Brexit might cost the Treasury £66 billion a year. Another figure plucked from the sky by Remainers.
So #Brexit is costing £66bn & Trident costing £167bn, can someone again please explain #BetterTogether #indyref2
There is no mandate for #Brexit. That is the great & important truth that must be fought for.
An extract from a leaked UKGov paper spelling out just how disastrous #Brexit will be. 
Hard #Brexit, like that planned by UKGov, could cost the economy £66Billion. That means jobs go, wealth lost and public services damaged.

It all gets more and more unbelievable. #Brexit-speak: a quarter of the population is an 'overwhelming mandate.' Orwellian.

Their long cherished idea in #Commons of parliament being sovereign now gone in #Brexit smoke -people r sovereign they say now #Useful4Scot
Another constitutional nugget from the #Brexit Secretary: "Crown prerogative rests on the will of the people." Making it up as he goes along
More bad #Brexit arithmetic: David Davis tells Commons Brexit has an "overwhelming" mandate. In what world is 51.9% v 48.1% overwhelming?
A shocking lack of detail from David Davis. The decision matters to every one of us, yet the Government is being utterly opaque. #Brexit
The Government has no mandate for their hard #Brexit. No vote in the Commons, no election. Where is the democracy in that?
.@nick_clegg is clear: there must be a parliamentary vote on the #Brexit negotiations & Govt strategy

"Where is the Govt's mandate for negotiations" says @ed_miliband in #Brexit statement - here's what he said this morning on @victorialive
The #Brexit Secretary is also unable to distinguish between a mandate to leave the EU and a mandate to negotiate particular exit terms

Problem w/No votes in UK w/#Brexit & #Colombia is that "better deals" supposedly voted for have no serious formulations & motivated by fear.
2016 is the Year of Magical Thinking: I don't have a plan but it's better than yours. #Brexit #ColombiaDecide #Trump
Actual negotiators would do no such thing as trade insults with EU counterparties. Only #Brexit ministers are so stupid and unpatriotic.

After the results of #Brexit, #ColombiaDecide and recent news I'm starting to think #Trump is going to be elected.
Could someone tell @Telegraph that avalanches rarely set people free but instead generally bury them in snow. #brexit 
So, referenda are having a good year #Brexit #ColombiaDecide
#New Yorker #ColombiaDecide  Today, Colombians have followed #Brexit trend & voted against peace deal, throwing country into a major crisis.
The UN should create a new country with those that voted Yes for #brexit, No Peace in COL and will vote for Trump.
Brexit: Mrs May rejects everything – and nothing ... a clever speech, or very clever?  #Brexit. 
Five key points in the UK's #Brexit strategy 
What a crying shame. Can we all finally agree that referendum is no way to set social policy? #farc #brexit 
Excellent, have just found out I'm eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship now based on my job offer. Bye #Brexit Britain!
Mental note: don't ever call for a referendum if you don't have a plan in case you lose #Colombia #Brexit
UK PM @theresa_may has good reason for refusing to discuss her approach to #Brexit: no tenable plan exists 
#Brexit damages our health, our country, our future. 
The 7 Brits contributed 0 points today for Europe. There's a #brexit joke in there somewhere... #RyderCup

BBC is still fighting the referendum. Will every evening news bulletin about #Brexit for 2 years sound like mourning, or will it be longer?
How ironic: #Brexit won't give sovereignty to Parliament; but will increase gov't power: May’s “Great Repeal Bill” 
Westwood, Rose, Willett, Fitzpatrick, Sullivan, Wood - once again the English deciding they'd rather not contribute to Europe. #Brexit
#bbcnews This seems to be what #TheresaMay thinks the 48% (and disillusioned #Brexit supporters) should do: 
After promising full #Brexit engagement with devolved gov.s Theresa May unilaterally announces Article 50 timetable. 
A strong @LibDems vote in the #WitneyByElection would be a strong sign that we don't accept the #Brexit path the May government is pursuing.
'I voted #brexit as I was sick and tired of unelected foreigners deciding government policy. 
.@RuthDavidsonMSP said just after #Brexit she wanted to stay in the single market even if it meant free movement of labour. What changed? 
Theresa May's position on a hard #brexit in one picture. 
Strong piece from Will Hutton: if hard #Brexit means trading only on WTO rules UK car industry could be hit severely 
The effect of Theresa May's Great Repeal Act will be to include all EU legislation into UK law. So what, then, is the point of #Brexit?
Here's hoping other companies will follow example of Nissan & Jaguar Land Rover by reminding #ConservativeConference of the risks of #Brexit
Liberal, Pro-European, pro-business member of the Conservatives? There's only one home for you now #LibDems #Brexit 
#Brexit Theresa May is a "One Nation" Conservative, and it's clear from the Tory conference that the One Nation is "Little England".
Reality must be hitting the more open-minded No voters. #indyref2 #Brexit 
Welcome announcement Theresa May. Essential for EU that #Brexit is completed ahead of European elections in 2019. 
Theresa's Vow: To treat Scotland with the contempt it deserves for voting No #Brexit #Indyref2
Common sense from @Mike_Fabricant on how it's not as black and white as Hard V Soft #Brexit 
Very very good. Watch for a giggle and a good long think about #Brexit 
MEANWHILE: “MPs opposing #Brexit insult the British people’s intelligence” says Theresa May of a campaign which did exactly that. Every day.
#Brexit #PM @Theresa_May is going to do something that in April she said wasn’t in #Britain’s best interest. Share: 
Here are the Scottish products that will lose EU protected status after #Brexit. 
Britain to start EU divorce by end of March 2017 #Brexit 
So presumably now PM has rejected FM's "red line" re: a Scottish opt-out from #Brexit NS will use her own conf speech to announce #indyref2?
So Theresa May wants hard #brexit, UK having a bespoke relationship with EU. And wants this relationship negotiated in 2 years. Good luck.
One of my favourite passages from Theresa May's #Brexit speech, in which the Attorney-General is weaponised in the service of democracy 
Theresa May tells UK economy it has six month to live  #SATIRE #Brexit #Marr #CPC16
@LeanneWood tells Theresa May "the real divisive nationalists are on her own side" when it comes to #Brexit

No vision, no explanation of what #Brexit means, just Jocks get back in your box.

So there we have it. Hard #Brexit. Devastation for Scotland's food and drink industry, life sciences, and what's left of our oil industry.
For those of you not worried enough by the Tories approach to #Brexit...today just made it worse 
The conference of an unelected Prime Minister whose party took power through electoral fraud #CPC16 #Brexit
Today's news on #Brexit proves that the leadership of both major UK political parties are in thrall to their populist base.
When a Country ignores the views of its young , logic, fact and expertise we can assume big trouble ahead. #brexit
Time to remind Nicola Sturgeon and her followers once more what the the #EURef question was: #CPC16 #Brexit #OpenBritain

Time for miserable drunkards like Soubry to put up, shut up or join the Labour Party. #Brexit is happening. Britain is happening. 
If you've not already worked out Tories are rattled, used best opportunity to say what #Brexit means to attack independence movement. #CPC16

Great news.  #Article50 #Brexit 
Speaking in Dublin Alex Salmond says that Theresa May's news on #Brexit could trigger another Independence Referendum in Scotland. 
YOUR COMMENTS: “…expelling of those considered unfit for the honour of living in Britain.” #Brexit 
Still abiding sense that #Brexit is being pursued solely as function of UK political agenda, w no thought to EU27 dynamics.
The long term interest of the country will never be #Brexit. Leaving the #EU will be a shortsighted and catastrophic decision 
#bbcsp @afneil So,still facing the same divisions & difficult choices (hard v soft #Brexit etc) as two months ago:
Read @elliebrodie's blog: why reform of agriculture policy following #Brexit is so important 
#Brexit --which was never going to happen, remember?-- gets under way in 6 months PM May announces: 
No answers frm @RuthDavidsonMSP on protecting Scottish interests in #Brexit negotiations & no understanding of single market @Sun_Pol_Scot
So watching UK PM May's #Brexit interview, and - bluntly - it's much worse than I feared. Looks like they have no idea what they're doing.
.@Anna_Soubry does not speak 4 us; on 23.06.16 she & rest of gvt were given a clear instruction 2 take us out of #EU. #Brexit #repealbill

Good news: Article 50 will be triggered by the end of March, along with millions of authoritarian, democracy hating euro-SJWs  #Brexit
I was 6 years old when the 1972 EC Act was passed. Since then I've been a European. Repealing it is like repealing my life. #Remain #Brexit 
#bbcsp #Brexit what have we done? When a man like Grayling starts telling us that Human Rights Act will no longer apply to UK I FEEL FEAR
The beginning of a great parliamentary rebellion on #Article50 #Brexit ? Cross-party support to resist repeal? 
Diane Abbott as a bigot and racist gets worse and worse. She slanders people who love their country. @UKIP #Brexit
.@Anna_Soubry and @jessphillips discuss whether MPs in #Remain areas will vote for #Brexit in parliament following the referendum result. 
Saying #Brexit can be negotiated in 2years reminds me of a time a builder said he could do my loft conversion in 2 months. Not going2happen.
No, we don't. We're as baffled by #Brexit as any other intelligent person who doesn't live in a jingoistic fantasy 
Italy PM Matteo Renzi has a lot to learn from David Cameron's #Brexit vote mistakes 
This is a very good analysis of the #Brexit Bill - essentially a coup by the PM at expense of parliament & a legal/ legislative nightmare

Triggering #Brexit as early as March is really troubling says @Anna_Soubry

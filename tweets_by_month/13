Meet the European Parliament’s #Brexit negotiator: @GuyVerhofstadt #Newsnight (video from 2012)
They despise our will to #BrexitThey despise the US will to elect #PresidentTrump They are marinated in hate and stupidity, equal measure
#ginamiller risked her life to throw MPs a lifeline on #Brexit, but they are too cowardly to take it 
If they kill off @EmiliaFox (Nikki) I will be starting one of those petitions they had when #Brexit was voted in! #SilentWitness #canttakeit
Let's face facts #brexit will be controlled by Tories not Labour & even if Labour comes to power in 2020 the damage will be too great to fix
I rather like Guy Verhofstadt. There, I said it. #newsnight #Article50 #brexit 
Politicians with incomes and wealth that will always be safe & secure even if #brexit is a horrible disaster will trigger #Article50.
Interesting idea from @GuyVerhofstadt about offering dual EU citizenship for Brits. Some of us are European and British #newsnight #brexit
Little in the UK press about Trump's planned trade war with China. By #Brexit-time, there may no longer be a WTO.

This is why Britain voted to Leaf, not Romaine, in the European Union #Brexit #SaladGate
. @GuyVerhofstadt said #Brexit could be a “golden opportunity” for “new partnership between the EU and Britain". Big tone change.
#Taoiseach: ‘Any manifestation of hard Irish #border would have very negative consequences’ #Brexit @EndaKennyTD
We are NOT out yet! We want #article50 now. The British People want HARD #brexit and we are watching. 
good, but blocking #brexit would protect us from this megalomaniac who would drag us down if art50 is passed, it must not.
Thank you for #brexit...€600Billion Euros!Sounds like a good divorce deal right...?NOT! #brexitshambles #Newsnight
Don't forget #Brexit in the UK boosted Trump to the White House as Brexit +++. 
#Brexit can & will be defeated. Today proves that the masses are agitated & @theresa_may is playing with matchsticks.

Hearing #Verhofstadt and other #EUcrats  fear of #Trump and #Brexit, assures me we are on the right track !
Britain has done just as much as Trump to throw both #Refugees & migrants under the bus & #Brexit will be the 5:15 tram to finish them off
Farage supporting Muslim ban. There you have it, #brexit was about racism, nothing else.
There's was no romance about @GuyVerhofstadt words in London today. Just the raw truth.#Brexit #Europe #Trump #Putin

Andrew Tyrie, Treasuy Select Cmme has 14 points on #Brexit made to @UKandEU today. My paraphrasing from his speech.
In my youth a Tory PM appeased Hitler giving him Europe today in my old age a Tory PM appeases Trump &  will give him Britain thro #brexit.
Considering #theresaMay has proven she is a callow leader when it comes to Trump or big buisiness we need a referendum on #brexit whitepaper
The #Brexit majority was 1,269,501 and has been called the 'will of the people'. This petition has just passed that. 
If it wasn't for #Brexit putting the UK in an incredibly weak position, UK govt wouldn't be sucking up to tyrants like Trump and Erdogan
so #brexit is not just about leaving, its about destroying it for others who may want it. Thats how kids behave, isn't it? 
No10: "We won't carry out populist gestures just because ppl are angrily demanding we do something." Does this mean #Brexit is cancelled?

Hard #Brexit madness: 46%, of exports from urban centres go to the EU, just 15% to the US & 4% to China #Remain
27% in favour of a referendum before #Brexit negotiations and 23% after. In other words, around 50% are in favour of another referendum. 
#Labour grassroots revolt gathers pace over Corbyn’s backing for Theresa May's #Brexit bill : via @labourlist

Great to see our #YoungVoices group meeting @KZapponeTD at today's youth forum on #brexit in Croke Park  #LetsTalkBrexit #NoBordersNoWalls
'#Brexit & #Trump are entangled. Labour must rethink its #Article50 stance'But it won't, and history will remember
BBC source reportedly said a rejection of Trump state visit would be a “populist gesture” & would “undo everything.” What?! Unlike #Brexit!
Bang! The petition to prevent Trump from making a State Visit to the UK passed 1.000.000 signatures.#Brexit #Trump
I find it depressing that #Brexit now has us grovelling at the feet of a bully for the scraps from his table.
Downing St says banning Trump would be a "populist gesture". What, you mean like #Brexit? Oh, you only like populist gestures that serve you
Theresa May who is shamelessly sucking up to the world's most rabid populist says it's populist to want to block his state visit!#Brexit
If you think this is unfair, you won't have a right to go to the ECJ after #Brexit 
Denmark's Novo Nordisk to invest £115m in new science research centre in Oxford. UK will thrive post #Brexit. 
UK's anti-Trump petition dismissed by May as "a populist gesture", apparently. So what was the #Brexit Leave vote then?
Not one US newspapers put Theresa May's US visit on front page.#Brexit supporters need to face UKs insignificance!
Just vote against triggering Article 50; #Brexit is based on lies like this - reject it outright. 
Most politicians know #Brexit will be disastrous for UK & is nothing like what was voted for. They should have balls to DO THE RIGHT THING.
Anyone & I mean anyone who supports #Brexit hands power to maniacs like #Trump(eg Boris, Gove, IDS, Priti Patel...)
If news about Downing St rejecting to debate petition to cancel Trump's state visit is true. Then #Brexit independence was pointless. 
If it wasn't for #Brexit putting the UK in an incredibly weak position, UK govt wouldn't be sucking up to tyrants like Trump and Erdogan.
You have to laugh at the devolved institutions wasting our taxes drawing up " plans to have full access to Single Market" post #Brexit 
#Brexit is about ensuring #Britain is run by the #British not unelected bureaucrats#Article50 #BrexitBritain #OpenBritain #No2EU #LeaveEU
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day! @DavidDavisMP should follow his own logic and allow second thoughts about disastrous #brexit 
To all MPs: The situation has changed. It just got so much bigger than #Brexit - look at the whole picture before you vote for #Article50
Downing St rejects petition to ban Donald Trump state visit. Utterly out of touch & wanting to appease a bully #brexit #TrumpBan #MuslimBan

Go from photo 1 to photo 2.Awkward.... #Brexit #TrumpBan
A guilty verdict can be overturned on appeal if it's found out that  prosecution deliberately withheld evidence Leave did that for #brexit 
The British people voted to take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade - that means leaving the EU’s Single Market #Brexit
All she did was to ensure that parliament was sovereignty by making sure the PM couldn't take peoples rights without it's approval. #Brexit 
March 25th has become more than #Brexit because #Brexit is a doorway to 1936 Fascism in 2017. It's your chance to reverse it. Be there.

UK Universities are heavily dependent on academics from the EU. #Brexit. 
World events are moving at an astonishing speed. The #Brexit vote is already looking obsolete. Parliament needs to proceed with care now.

#brexit will leads us to the corrupt, immoral and unstable orbit of #donaldtrump and that will spell the end of Britain's society & economy
It's now clear that the best case for reversing #brexit is that we can stand with Europe against #Trump rather than having to cosy up to him
#Brexit A lot of people voted to leave the EU last year in good faith. The world has changed. Now we have a choice to make. Europe or Trump?

Theresa May with her #Brexit will deliver us on a silver platter to Donald Trump and there will be no jobs, no wage increases only austerity
With #TheresaMay as PM #brexit will reduce Britain to a vassal state of Donald Trump's America without democracy & shorn of compassion.

Theresa May, the Neville Chamberlain of the 21st Century in her appeasement of Trump. History will not treat her kindly. #Brexit #Remain
Britain needs a leader not an appeaser. Time for Theresa May to go. #brexit
To be quite honest I think the Tories need to replace Theresa May as PM she is not fit to lead in still waters let alone a tempest. #brexit
Says Nigel Farage whose political influence appears to have been bought by the money of Arron Banks & the hate & lies of the #Brexit press 
After how Theresa May grovelled to Donald Trump & condoned through silence his human rights abuses she's not fit to lead us through #Brexit
The working classes whose interests Labour once aspired to represent voted for #Brexit en masse.This is its final betrayal of them. 
Erdogan, President of a much poorer & more vulnerable country stands up to Trump on refugees while Theresa May grovels. #Remain #Brexit 
#The_Observer on #Brexit " ... a return to the narrow, delusional world of Little England."  #indyref2

The election of #PresidentTrump and the decision to #Brexit has exposed the hateful intolerance of the regresssive left to democracy.

The @BBC is trying to sabotage Britain's trade deal with US. They are terrified #Brexit becomes a success story!
Now then will this bare fruit for U.K and #Brexit But a good start you must admit? 
In her attempts to by-pass legal & Parliamentary checks on #Brexit, Theresa May shows a Trump-like disrespect for restraints on her power.
"May's visit to the US shows how much less sovereignty Britain has since #brexit... Britain has no choice."Well done everyone. #newsnight

To be honest - #UKIP or #Labour - not that much difference - both united in support of #Brexit #MPsAgainstArticle50
A proper @UKLabour would not surrender to a 4% majority, it would work to persuade #Leave voters that Tory #Brexit is not what they want.

 @KeithBrownSNP on the threat of hard Tory #Brexit - to jobs, investment, household incomes & living standards. 
OPPORTUNITY: We're looking for ambassadors across UK to represent us at events in your area. Have your say on #Brexit AND get paid for it! 
Be under no illusions, this #EU project has always been about power and not the people of Europe.#Brexit
The EU's CFP has been a diaster for Scotland. #Brexit gives us a chance to rebuild our great fishing industry 
Trade deals after #Brexit could give firms the power to overturn UK laws protecting the NHS 
To sum up the moral of the day's news: Fight #Brexit!
Of course. @DanielZeichner is the MP for Cambridge (overwhelmingly for Remain) & #Brexit is already damaging what he is charged to protect. 
Two Labour whips defy Jeremy Corbyn on article 50 vote on #brexit
My reasoned amendment. I urge all MPs opposing an extreme cliff edge #Brexit to support it. 
Perhaps not, but voting for *this* #Brexit bill, which gives Theresa May free rein with *no* caveats, IS voting with the Tories. 
Britain is expected to begin talks on a number of high profile trade deals ahead of quitting the EU... #Brexit

My admiration and applause to @TulipSiddiq for her stand on #Brexit. Thank you for demonstrating what it is to be principled and strong.

Hey #Brexit fans - remember you said we had to vote leave to protects the #NHS from a trade deal? How's that going?
Tulip Siddiq was elected by her constituents to represent THEM. They voted to REMAIN.I support Tulip's decision NOT to support #Brexit bill 
Tulip Siddiq has my respect - MPs "have a general duty to act in the interests of the nation as a whole." They cannot allow #Brexit.
So as Corbyn lines up his troops to vote for a Tory #Brexit , once more it's left to @theSNP to be the main opposition.

#Brexit.The unthinkable in the hands of the incompetent. If Parliament doesn't tear this fiasco to shreds it will be utterly shameful.
And as I have said before - I think a 3 line whip on this is wrong. We should respect different views of MPs and their constituents. #Brexit
Ex Blairite, Cabinet ministers will vote against #Brexit in an attempt to unseat #Corbyn.Disgraceful behaviour on constitutional issues.
A Labour frontbencher resigns over triggering Article 50, confirming that - somehow - the first #Brexit Commons crisis is a Labour one.

Naturally we must respect the referendum vote just as we should respect people when they hand all their money away to tv evangelists #brexit
Numbers are rising. The balance will eventually tip. The tide will turn. Vote with hope not fear. Stop #Brexit. Save Britain and Europe. 
If Remainers are so democratic, why do they insist on subverting the will of the people?   #Brexit

We'll be negotiating with US from a position of weakness & they've said they'll exploit #brexit to screw us. But don't worry. We've got him. 
Tories have failed to deliver powers they promised, tried to cut Scotland's budget at every opportunity and caused the #Brexit shambles.

.@NicolaSturgeon fears PM's #Brexit plan will be "economically catastrophic"; no evidence Scotland being listened to
Now that #TheresaMay has confirmed #12pointplan to #Brexit #BBC news presenters reduced to playing solemn music & wearing black armbands 
What a mean, miserable, insular little country #brexit portends
#Sturgeon:Second #referendum now 'more likely' after May's #Brexit speechNicola,I'd call your bluff!Go for it!
You see #Brexit is going to take a very long time but we will start feeling the cuts very soon as for the benefits? Not in your life time.
I'll walk away from #Brexit talks if we don't get the right deal, says Theresa May 
My #brexit in 1534 allowed me to wed Anne Boleyn. Which ended w me hiring a French swordsman. So trade w Europe cont'd is what I'm saying.
So that lasted what, less than three hours??? #Brexit 'Brexit will happen even if MPs vote down deal in Parliament'

Theresa May's #Brexit confidence is deeply misguided - me for @cnni
.@Theresa_May has made clear that she is determined to use #Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven 
Don't be fooled #brexit means the end of the Welfare State, the privatisation of the NHS and our nation becoming a tax-free haven.

Congrats, Theresa Mayhem. You did it. #Brexit #Ukip
May's message in short. The reason for the leaving the EU is to restrict immigration. In order to do so we'll fudge everything else. #brexit

Looks like Theresa May is selling the UK down the river. Only @LibDems are arguing for a sensible departure. Labour r nowhere #brexit 
It's not a free vote when your decisions were based upon fake news, prejudice and intellectual coercion . #brexit 
Tim Farron doesn't like #brexit or democracy and what the UK will become post #brexit - a global outlooking nation. 
Actually feel ashamed to be British. @theresa_may making it clear #Brexit is about keeping other Europeans out of the UK. Just sickening.
This is a con. Parliament should be debating right now, on whether to enter a #Brexit 'negotiation' in the first place. And saying No. 
If you're rich you'll survive #brexit b/c you always walk away from calamities but for everyone else it will be a mean and cruel era for you

So May's #brexit speech is 'like a UKIP conference speech' (Nuttall) and 'accepted Labour's Brexit priorities' (Starmer). Chilling ... #fb
Tory response to #Brexit will be to attract money by making UK tax haven for rich. No tax money will mean no public services. Tory heaven.

Britain is embarking on the most complex negotiation in its modern history without even a White Paper. Extraordinary. Scary. #Brexit
Back in July, Ruth Davidson was clear - she supported remaining in the single market. What's changed? #Brexit 
Scotland’s Future White Paper was 650 pages. May’s #Brexit plan is waffle in a speech. That’s beyond shit. 
Sad process, surrealistic times but at least more realistic announcement on #Brexit. EU27 united and ready to negotiate after Art. 50.
Why is a tax haven Britain so worrying? Look at our NHS. Taxes pay for our public services, without proper funding they collapse.#Brexit
What's being proposed is "purple" (Ukip) #brexit. This is clearly not what the majority voted for in the referendum.
Germany has far bigger exports to non-EU countries than Britain. Nonsense that the EU hinders our trade #Brexit

Since there will be a vote on #brexit you must begin to Lobby your MP that you are against it today and everyday. #Globalbritain
An informed reaction to Theresa May’s speech. #Brexit 
Plenty of Leave voters wanted to stay in the Single Market - there is no majority and there has been no vote for hard Brexit.#Brexit
Jeremy Corbyn must be furious that Theresa May is delivering the #Brexit he has always wanted but he isn't allowed to say.
After Theresa's May #Brexit speech, it's clear Brits better brush up on their flint knapping skills.

I wonder how many civil servants (and politicians) feel right now like Tory minister Anthony Nutting just before the Suez War. #Brexit 
Dear #Brexit fans. Take a peek at number 3. Think about the slashed public services attached to tax slashing. It's tin hat time. Well done! 
#brexit : Our free reminder of the SNP's entirely consistent approach to why the UK should stay in the EU but Scotland should leave the UK 
Just because USA registers 10 on Richter scale of international dumbness is no reason for UK to feel smug about registering only 9. #Brexit
I am sadly convinced that once #brexit has humbled our economy and our lifestyles, we will be sore losers & lash out at Europe for our folly
#Brexit is economic suicide & all but the rich will suffer - especially the vulnerable. Politicians should have the balls to tell the truth.
PM Theresa May sets out 12 negotiating priorities for #Brexit as part of the Plan for Britain after leaving the EU: 
.@jeremycorbyn warns of "dangers" in @theresa_may "trying to have her cake and eat it" with her #Brexit trade plan
One thing no-one - Tory or Labour - seems to have answer to is what happens if parliament did vote down #Brexit deal at end of negotiation
Democracy is continuous discussion. A mere show of hands with narrow majority doesn't justify a gigantic decision like #Brexit, @theresa_may
If the Prime Minister wants a #Brexit that works for everyone then she needs to stop excluding the 48% entirely in her plans
If only there was an iconic work of English literature that shows how well negotiations go after you divest yourself of authority... #Brexit

This remark by May is a disgraceful lie: it's incredible she should claim this so brazenly, even in the fog of lies that is #Brexit. 
There are "enormous dangers" in what she said - Labour leader @jeremycorbyn responds to PM's #Brexit speech 
#Steinmeier: We will coordinate German position for the upcoming negotiations tomorrow during #Brexit cabinet meeting for the first time.
UK wants immigration control so as it can position itself as Global Britain. As if that makes sense. #brexit
FM #Steinmeier: #Brexit negotiations will not begin until #GreatBritain has officially requested to leave the #EU.
#Steinmeier: We as well want good and trustful relations and hope for a constructive process of negotiation. #EU #Brexit
I've interpreted Theresa May's 12-point #Brexit speech so you don't have to. 
Problem is #TheresaMay doesn't do well in a crisis see NHS and #brexit is a three alarm fire, so be prepared for the house to burn down.
Without UKIP winning a single parliamentary seat we now have what is to all intents and purposes a UKIP government.#Remain #YesEU #Brexit

Great to see @theresa_may finally revealing her plans for the #UK & #Brexit#TheresaMay
What a bad loser #TimFarron is - he just doesn't get it is too late, we will #Brexit and there is nothing he can do.
Remember May wanted to carry out #Brexit using the Royal Prerogative, her lawyers even argued for it at the Supreme Court. She's no democrat

For those celebrating the pound rising, I refer to my tweet from earlier this morning…. #Brexit 
This is now beyond #brexit it is now about democracy, divisive media control, parliamentary accountability & downright lies #NoWayMay
So May wants change from Great Britain to Global Britain. So far it mostly looks like little Britain #brexit #BrexitSpeech
#Brexit doesn't seem so bad when you consider how lucky we are not to be American
Britain has laid out its plan for #brexit. Next, it is the job of #EU27 to find a common position. United we stand, divided we fall.

I'm judging you now as somebody who used racism, intolerance and fear to stumble into power and ruin a nation. #Brexit 
First speech on BBC News Channel is Tim Farron not Jeremy Corbyn. Labour's horrific non-stance on #Brexit will harm the country.
Could there be a more stunning indictment of the PM's speech on #Brexit? 
Absolutely superb speech from @theresa_may for a full, smooth #Brexit where we can secure new trade deals to create a bold, global Scotland
My favourite bit was when she claimed all 65 million people of the UK were behind this nonsense. #brexit 
Thank you Nigel for all you have done. #Brexit 
What sort of delusion is #TheresaMay suffering from as if her speech would change my mind about wanting to remain an EU Citizen. #Brexit

PM continuing to dodge question on whether she thinks Britons will be worse off after #brexit. Second time of asking. So far...
Brexiters said we would remain in the single market. Can we add that to the list of things that was misleading during the campaign? #brexit
May in short: we're going for a hard #Brexit but we want to continue enjoying all your trade benefits, and don't try to punish us (please)
May saved final pledge for a dramatic finale. The NHS WILL get that £350 million per wk. Just joking. #brexit

If Theresa May can't protect workers rights now, how will she protect them after #Brexit?
Theresa May basically telling the 48% who voted remain, and 62% of people in Scotland, to just sit down & be quiet. #Brexit

Theresa May says the referendum was a vote to restore democracy, but refuses Parliament a vote on Article 50 or public vote on #Brexit deal
Ugh - @BBCWorld cut off PM May speech about #Brexit !!! How could they?
Very impressed by opening tone of @theresa_may crucial #Brexit speech against 'A Global Britain' backdrop. Exactly the right approach!
PM: "No partial membership of the EU, associate membership of the EU, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out." #Brexit
"It remains overwhelmingly and compellingly in Britain's national interest that the EU should succeed" says @theresa_may #brexit 
.@theresa_may: "June 23rd was the moment we chose to build a truly global Britain." #Brexit 
May is explaining why she now wants to leave, but so far not *how*#BrexitSpeech #Brexit
How did our membership of the EU ever stop us being a 'Global Britain'? We stand taller on the world stage inside Europe #Brexit
"They did so with their eyes open" says PM on voters in EU referendum "It is the job of this government to deliver it" #bbcdp #brexit 
.@theresa_may: "I want UK to emerge from period of change stronger, fairer, more united than ever before." #Brexit

Leaked: Theresa May’s notes for her big Brexit speech#Brexit #TheresaMay
Expect nothing but bombast and rhetoric from #TheresaMay today in a speech that cannot possibly bring the country together #Brexit 
There can never be such a thing as a 'clean' #Brexit: it can only be messy, chaotic, damaging, divisive, impoverishing - & it is pointless!
Let #May's speech be a catalyst for #Bresistance! From today, we'll be under no illusion who the enemy within is. #Brexit 
100% of the apps I use are free, so the 25% increase is going to hit me harder than most. #brexit
Seems to show contempt for Parliament on Mrs May's part. Our democracy being sidelined in the name of #brexit. 
Prime Minister is setting the course for Britain's place in the world. Surely least she can do is come to Parliament to answer Qs? #Brexit
Majority of Brits don't want #Brexit and majority of Americans don't want or approve #Trump - two coups for the price of one !
PM May indicates Britain will seek 'hard #Brexit' in EU talks: 
Great news we're leaving the Single Market! We can have a global Scotland which trades across the world. #Brexit

Europe waiting for May's #Brexit speech. 
Lib Dems claim May's #Brexit speech will be 'cheered on by Corbyn' 
Nervous to hear how #brexit plans will damage or benefit small businesses in the UK. Need a plan which will not only benefit major banks!
Where was this on the #Brexit battle bus? 
I hope #brexiteers realise that a hard #brexit will lead to a low tax economy to attract foreign investment. Less tax = less public services
#Brexit is the result of an English delusion. Interesting read from Cambridge University professor Nicholas Boyle. 
I was always told as a kid the best way to remove a plaster was quickly.The slower you do it the more painful it is Theresa May.#Brexit

Parliament is being excluded from the ruinous #Brexit path May is pursuing. Come on MPs, do something!!!

Here's a little something to keep you busy while @theresa_may talks Britain out of the #singlemarket #Brexit 
Thanks to Peter Mandelson and his kind, #Leave would win any second #Brexit referendum by about ten million votes.
Really looking forward to the PM's speech #Brexit 
Lord Mandelson is right to warn against a hard #Brexit that sends us off a cliff outside of the Single Market, our biggest trade partners 
We'll be at Lancaster House for @theresa_may's #Brexit speech. Add  BBCNews on Snapchat for more 
Theresa May's plan to yank Britain out of the Single Market is a reckless gamble.   #Brexit
Vote Leave promised #brexit would not make us worse off. PM's speech today must keep that promise & defend jobs #LeaveWatch
#Brexit has highlighted the discontent held by a 'privileged few' ignorance & shown their utter contempt for the working classes & democracy
My @NEF piece on why the prospect of a low tax, low regulation #Brexit is bad news for Britain: 
People like me thought that at some point the Tory moderates would stand up against the hard right. This is not happening. #Brexit #Remain

By failing to oppose #Brexit @UKLabour is helping the Tories create a #Brexit tax haven. An absolute betrayal.@Keir_Starmer#YesEU

Listening to Europarl presidential debate it is really depressing how the fascists use #Brexit to advance their cause
How apt.Repellent, unelected, deceitful, EU extremist Peter Mandelson has been wheeled out by EU fanatical @BBC to criticise #Brexit plans. 
#Brexit in fewer than 140 characters. 
Leave voter on #BBCQT: 'Throughout the whole referendum...we were told that leaving the EU means leaving the single market.' #Brexit 
Sanity check: does anyone REALLY believe a smart politician would reveal the full deal they want before negotiations actually begin? #Brexit
#brexit all the BBC attempts to explain Brexit just highlights the nonsense that was the referendum. No one knew what they voted for
Not a happy day for us #Europeans in the #UK. Shame, and sad really, after all these years of hard work making this city our home. #brexit
From the birth of our nation Scotland has sought alliances with our European continental neighbours. We will continue to do so #brexit

Anyone remember the new £5 note? since #brexit it is now only £1.80 .... Thanks to these two silly sausages

@TheNewEuropean Biggles cat is feeling melancholic this evening as he ponders the stupidity of #Brexit... 
It won't be the rich that lose after #brexit. It never is. Ask yourself if you trust the Tories to look after your interests, or their own?
Why do some rabid Brexiteers like to threaten civil war, riots and violence if they don't get their way? #Brexit #Ukip
REPEAT.There is no such thing as a "hard" or a "soft" #Brexit. Both concepts are inventions of Remainers. There is ONLY complete BREXIT.

May throwing blame is childish. We all warned 3m ago about underfunding & impending winter crisis, but Autumn Statement prioritised #Brexit. 
It's people like Gina Miller that give me hope for this country. She does more to uphold British values than the whole sorry #Brexit crew.
Great news Iceland is considering #EU membership again. It seems the #Brexit experience has had quite an effect! 
Apparently the state pension in Germany is £26,000 a year. If that doesn't indicate to you what a mess the UK is in, then what will? #Brexit

Thank God we have the Tories negotiating #brexit for us  
More people voted for #Brexit than any other vote in British history. 
Sir Tim Barrow reportedly new Perm Rep. Neutral decision, but in context, a quiet push-back from May to the hardnuts. #Brexit
Eddie Mair biased #brexit interview at the moment: interviewee spouting tabloid crap unchallenged. Disappointing.
In IDS we see the spectacle of a man of 3rd rate intellect raging against a world in which expert knowledge is ever more important#Brexit
EU’s #Brexit strategy: Grab the popcorn and watch anarchy in the UK 
Never let the far-right pose as patriots, they are supporting ruinous #Brexit, splitting the UK from its friends & helping our enemy Putin.
Danes @OleRyborg & @NSkaerbaek telling Leadsom a thing or two about pork exports while in EU!  #brexit 
Why is the UK Gov vilifying experts? RT This is the insider view on the Government's shambolic #Brexit negotiations

The 'so called' #bbcnews and 'so called' #skynews trying to out - doom each other today in a frenzy of #brexit negativity.Pathetic isn't it.
The U.K. has been hit with a dramatic new complication ahead of the start of #Brexit negotiations. 
As fresh and as true as if it were written yesterday.#brexit 
#Brexit isn't yet a done deal. UK researchers must look past a pay-off and take a stand 
#brexit has now caused the FTSE to crash to an all time high.
Ireland won't be bullied out of the EU by @Nigel_Farage & his #Brexit little Englanders. Please stay at home Nigel 
In topsy-turvy world of @theresa_may's #Brexit Britain judges, civil servants & diplomats get hounded for doing their jobs properly. Tragic.
The Tory right have every interest in wrecking the #Brexit negotiations & forcing the hardest of hard Brexits#ivanrogers #Remain #YesEU
My thoughts re Sir Ivan Rogers: would you get a lawyer who loves your wife & doesn't want you to split up, to conduct your divorce?#brexit

12 weeks to go and @UKLabour prepare themselves for #Brexit #Article50 vote:"Some of the people have spoken. Not our people, but oh well."
According to Iain Duncan Smith & Brexiteers we can't trust experts, judges, economists, civil servants & any1 that disagrees with #Brexit.
It's 2017 & the Tory #Brexit shambles continues. By contrast @scotgov has a plan to protect our place in Europe. 
Best Wishes to Sir Ivan Rogers, a much respected UK civil servant in Brussels - who knew what he was talking about.#Brexit
Remoaners would love this resignation from a pompous self important public servants to have massive detrimental impact on #Brexit It won't
NO 2 #indyref2ScotGov are not using all devolved powers granted by WM.1 million Scot's Voted for #Brexit The SNP demise begins.#UKIP
WATCH: @JamesMcGrory on @talkRADIO today on why the loss of Sir Ivan is a blow to everyone who wants the best deal for Britain after #Brexit 
First the Tories imposed austerity which was likely to make people vote for #Brexit, now they spend £122bn to maintain support for Brexit
He warned that a #brexit vote was 'perfectly imaginable' from end of 2012 until it happened & never displayed any 'remoaner' tendency at all 
Iain Duncan Smith discusses on should be Britain's next EU ambassador following Sir Ivan Rogers' resignation #Brexit 
This, of course, would amount to deliberate politicisation of the Civil Service. Are there no limits to this woman's stupidity?#Brexit #May
Met @LiamFoxMP today in Hong Kong mega impressed with his determination to secure Free Trade post #brexit I am sure he will succeed 
Former Downing St adviser Jonathan Powell is right: we need to know the #Brexit negotiations objectives before Article 50 is triggered 
Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin set to benefit from #Brexit.Let's get Edinburgh on that list!#indyrer2
Disgraceful- @DavidLammy is absolutely right- this is an assault on the founding principles of our democracy. #Brexit 
Brits Fear Civil War and Riots if #Brexit Not Delivered 
#Germany’s clout in EU will weaken significantly after #Brexit. It has no blocking minority once the Brits have left the EU. (via Astellon) 
"British" - but be careful WHICH values you hold dear#Brexit #brexitshambles #bresistanceFB:
More good #Brexit news for British farmers 
The .@BBCr4today programme this morning was one long tirade against #Brexit. They spin everything to their toxic narrative.
It is depressing that we have a govt that refuses to be honest with the British people concerning the huge challenges we face. #Brexit
Civil service insider tells me that despite huge inducements #brexit department is still not attracting any of the top people. A bourach!
#Farage is right (as usual).If #Brexit means out, pro #EU ambassadors should be replaced (or get a new agenda!)
Brilliant #Brexit quote from the Cleggster on the resignation of #SirIvanRogers
 UK: No #Brexit, 'there will be civil war' says this lady. via @SkyNews
If you're exchanging #sterling (like I do) or outsourcing,you know that pound slump is seriouschart @Brexit#Brexit
No country in the world would make such massive & consequential constitutional change on a mere 37% of the electorate. #Brexit is dishonest.
My phone's beside me, Prime Minister. Waiting for the call. I can start tomorrow. #brexit #ivanrogers
.@GoodwinMJ: For the majority of the electorate, there's no going back on #Brexit. 
This will be the story of #brexit. Convoluted leaps of logic to ensure any failure is always someone else's (foreigner or Remainer's) fault. 
"The government knows where it's going and it needs civil servants who will implement that," Iain Duncan Smith on #Brexit #r4today
Jonathan Powell: the worrying thing about Sir Ivan's letter was that there is no plan nor objectives #Brexit negotiations #r4today
You can tell how little support there is within the Conservative party for #Brexit by the frequency the handful of idiots appear on #r4today
Politicians should have balls to tell truth: #Brexit is economic suicide & all but rich will suffer - especially vulnerable. Need to rethink
Never forget. This man created #Brexit chaos because of an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all his mates. 
So pleased that this #Cameron crony has bowed out!#Brexit #Article50 #EUambassador #Brixham @LeaveMnsLeave #May
His resignation letter doesn't mince words over #Brexit 
#Brexit a fantastic mess. It can be stopped at a stroke: gov & Parliament say 'we are not taking the "advice" of the advisory referendum.'
Humiliation for Theresa May as UK's #EU envoy says UKGov #Brexit aims are unknown and deplores "muddled thinking". 
This morning on @LBC Radio, @ChukaUmunna is right to say that both Leave & Remain voters expect competence from this Govt on #Brexit 
New report warns British farming faces significant risks after #Brexit, including a loss of subsidies and tariffs 
12 weeks before biggest event in British politics since end of WW2 and Government still utterly clueless on #Brexit. #IvanRogers #r4today
A government only prepared to listen to what it wants to hear cannot possibly achieve a positive #Brexit outcome or govern for whole country 
My cartoon - UK’s EU ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers resigns#May#Brexit#r4Today
Ambassador to EU quits and warns Thick Tories over 'muddled thinking' #votetory #brexit 
#Brexit is portrayed as anger and emotion versus cold expert reason. Believe me, #Remainers *feel* their position very, very strongly, too.
I hope now Sir Ivan Rogers has resigned as UK EU Ambassador BBC et al will invite him regularly to explain why #Brexit is a fucking disaster
Axe The Tories#ToxicTories #Austerity #Poverty #Inequality #BedroomTax #Sanctions #Homeless #Xenophobia #ToryElectionFraud #Brexit 
"Muddle" a classic British understatement. #Brexit is the most disastrous predicament facing the UK in modern times. My advice: don't do it! 
What will #Brexit mean for #wine sales in UK, one of the world's biggest markets? Here's what we're seeing so far. 
.@ChukaUmunna: "Any moves to end civil service impartiality to dogmatically follow hard #Brexit wld be unacceptable" 
.@ChukaUmunna. If the UK's EU ambassador is bailing, surely it's time Labour stood up to gov and said "Actually, #Brexit is ideological BS" 
RT Sorry to interrupt #Newsnight #Skypapers #Brexit claptrap but can I point out @Theresa_May record as PM, can't wait for her Brexit record
Strange that #Newsnight discussion of 2017, #Brexit & UK not one person brought up crises of UK state, 4 nation politics & #indyref2.
#Newsnight is back to its politically biased best. Again questioning Corbyn's leadership when they should focus on Tory's leading #brexit
Is there any going back on #Brexit? Not for the majority of the electorate, says @GoodwinMJ #Newsnight
#newsnight Rogers resignation is latest sign Britain is heading for hard #Brexit
This country has a great future, post-#Brexit. Ivan Rogers will not be missed. 
Truly extraordinary attack from Ivan Rogers, calling on colleagues to challenge "ill-founded arguments and muddled thinking" on #Brexit. 
"..multilateral negotiating experience is in short supply in Whitehall....not the case in the Commission.."#Brexit
Anyone interested in HMG's readiness for the coming #brexit negotiations will benefit from reading this letter in full. 
Sir Ivan Rogers' email as devastating to Theresa May as Sir Jeffery Howe's resignation speech from Margaret Thatcher's Government #Brexit
#Brexit - Sir Ian Rogers resignation letter to staff: "I hope you will continue to challenge ill-founded arguments & muddled-thinking"
Suppose the Tories had spent the £122bn they're spending on #Brexit before June 23. Which side would have won the referendum?#Remain #YesEU
Refugee-workers in Italy went through hell being Kidnapper by enemy migrants. Their reaction:"all migrants must be deported, all"#Brexit 
This Better Together #brexit Britain just went over the cliff edge into a #brexit free fall & there will be no soft landing! 
People who believe in #Brexit should be in charge of getting the UK out, not pro-Remain civil servants  
SHOW this video to anyone in the remain campaign now arguing to stay in the single market #Brexit 
The worse the #Brexit mess, the more the Tory right will be able to push for tax cuts on business & wealth to attract investment.#Remain
I don't remember 'ending the principle of a politically neutral civil service' being on any ballot paper. #Brexit 
Mikhail Gorbachev correctly identified the nature of the EU.#Brexit 
Good riddance! And now for someone less pessimistic and more ambitious about #Brexit to take over... #IvanRogers
Not just chances of hard #Brexit increased. But of a chaotic, damaging, dogmatic Brexit. One that harms millions. 
So faith or ideological commitment, not knowledge, should determine whom we field? #Brexit's a bizarre cult.
UK ministers may stay "stuck in #Brexit denial" after #ivanrogers quits, says @Hugodixon (via @InFactsOrg ) :
EU president, who ran Luxembourg while it oversaw “industrial-scale” tax avoidance, blocked EU tax reforms. #Brexit 
The mandarins strike back after our man in Brussels resigns in frustration...#Brexit 
The #EU is worth fighting for! #Europe #Brexit 
Resignation of UK's #EU ambassador hints at hard #Brexit, and loss of #CustomsUnion. Expect scenes like this every day. Well done Quitlings!
So Ivan Rogers, 1 of top 2 officials at DExEU, has resigned. And the Labour Party - inc. @keir_starmer - seem to have said nothing. #Brexit
The #Brexit elite persuaded voters to go for a house swap before they'd seen the other house. Now they've seen the house & are worried.
Ha. Number 10 trying to spin Ivan Rogers resignation as a *good* thing before Article 50 triggered. #Brexit 
FFS Brexiteers. When Cameron struck a limited pre- #EUref deal you blamed him. You can’t revise it now & blame Ivan Rogers! #brexit
Catastrophic blow to Theresa May and UKGov as "UK's ambassador to the EU Sir Ivan Rogers resigns". #Brexit 
Goodbye Sir Ivan. Welcome Nigel Farage? @UKIP MEP @GerardBattenMEP  #Brexit #UKIP @Nigel_Farage
Hopefully the replacement for Sir Ivan will be a wholehearted believer in #Brexit who is as willing to play hardball as Juncker and his pals
Britain's EU ambassador has unexpectedly quit just months before the formal #Brexit talks are due to get under way 
UK Ambassador to #EU resigns ahead of #Brexit negotiations 
"Sir Ivan Rogers"Top UK diplomat resigns over #Brexit Everything going smoothly, nothing to see here, please move along. 
Change Britain's lies are the typical of a populism that leads down the road to disillusion, anger, fury and violence.#Remain #Brexit 
The man who ran @Nigel_Farage’s private office in the run-up to the #Brexit vote is facing up to 20 years in jail.
Going for a hard #Brexit + leaving the customs union could create 400,000 jobs bonanza, this strengthens @theresa_may hand.
.@isaby​: Sir Ivan Rogers quitting as British Ambassador to the EU is a huge boost to the #Brexit negotiations 
Former Taoiseach John Bruton has said Britain should change its mind on #Brexit & stay in the European Union. >> 
Just chatted to one MP about Sir Ivan Rogers' resignation: "wouldn't you? It's going to be an absolute fuck-fest." #brexit
Do you feel we are a nation more divided as a result of #Brexit?
EU ambassador #Ivanrogers gets his knighthood, has enjoyed a huge salary & resigns before he might have to do some #brexit work! 
Why wasn't the #EU taught in schools?#Brexit 
One senior UK official told me FCO's most experienced European officials frozen out of #Brexit, viewed as "tainted" @Number10gov & @DexEUgov
Remember how every self certified Intellectual and Analyst predicted that #brexit will screw up British Economy ..Reversed Happened  
With the UK's top Brussels diplomat Sir Ivan Rogers resigning ahead of #Brexit negotiations, is it time for @Nigel_Farage to step up?
#brexit will be a nightmare for our negotiators but this ostrich gov't keeps it's head firmly stuck up its arse. 
 Who represents Remainers in parliament? If you're 1 of 16 million who voted #Remain, what political party represents you best? #Brexit 
WANTED: Relentlessly optimistic Head of UKREP. No sense of the realpolitik, and a willingness to parrot trite slogans, an advantage.#Brexit
So to summarise, decent professional gets savaged by #Brexit mob for telling truth and being realistic about the downsides. Sound familiar?
It took 3 years to untangle Greenland from the EU. Ivan Rogers saying #brexit will take a decade was sensible. Govt ignored. So he goes.
Triggering Article 50 less than three months after your most senior Brussels diplomat resigns? Yeah!  #brexit
Is #Brexit an appalling idea which will take forever to sort out, make industries leave the UK & make ordinary people poorer?
Thank you Sir Ivan Roberts @foreignoffice for courageous rebellion against absurdity of #Brexit Will any MPs follow?
No doubt we will all be told everything is just fine and to be more positive...! #Brexit 
"Sod this, I'm off". UK's top #Brussels diplomat quits before #Brexit talks. And who can blame him. 
"UK's top EU diplomat resigns" Nah, #Brexit isn't a chaotic mess, not at all. 
Pessimist Rogers - who warned #Brexit could take 10 years - is to leave his post as UK Ambassador to the EU.Good - time for some optimism!
Ivan Rodgers resignation underlines the complete mess #Brexit is! No.10 DON'T want to hear that it's a process that could take 10years.
A prosperous future awaits the UK if we leave the EU customs union and become a beacon of global free trade! #Brexit

The Guardian view on the Brexit debate: listen, Mrs May | Editorial  
Big Brexit event late spring London yet to be announced. Need staff and volunteers, ideas - the lot. Follow me, I'll return and we can msg 
Fascinating that Mrs May is obsessed with populist view as expressed in so-called democratic referendum yet dismisses the populist petition! 
Did I just hear that UK commitment to the EU is 600,000,000,000 Euro! #Newsnight #Brexit. 
Finally a referendum I can get behind   
Meet the European Parliament’s #Brexit negotiator: @GuyVerhofstadt #Newsnight (video from 2012) 
A monument to my hard Brexit of 1534.  
Trump's most positive legacy could be unintentionally persuading the U.K. to drop Brexit. 
Thank you for #brexit...€600Billion Euros!Sounds like a good divorce deal right...?NOT! #brexitshambles #Newsnight 
Donald Trump is a disaster for Brexit  via @FT 
Easy to work out why.‘Liberal'-Left politico-media class wants to sour UK-US rel’ship, to stop post-Brexit trade deal & thus Brexit itself. 
#Remain & Go #Brexit...get Trump  
#GuyVerhofstadt, chief #Brexit negotiator on behalf of #EU argues socks off @EvanHD IN HIS 2ND LANGUAGE! Davis & May = mincemeat #Newsnight 
Politicians with incomes and wealth that will always be safe & secure even if #brexit is a horrible disaster will trigger #Article50. 
I truly respect the English vote on Brexit... It's just a pity that the Scottish vote doesn't seem to be reciprocated... 
Size Matters on World Stage #remain #brexit #trump #brightertogether #voteleave #voteremain 
As far as I can see, the war against fascism for us opens with the war against Brexit. 
LOL Guy Verhofstadt Chief EU brexit negotiator says UK will have a £600bn bill. Calamity for the brexiteers. @NewsNight 
I rather like Guy Verhofstadt. There, I said it. #newsnight #Article50 #brexit  
Asked if she thinks Russia intervened in the Brexit vote, Albright replies: "I actually think yes." 
What a fiasco.Palace displeased.May had advance warning of Trump move.The Brexit Faustian pact unravels.  
PM does not want any trade with Ireland to suffer due 2 brexit..yet Scotland office & conservatives consistently threaten Indy Scot exports?  
Looks like centrist Tories are putting Party before Country just as Trump is swinging the UK's mood against Brexit. 
When brexit has put Britain once again at the top table it will be interesting to watch remain pretending to have voted leave all along. 
Post-Brexit, the Human Rights Act will be next. If you don't want a populist authoritarian UK, send a signal on March 25 @uniteforeurope 
Listen to Theresa May's speech and replace "Ireland" with "Scotland". She just confirmed independence is logical. #indyref2 #brexit  
UK really showing off its post-Brexit sovereignty. Theresa May is now too terrified to call out a bigot for fear of losing trade. #Newsnight 
In a little under 9 years Hitler destroyed the world. Trump can do it in 8 years. Be very afraid of where #Brexit is heading.  
If Brexit means a deal with Trump stop Article 50. Now. Please. My message on postcards to MPs and Peers sent out today.  
"Jeremy Corbyn’s got the right strategy on Brexit vote" Letters

Interesting idea from @GuyVerhofstadt about offering dual EU citizenship for Brits. Some of us are European and British #newsnight #brexit 
Please get @GuyVerhofstadt on #Newsnight more often. The more he speaks the more he convinces people that Brexit is Best 
Theresa May's options are narrowing.She's either with the 52% and Trump or she's history #Brexit#UKIP

Let's have a referendum to take back control from the 'state visit committee'.  
Watch: How can EU NATO members who don't meet 2% GDP defence threshold even contemplate EU Army? It's Barmy! #brexit  
A third of firms are planning more exports to the EU after #Brexit - according to @britishchambers report 
Hard choices are often #right! Rejecting #A50 now would stop #Brexit #Insanity! #MPsAgainstArticle50 are not "just brave" they are #right! 
Two things Leavers need to read & understand1: The referendum was advisory. 2: Churchill's view on the duties of an MP#Brexit #Remain 
Maybe Theresa's hard Brexit policy was nothing to do with her either. Maybe it was the catastrophically inept committee. 
A million people sign a petition - The Government must act!Seventeen million people vote in a formal Referendum - Meh, ignore it... 
The missing market for an opposition party: the comical gulf between the Brexit Elite and the average member of the 52%. 
BREXIT: UK gov rejects calls to cancel Trump state visit, saying "oh God, please don't make stand up to him, we really need this. Pleeease." 
Should our relationship with the US grow stronger after #Brexit, now that #Trump's president? VOTE & Retweet: #banTrumpFromUK 
When the petition reaches 1.3m it matches the Brexit majority so by law May HAS to do a mad thing vaguely based on it no matter how ruinous. 
Brilliant logo for Catalonia's upcoming independence referendum campaign. Chapeau! #lovedemocracy 
UK agrees ‘immediate’ post-Brexit talks with the US, leaving the EU high and dry.  
In a way, Trump's actions are good for the UK. They allow MPs a glimpse of how Brexit Britain will look in 2 years time if we trigger A50.

Hard #Brexit madness: 46%, of exports from urban centres go to the EU, just 15% to the US & 4% to China #Remain 
Note changed wording. Poll shows 27pc support indyref before brexit, 23pc after. 50pc of Scots want 2nd indyref.  
Another morning and nothing from my MP @KateHoeyMP explaining some of the appalling things she has done in the name of Brexit 
27% in favour of a referendum before #Brexit negotiations and 23% after. In other words, around 50% are in favour of another referendum.  
Labour MPs should make clear they are not bound by the Tory govt's promise to implement the result of an advisory ref.@DavidLammy#Brexit 
The #TrumpPetition is fake, just like the Brexit one. 90% of the 'signatures' will be bots. The media know this but will continue to lie.

Downing St says banning Trump would be a "populist gesture". What, you mean like #Brexit? Oh, you only like populist gestures that serve you 
Theresa May who is shamelessly sucking up to the world's most rabid populist says it's populist to want to block his state visit!#Brexit

Petition to cancel Trump's state visit: "Populist gesture".Brexit: "Will of the people". 
Our amendment to Article 50 Bill. We won't give the Tories a blank cheque for a hard Brexit at all costs taking us out of the Single Market  
Decades of pro EU gov & lovers of freedom democratically oppose. A few months of Brexit & Trunp and we have mass protests against democracy 
UK's anti-Trump petition dismissed by May as "a populist gesture", apparently. So what was the #Brexit Leave vote then? 
Hard Brexit brigade should be cheering - this weakness is the logical consequence of what they campaigned for  
Trump's #MuslimBan is part of same current of hatred that fuelled Brexit, same hate in UK against immigration too  
This is a flat out lie. Poll shows 27pc support indyref before brexit, 23pc support it after. 27 + 23 = 50pc.  
What I don't get about the "trump doesn't share our British values" rhetoric is that uk voted for Brexit and implements PREVENT 
There needs to be a referendum on Government's final Brexit plan. How can any genuine democrat say no to that? 
Either people's opinions count (Brexit) or they don't (1m+ anti Trump petition). Make up your mind you useless travesty of a government.

BBC source: Stopping state visit would be a "populist gesture". Bit like Brexit! #brexitshambles  
Most politicians know #Brexit will be disastrous for UK & is nothing like what was voted for. They should have balls to DO THE RIGHT THING. 
Downing Street: "America is a huge important ally. We have to think long term". Really loving the post-Brexit return of our sovereignty... 
Come on guys, the referendum was very clearly about leaving the EU at any cost & lurching violently into the thrall of a Nazi foreign power. 
Theresa May confirms her desperation and international weakness as a result of pursuing Brexit.  
If it wasn't for #Brexit putting the UK in an incredibly weak position, UK govt wouldn't be sucking up to tyrants like Trump and Erdogan.

Interesting. Aberdeen sends 61% of exports to EU. Tory Hard Brexit would devastate region already feeling pressure of oil & gas downturn.

Great interest for today's information meeting @SvkyrkanLondon on Brexit. Could with colleagues answer some questions. But more remain.

These private equity funds are already planning new bases in Luxembourg after Brexit  
World events are moving at an astonishing speed. The #Brexit vote is already looking obsolete. Parliament needs to proceed with care now.

Britain in Line to Sign Major Trade Deals After Brexit  
We live in a Parliamentary Democracy.  It is up to Parliament how to implement the advisory referendum.  
As #Brexit would remove rights from citizens for generations, are you to reverse the 3L whip and order all to support #MPsAgainstArticle50? 
Screw you, you hypocrite. You are going to help push through May's Brexit, so that the UK is far less able to stand up to Trump.   
Trump supports xenophobic Brexit.Corbyn supports xenophobic Brexit.Corbyn is a hypocrite.  
These are dark days for British liberalism.It feels as if May, Brexit, UKIP, Trump and Corbyn have moved us back 100 years.

Corbyn warns shadow cabinet on Brexit vote rebellion  
#brexit will leads us to the corrupt, immoral and unstable orbit of #donaldtrump and that will spell the end of Britain's society & economy 
We have, of course, a trade deal with the US. One that gives us that surplus. But Brexit means we will lose it. It means a loss of control. 
Brexit: UK PM signs £100m fighter jet deal with Turkey amidst concerns that UK is losing its moral compass in post-Brexit economic scramble. 
In a sane world where UK government genuinely worked in national interest, Trump's election should have forced rapid re-think re Brexit. 
It's clear from the indecent haste that those driving Brexit want it irrevocable before people rumble them.  
With America we run a trade surplus. We take 3% of its exports. Brexit means we need a trade deal. Trump is nativist. These are the facts. 
Occasional reminder that an uncritical approach to the US is not necessarily related to Brexit or even Euroskepticism  
#MuslimBan is nothing like Brexit. It's more like the EU, which privileges Euro-migration and pays African dictators to keep people out. 
It's now clear that the best case for reversing #brexit is that we can stand with Europe against #Trump rather than having to cosy up to him 
Brexit trade negotiations  
#Brexit A lot of people voted to leave the EU last year in good faith. The world has changed. Now we have a choice to make. Europe or Trump? 
'Single market is INTERTWINED with EU' Marr scolds traitor @timfarron for bashing 'hard' Brexit  
Corbyn rebelled against the Labour whip 428 times during Labour's years in power. Here's hoping his MPs do the same on the Brexit vote. 
Days after our Washington DC anti brexit advan with CHURCHILL pro EU message, this. Yay!! @Independent  
Brexit forcing UK to line up behind Trump & Erdogan rather than Merkel & Hollande. Choosing bullies & bluster over compassion & human rights 
I had been ok with leaving the EU. But killing Brexit now seems to be the only defence against Trump & useless May. So that's settled then 
Sobering thoughts from a #Labour veteran on how damaging a failure to oppose May's #brexit would be:  
After her Neville Chamberlain approach to the #MuslimBan nothing that Theresa May does or says can be trusted especially with #brexit

UK PM Theresa May -Reluctant to condemn Trump on refugees and reluctant to listen to Scotland's Gov on #Brexit. What is #BetterTogether here 
An idiotic speech from Watson, suggesting we may have a great protectionist Brexit future & Trump could be fine.  
Brits -With #Brexit & a PM with no backbone we need to be ready. Tell your MP where you stand. Be kind to minorities. Make protest signs. 
#Brexit is to the UK what Trump is to the US: toxic & destructive. Trump might take 4 years to stop; Brexit can be stopped right now. 
A sad day indeed for the US, but Nadhim voted for Brexit.  Maybe he now understands how EU migrants in the UK have been feeling for months.

The natural result of Brexit is going to be that weak PMs fear to speak out because it harms trade. We no longer have strength in numbers 
I have a thought.Once Brexit is completed, EU dies & UK could head a new European zone of friendship & cooperation  
May can't say anything. UK already so economically desperate we're cap in hand to genocidal regimes offering to sell arms. Brexit MUST die.  
uk: we did brexitamerica: oh yeah, hold my beer  
#TheresaTheAppeaser shows just how desperate the position for the UK is post Brexit. Willing to accept openly fascist policy for trade 
This lies at the heart of Labour's insanity.They still think a "soft" Brexit exists.But it doesn't !!!It's Hard Brexit or Remain.  
There is one clear alternative:"No Brexit" A pragmatic realignment of ALL 'free' thinking MPs......to create a new EU alliance.

I campaigned for #remain . Brother voted Brexit. Read. Not all Neanderthal racists . Not an easy set of choices  
Enough ‘hard Brexit’. We need a ‘hard Remain’ counterattack | The big issue  
The problem is that Twitter is a window into a world you choose to see & generally the world is full of stupid cunts who vote Brexit & Trump 
Of course, May wouldn't have to cosy up to Trump if it weren't for Brexit, the gift that just keeps on taking. 
Stand firm Corbyn, against the illiberal liberals; respect the EU referendum, expose May's lies, & articulate the socialist alternative..... 
This is what a Brexit world looks like folks  
May shows how weak she is and by default how weak Brexit Britain is by not standing up to Trump's #muslimban 
The referendum was not about the EU or even immigration - it was about foreigners  
Theresa May is unfit to lead Britain.Handling #Brexit w/out a plan, praising Trump & Erdogan, our directionless, unelected PM should resign  
.@bbcbreaking It's no good #Labour attacking #Trump but backing #brexit they both come out of the same cesspit! 
@theresa_may Forget Brexit, NHS, education - unless you denounce @realDonaldTrump over muslim ban you'll be a British disgrace forever. 
I actually feel sorry for May. This isn't her fault. Simply the fact of life for us post-Brexit. We're just a door-to-door salesman now. 
Labour's betrayal of its principles to support May on Brexit and therefore her shameful overtures to Trump may just be terminal. 
Nope Gee, just working out how to clean up the mess your boy Big Dave left when he tossed that Brexit hand grenade behind him.. actually :-)  
the Tories more split than labour over Brexit but right wing press give them easy ride and the whole thing is a right tory mess  
The UK’s relationship with Australia will be revitalised after Brexit  
TOMORROW: Brexit forces our PM to dance for racists, opportunists and warmongers, so we go after the transgenders.  
Why not hold a referendum on whether to criticise Trump? The threshold for you to say "The British people sent a clear message" is only 52%.

Theresa May's epic cowardice on the international stage is morally repellant. But it doesn't bode well for post-Brexit Britain either.

#The_Observer on #Brexit " ... a return to the narrow, delusional world of Little England."  #indyref2 
May's refusal to condemn #MuslimBan due to her desperation to get a trade deal shows how #Brexit has already diminished a once proud nation.

Do you think we should resist #Brexit? Make your voice heard! Contact your MPs to oppose #Article50  
Trump "I was in Scotland when they voted for Brexit, it was amazing!" PM May does NOT correct him that Scotland voted to REMAIN in the EU. 
The Guardian newspaper is working relentlessly to turn people against Brexit, instead of embracing it as most British people have. 
Completely agree. This has just put an entirely different spin on Brexit. Stand up MPs across the house. Stand up.  
Growing up in the slums of Yorkshire during 1930s we knew who our enemies were unlike today which is why we built the Welfare State #brexit

If you support #Trump, #Brexit, #UKIP, #ConservativeGovt #Breitbart #Fascism you are my enemy. I can't do much, but I will speak out. 
Where on the referendum paper did it ask if we agree to getting in bed with fascists and dictators? 
A healthy democracy would marginalize the minority of racists, bigots and fascists, not give them the deciding vote on our future.#Brexit 
UK's unelected PM throwing away keys to Europe in desperate Brexit rush! Now arms deal with Turkey, Europes biggest jailer of journalists!

Young republicans demanding a referendum on Irish Unity today. "From the hills of Kerry to the streets of Free Derry..."

#BBC 's @bbclaurak taking out her sour grapes re Brexit/Trump victories is appalling. It's clear the leftard BBC wants Britain to fail.  
'Brexit will be a FANTASTIC thing for Britain' Trump confirms trade deal after May meeting  
The UK don't deserve to be in Eurovision this year. We should be made to sit in the corner with the Brexit Dunce cap on #EurovisionYouDecide

PM May in USA: Prez Sez Brexit 'Will Be a Fantastic Thing'  
Trump's a big Brexit fan. And we're big fans of that.   
Theresa May failed to challenge Trump & stand up for our values today - she prefers a US corporate trade deal for a bargain basement Brexit 
Surely the fact that Donald Trump thinks #Brexit is an amazing idea is all the evidence anyone needs to bin the whole thing immediately. 
We've joined forces with @theSNP to amend the British Government's Hard-Brexit Bill #MakeChangeHappen 
Obama 2016: US focus is with EU. UK will be back of queue. Trump 2017: Brexit will be a wonderful thing for UK. #SpecialRelationship

#EurovisionYouDecideOh my god, not another referendum :( 
Trigger Article 50 NOW: Czech minister urges Britain to speed up Brexit  
Trump claims he arrived in Scotland the day before June 23 Brexit vote, correctly predicted victory. Trump's visit was on June 24. 
Then the day before the Brexit vote, Trump said nobody should listen to him because he hadn't paid much attention.  
Corbyn's Brexit stance takes into account will of the British public. Why is he being criticisied when world leaders ignore their public? 
NEW: Donald Trump tells Theresa May that #Brexit will be "a wonderful thing" for Britain  
"Britain could have 'fast track back to EU' after Brexit, says European Parliament chief negotiator".  
Trump describes himself as the great sage who predicted Brexit. Here is an actual exchange from three weeks before the vote.  
Trump again labels Brexit an act of national self-determination.Another slap for Merkel & anti-democratic, supranationalist #EU.#maytrump 
I have a letter in tonight's @EveningStandard highlighting the way a hard #Brexit will damage prospects for the young  
I was always very pro European but Brexit and Trump is making me even more of a European patriot. Let's show them all. #EU #Brexit #Trump 
Today at a joint press conference with U.K. PM @theresa_may, @POTUS reaffirmed his support for Brexit.  
In fact when asked about Brexit he didn't know what it was  
"Brexit is going to be a wonderful thing for your country."@POTUS toPM Theresa MayMake Britain Great Again#MAGA 
#Brexit papers lodged in High Court (via @RTENewsNow) @JolyonMaugham's Dublin #Article50 case gets under way 
BTW Trump didn't predict Brexit at Turnberry presser. It was after Brexit, which he said he predicted.  
Whatever your views on Trump, May or Brexit, you have to admit the PM's trip to the US has been a triumph. #proudtobeBritish 
Takeaway from presser: Brexit good. Mattis good. BBC bad. 
That went as well as May cld have hoped. Trump effusive about Brexit, warm about her, ruled out torture & didn’t dissent from her Nato line 
Trump "I was in Scotland when they voted for Brexit, it was amazing!" PM May does NOT correct him that Scotland voted to REMAIN in the EU. 
Trump gave hearty approval of Brexit alongside May, adding he had trouble with his businesses getting approvals from "the consortium" (EU). 
[rubs temples] Trump is promoting Brexit because it will make things easier for businesses like his 
Trump says Brexit a wonderful thing. Believes it paved the way to his victory so has emotional attachment to it 
TRUMP: Brexit will end up being a fantastic thing for the United Kingdom  
Another small weird lie: Trump said he arrived in Scotland the day before Brexit and said it would happen. False.  
Trump is saying he was mocked for predicting Brexit when he was in Scotland the day before the vote. He arrived in Scotland the day after. 
.@POTUS: "I think Brexit is going to be a wonderful thing... You're going to have your own identity."  
Trump is boasting that he predicted Brexit. Trump did not know what Brexit was when initially asked about it. 
Most EU countries have agreed to maintain the excellent bird protection pollcies Does Brexit mean Britain wont bother? 
A coherent Labour position on Brexit  from @labourlewis 
A trade deal made with Trump would include access to public service contracts including NHS contracts. Brexit is bad for Britain. #Brexit

Theresa May says she's been discussing laying groundwork for a post Brexit free trade agreement between the US and UK with Donald Trump. 
UK PM Theresa May takes her place at the back of the queue.#MayTrump #Brexit #MAGA 
#maytrump  May licking the boots of Authoritarian Trump demeans herself and Britain. #Brexit makes her desperate!

You're joking?! Bill to start Brexit only contains 130 words and MPs have only FIVE days to debate it  #brexit #Article50 
I fear  the great enthusiasm produced by the unknown of #Brexit will evaporated once we arrive at it and learn it has added to our misery 
UK farmers could lose tariff-free access to EU market and be undercut by cheap US imports post #Brexit  
The great farce continues! 130 words WTF? Theresa May just published the Brexit Bill and it's only 8 lines long  
Sometimes I found that the will of the people is just a mob with a rope tied into a noose. #brexit  
I hoped the lesson from Brexit would be that people learn to go out and vote to defend against the hateful voices that want to tear us apart 
Good discussion at @WadeCeramics about #Brexit issues with @gareth_snell @Keir_Starmer @RuthSmeeth.

The principled opposition of Greens, SNP, Plaid & SDLP to #Article50 is completely right Thank you for opposing this dangerous Govt. #Brexit 
#clivelewis like all Labour MPs should have the right to vote their conscience on #Article50 b/c there is no builder's plan for Brexit. 
Brexit. Trump. Rise of the far right. Keep waking up with that sinking feeling? Do something about it:  
The UK government is already struggling with the Brexit workload, according to a new report  
Today's Brexit bill was missing a point. Or rather 3 million points. Share widely as the lives of EU citizens mustn't be up for negotiations

A new post by our director, @jolyonmaugham, on whether the Brexit Bill actually works.  
Does the Government’s Brexit Bill work?  
For all asking: I will be voting for Parliament to honour the national result of the EU Referendum & to trigger Article 50. #democracy 
Jeremy Corbyn is the worst of political frauds, a fake Socialist who is doing everything in his power to help the far-right.#Remain #Brexit 
Delighted to be selected as Labour's candidate for S-o-T Central.  I'll fight for our city, our NHS & for a fair Brexit for Stoke-on-Trent. 
Two clauses and 137 words: The Government has published its bill seeking Parliament's authority to trigger #Brexit  
Sadly UK Guardian chooses to indulge in anti Corbyn agenda rather than complex reality of constituencies voting Brexit due to austerity cuts 
Has #Corbyn gone completely mad? Brexit is a suicide note that will affect all those he purports to support! #labour  
Speaking on Northern Ireland in #Seanad shortly. Outraged #Brexit campaigners so indifferent to UK's responsibility to peace in Ireland.  
Democracy is not just an occasional vote - get in touch with your MP and ask them to represent your views on science in Brexit negotiations  
Britain’s excruciating embrace of Donald Trump shows how little independence it has gained from Brexit  
MPs will vote on triggering #Brexit within two weeks  
Gibraltar is all too rarely considered in the Brexit debate. Read our joint report with @Open_Britain here:  
#Article50 should be a free vote for each #labourmp not a whipped endorsment of Brexit Accepting madness shouldn't be viewed as condoning it 
Pretty rich of Corbyn to ask Labour MPs to put aside their principles, and constituents, to serve his agenda on Brexit  
Barclays to make Dublin its EU headquarters after Brexit: source  
By whipping the vote for #Article50 Labour will be wrongly tarred as an enabler of the sheer chaos Brexit will produce across Britain. 
Beautiful #Brexit Bill.  
Germany achieves lowest unemployment rate since unification. EU member, of course. UK will be heading the other way with #Brexit.  
Remember when we said that #brexit would devastate the NHS? And you said 'look at that bus!'

Me on why Trump could be punished by his own voters for lies/ broken promises-  but Brexit campaign won't be. @ft 
A monumental error of judgement and direction. Labour leadership's 'Official' stance is an appeasement to Brexit. 
Brexit has begun: Theresa May has published her Article 50 bill, paving the way for the UK's exit from the EU.  
If Labour decides to vote for Brexit then I'm done with Labour forever. I will not vote for a pro Brexit party. Never. Ever. Never. Ever. 
Jeremy Corbyn, who defied Labour whip 487 times under last Labour govt, is imposing a 3 line whip requiring Labour MPs to vote for Brexit. 
52% of voters (17.4 million people) backing #Brexit = democracy being “hijacked by minorities”. No intelligent life on #PlanetRemain...

Disgraceful - 137 word bill. Why is this government so terrified of proper debate and scrutiny of Brexit. Where is the Impact Assessment?  
A pre-Article 50 White Paper needs objectively to cost & consider ALL consequences of a #Brexit, & compare them to remaining in the EU. 
We are about to start a process that will cost billions, and serves no useful purpose #brexit? #justsayno 
Corbyn's Brexit policy, from demanding A50 was triggered on June 24 to whipping it today, has been a triumph of monumental stupidity.

@Bonn1eGreer Brexit & Trump, we've been here before. Hannah Arendt, 'Origins of Totalitarianism ', 1951  
Now take a million civil servants... Each £1,000 in salary x 1m people = £1bn per annum cost for UK taxpayers. Brexit ain't cheap.   
Voting to trigger Article 50 without knowing if it's reversible, or a White Paper, means voting to leave the EU whatever the terms. #Brexit 
Here's the full text of the government's bill to trigger Article 50 and the Brexit process  
Here it is- Theresa May's Brexit Bill has just been published, and it's an entire 137 words long  
The fight against Brexit is now also the fight against Trump. Lines have been drawn and we have to be on the right side. 
Labour MPs cannot put loyalty over country. Brexit will be a disaster. We need far more transparency over A50  
Ben “we’re supposed to be an opposition” Bradshaw – one of those who abstained on Welfare Bill, voted for the referendum to happen. 
THANKYOU to ALL the Labour MP's prepared to defy 3 line whip and not allow this govt free reign #Article50 #brexit 
No plan, no detail and a wilful ignorance of the damage to trade and jobs. This is how a hard Tory #Brexit will happen.  
History is made today.#BrexitAnd so it begins.  And all the best for a  deal tomorrow.  
No, what's "Really disappointing" is that the Green Party leader is trying to refight a referendum that she lost  
Supreme Court ruling or no Supreme Court ruling, Brexit is happening (£)  
Essentially, Corbyn's decided to enable the hardest, most workers-rights-destroying, NHS-selling #Brexit possible. Not a good look

So the Government's Article 50 Bill has been written at a rate of one word every week day since the referendum result. #productive

The Commons spent;30 days debating entry into EEC, 29 days on Maastricht, 13 days on Lisbon.Will get 5 on triggering Brexit. 
Stop me if you've heard this one before (every week), but the Tories are talking about independence and the SNP are replying about Brexit. 
It is demonstrably undemocratic. For example, how they treated Greece's democratic referendum result with utter disdain and disrespect.  
Ruth Davidson in shock call to rule out a second independence referendum. #FMQs

More evidence that #brexit is nothing but vacuous dogma, devoid of substance, reason and merit. A dangerous mantra indeed.  
UK GDP grew 0.6% in the final quarter of 2016 - much better than predicted! Our economy remains strong post-Brexit.

May is now praising Trump. So in WW3 we'll be on the side of the fascists, not fighting them. Another triumph for every single Brexit voter! 
Theresa May is about to do far worse than this: today she flies to America to hand #Brexit Britain over to #Trump.

Among #AP10ThingstoKnow: Busy slate for Trump on second full day; UK Supreme Court rules on Brexit terms.  
The mask slips.Miller in effect admits A 50 case not about Parl/legal process, but stopping Brexit.And who's "we"? 
Parliament won't agree to a #Brexit deal that hurts the livelihoods & living standards of middle & lower income families, says @ChukaUmunna 
"Leaving #SingleMarket :lowering of imports/ diminution of wealth."@BloombergTV Pound after #SupremeCourt-@Brexit 
As the economy starts to shudder in the face of Brexit, siren voices suggesting we accommodate tax cheats or criminals will only grow louder  
The Supreme Court #Article50 decision should help Brexit rather than hinder it  
Gina Miller, who brought #Brexit case, says she was “shocked by levels of personal abuse” she received 
Shocking that a leading politician is so boldly and shamelessly ignorant concerning the law and parliament. #IDS #Brexit #SupremeCourt 
Who'd have guessed that a Brexit draped in Union Jacks, arrogance and stupidity would lead to a second Scottish independence referendum? 
The Brexit Plan: A One-Act Dramatheresa may: we definitely have a brexit plan, but it's a Secret.labour: sounds legit! we support you. 
Topical reminder of the time I met Iain Duncan Smith, just before the referendum. We had a chat and I mentioned the fact that many unlikely 
If Theresa May intends to deny devolved legislative rights and trample over the will of voters in Scotland - #indyref2 must happen.#Brexit 
The ignorance of @scottishlabour to Scotland's vote to remain is severely damaging your party in Scotland. Take note. #brexit 
Iain Duncan Smith mercilessly tackled by lawyer over Supreme Court Brexit ruling comment  
There's no doubt Theresa May overstated her offer to the devolved nations re Brexit. In Edinburgh last July:  
You know who I blame for all this mess, all the grim Brexit and Trump chaos going down lately? Simon Cowell. Honestly. 
And LibDems will vote against Article 50 bill if no referendum on the final deal. Assumes Article 50 notice is revocable.  
Why are so many politicians too frightened to stand up and say #Brexit is insane and block #Article50 . It IS insane!  Grow a pair & say so! 
What does the Supreme Court ruling mean for Brexit? As ever, @JolyonMaugham provides clarity 
Does 37% represent 'will of the people"? If Corbyn wants to protect workers rights he'd vote against Art50 to prevent Tory tax haven #Brexit 
Corbyn blocking Brexit would be electoral suicide. Corbyn backing Brexit is electoral suicide. Corbyn is electoral suicide. 
Durham's @Prof_Phillipson was cited in #SupremeCourt ruling on #Brexit and will discuss the case on @BBCWorld throughout the day 
The irony isn't lost on me that #Brexit is about "taking back control" from an apparently all-powerful, undemocratic, unaccountable union  
She's right. Verdict strengthens legislature, says short one line bill is fine, devolved no power to stop #brexit  
We Remainers have won in the Supreme Court. Now we demand a proper examination of Brexit in Parliament#premium  
Agreed - Gina Miller did more for the sovereignty of parliament, with this case, than any supporter of Brexit.  
The Lib Dems and the House of Lords will seal their own fate if they attempt to derail Brexit. 
Another threat from unelected Hartley-Brewer. Now opposes will of 'Sovereign Parliament' she espoused endlessly during referendum campaign  
Don't get mad, don't get angry, get informed.  words to live by from @mrjamesob on @LBC#remain #democracy #brexit #supremecourt #life 
With every fresh bit of Brexit news, Scotland edges just a little bit closer to #IndyRef2. 
Well said, from a Brexit supporter.  
The Supreme Court ruling means the Government will probably publish a Brexit bill tomorrow

Referendum is not democracy. Voting for your elected reps is democracy  *BTW Churchill much in favour of EU 
#SupremeCourt decision sets out procedure for Brexit. Looking forward to voting in Parliament to trigger Article 50 before end of March. 
I think he's right. There was a referendum, direct democracy. Cannae go against it.  
Pounds falls after Supreme Court ends prospect of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland blocking Brexit  
#Brexit decision: LibDem MP @thomasbrake tells #5liveDaily he will vote against Article 50 because he doesn't want to "damage" UK economy 
Bill to implement Article 50 will have to go through 5 stages in each chamber of Parliament  
I will be voting to trigger Article 50 and delivering the democratic will of the British people #brexit 
Fascinating and untrue. The fascinating part is the willing ness of the Brexit crowd to lie the way Trump does.  
Parliament and the supreme court Brexit ruling: what happens next?  
Supreme Court result hailed by Remainers as a "victory for democracy".The decision of the British people in the EU referendum: not so much. 
Well done sir. No mandate for hard Brexit.  
We now know that by initially denying parliament a vote on #Article50, #TheresaMay was the enemy of the people. #SupremeCourt #Brexit 
The EU and NATO are the twin pillars of our security. #Brexit is an attack on one of those pillars, no wonder Putin wants it.#Remain #YesEU

I will not vote to destroy jobs and prosperity in #Exeter & the wider South West with a hard Tory #brexit. I will vote against #Article50. 
This is the critical point - Supreme court Brexit judgment isn’t a victory for Gina Miller but for our constitution.  
Germany thinks parliament may stop Brexit  
 out-of-touch establishment delay Brexit democracy is being thwartedIt's a full house from @Arron_banks! 
If Putin & Assad had not sent millions of Syrian refugees pouring into Europe would #Leave have gained a majority?#Remain #Brexit 
The Supreme Court says UK ministers 'not compelled' to consult devolved legislatures on Brexit. For more go to  
Anyone who believes that Miller did this for some higher principle & not to derail Brexit is mad. She wanted to stop Brexit, she failed.  
The people democratically voted for #brexit to happen. Everyone had the chance to go out and vote. 
Today's high court Brexit ruling explained in one simple image....  
I am a Brexiteer, but the Judges have made their decision. All sides need to calm down and respect both the Referendum AND the Judgement. 
Full statement by First Minister @NicolaSturgeon: Scotland faces choice we must make whether we take our future into our own hands #Brexit  
At the end of the day, it disnae matter, all the talking and voting has been done. Scotland voted No, which ties us into Brexit. 
The Labour leadership is not an abstract politico problem. A competently led Labour Party could have saved the UK from a bad Brexit outcome. 
Interesting thing about Trump fans & #brexit people. They are all for freedoms until the said freedoms are democracy & actual sovereignty. 
The people of #Erdington voted 'Leave'. I will vote for Article 50. I will then fight for the best possible #Brexit for Birmingham & Britain 
More by accident than ministerial design, the Supreme Court case has squashed two threats to Brexit  
UK devolved govts may not have a say over #Brexit, but some EU regional parliaments will. All eyes now on #Wallonia! 
When even the Sun knew Leave weren't talking about leaving the Single Market ... Smell the hypocrisy! 
Too all those #Brexit MPs, who opposed Lords Reform: you Reap what you Sow.  You kept us as an amending body - we will fulfil that role. 
Wise MP Ken Clarke on #Article50 bill, today on BBC's @VictoriaLIVE, after decision of Supreme Court vs Gov.#Brexit #SupremeCourt #politics 
gina miller has done more to protect our soverignty than brexit conmen @Nigel_Farage and @Arron_banks #Article50 
Has Theresa May`s hard #Brexit and exit from The Single Market just been doomed? Certainly hope so, its crazy. 
Also something odd about those whose position on Brexit was partly that the UK Parliament should be trusted now getting cross about a vote 
If you want MPs to be able to reject a bad Brexit deal & insist on a new one in 2019, you need clarity on whether Art 50 is reversible asap. 
Repetition of claim Brexit case judges are "enemies of the people" is an utter disgrace. Parliament always has final say after a referendum 
Nicola Sturgeon says it's "becoming clearer by the day" that Scotland is not being listened to on Brexit. #Article50 
Feeble Farron AGAIN drawing BIG emphasis to the fact Article 50 can be revoked. He wants to delay & destroy Brexit! An ENEMY of democracy! 
My response to the #SupremeCourt judgement. A blow for the Govt, and now down to opposition parties to stop an extreme Brexit. #Article50 
#SupremeCourt rules on #Brexit the end of the UK is nigh #buildyesgood luck rUk -  Scotland #indyref2 #Yes2 
Wrote this in November but it seems relevant today: Brexit may prove Britain's long-overdue "constitutional moment".  
UK's Supreme Court rules Act of Parliament needed to Trigger Article 50 Banksters still trying to stop #BrExit  
This is what makes me sick to my stomach, Gina Miller making out her legal action was for a higher principle & not to derail Brexit; liar.  
Brexit for Wales will be equivalent of stabbing out yr eyes before attempting to cross both carriageways of M4 during Newport rush hour. 
Amazing all the #Brexit idiots moaning about today's judgment. They really could do with understanding the nature of our constitution. 
This is pretty damn creative: A sticky-note guide to #Brexit's Article 50 case.  
MP's who table Article 50 amendments to PURPOSELY frustrate, delay & destroy Brexit are NO FRIENDS of the people! 
Hope we all respect judges & their clear decision. Now let's get on & vote to invoke Article 50 & start making #Brexit work for all 
The Supreme Court ruling, like the Brexit vote, has defended the sovereignty of parliament, says @FraserNelson 
"This is a victory for democracy."David Greene, Deir dos Santos' lawyer, gives a statement following the Brexit Supreme Court judgment  
#Brexit plans unlikely to be slowed by Article 50 defeat:  
In Blow To Theresa May, UK Supreme Court Rules Parliament Must Vote Before Brexit Can Start  
The whole referendum issue arose only due to splits in the TORY party, stop trying to make this a story about Labour #VictoriaDerbyshire 
Important on Northern Ireland & Brexit. Supreme Court says Good Friday Agreement covers NI's place in UK, not NI's place in EU:  
stop with the "will of the people" bullshit! Thin majority & absolutely no definition of what #Brexit meant contained in ref 
The man who led the Brexit legal case against the UK government is one of Britain's most influential barristers  
Had the referendum been explicitly presented as "advisory", fair enough. But it wasn't. It was presented as the people's decision. 
Whatever ur #Brexit view, we're lucky we live somewhere government are beholden to law. Something UKIP ALREADY want to erode #SupremeCourt 
Hitting the nail on the head. #Scotland a devolved power house dismissed in one sentence. #Brexit chaos #Wallonia is more powerful 
Scotland told 'You've NO sovereignty' #eatyourcereal. Fully sovereign Ireland ready for Brexit spoils. #independence 
How Daily Mail readers would like to react to the #brexit  decision v how they will  
People outside the UK continue to be far too hopeful that Brexit will be stopped.  
Too many people think the #SupremeCourt ruling is about Brexit going ahead. It's not, it's about parliamentary sovereignty v dictatorship 
#Brexit is helping Putin in his hybrid war against the EU & Western democracy.Why is the government helping our country's enemy?#Remain 
Difficult day for those who thought they helped secure a powerhouse parliament for Scotland and partnership of equals in UK #Brexit  
The Supreme Court says May must get parliament approval to trigger #Brexit  
Then forget your "workers' #brexit". You've given the game away: you have no leverage. It will be oligarch's brexit, all the way.  
TRAITOR: As Gina Miller brings Brexit to a halt, we ask - was #WomensMarch more dangerous than anyone believed?

If my fellow peers try to derail Brexit, they will destroy the House of Lords' credibility@TeleComment #premium  
working so well we decided to keep with the plan and destroy the economy as well with #brexit omnishambles  
Labour are cowards. No opposition at all. Useless. #Brexit  
UK Supreme court ruling is clear: Parliaments must be respected. European Parliament will have the final say on #brexit @EPPGroup 
I cover Emerging Markets, so I can't comment on Brexit. Not for a couple of years, anyway. 
How democracy works: Get elected; Run a referendum; Lose referendum; Move seats round the deck; Fight Supreme Court; Lose; Stay in power. 
@mrjamesob A voice of reason, as always, this morning. Your message needs to be rammed in - nobody promised to leave SM. 
IMO The PM and the 3*Brexiteers* by holding Parliament in contempt re A50 - were hoping to do a *quick & dirty* job on #Brexit#SupremeCourt 
I welcome Supreme Court #brexit ruling, government shouldn't have tried to bypass parliament. We are leaving EU & need best possible deal. 
Coming up very shortly at  my blog on what the Supreme Court decision means for Brexit. Please follow @GoodLawProject 
Gina Miller, the lead claimant in the Brexit challenge, has welcomed today's #SupremeCourt ruling on #Article50

Gina Miller on Brexit ruling: 'Parliament alone is sovereign'  
Lord Callanan warns his fellow peers not to try to derail Brexit  
"This case was about the legal process, not politics."Gina Miller's statement outside the Supreme Court following the #Brexit judgment  
Whatever the Supreme Court ended up saying, there was - and is - going to be a Parliamentary vote on Brexit backed by a majority of MPs. 
Brexit ruling is democracy in action: antiseptic of Parliamentary scrutiny is vital for executive action that impacts our rights #Article50 
The supreme court Brexit judgment isn’t a victory for me, but for our constitution | Gina Miller  
Spent months on jolly around Europe at considerable taxpayers expense trying to subvert #Brexit. .Today #SupremeCourt said they couldn't  
SNP now doing their best to derail Brexit. The Brexit blockers are on the march.  
Then he should get 37.4% of his MPs to vote for Brexit, 34.7% against and tell 27.9% to not turn up.  
UK government doesn't need to consult Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland on triggering #Brexit, Supreme Court rules  
Supreme Court verdict a blow for democracy, they  had their day in court but we have Brexit decision on our side & will fight tooth & nail. 
Demanding rules of our representative democracy be ripped up on basis of advisory referendum isn't democratic. It's authoritarian. 
The Lib Dems have demanded a second EU referendum  
Highest court tells PM she has to run Brexit by parliament.  
If leave campaigners wanted a legally binding referendum they should have pressed for one when referendum legislation was passed 1/2 
The abuse sent to Gina Miller speaks volumes for Brexit. The fact the PM wanted to just steamroll Brexit through, speaks volumes. It stinks. 
This is smart: Labour's proposed amendments from shadow Brexit minister @mtpennycook 
#Brexit decision: @joannaccherry tells #5liveDaily Scotland's views need to be taken into account & they want to stay in the Single Market 
Supreme Court says May must get parliament approval to trigger #Brexit:  
Should #Article50 legislation be opposed if the #Brexit deal is not put to a public vote?*Please vote and RT, debate welcome* 
For those outside UK: Supreme Court ruling unlikely to stop #Brexit. Case was more about enforcing principle of parliamentary sovereignty 
Douglas Carsewll referring to subverting the 'Will of the People' - a classic populist & authoritarian attempt to suppress dissent#Brexit 
So May, by appealing unanimous high court decision, has just lost time on Brexit.  High court vindicated.5/ends 
Douglas Carswell is still claiming on Sky News that Labour leadership want to stop Brexit (we wish!). Goes unchallenged 
#UKIP Deputy Leader @prwhittle - "Just get on with it (Brexit), we should have triggered article 50 the day after the referendum vote" 
“Do what the people wanted you to do”@UKIP @SuzanneEvans1 attacks SNP, Lib Dems and some in Labour for “frustrating process” of Brexit  
Parliament gave the people the power ( for once ) in a referendum. Today the courts gave it back to a remain House of Parliament.  
Of course, the first lawyer who tried to stop Brexit was probably Sir Thomas More. 
We now need MPs to uphold the will of the people and back Brexit. Shame so many seem ready to oppose democracy when it doesn't go their way. 
Ruling for the claimants doesn't threaten #Brexit, it just tells us how to do it according to UK law. #RuleofLaw #Article50 
Gina Miller and the #Brexit legal battle - in 60 seconds  
Thnx Supreme Court. But makes no difference until those opposed to isolationism start to campaign on economic/geo-poliical damage of Brexit 
#Brexit decision:  @GrahamAllenMP tells Adrian Chiles that Gina Miller has done what MPs failed to do #5liveDaily  
The one thing you need to know today: #SupremeCourt ruling is *not* blocking Brexit or the will of the people. It is purely about process. 
4. For the "but the Referendum!" wails:  
So, we've gone from Hard Brexit to a Semi. 
Today's a big defeat for Theresa May who'll now have to be more accountable to parliament in shaping BREXIT. Appeal to SC just wasted time 
Whatever your view on #Brexit, it must be right that parliament makes laws. 
Another capitulation from Labour. No fight, no interest in defending ordinary people, no clue. #brexit  
That it took an actual private - PRIVATE - prosecution to get a Parliamentary vote on Brexit is such a disgrace...  
The Supreme Court has been very clear. The Government must now get on with it and put forward a simple Brexit Bill  
.@LibDems say they'll oppose Article 50 legislation unless final #Brexit deal is put to public vote

As brexit was fought for to maintain U.K. Parliamentary sovereignty and not at all about being racist, all brexiters must be delighted.

Labour will seek to amend the Article 50 Bill to prevent the Conservatives using Brexit to turn Britain into a bargain basement tax haven. 
I'll will be voting to trigger #Article50 as I respect the ref result - but that doesn't mean we have to agree to govt's Brexit approach. 
If you agree with the Liberal Democrats that the British people must have a final say on the #Brexit deal, join us:  
As the verdict will barely delay, let alone stop, Brexit, I can only assume that those angry about it just don't like judicial independence. 
Labour respects the result of the referendum and the will of the British people and will not frustrate the process for invoking Article 50. 
Let us not forget that Parliament backed the referendum by a margin of six to one, now it is time to get on with Brexit as instructed. 
UKIP "disappointed" that SNP won't lie down and let Brexit be imposed on us. We must be doing something right.

Brexit being used not only as a means of taking power back from EU, but also re-centralising power within the UK.

Hooray! Triggering #Brexit needs parliamentary approval & therefore prior debate. TRUE democracy.  
Gina right -govt was trying to take away your freedoms behind closed doors. Now we can challenge that as MPs in any brexit deal #brexithaos 
People telling me my Brexit instincts are old fashioned. Rooted in the 1970's. Rubbish ... they are rooted in the 1640's. 
I admire Iain Duncan Smith. Imagine being the least talented in a party that includes Grayling, Fox and Leadsom. Superb effort that. #Brexit 
Liberal Democrats say they will vote against Article 50 unless the people are given their say on the final #Brexit deal. 
Theresa May cannot trigger #Brexit without parliamentary permission, UK Supreme Court rules

Any concerns about the legitimacy of  #Brexit should have been raised BEFORE the referendum.Not used afterwards as a delay tactic.

Supreme Court rules Brexit to be a confusing load of bollocks that nobody understands  
If Parliament had done it’s job properly at least one MP would have spotted the referendum bill failed to say what happened next. 
Supreme Court gives MPs final say - so I'll try to the amend Bill & pull Govt away from dangerous hard #Brexit path   
A key political point in the #Miller judgment: it's not about the merits of Brexit. Blog post this evening hopefully.  
MPs should vote their genuine informed & considered view of UK interests, not the politically illegitimate, flawed referendum outcome. 
UK parliament must approve start of Brexit process, Supreme Court rules

I am very sad to say that the LibDems have a coherent line on Brexit, rightly demanding a 2nd referendum, but Lab seems to have no strategy 
Today's #Article50 ruling upholds both the Rule of Law and Parliamentary Sovereignty - democracy in action  #Brexit 
So Lib Dems now firmly committed to 2nd referendum on final Brexit deal + will vote against A50 without it. Lab position more nuanced 
Britain's top court ruled that the government must get Parliament's approval before starting Brexit talks  
UK parliamentary sovereignty requires meaningful scrutiny of any Brexit deal. Govt must NOT try to sideline Parliament  
We will only support triggering Article 50 if the people are guaranteed a referendum on the deal at the end of negotiating process. 
A victory for Parliamentary democracy and the rule of law. Thank you #GinaMiller #Brexit

Gina Miller | The supreme court Brexit judgment isn’t a victory for me, but for our constitution  
Government lose appeal as Supreme Courts rules Parliament must approve start of Brexit process. What a total waste of public money and time. 
Scotland be like..."You can NEVER, take OUR UNELECTED BUREAUCRATIC EU DICTATORSHIP!!!!" #Brexit #Article50 
Cameron-led Gov was grossly deficient in omitting implementation provisions from Referendum Bill.Possibly deliberately.Thank God he’s gone 
#BREAKING UK government need not consult Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland on starting Brexit: court 
What's not to like about UK judges upholding UK law and UK Parliamentary sovereignty? "Enemies of the people" smear was another Brexit lie 
Thank You #GinaMiller and Supreme Court. #Brexit 
Brexit judgment: Lord Neuberger sets out why the Supreme Court rejected the Government's appeal  
Green MP Caroline Lucas: "I will not be capitulating to the Tories over Brexit – and will vote against prematurely triggering Article 50." 
Moment the government lost the Brexit case it should have got on with putting a bill through parliament. They've wasted their own time. 
Oops David Cameron reputation trashed again. If he'd included a clause in Referendum Bill could have avoided today's judgement. 
So now the real Brexit debate in parliament begins  
The Latest: Britain's Supreme Court says that the government can't trigger Brexit without an act of Parliament.  
All the lawyers in London cannot subvert the referendum. Clear way ahead now: vote in Parliament. Replace Commons or Lords if they veto 
4) That there is robust and regular Parliamentary scrutiny throughout the Brexit negotiations. 
Gina Miller is the one remaining claimant in the legal challenge to Brexit. The other two couldn't handle the abuse. What a woman. 
"The referendum is of great political significance." President of Supreme Court Lord Neuberger #Brexit #Article50 
Breaking: U.K. Parliament must vote on triggering Brexit process, court rules, complicating Theresa May's plans   
The Supreme Court ruling, like the Brexit vote, has defended the sovereignty of parliament. My take:  
So now we have the court's decision on the Brexit legal rules - let's get on with it, and give the people what they voted for! 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May Will Have To Consult Parliament Before Starting The Formal Brexit Process 
Do you agree with the Supreme Court's ruling that the government can't trigger Article 50 without parliamentary permission? #Brexit 
NEWS! Supreme Court Brexit decision to be written on the side of a bus  
Ploughing ahead with hard #Brexit is not respecting the result of the advisory referendum, it is grotesquely abusing democracy.#Remain 
A victory for democracy - the govt must consult parliament before triggering Article 50 #Brexit #Article50 
We want the people to be given a final say on the #Brexit deal in a referendum. Without that we will vote against Article 50. #SupremeCourt 
1) That a detailed Government plan for Brexit is published before Article 50 is triggered, along with robust impact assessments. 
Pound falls following Supreme Court ruling on Brexit trigger  
If the government respected the result of the advisory #EURef it would carefully balance the views of the 48% and 52%#Remain #Brexit 
Supreme Court reject Scotland's right to have a say in BrexitAlong with Wales and Northern Ireland 
Maybe this is a victory after all for #Brexit  
What a futile, costly, damaging waste of time the Supreme Court appeal has been, thus making it the perfect training for Brexit itself.

No role for Scottish, NI and Welsh governments in deciding when to trigger Article 50 Brexit talks says Supreme Court, as expected 
We therefore plan to table amendments to the Article 50 Bill in order to significantly increase Parliament's grip on the Brexit process.

Inflation at 1.6% apple raising app prices by 20% we are all getting poorer. Thank ou Brexit.

We are #EUnited and now we're also angry. Two main requirements for stopping #brexit we can do this! #NoWayMay 
Am worried about slow motion nature of Mrs May's Brexit, but am very pleased she made clear UK will walk away rather than sign a bad deal. 
Many voted Leave expecting to stay in the Single Market... many would prefer to Remain to Hard Brexit  
Hard Brexit is bad for the masses who believed the Red Bus Lies. There is no mandate to stuff the economy and impoverish the NHS #NoWayMay 
Because it took 9 years or more to get a referendum.  
They prolly all stood in one line behind Kagame during that referendum. 
Sorry but there will be a Scottish Independence Referendum in 2018and this time we will win it! 
Kay Burley must be livid at Brexit. Where else will she find someone to clean her mansion and pool for £3 an hour? It must be horrific 4her.

There is truth in this. #brexit  
So Scottish Labour would rather have Scotland consigned to a hard brexit and Tory rule! Well done Kezia! Am sure that'll go down well...  
Right here is the reason why Sturgeon can never win #indyref2. Brexit has divided the Independence cause and it is glorious to behold.

As Theresa May steers Britain towards 'hard' Brexit, disruptions loom for Europe's political and economic structure  
Is a 'hard Brexit' the best way for the UK to leave the EU?  
We cannot let @Theresa_May use Brexit to turn Britain into a tax haven on the edge of Europe and create a bargain basement economy. #Brexit  
The EU has achieved so much with the UK as a central component, it sickens and saddens me that the UK is doing what it is doing. #brexit 
So Ruth Davidson 'demanded' the SNP get on with getting the best #brexit for Scotland.Now that's failed what's next? 
Britain will leave the EU even if Parliament votes against Brexit, Downing Street confirms.

Brexit gives UK 'once in a hundred years opportunity' to restore fish and marine life  
Labour should be owning it: hard Brexit is gonna trash the NHS, hard Brexit is gonna spike the prices, hard Brexit is gonna hurt the nurses. 
Incredible.@UKLabour is more concerned with how the EU emerges from a #Brexit deal than how Britain does.You can't make this shit up. 
Emily Thornberry on @Channel4News just now should be studied as an example of why Labour's Brexit message is failing. Weak, muddled, shifty. 
I just think until we can get all five or six Lib Dem MPs behind it we should put Brexit on hold 
Can we deport stupid celebrities like Lily Allen as part of the Brexit deal? 
Emily Thornberry truly poor on C4 News on Labour & Brexit. Does she bother to prepare for these interviews? Floored by basic questions.

I started to *DECODE* the PM's #Brexit speechI gave up.Clear to me she's put interests of the Tory Party BEFORE the interests of the UK. 
Theresa May's aim is to deliver a hard extreme Brexit tearing us out of singlemarket as favoured by UKIP & Farage w/Corbyn & Lab backing her

@theresa_may I did not vote to Leave and I will never 'unite' behind Brexit or those who voted Leave and set this country on a path to ruin.

Read here the Government of Ireland's statement on Brexit following Prime Minister May’s speech today : 
Looks like Theresa May is selling the UK down the river. Only @LibDems are arguing for a sensible departure. Labour r nowhere #brexit  
Brexit/Trump/Le Pen votes were all protests against the governing 'establishment.' Worth noting that DUP is governing 'establishment' here. 
2) May not in control of Brexit. SC ruling matters, but more consequential is position of EU27, who look at disorganised UK 
Extra measures may be needed to ensure environmental regulations remain in full force post-#Brexit  
It's not a free vote when your decisions were based upon fake news, prejudice and intellectual coercion . #brexit  
#nowaymay everyday Brexit gets more bonkers and people seem to forget this is not the will of the majority  
May’s speech means a Hard Brexit for the island of Ireland  
Tim Farron doesn't like #brexit or democracy and what the UK will become post #brexit - a global outlooking nation.  
Actually feel ashamed to be British. @theresa_may making it clear #Brexit is about keeping other Europeans out of the UK. Just sickening. 
Ken Clarke's question same as our "returning Brexit" video; some think we'll have deals all over world on own rules  
Stop patronising the 52% – the Brexit vote was a rational act  
This is a con. Parliament should be debating right now, on whether to enter a #Brexit 'negotiation' in the first place. And saying No.  
If you're rich you'll survive #brexit b/c you always walk away from calamities but for everyone else it will be a mean and cruel era for you

British politics is such an embarrassment.  I wouldn't trust David Davis or Theresa May to negotiate traffic, much less Brexit

Have a lot of respect for @Keir_Starmer but totally disagree with this. May's plans are an extreme gamble with Britain's future #brexit

#brexit : Our free reminder of the SNP's entirely consistent approach to why the UK should stay in the EU but Scotland should leave the UK

I am sadly convinced that once #brexit has humbled our economy and our lifestyles, we will be sore losers & lash out at Europe for our folly 
In a mark of progress on Brexit, May used "clear" 14 times in the speech, and all but one used without an adverb ("absolutely clear", etc). 
British PM Theresa May commits to put final Brexit deal to a vote in both houses of the UK parliament

Key point about Parliament's vote on Brexit deal - PM refused to say it will be binding. So if she loses it, expect a 2019 general election.

One thing no-one - Tory or Labour - seems to have answer to is what happens if parliament did vote down #Brexit deal at end of negotiation 
The SNP should take a second indyref threat off table following PM’s ‘clear and reasonable’ Brexit plan: 
Remain worried that it could be.Brexit expressly promised that it wouldn't be.This is actually a double lie.Misrepresenting BOTH sides  
Like the eurosceptic wing of the Tory Party, I too favour a "Heaven's Gate" Brexit and am willing to join the Freedom of Movement Away Team 
Theresa May has called Sturgeon's bluff. SNP demanded "soft Brexit" to prevent second referendum. 
If the Prime Minister wants a #Brexit that works for everyone then she needs to stop excluding the 48% entirely in her plans 
If only there was an iconic work of English literature that shows how well negotiations go after you divest yourself of authority... #Brexit

A stupid idea is a stupid idea no matter how many people voted for it. Labour should be fighting Brexit with everything we've got. 
Mrs May @theresa_may is taking the UK towards the hardest, the most damaging, the most extreme Brexit, that wasn't on the referendum paper. 
Now in chamber - PM may not be here but we will never stop asking questions about deal govt plans for brexit as such a mess! 
Theresa May's Brexit speech is Angela Merkel's victory - here's why  
Have a question since the beginning,why the 48% seems so silent & not represented in #Brexit debate? Even in this sad #HardBrexit day? #May

Hi folks, here's my reaction to the Prime Minister's fantastic speech on Brexit  
The White Paper for Scottish independence was roundly mocked and vilified, yet it was far more comprehensive than May's Brexit strategy! 
How do I know PM May's speech abt #Brexit was right on? The Liberal Democrats are screeching& want 2nd Referendum! 
This hard Tory #Brexit is a kick in the teeth to those that voted Leave believing they would be offered an EEA/EEFA style deal.  
Feels to me that the Brexit negotiations will move to a negotiation breakdown blame game  - both sides say "we wanted a fair deal, but..." 
.@Theresa_May says you can't have #Brexit without leaving the European single market 
BBC lunch time news all anti Brexit. Where is the pro reporting. Where is impartiality? Why do we pay a licence fee for this crap.

Indyref2 now appears inevitable after May's Hard Brexit speech  
Britain leaving the EU like #brexit 
That's all folks. That was the Plan. No 10 say nothing more to come on Brexit pre Article 50 
So in shortMay's #Brexit priority is to secure Britain's borders.Everything else is secondary.And that's not even a *TINY* bit racist? 
It was good to see #TheresaMay standing strong on #Brexit and not giving into the pressure coming from the Remainers and Liberal Left...  
May "both sides in the referendum campaign made it clear that a vote to leave the EU would be a vote to leave the Single Market." 
Schrödinger’s Border : it maintains an Irish common travel area while avoiding an EU free movement of people. #brexit  h/t @TimForde

"Brutal Brexit"? And Trump "wants an end to NATO"? Give me strength.

Theresa May sets Britain on course for a hard Brexit 
PM's Brexit speech driven by narrow-minded outdated British nationalism and Tory self interest  
One very positive aspect to May speech: pledges "proper Parliamentary debate" on any change to EU law after Brexit. Doesn't quite rule out 
Todays @theresa_may proves that 'Brexit means Brexit' @NicolaSturgeon gives her reaction to @SkyNews 
Final #Brexit deal with the EU will mean the UK leaving the European single market, Theresa May has announced  
From June 2016 to January 2017: which shade of Brexit?From January 2017: (full, clean) Brexit, or no Brexit. 
Don't know about anyone else but May's speech left me more determined than ever to oppose Brexit in any way I (peacefully) can. 
#Farron:"This is a theft of democracy" No mate.This is EXACTLY the #Brexit that I signed for as I understood it! 
Government statement on Brexit  
Interesting that Tim Farron now appears to be the de facto official opposition on #Brexit. No sign of Corbyn or Labour. 
Here's a recap of the main points from Theresa May's speech, outlining her Brexit strategy  
Hi @timfarron @nick_clegg these are for you. #Brexit  
My daily Brexit toon: UtopiaALL OUR NIGHTMARES COME TRUE!#Brexit #Brexitshambles #BizzarolandFB:  
Pound soars 2% against dollar at $1.2285 after @theresa_may's #Brexit speech 
Soft Brexit: long complicated uncertain negotiations with savvy and experienced EU negotiators.Oh sod it, let's go for a Hard Brexit. 
Just last year Theresa May admitted that a hard Brexit would be bad for our economy  
First Q to PM after Brexit speech: "you said Brexit would make people poorer. Do you still believe that?"She doesn't answer the question  
#TheresaMay's #Brexit speech tacks #GlobalBritain firmly to a free-trade,classically liberal ideal.The very 'globalism' Brexiteers despise  
"Incredibly disappointing for anybody who thinks democracy matters" says @timfarron claiming PM's #brexit speech was a "theft on democracy"  
There should be a vote of no confidence in May and her cabinet. Collectively clueless. #brexit 
For those celebrating the pound rising, I refer to my tweet from earlier this morning…. #Brexit  
Pascal once said that he wrote a long letter because he had not enough time to write a short one.Ditto, UK choosing hard over soft Brexit. 
This is now beyond #brexit it is now about democracy, divisive media control, parliamentary accountability & downright lies #NoWayMay 
So May wants change from Great Britain to Global Britain. So far it mostly looks like little Britain #brexit #BrexitSpeech 
#Brexit doesn't seem so bad when you consider how lucky we are not to be American 
#brexit is going to a vote in the HOC. If you want #brexit - vote #ukip at every by-election to make your voice heard. Don't take risks. 
If anyone had doubt that Tory's self-destruction around Brexit was caused by running scared of UKIP well here it is from horse's mouth...  
Britain has laid out its plan for #brexit. Next, it is the job of #EU27 to find a common position. United we stand, divided we fall. 
Did the PM choose a hard or clean Brexit? No - she just chose Brexit. Debate around 'hard & soft' is a tactic to subvert will of the people. 
The government, having realised a safe Soft Bexit would be complicated, has gone for the easier but more perilous option of a Hard Brexit. 
In 10yrs reflection on Brexit chaos will be like Iraq War revisionism. "How could we have known?" You knew. We told you. You did it anyway. 
All the Brexit/Trump tweets are giving me a newfound appreciation of Ireland's simplicity. Our country ain't perfect but...feck. Brightside! 
.@TechnicallyRon @grahamorriss This was my favourite #brexit representation  
Apple’s British App Store is getting more expensive because of Brexit  
Interesting labelling of Yer Brexit by the SNP as English and Tory, again forgetting the large number of their supporters who voted for it. 
The UK pound is headed for its best day in more than 8 years after Theresa May's Brexit speech  
If I hear one more brexiter complain about the Houses of Parliament voting on the #brexit deal. YOU wanted parliamentary sovereignty!  
It is also quite clear that Theresa May has no serious interest in any accommodation with Scotland or Northern Ireland in shaping #Brexit. 
UK PM will work for the greatest possible access to single market:  #Brexit  
European leaders fire back at Trump after the U.S. president-elect criticized the EU and NATO, and praised Brexit.  
Much of Europe's political class in denial about #Brexit. PM's speech shows serious intent. But extends a hand of friendship & collaboration 
Theresa May refuses to say what happens if Parliament rejects her Brexit deal  
How dare Tim Farron describe the implementation of a decision of the people in a referendum as a 'theft of democracy ' 
The main Brexit prob in NI not border (tech/political fixes doable). It's a Belfast agreement founded on assumption of common EU membership.

"I was chuckling at some of it to be honest, because it seemed like she was channeling UKIP " says @SuzanneEvans1 on PM's #Brexit speech  
In a referendum, the UK would vote for mandatory beer taps in homes. Doesn't mean government would do it or that it would be good for us. 
Theresa May is acting like the referendum is binding (it isn't) and she has a large majority (it's 16).Can we have some Opposition, pls? 
Let's face it, when it comes to "calamatous acts of self harm" the UK is fast becoming an expert #brexit #TheresaMay 
I see "transition arrangements" has replaced "we don't know what Brexit means", itself the unconvincing sequel to "Brexit won't happen". 
.@theresa_may makes it clear that her #Brexit framework is in the interest of the UK, Europe and the wider world  
Pound jumps by most since July as Theresa May reveals Brexit plan  
Scotland voted remain, yet in choosing a hard Brexit the UK Government has willingly accepted 80,000 job losses in Scotland within 10 years. 
It's clear Britain has no real Brexit plan because Theresa May's speech didn't mention kebabs once.

Still cannot believe people voted for Brexit..Its quite simply unbelievable..Why would you vote for something that makes you worse off? 
Great response to PM's Brexit briefing. The sterling strong against the Euro and the Dollar. At first sight looks like what we voted for. 
There's no mandate for Hard Brexit; to sideline Parliament or to become a tax haven. This looks more like a coup every day. #BrexitCoup 
.@theresa_may explains what #Brexit means for immigration into Britain  
Westminster Labour rarely opposes British nationalist projects. The empire, WWI, endless wars, Trident, now Brexit. It's institutional.

Update on 2017 in the UK:– N. Ireland executive collapsed– England and Wales head for hard Brexit– Scotland hurtling towards #indyref2 
I grew up on Irish/UK border; the checkpoint was at the end of our street. It was grim. Watching Brexit shambles with dread & growing fury. 
First speech on BBC News Channel is Tim Farron not Jeremy Corbyn. Labour's horrific non-stance on #Brexit will harm the country. 
Could there be a more stunning indictment of the PM's speech on #Brexit?  
My favourite bit was when she claimed all 65 million people of the UK were behind this nonsense. #brexit  
Thank you Nigel for all you have done. #Brexit  
Theresa May's great inspirationFor taking control of the nationIs make sure hard BrexitFinancially wrecks itAnd ends economic migration. 
What sort of delusion is #TheresaMay suffering from as if her speech would change my mind about wanting to remain an EU Citizen. #Brexit 
Have been critical of May on Brexit, but that speech was as detailed as it reasonably could be at this stage. 
But if May did lose a vote on the Brexit deal it would surely be tantamount to a vote of no-confidence in her govt. 
With Brexit, EU loses:- 18% of its GDP- 13% of its population- EU's largest military spender- $10.4 billion in annual net contribution 
Parliament could choose to exit with no deal, legislate for a Final Deal referendum, or to Remain. But only one of those is likely.  
If I hear *the will of the British people* once more  People cast their vote based on lies. The politicians LIED #Brexit 
"I feel quite emotional" says Theresa Villiers "...another big step towards becoming an independent country again" #bbcdp #brexit  
"NI can't afford Irish Language Act" says member of party that blindly supported Brexit against countless warnings of economic damage. 
It would be "an act of calamitous self-harm" if any EU member state sought punitive #Brexit deal - @theresa_may  
It's a full English Brexit... 
No mention of the £350 million extra for our NHS a week that was a key promise by the Leave campaign. This isn't the Brexit people voted for 
The Prime Minister has just given her vision for #Brexit and future of the UK. There was no mention of the environment or climate change. 
Good q from @Peston - if Parl votes down final Brexit deal will we stay in EU? Some say A50 trigger means we'd be out but with no deal

A gentle reminder that the European Parliament also has to accept the Brexit deal... 
"So that's my Brexit plan. Cheers."  
May twice declines invitation to say she has changed her mind on whether Brexit will be good for UK - says only econ data better than feared 
Not one word about the racism employed to win the referendum, nor the increase in racism since. Why, it's almost as though she doesn't care! 
Brexit latest:  
PM continuing to dodge question on whether she thinks Britons will be worse off after #brexit. Second time of asking. So far... 
Brexiters said we would remain in the single market. Can we add that to the list of things that was misleading during the campaign? #brexit

All economic indicators since the referendum have been more positive than predicted, @theresa_may reminds @bbclaurak 
Theresa thinks the nation is coming together behind Brexit and the 'winners' are magnanimous? Is she using a different Internet? 
ugh the reality of brexit just sunk in 
Absolutely no reassurance on higher education or research from #TheresaMay. Now we know - #Brexit means jumping off the cliff and hoping... 
PM is right that "no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain". #Brexit #AGlobalBritain

Remember it was David Cameron who betrayed Britain with the EU ref but it will be Theresa May who sells us out with #brexit. #tories 
No mention from #TheresaMay of the damage #Brexit will do to environmental protections. We must stand up to protect our nature and wildlife 
May just claimed 65 million people are behind her and #Brexit. I'm not. And I won't be magnanimous. She's utterly delusional. 
Blimey. This Teresa May #Brexit speech is a tough wank.  
May already setting the terms for any #Brexit failure. It will be Europe's fault. Watch press fall in line with this self serving excuse 
65 million people willing us forward. What? Not me, sorry. #brexit 
"No deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain," Theresa May says  
Brexit means Clean Brexit, Deal means No Deal. No single market but best possible access to single market. #waffle 
Going for hard Brexit is ignoring Scotland's position paperHow can she even pretend she is listening to Scotland? #Indyref2 
May suggests that if Brexit leaves us worse off it will be the fault of people who said Brexit would leave us worse off. Bold. #BrexitSpeech

Theresa May criticising the media, she’s literally playing a Trump card. #Brexit 
One problem of UK PM May outlining ideal Brexit package is that it fails to prepare the country for inevitable compromises & hard choices 
UPDATE: UK Chancellor Hammond says pound has spiked during #Brexit speech by PM May:  
Theresa May is effectively saying that anyone who gives negative briefings to journalists on Brexit is unpatriotic, which is lovely. 
Even as she speaks, I'm satisfied & proud of PM May and her cogent vision for our country.All Britons must support her leadership in Brexit  
#TheresaMay in a nutshell: We want benefits of EU membership without being members. We are not saying how we are going to get it. #brexit

It's now clear the Government is pursuing a Hard #Brexit with Britain out the Single Market, limiting opportunities for future generations 
"... and the moon on a stick"#Brexit 
Brexit plan:   - exit single market - leave European Court of Justice - immigration control - parliament vote  
We're going to have to wait for season 7 of "The Crown" to find out what the queen makes of all this #brexit 
Leaders of the #EU27 countries on their backs on the floor, legs in the air, howling laughing. #Brexit 
The incredible talent of politicians being able to say so many words, and yet at the same time saying nothing at all #Brexit 
So Tories will regulate labour - but deregulate (further) capital and trade flows & accelerate privatisation & tax breaks? #Brexit 
.@theresa_may: "We will ensure workers' rights are fully protected and maintained." #Brexit  
NEWS! Hard Brexit will be ‘brilliant for Britain’, insists complete f*cking moron  
PM seems determined to tank the economy,which no one voted for,but no mention of the £350m extra p/w for the NHS pple did vote for #Brexit 
Yay, Brexit. I'm going to buy a third of a Freddo to celebrate 
PM confirms transition period to avoid a "cliff edge" Brexit. She will hope the transition phase doesn't last as long as post-Fergie Man Utd

MAY: Confidence is a preference for the habitual voyeur of what is known as *BREXIT*  
Here’s a new Policy Exchange paper about why “hard” or “clean” Brexit is the least bad option for the UK now  
Brexit "plan".  
.@theresa_may talks about immigration control as part of her #Brexit speech  
Hard Brexit it is  
Today I told the Chancellor: #Tooting residents did not vote for a hard #Brexit, leaving the single market puts their jobs at risk.  
.@theresa_may sets out her #Brexit plan by defending the UK's place in Europe. "Leaving the EU... Not Europe."  
May: "We won't have to make vast contributions to the EU" #Brexit #BrexitSpeech 
@ManMadeMoon as a Canadian Brexit is like seeing your 80 yr old mum start to smoke crack and get a back tattoo 
This is how the pound has reacted so far during Theresa May's speech  
BREAKING! Theresa May confirms Brexit will be as hard as Nigel Farage's current erection 
"Brexit must mean control of the number of people who come to Britain from Europe" - @theresa_may  
2. Fear is driving her to a hard Brexit. She doesn't believe in it. Indeed she and her chancellor said last year there should be no Brexit 
"We have to do Brexit because the people wanted it.""The people want a fully funded NHS too."...*footsteps, door slams, car starts* 
Trump warns that the #Brexit vote shows countries want their own identity. The EU answers with a cry: “More Europe!”  
BREAKING: Theresa May confirms she isn't seeking membership of EU single market  
I wonder if Netflix would be ok with me ending my membership but asking to still have access to all of their shows. #brexit 
It is ludicrous to suggest we have the trade deficit we do because of the EU as the PM seems to suggest #Brexit 
#TheresaMay talks of Britain becoming a "great trading nation" by leaving the world's largest free trade area... #Brexit 
Be the world's biggest advocate for free trade by leaving the world's biggest free trading area. Makes sense. #Brexit 
Only option is 'hard' Brexit - the EU will see to that. U.K. media agenda one of false empowerment of UK govt pretending soft option exists. 
The PM fails to understand if we leave the EU Single Market we'd have no say over the rules applying to almost half our exports #Brexit

UK cannot remain part of the single market, @theresa_maysays in major #Brexit speech  
I have still - STILL, after 6 months - to hear anyone name a single practical, TANGLIBLE benefit that Brexit will bring. Not one. 
No Single Market membership after Brexit. If anybody is surprised, they haven't been paying attention. 
Prime Minister Theresa May has said that her plans for Brexit cannot allow the UK to remain in the European single market 
Biggest myth perpetuated by UK media is notion that there's a 'choice' between 'hard' and 'soft' Brexit. 
Sterling is moving higher during Theresa May's Brexit speech:  
Isn't the 'greatest possible access' to the European Single Market known as membership? #Brexit #May 
A reminder from @theresa_may that BOTH sides in the referendum campaign said leaving the EU would mean leaving the single market 
That’s a bare faced LIE. Both sides did NOT state leaving EU = leaving the Single Market. #brexit 
May confirms she is pursuing a hard Brexit - it will wrench Britain out of the Single Market and damage our economy 
Teresa May's #Brexit speech...blaming immigration for pressure on schools and public services is shameful. Lies. 
Remember the last time a British Prime Minister made big promises about devolved powers for Scotland after a referendum? #BrexitSpeech 
The Brexit PowerPoint presentation is (without much exaggeration) at @Number10gov 
MP's to get a vote on the final Brexit deal - no problem! I expect the Tory majority to respect democracy - unlike Feeble Farron's Lib Dems. 
Former deputy prime minister and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg tells Owen Jones he warned David Cameron his Brexit strategy was failing  
Theresa May confirms Parliament will have final vote on Brexit  
If City folk still think there are 325 MPs out there likely to vote to block Brexit they need to snap out of wishful thinking daydreams. 
.@theresa_may confirms Government will put final #Brexit deal agreed by UK/EU to a vote in both Houses of Parliament  
Watching May on #Brexit is like seeing the smart kid at school asked by teacher to defend the side they don't agree with in class debate. 
Excluding wars, has a country ever made a single decision as pointless & destructive as brexit? 
Er, so what was the point of Brexit again?  
MEANINGLESS: "Parliament will vote for final Brexit deal or be be labelled 'enemies of the people' by the press" confirms Prime Minister. 
"We will convert the body of existing EU law into British law," says @theresa_may about #Brexit

So, are we all bracing our splitting sides for the raft of anti-Brexit nonsense that will come from Clegg, Sturgeon & Corbyn ?  
Theresa May to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland: "It is more important than ever that we face the future together."BREXIT MEANS BREXIT  
12 objectives! We can have a Christmas song! "On the fourth day of Brexit, my true love gave to me/ A common travel area with Ireland" 
BREAKING: Parliament will vote on final Brexit deal, Theresa May says  
True to her word, @theresa_may is carrying out the expressed wish of the British people for a clean Brexit. She deserves unstinting support. 
If it is good enough for Parliament to have a vote on May's Brexit deal, then it is good enough for the public to have their say. 
Different issue.Supreme Court case, re A50 notification.Today's promise: vote on Brexit deal.  
When it comes to brexit parliament must show a courage I fear it does not have and vote against this madness.#brexitspeech 
May's Brexit plan in full

JUST IN: UK PM May says government will put the final Brexit deal to a vote in both Houses of Parliament:  
Theresa May says government will put final Brexit deal agreed between EU and UK before parliament for vote  
Theresa May speech: Good on parliamentary scrutiny - all changes of law and final Brexit deal will be scrutinised by Parliament. 
After Brexit we set sail for America, says May  
the pound really shot up on confirmation of parliamentary vote on Brexit  
"We are leaving the European Union, but we're not leaving Europe," says @theresa_may in her #Brexit speech  
Theresa May says Westminster will vote on final Brexit deal - but doesn't mention Scottish, Northern Irish or Welsh parliaments. 
PM @theresa_may outlines government's objectives ahead of #Brexit negotiations 
Parliamentary vote on final Brexit deal: Good but probably ultimately meaningless. Between shit deal & nothing, they'll support a shit deal. 
Both the House of Commons and House of Lords will be getting a vote on the final Brexit deal, the PM says. 
I've broken up with women over the phone in a more diplomatic and sensitive manner than this. #TheresaMayhem #brexit #brexitspeech 
Brexit really does mean Brexit. #BrexitSpeech 
May: "I want to outline twelve objectives in our Brexit negotiations. You Won't Believe Number Six " 
MAY: GOVERNMENT WILL PUT THE FINAL BREXIT DEAL TO A VOTE IN BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT 
.@theresa_may confirms that final Brexit deal will be put to vote in Parliament 
Theresa May claims the EU referendum result was a vote for a "new global Britain". It really wasn't.  
Theresa May says the referendum was a vote to restore democracy, but refuses Parliament a vote on Article 50 or public vote on #Brexit deal 
Brexit dictator delivers #BrexitSpeech outside parliament to avoid parliamentary scrutiny & questioning. #SovereigntyCharade #NoWayMay 
#BrexitSpeech Sturgeon says she definitely wasn't bluffing about Indyref2 with Hard Brexit but her Indyref2 paperwork was eaten by the dog. 
Breaks my heart the UK is leaving the EU. I don't see how we can be global, if we aren't part of something bigger than ourselves. #Brexit 
Very impressed by opening tone of @theresa_may crucial #Brexit speech against 'A Global Britain' backdrop. Exactly the right approach! 
PM: "No partial membership of the EU, associate membership of the EU, or anything that leaves us half-in, half-out." #Brexit

May says the referendum result "was not a decision to turn inward and away from the world”. Let’s see how that gels with cutting migration 
Theresa May says the UK must come together as "one great union of nations" to make Brexit succeed. I'm not sure Nicola Sturgeon will agree. 
May claims Brexit voters did so with eyes open - i.e. with clear understanding of all downsides: shrinking econ etc. I doubt that

Easy to see how hard Brexit turns into a series of vetoes and a UK-EU tax war turning Britain into a tax haven. Effect on NHS: devastating.

With UK inflation now almost up to 2% target, those deflation fears belong to the distant pre Brexit world. How long till well above target? 
Food price rises disproportionately hit the poorest in society. Highly predictable impact of #Brexit

UK Prime Minister Theresa May to give clearest signals yet on Brexit:  via @ReutersTV

11. Events will intervene – and may alter how we feel about Brexit. And if they do, the Dublin case will ensure we can reconsider. 
Here's a little something to keep you busy while @theresa_may talks Britain out of the #singlemarket #Brexit  
Thanks to Peter Mandelson and his kind, #Leave would win any second #Brexit referendum by about ten million votes. 
Ill-informed Remoaners screeching about inflation rising to 1.6% "because of Brexit". THE BANK OF ENGLAND TARGET IS 2%! On course. 
Really looking forward to the PM's speech #Brexit  
Lord Mandelson is right to warn against a hard #Brexit that sends us off a cliff outside of the Single Market, our biggest trade partners  
Discussed Turkey-UK relations, regional issues and EU/Brexit with the visiting members of House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee.  
Clean Brexit is like Clean Eating: incoherent, self-indulgent and harmful nonsense driven by ideological obsession with imagined purity. 
I've changed my browser to replace the world Brexit with a random bit of filth and suddenly the news is worth reading again.  
So it's looking like Brexit means we pull out of the single market, no free movement, huge corporation tax cuts and ??? for expats. 
Theresa May's plan to yank Britain out of the Single Market is a reckless gamble.   #Brexit 
Brexit: a permanently divided, poorer, isolated country. Good call Mrs May @theresa_may. May your actions haunt you in your sleep, always. 
Repeat after me: it's not hysterical to protest the result of an advisory referendum, narrowly won on lies. It's not a mandate.  
Vote Leave promised #brexit would not make us worse off. PM's speech today must keep that promise & defend jobs #LeaveWatch 
Tories have gone full UKIP on Brexit. They are going to destroy our economy to appease the right wingers. They are no longer fit for purpose 
Exactly how? This government's Brexit policy is directly hurting HH living standards  
I always said there was only one Brexit - hard. Everything else was a delusion. And it will be painful. And we will suffer. 
We were told in the EU Referendum that leaving the EU means leaving the single market #CleanBrexit

Clean Brexit - like when you try & take a condom off in one go, but end up turning it inside out & spilling the contents all over your balls 
Even in light of the Brexit catastrophe, the British haven't lost their sense of humor. And ice cold irony.  
Theresa May wants to unite the whole UK in her vision of Brexit by telling Scotland to shut up. She can fuck right off with that. 
What? May going for Hard #Brexit to “make Britain stronger”? Stronger than what or who? Stronger without Scotland?

Problem with Brexit is that British people want to have cake (controls on migration) and eat it (not a penny poorer). 
So many Americans would rather see the US smashed than Trump succeed. So many Brits would rather see the UK collapse than Brexit work.

What does the rest of #Europe really think about #Brexit Britain?  
What happened here isn't isolated. It happened in England with Brexit. It's ongoing in France & Germany. It's weaponized media and ideology.  
Remain & Leave were VERY clear. Brexit meant leaving the EU Single Market. The PM has her mandate. Feeble Farron has NOTHING. Clear as day!  
Thanks Brexit.

I don't know anyone who has moved on. If anything their opposition to Brexit has hardened like mine. All my family voted Remain. 
Norway voted twice against joining EU but is in single market. Don't accept lie that Brexit vote was to leave single market. 
Post-Brexit there will be no "Auf Wiedersehen, Pet", no bolt hole, no EU social fund to hand out financial help. Just lots of burnt bridges.

In a crowded field, the "actually the majority of people DIDN'T vote for Brexit" take may genuinely be my least favourite Brexit take.

Three non-EU countries, including Norway, access the EU Single Market via EFTA/EEA. Scotland needs this not the threatened hard Tory Brexit!  
Brexit isn't liberation, it's:a humanitarian tragedyan acceptance of extremist viewsan implosion of valuesa symptom of discontent & fear  
Why Britain should play hardball and go for a hard Brexit 
So a cold, hard Brexit = the end of the European social model (a social safety net and universal healthcare).  Where was that on the ballot? 
This is just deflection from the obvious fact that £58bn Brexit borrowing, falling £ & anti-immigration rhetoric are adding to #NHScrisis. 
Theresa May is dreaming if she thinks she can stop what Brexit unleashed

Brexit killing off NHS (£58bn Brexit bill, chasing off foreign docs, US FTA --> NHS privatisation) Let's stop Brexit - save NHS instead. 
Like most young people, I voted against Brexit - and I know that Theresa May didn't betray me, my parents did  
A lot of v rich men have made money out of Brexit - shorting the £, using the weakness to buy assets here. It's a billionaires' revolution. 
Remain and Leave agreed during referendum that Brexit meant leaving the single market. Can change position but that's point of fact. 
While world worries about Trump/Russia links, it is worth reading this old story on Farage/Russia ties. #Brexit  
Absolutely reprehensible vision from the Chancellor - UK as a post-Brexit tax haven. Not what anyone voted for  
Well played @NandosUK #Ukip #Brexit  
So having held a referendum with no plan whatsoever, the Tories want to turn us into a giant tax haven. NO  
Downing Street says Brexit may cause the pound to undergo a "market correction".Much as the Titanic underwent a "buoyancy correction". 
This is a great time to observe politics. Trump will change the world. Brexit will change the UK. Social media will destroy the MSM. 
#bbcsp @afneil #brexitshamblesIn her speech on #brexit, #TheresaMay should spell out the costs of the options she chooses. #costofbrexit 
Audience member on BBCQT tells Tim Farron: 'We have to leave the single market to leave the European Union.' #RespectTheResult #Brexit  
Brexit plan is basically to make UK a sort of Ryanair nation; economically competitive but you have to pay for stuff once taken for granted. 
The UK SHOULD be a low tax nation. This should not be a THREAT but a promise. Cut all taxes at Brexit 
Why cut taxes after Brexit? To attract those want to make money without paying for public infrastructure. 
I am so fucking bored of British politics right now. The most uninspiring shit in my lifetime "global brexit" just empty words 
Why cut environmental protection after Brexit? To encourage activity that won't happen if we protect our environment. 
Why cut workplace protection after Brexit? To attract those who won't employ if workers are protected. 
When PM calls on Tuesday for national unity behind referendum result, recall that she has absolutely no mandate for this.  
Obama openly sought to influence our EU referendum, and the CIA tried to get us to join Common Market  #tweko 
March 2014 Farage told @FT dinner that Norway/Switzerland were models for Brexit Britain. It wasn't only time and he wasn't the only one.  
In contrast to the line-ups that can be expected on Brexit Time, or Question Time, as it was once known 
No but very much a net contributor. Like the vast majority of EU citizens living in the UK. 
Theresa May cannot deliver a #Brexit that works for the whole country because those of us who want to remain, don't want it at all. 
Jeremy Corbyn has reportedly said that a "hard Brexit" will mean a trade war with Europe. Perhaps his daftest statement yet. 
Travelling across Punjab with @maryashakil for the last 7 days. Rest assured this election will not be a referendum on #Demonitization.

"A hard Brexit was not on the ballot paper. Farage's vision of Europe was not voted for last June" @timfarron tells #bbcsp 
Farron is an irritant & irrelevance. I voted Brexit. He didn't. Yet he thinks he knows what I want. I can tell him he's wrong.  #bbcsp 
What you call "hard Brexit", Farron, is what BOTH Leave & Remain made CLEAR would happen if we left. The UK KNEW what it was voting for! 
Sign the petition, let's get to 50K. Don't cut a single workers' right when making new UK laws post #Brexit

Everytime you read about a "hard" #Brexit it means you get what you voted for - the leaving of the EU. Ignore media drivel 
Left claim there's an organised 'right-wing movement' that opposes them when it's simply decent people losing patience with them. #Brexit 
So who would've guessed it that Brexit was all about IMMIGRATION.....welcome to Little England #nothanks #indyref2 
Brexit = losing £500m EU funds a year & a hard border. Courtesy of the champagne sipping , wood chip burning , wink, wink say no more, DUP !

Why would any clear thinking person unite behind the divisive stupidity of Brexit? I will never unite behind losing EU rights. 
From media leaks it appears HMG has decided on hard Brexit strategy but fail to see how this will unify UK behind it & not damage economy. 
People who hate the #EU: Trump; Farage; Le Pen; Putin. (Insert any fascist) I dislike ad hominem arguments but there's a pattern #Brexit 
We are hurtling towards hard Brexit, virtually unopposed. Meanwhile, Corbyn is cracking jokes about free movement on #Marr. So depressing. 
Theresa May to announce clean Brexit - out of the single market and customs union - in Tuesday’s big speech  
In 2016, 68% of Wales's exports went to EU. Brexit is economic madness. UK tax haven = turbo Thatcherism. Minimal NHS.  
This gives an insight into what a Tory Brexit would truly look like – a tax haven off the coast of Europe.

One other thing people are going to have to get their head round. When Theresa May says "Brexit means Brexit", she's telling the truth. 
One of the pleasures of post-Brexit Britain is Theresa May announcing a "clean" Brexit every 6 weeks or so and everyone acting surprised.

There can be no way UK can be part of Single Market if May's two precise and three general Brexit demands are met.Therefore: Hard Brexit.

According to May, Brexit was "a quiet revolution". Only it was bloody noisy and more like a vote. Other than that, yeah, a quiet revolution. 
Yes, unless they oppose Brexit it will be the end of Labour in EnglandThey haven't learned the lesson of IndyRef1  
So, my conclusion: Any Brexit which takes the ECJ out of our judicial system will inevitably be a hard Brexit with huge non-tariff barriers.

A row of coal miners' houses with no windows, East Durham c.1937 by Bill Brandt. If #Brexit was a house it would look like this.  
Behind the platitudes, there a clearer direction on Brexit is emerging from the May government, and it’s twds hard end of #Brexit scale. 
Hard Brexit is a negative way of describing Real Brexit or Full Brexit

#Brexit, has been, for the most part, an exercise in petulantly blaming the EU for Britain's self-inflicted failings.#Remain #YesEU

The penny has finally dropped.  #Brexit #Ukip 
We have to continue to argue that #Brexit will damage Britain. Never argue we can make it work, as it will never be as good as remaining. 
The term hard or soft Brexit is a post referendum invention by the Remain camp seeking to change or water down the Leave decision.  
#Brexit is about securing the British way of life! It's not shameful to be British born of British values! We are defending our way of life 
PM's answers on #Ridge prog were vague, muddy and ultimately opaque. 'Move along nothing to see here' seems to be the PM's Brexit strategy 
Mayhem probably isn't smart enough to realize a hard Brexit or even the prospect will send the markets into a terrible tizzy preventing it 
UK is in "Zugzwang" -- obliged to make a move but all moves lose. Crap UK politicians got us here. Not immigrants. #EURef #Brexit

Never cease to be blown away by Nicola Sturgeon in interviews. Lucid, measured, informed, utterly convincing. Class act. #Marr #Brexit 
Far from avoiding hard Brexit, this will ensure it. Govt can alter FoM *without* discriminating. Else, single market out & econ disaster in  
UK Labour agonising on how hard it should be on immigration shows clearly the reality of the UKIPification of post referendum UK politics.

Remain media will report PM's interview as confirming what they regard as "hard Brexit". 
Watching May and Sturgeon interviews this morning it's increasingly difficult to see how they can reconcile their positions on Brexit. 
Is it just me or is May struggling in this @RidgeOnSunday interview: woolly on Brexit, poor on NHS. Reaction on a napkin please... #ridge 
The Brexit shambles really highlights how incredibly irresponsible David Cameron was to call that vote. No plans, no ideas in place. 
Good launch for @RidgeOnSunday but frankly, the PM is a disgrace on NHS, social issues and Brexit - a real Jim Callaghan in disguise.  
If you thought you were going to learn anything new about this clueless Tory Brexit from this interview you'll be disappointed. #ridge 
Soft Brexit supporters won't find much to like in Theresa May's #ridge interview. Sounds like we're on track for a pretty clean break 
Theresa May: EU referendum vote was a vote to bring EU immigration control back to the UK #Ridge

Theresa May keeps using phrase "good trade deal" rather than "single market". Hard Brexit's gonna fall. #Ridge

NS: I’m not going to sit back while Scotland is driven off a hard #Brexit cliff-edge. #marr 
Sturgeon: If there's no Brexit compromise, question for Scotland is "are we happy with that" 
/ And let's not forget that the threat of indyref2 could be a crucial factor in edging UK towards softest achievable Brexit. 
The only thing that separates meeting the concerns of Scotland in a post-Brexit UK from meeting those of Ireland is political will.

The press & media haven't grasped just how deeply traumatised the Foreign Office mandarins are by BREXIT.They bought into the EU dream.  
It's true. I confess that I do not consider a non-legally binding referendum to be legally-binding. String me up from a Union flagmast.  
I can't think of a group which is in more trouble post-Brexit than farmers. Their tariffs are v.high, subsidies are probably going to vanish 
Brexit negotiations are not in disarray because Sir Ivan Rogers resigned: he resigned because they are in disarray. Blame Theresa May 
Best Wishes to Sir Ivan Rogers, a much respected UK civil servant in Brussels - who knew what he was talking about.#Brexit

Former Downing St adviser Jonathan Powell is right: we need to know the #Brexit negotiations objectives before Article 50 is triggered

In essence Ivan Rogers is saying there's no government strategy on Brexit and nobody with the experience to negotiate on our behalf.  
When even their own not so secret press office (the BBC) are wondering if the Tories have a Brexit strategy you know May is struggling 
I doubt that a single civil servant working at Ukrep or the Foreign Office voted for Brexit.

Ivan Rogers' "gloomy pessimism" (D. Raab) meant one of few people in UK govt to think about pre-ref Brexit planning, transition periods, etc 
UK Govt loses its most experienced Brexit negotiator. More evidence that Govt is losing control rather than taking back control. 
Brexit: Plan A was to lose. Plan B is to watch it go down in flames and then blame the negotiators. Why would any sensible person stay on?

Theresa May already spouting out Tory/Brexit/Unionist crap. Time to crank up the #Remain/#indyref2 agenda by several notches? 
No amount of glitzy fireworks over the Thames in #London can mask the fact that the UK is heading into a backwater unless #Brexit is stopped 
Wishing everyone a magical 2017; filled with happiness, love, friendship & kindness. Let's make it our best year yet, & bring on the #brexit

After Brexit this whole display will be Paul Nuttall trying to light a Catherine Wheel with a cap gun. 
Wish the lovely London fireworks spelt out "HAHA WE WERE JUST JOKING ABOUT BREXIT. DON'T WORRY" 
May Trump and Brexit be forgot,And never brought to mind,May Irish Unity be in your thoughts,For the sake of Auld Lang Syne!

My open, joyful, optimistic and tolerant Britain. Quite a contrast with the mean spirited, distrustful and xenophobic #brexit Britain. 
My thoughts exactly: Shut up, May, and leave god out of politics and #BrexitBesides, Jesus wouldn't have voted for isolation & xenophobia. 
We are going to see a lot more polls like this as Brexit bites in 2017 and mood of the country changes. #Brexit pic.twitter.com/c9rp5vOU3N
Belief in #Brexit is akin to religion. You can’t make a reasoned case for it, so you have to just have faith it will all be fine.
Trump as 'man of the people' - the staggering disconnect between reality and assertion characterises both his election & the #Brexit lunacy. 
Its time to end the UN...their agenda is not about free people, rather the enslavement of humanity to globalist ideals. #tcot #maga #brexit

“May Christmas message urges unity after Brexit vote”And I urge May to shove #Brexit up her arse.
Part of a thread which reveals @AndrewMarr9 is pro #Brexit. Also his 'disdain' language mirrors those who want to close democratic debate. 
I think there's a real possibility that the May gov will collapse in 2017 when #Brexit negotiations fail. Progressives have to be ready.
"Unite" Mrs May? The only real evidence of what you're planning is your insane attack on student visas. Unite behind that? Feck off. #brexit

The UK Government should have a fair immigration system that we control #Brexit 
Europe sees #Brexit is a terrible idea, a lose-lose all round, but mostly as our problem  (& NewYork will benefit!)
This means #Brexit could need to be agreed on by 75 national & region parliaments before it can split from EU 
We need to make this point - #Brexit might actually push up the level of net migration!#Remain #YesEU
Will #Brexit cut net migration? More people with large families coming from the third world, fewer pensioners retiring to the Costas#Remain

Remainers whine about the danger of the EU imposing tariffs on us whilst ignoring the fact we would reciprocate!! All basic stuff #Brexit

Surprise surorise.  It turns out that #brexit won't save the UK fishing industry. That was just another lie. 
So much for demcracy: Swiss referendum to END mass migration from EU is ignored  #EU #Brexit

Wot? You mean leaving the EU and 'taking back control' doesn't actually result in having control Ouch! #brexit 
One of the most enduring, noxious, fact-resistant, tabloid fuelled #Brexit lies: that EU is entirely to blame for UK's fisheries problems. 
Read this and tell me they're not thinking of selling out fishermen as part of a wider #Brexit deal.
Off to @euromove National Council today, choosing new chair to lead fight against costly #brexit 
This week's #Brexit fact 
The UK Government should have a fair immigration system that we control #Brexit 
Remember when they said we had to vote #Brexit to get control of the fish?
#Brexit costs soar...City £38 billion,  #EU exit costs £100billion... AND we still have a stonking deficit.  Mad Mrs May remains determined!
German journalist Anna Lehmann travelling around #Brexit Britain. Lots of this sounds depressingly correct. 
Labour's endless fixation with itself & its abandonment of ordinary people are major drivers of this #Brexit mess we must now fix, and fast!
The #Remain argument against #Brexit is premised on the huge advantages of EU membership & the huge downside of forfeiting those advantages.

How about we #Remain and give #Brexit supporters who don't want free movement the opportunity to opt out of being European?
Dear #brexiters, if you are so sure #brexit will make Britain great again, why do you spend your time attacking those with another opinion?
Second poll in the space of about a fortnight with very similar results. Looks like for Sunderland, #Brexit meant £350m per week for the NHS 
Trade deficit increases; Banks go for French licenses; universities expect £350m loss. #Brexit shambles found here

So, are the few remaining #Brexit fanatics still going to insist we leave because less than a quarter of the country wants to do it?

SHOW this video to anyone in the remain campaign now arguing to stay in the single market #Brexit 
Great, but this won't appease me. So much more is at stake from #Brexit than just personal benefits of EU membership 
Prediction. Cowardly, two faced Leave #Brexit voters will nearly all choose to keep EU citizenship. 
Strategic madness. We are losing the friends we will need in the future. Our soft power base is being eroded because of #Brexit

Transcript from Thurs AM of Article 50 #Brexit case now online 
It's a catastrophe for Britain that #TheresaMay  spent more time approving Christmas card designs than making a workable #brexit plan. 
Looks like our banks are already lining up to desert the sinking ship #Brexit 
I had a few things to say to Ian Duncan Smith who wrote in the Daily Mail on the Art50 Supreme Court case. #Brexit 
“The old world is over,” says @paulmasonnews in his Q&A with @Ang_Bok  #postcapitalism #Brexit 
Yesterday Labour walked into a Tory trap & gave the Government a blank cheque for hard #Brexit. @CarolineLucas didn't - here's why.
We're now part of the #GreenerUK coalition  launched today to ensure the environment isn't forgotten after #Brexit 
Manjit Gill QC really bringing home in #UKSupremeCourt the human cost of uncertainty over who has the power to trigger #Article50 & #Brexit 
Against the backdrop of #Brexit, here’s what we’re doing to support businesses and grow our economy. #FMQs
The "will of the people" is a bogus democratic concept that serves those wishing to delegitimize and suppress dissent.#Remain #Brexit
After 3 days of incomprehensibility, I understand every word Helen Mountfield QC says about #brexit in the #supremecourt - Brilliant!
#BREXIT: We Won, you Lost, get over it! I SUFFERED THREE TERMS OF #TONYBLAIR AS #PM BASED ON A MAJORITY RESULT. NOW IT IS MY TURN! #BBC #UK
It's ludicrous for @RuthDavidsonMSP to suggest @theSNP is creating a 'constitutional crisis' after the Tory #Brexit. #FMQs
.@BorisJohnson: 'I would like to ask Keir Starmer why he is seeking to frustrate the will of the people?' #Brexit 
My advice to @theresa_may on getting best possible #Brexit deal: she needs to generate goodwill from 27.  @CER_London
Those women wanting to be barristers&disheartened by all-male #Brexit case: watch Helen Mountfield QC speaking now. Take heart&be inspired
Leave voter on #BBCQT: 'Throughout the whole referendum...we were told that leaving the EU means leaving the single market.' #Brexit 
My speech from yesterday's #Brexit debate explaining why I could not vote to invoke #Article50 by March deadline 
With hapless Labour facilitating #Brexit, the political home for serious Remainers has to be the #LibDems.
Glad to be part of #GreenerUK. Govt must protect & restore nature whatever #brexit looks like 
145 MPs signing #EnvironmentPledge highlights that #Brexit is a pivotal moment in achieving a thriving natural world. #GreenerUK
.@stroud_neil is right: the Govt should produce a White Paper outlining the core strategic objectives it's aiming for from #Brexit 
British manufacturing has slumped since #brexit. We need to stay in the Single Market to protect jobs  
Congrats to  #GreenerUK #EnvironmentPledge – "Our environment must not be harmed by #Brexit"Government must not dilute EU protections 
Our CEO @stephhilborne blogs about wildlife protection and recovery after #Brexit  #GreenerUK
Quick tip: maybe you should look at the wages, rather than restraining the rights of individual people to move. Just saying... #brexit 
145 MPs signing #EnvironmentPledge - #Brexit needs to work for the environment  #GreenerUK
Half the Liberal Democrat MPs missed the vote on Article 50 last night. So much for taking a stand against #Brexit 
We're part of the #GreenerUK coalition calling for environmental protection and enhancement after #Brexit 
Proud to support #EnvironmentPledge launched today by #GreenerUK - our environment must not be harmed by #brexit 
Thrilled to be part of #GreenerUK movement to make #Brexit work for our #environment. Has your MP signed the pledge? 
Disappointing to see Labour campaigning for #Brexit in #sleafordandnorthhykeham; last week in #RichmondPark they said they were against! #fb

Ian #Dunt: #Brexit is in effect 'making a new country'. Made by whom? - Fox, Bojo, Davis, May, the Daily Mail, Sunderland, Rupert Murdoch.
(3) - even though most MPs know #Brexit is badly wrong they have voted against their better judgment & - an unforgivable dereliction.
(1)The theft of the UK from its own people occurred not on 23 June 2016 but 7 December 2016 when MPs voted to trigger #Brexit in the spring.
We must say thank you to #GinaMiller for her courageous decision to challenge the UK Gov #Brexit #BrexitSupremeCourt
"Love Actually" is on. Foreigners are still people, no one's ever heard of #brexit and Alan Rickman's there, alive, as large as life.
I see that snivelling euroserf #KenClarke finishes his political career by being the ONLY Conservative MP to seek to block #Brexit
Irrespective of #brexit; be proud of a country that allows a govt to be taken to task- openly, adroitly, thoroughly, and value that.
With the advent of #brexit and the coming #DonaldTrump Presidency 2017 will be prove to be more of a rough ride than 2016.
Good to see at least one journalist calling @RuthDavidsonMSP out on her #Brexit defence of the indefensible 
I go to bed wondering if @UKLabour has a plan that I have not fathomed to save us from #Brexit insanity or has miscalculated again.

Almost in line with constituency numbers. Happy #Brexit  MPs back triggering Brexit by end of March

After 6hrs of debate in #Commons nothing certain emerges from UK Gov.  Only certainty is second Scottish independence referendum. #brexit
@SkipLicker If you're going to go all historical about #Brexit then this is genuinely why I voted Leave. Pitt the Younger #oldskool
The debate online seems to be dominated by leavers who are terrified #Brexit won't be racist enough. #brexitdebate
MPs from across the political spectrum are united and clear on this issue: the Govt must produce a plan for #Brexit before triggering A50. 
Ah. Just when you thought Labour was mustering up some proper #Brexit opposition, up steps Andy Burnham.

How's that "taking back control" going, Leave voters? #brexit 
Maybe for you but for most  the feeling isn't awesome but terror- like when you see your car is about to collide with a lorry. #brexit

#Brexit is a burning issue. But #UKpoverty is still the big one | @JuliaUnwin in the @guardian 
Leaked documents of the UK's #Brexit plan include a "prosperity zone" with #Canada #Australia & #NewZealand:
An interesting view from 74% remain voting Edinburgh on Ruth Davidson's embarrassing #Brexit u-turn 
WATCH: @MichaelGove blasts Remain MPs "looking back in anger and remorse" instead of looking forward with optimism. #Brexit 
One of these people has a #cunningplan  the other does not have a clue.#Brexit #Article50. God help us....
I disagree with Ed Miliband that we will leave the EU whatever happens. If the #Brexit deal is terrible we should stay.
Draft transcript from Weds AM - day three of Article 50 #Brexit appeal - now available 
Discussed #brexit with @MichelBarnier. First task is to find a common position among the #EU27. That's up to us, the Member States.
Labour's motion effectively backs Tories moves towards Hard #Brexit & the Tory amendment fails to recognise the rights of devolved govts 
'We were only joking' #Brexit 
So wrong it’s amusing. 64% of Labour voters backed Remain, and as Labour is backing the govt on Art 50 it offers *them* nothing. #Brexit 
.@patmcfaddenmp: does @DavidDavisMP agree with himself that #Brexit White paper is crucial? He argued for it in July 
Labour out to subvert #Brexit They are enemies of democracy  
At some point soon voters will run out of patience with MPs who procrastinate over #Brexit #premium
Did Tory chair of Foreign Affairs Select Committee @crispinbluntmp just describe our European friends as 'the enemy'? Jeez #brexit
Why Britain voted for #Brexit: a look back 200 years 
Emily Thornberry and David Lidington faced off over #Brexit negotiations as they stood in for their party leaders at #PMQs
UK: Groups that voted for (economically deprived, anti-immigration: 95%) or against (middle-class liberals: 92%) (NatCen poll). #Brexit 
David Davis argued in July that the Gov should publish a #brexit white paper pre-negotiations. He needs to keep his promise #LeaveWatch
Green MP @CarolineLucas says government amendment to Labour #Brexit motion makes it a "trap" 
.@CarolineLucas intervenes early in #Brexit debate to ask why Labour is willing to commit itself to Govt's Article 50 deadline #yplive
Will the red, white and blue of #Brexit keep tough targets to protect the environment & tackle #climatechange? My q at #PMQs today
"The more red, white and blue he makes it, the better for us on the unionist benches" @NigelDoddsDUP #Brexit #PMQs
Thank goodness @UKLabour are not in charge of the #Brexit negotiations! 
Labour's #Brexit rebels emerge: MPs reveal they will try to block Article 50. Keep up with our live updates#premium
Tory @DLidington: Anyone voting against parliament #Brexit motion later trying to 'thwart referendum outcome' #PMQs
Letter in today’s @PrivateEyeNews puts the @dailyexpressuk and @DailyMailUK right on a few #Brexit points.Thank you, Robin Wendt 
#Brexit loveliness: A leaver telling me about his legally binding oath to kill me (us). Cheery chaps, aren't they? 
Ex-remainers Tory @DLidington & Labour's @EmilyThornberry's #Brexit row in leaders' absence
#Brexit No amount of jingoism is going to replace the vacuum of May`s Brexit Policy 
. @EmilyThornberry doing a great job in holding the Tories to account on #Brexit at #PMQs
There is a recurring pattern of some Tory MPs & MSPs attempting to silence witnesses in committee who don't support their #Brexit delusions
Whenever I vote, I stop and think "What would Tony Blair do" ... and, you guessed it, I vote the other way.#Brexit #Article50 #LeaveEU
#Brexit in progress. 
I won't be falling into this Tory trap by voting for the Labour/Government motion on #brexit today. 
After #Brexit "we will slash #environment protection"... Tory MP. Sometimes a think people like to swim in filth.#pollution #GlobalWarming
#Brexit could see net migration from the EU fall by 150,000 a year and give pay boost to low-income workers.
Troll Level: LORD SUMPTION!! #TeamGB #SupremeCourt #Brexit #Article50

The problem with #Brexit is surely the v different motivations of #Leave voters: no #Brexit'll satisfy them all.
Theresa May calls bluff of Europhile MPs over Brexit with Commons vote today. #Brexit
Leading historian and backer of Remain campaign @nfergus now backs #Brexit and admits he made a mistake. Fair play Niall, takes courage  
Lord, the Mail's coverage of #brexit legal deliberations is vile,  even by their standards. #DontBuyTheMail #StopFundingHate
Basic requirements of #Brexit must be:-Control of own bordersAbility to make trade agreements with worldNo control by Euro Court Justice 
I remind those MPs who seek to frustrate the #EUReferendum result by forcing a soft #Brexit,421 out of 574 seats in Eng+Wales voted #Leave
Yes and after #Brexit more Britons will be living in poverty because the Tories will demolish the welfare state and privatise the NHS

How does the Article 50 process work? A @commonslibrary research briefing  #Brexit 
MPs set to vote for first time on government plans to trigger #Brexit by end of March next year
Let's get a new #irishwater conversation trending... #AtlanticFilm Thurs @rte 10.15pm  #brexit #supertrawlers #rtept
Good morning. Here are some of our top stories on a day when there's going to be a lot of #Brexit talk...
Doesn't seem to be significant enough for #Brexit obsessed BBC Radio 4 to add to their headlines this morning ?
"I'm a spineless, careerist sycophant who slavishly backs the party leader. My shift on #Brexit is therefore meaningless" #GrantShapps
Pro #Remain MPs should not get trapped by any vote today. Demand a substantive Bill with full details of the government #Brexit plan.
In what parallel universe is "taking back control" giving it to billionaires like Murdoch and the rest? #Brexit
If gives me no pleasure whatsoever to have predicted this  #Brexit 
New analysis report from @NatCen @kirbyswales on why people voted for #Brexit in the #euref. @UKandEU.
Jacob Rees Mogg suggests post-#Brexit slashing of environment & human health safety standards to levels in eg India. 
I will not vote today to invoke Article 50 by March when we  still have no idea what sort of #Brexit the Government will pursue.
We have been told that foreigners 'steal' the natives' jobs, so let us see now if any natives will wash cars or pick potatoes after #Brexit
It’s looking more likely everyone in the EU will get free wifi—except those in the UK, thanks to #Brexit. 
Repeat: #Brexit will happen. Court case not attempt to stop it, it's about making sure govt consult MPs on it. It's about legal protections 
How did Leave manage to get the buy-in of working-poor Brits, when #Brexit is actually about deregulation and tax cuts for the wealthy? 
The appalling mess of #Brexit can be stopped by #MPs if they put the country before themselves. Courage & principle: do MPs still have them?
No #Brexit deal will ever be as good as the #EU membership we have. Brexit is self-harm on a huge scale.
The huge dishonesty endlessly repeated is 'the #ref expressed the will of the UK' for #Brexit. No: 1/4 of the UK population is not 'the UK'.
#CCOT Churchill was a winner the #UK - the world - could sure use him today. .@realDonaldTrump #MAGA #UKIP #MEGA #Brexit 
Corbyn gets another Tory u-turn, his 24th, Tories accept Labour amendment to produce #brexit plan before #Article50 invoked.@EdDavie

#BREXIT BREAKING NEWS: MPs to vote on EU exit *TODAY* after May challenges them to respect the wishes of the People. 
Theresa will reveal #Brexit plan. Only if Labour agrees on it.(16:32)"Please sign the contract BEFORE YOU READ IT."
So, the #brexit we're after is a 'red, white and blue brexit'; if this doesn't shout out 'I have no idea what I'm doing' nothing will
Moggy-Rees #brexit vision: "UK can slash environmental and safety standards." Hello sweatshop Britain 
Overheard at gym. "I voted leave 'cos too many foreigners, expected it next day. Taking too long. Shouldn't have bothered." #Brexit #sad
"We want EU back" -  poll shows North East changed its mind on #brexit :
No! First Government needs to decide whether to act upon this advisory result. #remain needs to be an option!#Brexit#NoMandateMay
Today, ladies and gentlemen, was momentous for #Brexit.We moved from asking what Brexit means, to asking what a Brexit plan looks like.
May wants a red, white and blue #Brexit. My ambition is lower: a blue and white #Remain.
Theresa May said she wants a red, white and blue #brexit 
All these patriots who fell for the great #Brexit swindle due to jingoism and stories about reducing migration are in for a rude awakening.
#Brexit is UK's #Trump. Don't our MPs get that?
If the single market and its 'four freedoms' are indivisible, that's fine, Mr Barnier. No cherrypicking.Just Goodbye.#Brexit

Great stuff from @guardian's Steve Bell. #RedWhiteAndBlueBrexit #brexit 
My cartoon - where does Britain draw the line with Saudi Arabia & China?#Brexit
#Labour's supine attitude to #Brexit is a deeply dismaying feature of this whole ghastly situation. If it stood & fought, Brexit would stop.
UK has to reach #Brexit deal by October 2018, says EU's chief negotiator for Brexit 
Those #brexit colour options in full:1. Red, white & blue2. Red, gold & green3. Red, amber, green4. green eyes, blue eyes, grey eyes

Ministers 'have no right to trigger Article 50' says Lord Pannick in #Brexit #SupremeCourt case

The UK Government should have a fair immigration system that we control #Brexit 
20 (very scary) reasons #Brexit will be a nightmare, and significantly tougher than deluded #Brexiteers think:
So, #brexit doesn't just mean Brexit. It means a #RedWhiteAndBlueBrexit . It's all so much clearer now!
Scotland's going for a Tartan #brexit. Tartan in English means "We're staying in the EU no matter WTF happens".  #RedWhiteAndBlueBrexit
The tragedy of #Brexit for #Labour is they have lots of leaders who cd make hay with this and really hurt the Cons' polling.
SNP amendment to Labour's #Brexit motion tomorrow. Devolved Govt's must have say. SNP will continue to stand up for our place in Europe. 
Most politicians know #Brexit will be disastrous for UK and its people. Why don't they have the balls to do the right thing?
Can anyone tell me the difference between a Hard #Brexit and cutting your legs off and throwing yourself into shark tank? Not obvious to me.
What we had. What #TheresaMay thinks we'll get. What we'll end up with. #RedWhiteAndBlueBrexit #Brexit #BrexitMeansBrexit
Just hours after #Brexit result, I asked @AdamPosen about the vote's broad implications. What he said stuck with me. 
Tory MP & former UK Gov minister @Anna_Soubry saying that Scottish Parly is "entitled" to having a consent motion before #Brexit can happen 
Theresa May wants a red, white & blue #Brexit, just like the colours of this flagOh, wait.Wake up, #Wales
An excellent list of 10 reasons why the #EURef result does not provide a mandate for #Brexit#Reman #YesEU
#LordPannick went to work and everybody had to keep up.Galaxy-size legal brain. #Brexit will happen, but it's been beaten up#PannickAttack
The Government's bid to keep control of the #Brexit timetable has begun. Here's what happened on day one of the Brexit legal challenge. 
Its disgraceful how they mislead us RT Very quietly, Liam Fox admits the #Brexit lie 
British PM wants a red,white & blue #Brexit !!! Brexit strategy blowing in the wind!!
From having cake & eating it, to red, white & blue #Brexit - such vacuous nonsense from the Tories. #brexitshambles
"Richard Corbett MEP is absolutely right. There is no mandate for a #Brexit that pushes us over the…" — Mark Watts  
I also remember the 1930s which is what austerity and Brexit will usher back into Britain-equality will never come from #Brexit only poverty 
STPs are like #Brexit Gov hoping to plan in secret with minimal consultation to avoid proper scrutiny/accountability 
"The basic fact: healthy nature is vital for our health, wealth and security" @TonyJuniper on Nature and #Brexit 
Until people learn their economic woes aren't caused by those more vulnerable than them but the 1% the #brexit mentality will continue.
First @theresa_may talks about her faith & now she wants a #redwhiteandbluebrexit.How many more clues do you need!#brexit #brexitshambles
Simply put this is what #IndyRef2 is forANYTHING Else , including #Brexit just a distraction @TommySheppard
The #Brexit vote is just one of many political shocks that have occurred across Europe in recent months 
I'm guessing Theresa May hasn't actually read a single page of the Good Friday Agreement; no regard for Irish citizens caught in her #brexit 
The amendment is comprehensive and reassuring. Anyone who can't support can only be acting in a hindering, mischievous capacity #brexit 
Dear Lord Pannick I've been in an accident that wasn't my fault.  Are you available from Thursday? #SupremeCourt #brexit
Delighted that @AshfordCouncil are leading the way for #Brexit by taking down the #EU Flag from the main flagpole outside the civic centre.
Dramatic developments outside Ct as Govt now saying it will publish #Brexit plan, but trying to hang on to March 2017 #Art50 trigger date.
#Brexit has now been coloured in #RedWhiteAndBlueBrexit ! I want glitter on it to see if you can in fact polish a turd.
#DavidPannick provides a perfect demonstration of why the Leave campaign were so terrified of experts. #SupremeCourt #Brexit
"Next week's Govt. update. We want #Brexit to smell pine fresh and taste of Chicken." What a shameful mess. #RedWhiteAndBlueBrexit
Great plan Merkal! Let them flood Europe, then piss them off. Angela #Merkel calls for #burqaban in Germany. #Brexit 
BREAKING: Theresa May finally reveals her cards on #Brexit strategy#ToryBrexit #RedWhiteAndBlueBrexit
Evolution of a vacuous Tory soundbite:Jun: #Brexit means #Brexit.Nov: #Brexit means #Brexit.Dec: We need a red, white and blue #Brexit.
"It's about a red, white and blue #Brexit that is the right deal for Britain," Prime Minister @theresa_may has said
Tories: Let's have a more respectful #Brexit debateLess than 24 hours later...No.10: If you don't back UK Gov you're not backing UK team! 
Can the Scots have a blue and white #brexit ? Surely they’d be happy with that. 
What is taking place in the Supreme Court is a mockery of justice and a blatant attempt to bury #Brexit by abuse of legal procedure.
Red White & Blue #Brexit :Red = our future financesWhite = our future raceBlue = our future government
#TheresaMay's latest clarification on #brexit - it'll be 'red,white and blue' !So,I'm still asking #WhatsThePlan?
Theresa May is about 5 minutes from telling us all to drape ourselves in Union Jacks and start praying for #brexit. She's off her trolley.
Bernard Jenkin tells @BBCRadio4 re #Brexit that UK should look at how easy & quick independence was for the colonies #HistoryFail #India etc
Theresa May just said she wants a "Red, White & Blue Brexit" - ah... now it all becomes clear.#NorthKorea#Brexit#WhatsThePlan
Theresa May's adorning a union jack fig leaf doesn't cover up the sheer emptiness of her strategy on #Brexit #LetsRemain
Mark Carney spends his time bringing anti #brexit poverty doom and gloom wherever he goes! Why does #TheresaMay keep him in situ?
Those who lost the #Brexit referendum are engaged in a twofold strategy. 1. Delay and dilute it. 2. Do everything possible to wreck the deal
#MPs with #constituencies who voted leave should be not try to delay or frustrate #Brexit!  #BBC #SKY #ITV #EU #UK
#MPs who do not commit to voting for #Article50 unconditionally are guilty of delaying and frustrating #Brexit  #BBC
She gave us "Brexit means Brexit" and now @theresa_may has come up with "red, white and blue #Brexit" 
#Brexit recap: the government HAS A PLAN. Or maybe not. And they're not saying what it is. But if you don't support it, YOU ARE A TRAITOR.
Fun with Flags: Today, we will focus on red, white and blue #Brexit #redwhiteandbluebrexit
The 'will of the people' is a perfect democratic sounding device for authoritarians aiming to delegitimize political opposition.#Brexit

Frankly, we'd have been happy with October this year!So what are we waiting for? Let's get on with it! #Brexit 
Has anyone heard government say they are confident that #Brexit deal will be better than what we have now? Only the best deal they can get!

What are the 4 principles that will guide the negotiation with the UK  ?   @MichelBarnier, Chief negotiator #Brexit 
Any MPs who vote against the people or push for a 2nd referendum will have @ukip breathing down their neck. We will never give up on #Brexit 
"Time will be short. The period for actual negotiations will be shorter than 2 years." @MichelBarnier #Brexit 
UK will have to reach #Brexit deal with EU by October 2018 - EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier
The gerrymandering of the electoral franchise & the lack of a threshold wouldn't matter if #EURef were correctly treated as advisory#Brexit
No-one should be surprised that Barnier is talking tough - he's the EU's chief negotiatior and these are the opening salvos #brexit
#Merkel held a presser simultaneously with @MichelBarnier and used the same popular #EU phrase about #Brexit deal for UK: no cherry picking
There could be a 30% fall in trade volumes regardless of the number of free-trade deals it agreed with non-EU countries post #Brexit 
Matt nails it.     #brexit #christmas
"There will less than 18 months" to negotiate #Brexit with EU, says @MichelBarnier
A vote for #UKIP in #Sleaford is a vote for corruption and elitism, lying #VictoriaAyling can't be trusted! #Brexit 
Pretty solid statement by #EU's #Brexit negotiator Barnier. UK cannot move goal posts according to Brexiteers' fallacies.

Recipe for successful and rapid #Brexit. 1. Repeal fixed term Parliament act. 2. Hold General Election. 3. Destroy Labour. 4. Leave!
Britain was hardly a benevolent state before #brexit but after Brexit-it is going to be truly authoritarian.

As the Supreme Court hears the #Brexit case, why Britain needs a big, unsexy constitutional debate. From the archive 
New video on #Brexit coming soon.
If the government should lose this appeal then it should resign so we can elect MPs that will represent the people and not the EU #brexit

The simple fact is that #brexit won't curtail immigration only the rights of migrants in Britain b/c they will be treated like guest workers

#RichmondPark is a triumph for LibDems. But that doesn't mean they're up to the task of defeating #Brexit alone 
If #RichmondPark was really about #Brexit, the Leave vote went UP from 27.7% to 45.2%. Devastating for Remainers.

Seems very unfair given that it's #Conservatives that caused #Brexit, but I think #Labour the party most likely to be torn apart by it.

Nicola Sturgeon attacks "arrogant dismissals" of UK Govt of possible separate/differentiated #Brexit deal for Scotland. #EGP25
The priority is clear - moderate voters need to forget party divisions, unite & simply vote for the candidate who represents Remain. #brexit 
We will continue to work on a cross-party basis to fight a hard #Brexit - inc keeping Britain in the Single Market

#LibDems vow to fight against a "hard #Brexit" after their win in the #RichmondPark by-election
"Tories ready to betray 17.4m people who voted for #Brexit" says UKIP MEP Tim Aker on govt considering paying for single market access

"Don't ask me, I've no effing idea what's going on" #Brexit 
Can't say I blame them. I wouldn't want to have dinner with a xenophobic right wing human rights abuser who hates the EU. #Brexit 
If @LibDems thinks that the wealthy borough of Richmond speaks for the rest of the country they are seriously deluded & certifiable #Brexit
A clear, sensible & logical #Brexit strategy for Labour by @JolyonMaugham for the New Statesman - FAO @Keir_Starmer

The stunning @LibDems by-election victory in #RichmondPark underlines that there is no majority for a hard #Brexit 
Enjoyed speaking about complexities and pitfalls of #brexit process to Hull University today 
For remainers celebrating the #RichmondParkByelection. Now lets do the other 649 constituencies.. #Brexit  
To be clear if the 48% want to stop #brexit they are going to have to end austerity first b/c that is what is feeding it. #Richmond #labour

Remain voters feel "airbrushed out of the equation" after #Brexit vote, @nick_clegg says 
There's massive frustration amongst the millions who voted #Brexit because we have a dithering Govt that at heart does not want #Brexit
All part of the Remain strategy to stop #brexit. Tough. Richmond Park does not tell the UK what to do. Out is Out 
Sick of being told I'm undemocratic in fighting #Brexit.Fighting Brexit IS my democratic right and I'll exercise it thank you very much!!

Anti-#Brexit candidate wins in #RichmondPark/London. She will vote against Brexit if Parliament is consulted.
A HUGE defeat for Tories with tactical voting from cross Party anti- #Brexit voters.Difficult not to be pleased!
A #Brexit message to politicians from the 48% - "Ignore us at your peril": Lib Dems overturn 23,000 Tory majority! 
Aren't the #Brexit'ers angry litttle snowflakes this morning? Poor things. X#LibDems #RichmondPark #richmondparkbyelection
Louise Trethowen remembers the reaction of Prime Minister Theresa May when asked about #Brexit. Full story in today's issue 
#richmondparkbyelection is the first clear proof that #Brexit will drive away many Tory voters. Tory MPs take heed!#Remain #YesEU
By alienating most of the young, educated and professional the Tories are writing a medium term political suicide note.#Remain #Brexit
Britain could pay EU to retain Single Market access after #Brexit, reveals David Davis, the Brexit Secretary 
Voters in Richmond voted for their rich greedy self interest in having cheap immigrants for staying in EU, #Brexit would stop. #VictoriaLive
The EU's #Brexit negotiator now trolling the government. 
Interesting to review how much this was success of #progressivealliance politics vs anti-#brexit sentiment. Will @UKLabour now reconsider?
#Brexit must be stopped.#Brexit can be stopped.
If half a dozen pro-Remain Tories threaten to cross the floor, #Brexit is over. @LibDems must start courting them #BrexitMustBeStopped
If this isn't a message to Labour regarding the dangers of its #Brexit stance, I don't know what is. 
Dear Liberal Democrats. Zac Goldsmith stood as an independent (not a Tory) in #RichmondPark. NB: Remainers will vote against #Brexit MPs.
UK voted for hard #Brexit, and that's what people want. By-election shows LimpDems ignore democracy.
#RichmondPark by-election: Lib Dems' Sarah Olney defeats Zac Goldsmith in a #Brexit backlash 
Congrats LibDems for stunning win. Commiserations to our excellent @wolmarforlondon hit by huge anti hard #Brexit squeeze. #RichmondPark
Is the UK government still claiming it's listening to Scotland after 62% voted to remain in EU? #Brexit 
Thank you #RichmondPark - every day is a day closer to the defeat of #Brexit. You have said loud & clear - they shall not pass! 
Drip, drip, drip as 'Brexit means #Brexit' begins to dissolve: Richmond Park by-election is a Tory disaster 
#Brexit Fantastic rejection of Brexit at Richmond! We keep fighting! 
Labour could lose a hell of a lot of seats in London if it goes all out for 'hard' #Brexit.   #richmondparkbyelection
I'm quite happy to tot up this Leave /Remain thing on a constituency by constituency basis if that's what Remainers want. #Richmond #brexit 
The only choice is between No #Brexit and Hard Brexit. The facts are in: the latter is Wrecks It. Why is the farce is still running?
#MPs: could it be that #Remain is the majority sentiment in the country? Most of you are anti-#Brexit: here you have your true mandate.
The #Richmond election result is the best news in a dire year. It heartens & strengthens the #Remain anti-#Brexit cause. Fight on & harder.
#RichmondPark has shown us the way. Progressives working together and not fighting each other can defeat #Brexit #UKIP and the #Tories.
Well done #LibDems will done in #RichmondPark Your win is a victory for everyone fighting for sanity when it comes to #brexit.
An area that voted 70% Remain has elected a pro-Remain candidate. Hardly a political earthquake. #RichmondPark #Brexit #bbctw
#RichmondPark was in part a  #Brexit backlash. #Remain Tories- and even #Labour Remain - came together to say no. #Tory maj now down to 11.
.@LibDems win the #RichmondPark by-election, by 1,872 votes. #Brexit supporter Zac Goldsmith defeated. 
Theresa May honeymoon has ended in #RichmondPark. Tory #Brexit divisions are going to go crazy. Shame UK doesn't have a proper opposition.
Brexit: reality takes a seat - we will be paying to the EU, post-Brexit ...    #Brexit. 
Europeans have tried nationalism on numerous occasions, it has nearly always ended in wars & massive suffering. #Remain #Brexit
.@PennyRed - your questions to the racist teacher on #bbcqt were spot on, and you were brave to ask them. I despair of #Brexit Britain!
#Brexit.  It's like Shiny Dave shat on his own doorstep, stepped neatly over it and let everyone else tread it down the hall.
all across #Europe ordinary people are saying #LoveEuropeLeaveEU#EUcrisis #No2EU #Frexit #Italexit #Irexit #Dexit #Brexit #EUspring
IDS, another Brexiter terrified of a vote on a real #Brexit scheme instead of an empty slogan & a bunch of fantasies and lies#Remain #YesEU
A member of the #bbcqt audience rightly raises the Remain/George Osborne threat of a "punishment budget" - which was outrageous. #Brexit
Someone needs to tell Laurie Penny #bbcqt that controlling immigration is NOT inhumane #brexit
The new view that people are 'blocking' #brexit is bollocks. The reason nothing is moving forward is there are no plans. #bbcqt
Err Laurie Penny, #Brexit was only a huge shock to the out of touch!! #bbcqt
Yes Laurie Penny! #brexit was sold on a lie - inc phantom funding for #nhs and hysteria on immigration  #bbcqt
Nobody who voted for #Brexit had a united view of what Brexit really meant. It was a rag-tag bunch of racists and the pissed off. #BBCQT
Loving Richard Tice #bbcqt. Says there's a conspiracy among Metropolitan elite to stop #Brexit.Dead right!
#bbcqt I find #Brexit a complete distraction to the fact that most of the problems in UK are caused by Tory Gov't Policy,not the EU
.@RuthDavidsonMSP on #Brexit "A decision was taken as a country and I'm a democrat and I'll respect that." #bbcqt
Calls for a 2nd referendum on #Brexit a recount in the #USelection, if there was ever a year for bad losers, 2016 is the one

Six hours left to create a political earthquake in the #richmondparkbyelection. Vote @LibDems @sarahjolney1 and stop hard #Brexit!
Flip-flopping David Davis and Boris Johnson once again prove that the government, after almost six months, STILL has no plan for #Brexit
Or the reason #Brexit seems marooned and looking weaker by the day could be because it's a stupid, expensive and impractical idea. 
Government's #brexit position in shambles. Half wit David Davis now says UK might pay for single market. What next - pay for EU membership? 
#Brexit buffoon @BorisJohnson receives his punishment from PM May for mentioning his pro-freedom of movement opinion to EU ministers
Think how it would surge if they gave up on this #Brexit drivel.

By telling Scotland that there will be no 'separate #Brexit deal' Tories are giving up any pretence that this is an equal partnership.

Met with Farming Minister George Eustice MP - share common interest in sustaining free trade post #brexit 
The reason #Brexit seems marooned and looking weaker by the day is simple. Most elected politicians WANT us to Remain. We are in a battle ..

Boris Johnson wants free movement of people. David Davis wants to pay to stay in single market. Maybe just, I dunno… STAY IN THE EU? #Brexit

How the new Brexit minister wants to conduct #Brexit negotiations - in his own words, written 2 days ago: 
Like Pokémon Go but without the Pokemon and you just wander the streets sobbing at the state of our government #brexit #reshuffle

And there people were saying Theresa May didn't have a sense humor... #borisoftheundead #brexit #funtimes
#BorisJohnson on Africa "The problem is not that we were once in charge, but that we are not in charge anymore" #colonialism #racism #Brexit
Making David Davis Secretary of State for #Brexit sends all the right messages. For the first time in a week I begin to think it will happen
Boris new UK foreign minister. Almost like May is saying "you made this mess. Now deal with it!!"  #Brexit 
Also excellent @BorisJohnson as Foreign Sec as role will be responsible for oversight of key #Brexit negotiations.

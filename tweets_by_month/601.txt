Strong performance from Leave panel at ES EU debate.  @DanHannanMEP very credible & my undecided friend is now 100% voting leave. #brexit
Cameron's big flaw is that he's short-termist. The renegotiation was a short-term ploy. So was the promise of a referendum. Keeps happening,
Fundamental dynamic of the referendum here. Cameron much more confident on the economy than Farage.
.@Lord_Sugar knows business, and he knows that #Brexit is NOT a gamble worth taking. #ITVEURef
Tell you what, this #Brexit campaign also helps bring some right racist and xenophobic morons out of the woods ready for Mr Block.
Why risk a referendum if the effects of leaving are going to be so catastrophic? #ITVEURef

More MPs announce they're backing #VoteLeave. Welcome aboard @PaulMaynardMP, @JohnMannMP and Dennis Skinner #EUref #Brexit
Great piece on the EU! "The EU isn't the USA without the electric chair, it's the USSR without the Gulags" #Brexit
Still waiting for #bbc to report on #toryelectionfraud won't hold my breath like this one! #Brexit #greatbritain
We are not leaving the EU. We are re-joining the rest of the World.  OUT.  #brexit

Great debate on Brexit at The Angel Inn Grosmont tonight. Result: Narrow victory for Brexit.

#StrongerIn #LabourInLabour MP John Mann Comes Out For #Brexit#VoteLeave #EUref
.@labourleave great to see @JohnMannMP supporting #VoteLeave. Another @UKLabour MP true to his roots of supporting the working man #Brexit
Astonishing how people are quick to say £10 billion isn't much, then moan about austerity. #VoteLeave for #Brexit
#bbcqt  Never realised what a total plonker Eddie Izzard is! Totally wrecked the remain camp! #VoteLeave #Brexit
#EUref #bbcqt I would like to offer my sincere thanks to @eddieizzard for all his support to the #Brexit campaign
Fear, terror, and racism: the EU referendum is certainly charming to beholdNext up: Death on a White Horse, followed by Famine and Plague
After Brexit, Boris Johnson the PM would axe public services and ramp up taxes
#BREXIT  Europe is over! Never again on vacation over there @thetemplar5 @Nigel_Farage @BorisJohnson #VoteLEAVE
John Mann comes out for Brexit - via @craigawoodhouse:
Labour MP declares for Brexit and says many others are secretly in the closet.
I'm actually quite impressed with Eddie Izzard's ability to turn a left-wing audience against him.#Brexit #VoteLeave #EUref #bbcqt
Top British businessman stuns Cameron by telling staff there's NOTHING to fear from Brexit.@vote_leave
The real consensus is among people who love #democracy - and they overwhelmingly back #Brexit
My God, I had to put up with the 3 fishwives on #itvdebate for 2 hours and on #bbcqt for1 hour with Eddy. Headache so to bed I go #brexit
@andrealeadsom Leave team were fantastic tonight and really showed a togetherness in the hostile face of the remain team #Brexit
Given that Trump didn't even know what the nuclear triad or Brexit was, unlikely....but thanks for the comic relief
What a fantastic night for @vote_leave! Remain totally decimated on both #ITVEURef and #bbcqt. People are waking up. #VoteLeave #Brexit
I wasn't sure how to vote in the EU referendum but then Eddie Izzard said Nigel Farage was from an immigrant family. Swung it for me.
Twitter, if I've just been arguing with frothing crypto-racists and Brexit fanatics I don't need to be told I can now follow them.
People are going to be pretty upset when we Brexit and a new hospital isn't built every week, and there are still immigrants, and...
Izzard piling up votes for Brexit tonight. @bbcquestiontime
After an entire day of Brexit trolls. sturdyalex be like
This beret is absolutely the only reason I am now voting Brexit. I'm out.

Another thing, with Gisela Stuart performance and John Mann coming out for Brexit, this is the day that Labour Leave has really taken off.
This is what hedge fund billionaire George Soros thinks about Brexit:
Creaking public services, lack of housing, overworked teachers: the Brexit campaign blames Europe for the failure of Tory UK policy #bbcqt
Scottish departure post-Brexit is a non-starter. SNP pitch would be split from biggest trading partner to join the Euro. Not great offer.
Intend to wait till 30 secs before referendum registration finishes then walking into booth saying, "I think you'll find this is in order."
Eddie Izard #BBCQT thinks  the North of England will seek independence in the event of a Brexit #TotallyLostThePlot
It is not about little England, it's about making Britain global #Brexit #bbcqt
Nicola Sturgeon said that an EU exit could trigger demand for a Scottish referendum #bbcqt
All this Brexit talk has gotten too much for your dad. Please come and collect him.

Overwhelming support for #Brexit at tonight's EU debate in Shrewsbury -At least 80% present favouring #LeaveEU.
The Brexit campaign have paraded their lies on the side of buses every day during this campaign #bbcqt
Anyone who believes the tories would spend any post brexit savings on the NHS was born yesterday #bbcqt

Remember, fellow #Brexit folk, the deadline to register to vote is a week tomorrow. Do it first thing Monday. FIRST THING!  #ITVEURef
Huge boost for the #Remain camp as John Mann says he will vote #Brexit
Until now I've been sure Remain would win, c.55%-45%. Still 2 weeks to go but tonight's Remain-shambles makes me think Brexit qt possible.
Archbishop of York: 'My conscience tells me I must vote remain'  #EUref #referendum
The woman on #BBCQT saying that Brexit arguments sound like 1933 german rhetoric is so accurate it hurts. Fear does not lead to success.
The EU is yesterday's game, the UK's future is global #EUref #Brexit
Great to have .@JohnMannMP with us- now all those other Labour Brexit MPs should be brave and come out too!
During the EU referendum politicians have said things which we would despise if said by fascists #bbcqt
Worth keeping in mind for US election and - I dare say - EU referendum.
Lady in #bbcqt audience suggests that the Brexit argument is akin to the Nazis. Where DO the BBC find these people?
Please can there be a clear decisive accepted result in the EU referendum. Either way. Don't want to write about voting law again.
Labour MP @JohnMannMP is a great acquisition for #voteleave. Huge respect with the core Labour vote.#Brexit#bbcqt
Thank you God for @eddieizzard. His hysterical, hectoring performance on #bbcqt is best advert for #Brexit
Watch this hastily made European tourism video! #cdnpoli #refugeescrisis #europe #brexit #travel (satire)
.@IainDale Apparently many Labour MPs (especially ones with Northern constituencies) are just meeting support for Brexit on the doorstep.
Delighted that .@JohnMannMP is joining the #LabourLeave campaign- momentum is building and Labour voters will win this referendum for Leave!

I'm really interested how people will be voting in this referendum, so here's a quick poll

Eddie Izzard has lost every campaign & referendum he's been involved with. Please people of the UK, let's continue the trend! #bbcqt #Leave
Allison Pearson says Brexit is not about stopping foreigners entering the UK, but controlling levels  #bbcqt

Boris Johnson: eccentric? Probably. Puts foot in mouth? Sometimes. Passionate about Britain & making us great again? Absolutely. #Brexit
Referendum boils down to a political process. Democracy has  served us well. The EU council is unelected & makes policy behind closed doors.
Tony Blair lied about WMD's in Iraq now he says the Northern Ireland peace process is in danger in case of #Brexit. Come on who you kidding.
Why aren't we having a referendum on whether we want our NHS underfunded, dismantled and sold off, which nobody voted for?  #EUreferendum
#BREXIT Support for EU falls due to migrant crisis French hate it even more than UK #VoteLEAVE #Immigration #OUT

I'm glad to see that everyone's preferred EU referendum outcome definitely won the debate tonight.

Glad to be on the positive team in this referendum, not the fearful, divided and embittered one #ITVEURef #TakeControl
I didn't watch the EU referendum debate but I'm assuming Boris was like this. #ITVEURef

Boris, Gisela and Andrea are right: this referendum is our chance to #TakeControl of our borders, economy and democracy #ITVEURef

Thought @angelaeagle did @UKLabour proud tonight in #ITVEURef debate. This isn't a referendum on the Tories, it's about the UK's future.
.@angelaeagle "this is not a referendum on the government". She's clearer on this than @jeremycorbyn #ITVEURef
Amber Rudd: Boris "is the life and soul of the party, but not the man you want driving you home". A v personal attack, goes beyond Brexit.
Experts agree: Brexit will cost jobs and put workers' rights at risk. But it won't be Boris who suffers.

Oh. Another body which says Brexit will be a disaster for the UK. Our borrowing costs will rise.
Undecided in the referendum? Here are SIX reasons why we all have a brighter future by staying IN Europe.  #ITVEURef
My (objective) view is that the Brexit side are winning this hands down. Andrea Leadsom shining star. @LBC
Permit us to clear up any confusion about the EU referendum  #ITVEURef #Brexit #Strongerin
"We're not in the European Union". Patience, Angela. Patience. #ITVEURef #Brexit #UKIP
Well done @ITV. #referendum debate and thankfully not another manel! Five women and one man! @bespoke_comms
To be fair, Andrea Leadsome is having a blinding referendum as well.
I'm voting to beStronger, safer and better offYes I'm voting LEAVE Retweet if you're joining me#StrongerIn #brexit #itvdebate
A source close Labour leadership told me today that Corbyn could not back Brexit because MPs like Angela Eagle are "fanatical" about the EU
Simple question "Which one are you" ? #Brexit
.@Lord_Sugar knows business, and he knows that #Brexit is NOT a gamble worth taking. #ITVEURef
You pick year 9 girls up from McDonald's in your corsa stop telling us what to think about the eu referendum
The basic question has to be: will EU membership protect the poor and improve their prospects better than #Brexit?Yes. #ITVEURef
Nicola Sturgeon is mendacious to imply that after Brexit we won't be able to trade in the Single Market. Of course we will.
#ITVEURef The #Brexit #VoteLeave team with Boris are trouncing #NicolaSturgeon and her remain trio traitors.. This is great for vote leavers
Boris appears to have forgotten about referendum lock - any future transfers of sovereignty have to be approved by UK voters #ITVEURef
If we are leaders in the #EU why was Cameron so unable to negotiate reform to the EU or Britain's relationship with it?#ITVEURef#Brexit
My cartoon - the #Brexit Fairy Tale#ITVEURef
Andrea Leadsom on fire, speaking calmly, confidently and courteously. Excellent. #brexit
To be fair to Sturgeon...Post-Brexit there may be more chance of U.K. breaking up.Yet she's arguing for the EU.That says something
Good to finally see a Tory woman back on the big stage on merit not quotas@andrealeadsom has a huge future @Conservatives#ITVEURef#Brexit
ITV Debate: a future of having Boris as PM fills me with total horror! Do people really realize Towards what Brexit is taking us?
.@NicolaSturgeon If a country independently decides to be interdependent in a union in a referendum, is that reasonable? Asking for a friend
House of Commons Library research shows 60% of legislation comes from the EU #itveuref #brexit #voteleave #takecontrol
#itvEUref All the EU has done is shift it`s carbon footprint to China & India losing jobs while doing so. #Brexit
Britain's EU referendum is on June 23rd. Read our full Brexit coverage
Dear @AmberRudd_MP: you are overdoing the personal onslaughts on Boris. It's saying much more about you than him or whether to #Brexit
We are having a referendum - this demonstrates we are a sovereign country #StrongerIn #ITVEURef
Nicola spot on. The Brexit lot rant about unelected bureaucrats. But strangely silent on 900 unelected Lords who legislate here. #ITVEURef

Totally got my British flag ready to hang over the balcony for my post-Brexit Ibiza holiday
Scrolling through Twitter during this EU referendum debate is proof that people will hear only what they want to hear.
The big #Brexit debate? In one corner, Boris Johnson…in the other, Boris Johnson.  #ITVEURef
Boris: a man who wants to privatise NHS, lecturing you on how NHS will be better off Ironic#ITVEURef #Brexit
If I was on fence I wouldn't want to be lectured by Nicola Sturgeon. She wants to break up Britain so I don't care what she says abt Brexit
This EU referendum is much more important than who the next Conservative leader will be. #ITVEURef
I do believe @sarahwollaston has just challenged @BorisJohnson to a debate on #Brexit and the NHS:
Angela Lansbury . . Spells it out Clearly . .Uncontrolled migration IS overburdening OUR services #Brexit #itvdebate
I want this lady as PM @andrealeadsom#Brexit #ITVEURef #VoteLeave RT
More than happy to debate #brexit impact on NHS & research in conversation with @BorisJohnson as a calm discussion.
The antics of @AmberRudd_MP are a microcosm of the #remain campaign. Aggressive, negative and fear-mongering approach. #Brexit #ITVEURef
Course if the #brexit team support the rights we get from being part of EU, what's point in leaving? Can't have it both ways... #StrongerIN
My cartoon - #Brexit decision-making headgear #ITVEURef
The point isn't if the UK was first to introduce workers rights or the EU, it's whether a post-Brexit govt would take them  away #ITVEUref
You will have a clear choice Either you vote BRITANNIA or  for the EU
How much more positive the side that has optimism & confidence about our country is, much better than dour remainers #brexit #itveuref
People are already losing their jobs over Brexit
ITV Brexit debate: a feisty Amber Rudd eclipses Sturgeon, everyone picks on Boris. Coffee House live blog  #ITVEURef
The NHS budget comes from general income taxation. No credible economist suggests economy won't be hit by Brexit. Work. It out for yourself.
Lily Allen turns the Brexit TV debate into a glorious Snapchat party:

If only my twitter feed were voting in the EU referendum, I'd feel far less nervous.
What will it take to bring opposing leaders together to talk about Brexit? A look at our latest #ThePledge mashup
Registration to vote in the EU Referendum closes at midnight. It only takes 2.5 minutes.
Brexit means LESS money for public services, not more. Economic shock = lower tax receipts = less ££ for NHS. Simples.
Nicola Sturgeon chuckling at Andrea Leadsom's claims Brexit will deliver "an independence dividend". This referendum is blowing my mind.
These EU referendum debates are so confusing. Why can't we have REAL facts and statistics that are TRUE and not a mixture?
Does Nicola really think paid holiday would be abolished post brexit? When uk has more than eu mandates already. Bit silly really.
ITV Debate: The whole Remain case depends on the myth that Brexit will make us worse off. No.  It will promote prosperity.
No spin. What are the facts? My guide on how to vote in the EU referendum  #ITVEURef #EUref
Took a break from Brexit to meet this man. Neil Young. Canada's best export. Not sure this was what Boris meant.
Not sure why Gisela Stuart just said that Brexit would "take back control" of the majority of UK spending --- it is 1% of GDP versus 99% GDP
I have been watching the itv referendum debate & honestly Nicola sturgeon should shut her mouth Go back Scotland!
The referendum debate is going off on @ITV All im hearing is @BorisJohnson getting abused about putting something on the side of a bus
Boris Johnson slams Eurocrats and says Brexit could free up £350million a week for the NHS
I do not believe the UK wildlife and Environment is safe in the hands of Owen Patterson if #brexit just look at his record.
They're pathetic clutching at straws to try and deceive those who didn't know what life was like before EU #Brexit
Andrea Leadsom says she agrees with Simon Stevens, NHS Chief Exec - actually he says Brexit would be dangerous for NHS #StrongerIn
You’re completely wrong about Brexit and the NHS @BorisJohnson. Take it from the biggest health union in the country
Warning, warning #magicmoneytree being shaken - #brexit also said would spend money on VAT, farmers, NHS, tax cuts ... #StrongerIn
Watching this EU Referendum debate.....the leave option sounds far more appealing! #ITVEURef
#VoteLeave #Brexit.  Soros Bets Against Europe While Funding The Mass #Migration He Admits Will 'Collapse' The #EU
Superb speech @ClaudeMoraesMEP Referendum is battle of values, conducted on the Rights terms. Brexit promises of NHS spending totally bogus
Fact check: 'Brexit means no guarantee to access single market' #ITVEURef
Only 14.7% of economists oppose #Brexit -
Gosh, no advert breaks yet. They were right about how the referendum would be bad for businesses
Remain says jobs are at risk after Brexit.  I worry about the jobs we're losing today, because if EU rules.
Nicola Sturgeon is doing a great job for LEAVE #ITVEURef #itvdebate #itv #Brexit #VoteLeave #EUref #LeaveEU
We must hear more from @NicolaSturgeon and @AmberRudd_MP until the referendum! Clear but also very passionate case made for #remain.
Absurdly, Remainians think Mercedes, VW, Spanish hotel industry etc will allow the EU to build trade walls after #Brexit. Rubbish! #ITVEURef
Ha ha, Boris uses a @NicolaSturgeon quote against her. #ITVEURef #Brexit #EURef
Amber Rudd: "No manufacturers support Brexit". What about JCB, Amber?
2. Brexit Conference: "If referendum votes to leave EU Sinn Féin believes there should b a border poll."
seeing as there's another #ITVEURef, HERE'S ANOTHER #BREXIT STRAW POLL!
What Nicola Sturgeon is saying in this debate is going to be very difficult for her if there is a 2nd independence referendum
Any journalists getting confused by all the #Brexit numbers? Take our free online stats training:

3. Brexit conference:"if part of Ireland is outside the EU while the other stays in, will not benefit Irish People".

#ITVEURef #EUref Oh look,It's the ITV EU referendum debate!
Lies, lies, damn lies...There is no saving from Brexit. IFS say there is a £40bn cost of leaving the EU. There is no saving #ITVEURef
Glad that @NicolaSturgeon is making a progressive case against @BorisJohnson and his #Brexit lies #ITVEURef #itvdebate
Boris says a Brexit means wages going up. "That is a lie & you know it," is the response
1. Brexit conference: Carrickdale. "Sinn Féin is asking for a clear vote in Brexit referendum to stay in the EU."
Running a sweepstake on how many different things the #brexit campaign will claim they can fund by leaving EU... #magicmoneytree #StrongerIN
Brexit gives British papers a reason to indulge their nationalist, anti-Europe tendencies.
Wish I could vote in this referendum. Instead I'll sit here, drink tea and scowl at Boris #ITVEURef #proudimmigrant

The economic fall out from Brexit will necessitate tax rises, spending cuts or more borrowing. Tory Leavers should tell us which to expect.
As I predicted, they're already preparing to ignore the vote if Brits back #Brexit.

Post-Brexit, an "emergency Budget" to raise taxes & cut spending would be precisely wrong response. My thoughts:
Osborne should relax: if we #VoteLeave he'll be on the backbenches with a massively paid part-time job at his beloved Goldman Sachs. #Brexit

Ironically Leave resonates in UK regions that have most to lose from Brexit @CER_London #StrongerIn
What's becoming clear is that if we vote for Brexit the economic chaos will only be matched by the political chaos inside the Tory party.
As the Sun backs Brexit, remember Rupert Murdoch's terrifying quote about the EU
Extraordinary - leave & remain Cabinet ministers have alternative manifestos for post Brexit - how would they agree ?
Perhaps everyone who votes for Brexit could pay the extra tax. Just for a couple of years, while the economy gets back on its feet.

From the man who talked most economic sense during the Scottish referendum debate, more good sense on Brexit.
Brexit image of pure UK sovereignty&people power is fantasy. MPs make policy decisions that many ppl won't like. EU gives extra protection
57 Tory MPs have called Osborne's plan to raise taxes if Brexit "scary stories" and will bring a vote against him. A vote of no confidence
Last person Oz needs to lead if Brexit causes meltdown is Turnbull, deeply irresponsible in GFC. See the #GoodFight
Problem is that many #Brexit supporters confuse fiction with fact

57 Tory MPs say Osborne's position would be untenable if he forced post-Brexit cuts. Here's the lot of them:
Incredible. 57 Tory MPs openly vow to oppose Chancellor's emergency Brexit Budget. Surely even if Remain wins, George's bid for No10 is over
Osborne's threat to crash economy with cuts/tax rises if Brexit wins = just one more idiotic flounce from doomed Chancellor. (1/3) ...
Apparently if we vote Brexit George Osborne will have no option but to confiscate all our pocket money.

No "project reality" as #Brexit fears wipe 30 billion off markets in 10 hours - more than 3 times annual UK EU net contribution
'Brexit rocket boost to shares' says the Sun, on the day £30bn was wiped off them. Lying fucking scum.
it's all very well Jeremy Corbyn saying he doesn't want a Brexit but the millions of deserting Labour voters don't trust any of them anymore
Osborne says he couldn’t control a post-#Brexit economy?I wasn’t under the impression he’s controlled a pre-#Brexit one particularly well..
No surprise at #Brexit pullback. It's a repeat of the pattern ahead of the Scottish referendum-but more is at stake.
If Labour Remain supporters think they can win the referendum by saying anything - anything at all - on immigration, they're insane.
As well as all the good reasons to Leave the EU, this referendum is the one chance for voters to give Labour & Tory leaders a good kicking.

So Osborne and wait for it Darling are going to present a Brexit budget tomorrow !! Dear god hold on to your tin hats incoming Bullsh^t

Brexit will win and Labour is dying.
Honestly - just look at the people voting brexit. Boris, Nigel, Gove. Common sense says you have to vote the other way

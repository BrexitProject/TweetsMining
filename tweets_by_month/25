.@libdemlords Lord Burnett says there’s an unseemly haste by the #ToryBrexitgovt to execute #Brexit before the public know the details
If I were an ambitious young Tory MP in a relatively safe seat, looking at those #Brexit economic models, I might think that perhaps Corbyn taking the next shift at the helm is possibly not the worst thing ever.
The #government #coverup of the cost of #Brexit continues. Now we know that they HAVE actually done the studies they previously denied doing, they STILL won’t let us see them. They must be bad...
It's all unraveling for Ruth Davidson in this bumbling interview, which only helps to confirm that Tories have got nothing good to offer Scotland from #Brexit ... after their own leaked #Brexit analyses are very damning indeedTo be fair, Ruth never mentioned flags at all  
Ruth is merely trying to deflect attention from the Tory #BREXIT meltdown at Westminster .  That’s her role - to jump to with diversionary tactics when her bosses in London are in trouble. 
Science is the willingness to be proven wrong in the pursuit of truth, so here goes...Brexiters: Prove to me why I'm wrong. Why should I back #Brexit?No platitudes. I want evidence as to why Britain will be better off outside the EU. Please retweet. I want genuine replies.
The Tory party has no answers to address the country’s problems. It’s ideology of austerity and privatisation has failed and left millions to suffer the consequences. #Brexit has made things even worse. Incredible that they are still neck & neck with Labour
Things that #Newsnight thought were more newsworthy than leaked #Brexit impact report:Their own salaries A Saudi businessman An exhibition on shipsWood burning stoves 
Admirable honesty from a sitting Government Minister - an admission that ideology and dogma, not the national interest, have been driving government policy on #Brexit to date. An utter shambles underlining that a serious change in course is needed.

Watch my question to #Brexit Minister Steve Baker earlier in the Commons. The UK Government must publish and share this crucial evidence. 
The extreme anti-Brexit and anti-Trump bias that is overwhelmingly present in British mainstream media has rendered it unable to cover current events in an objective way. This is now only about attempts to damage #Brexit and #Trump at any cost. This is the end of the road.
With under 300 working days left until Britain leaves the European Union, this former #Brexit minister thinks "all we hear day after day, are conflicting, confusing voices" from the Government 
Wednesday's Express: "Secret plot to derail #Brexit" (via @hendopolis) #tomorrowspaperstoday
Despite what many people were led to believe, Parliament has never delegated the withdrawal decision to the people and has never made the withdrawal decision itself.Regardless of your view on #Brexit itself this current mess is unstable and illegitimate
Govt response is a smokescreen. #DavidDavis is now attacking civil servants because the leak reveals the existence of #Brexit impact studies, something he denied in parliament. Thus in a functioning democracy he would be held in contempt of parliament, one assumes
The #AngryWhiteMan..he's behind #Brexit; he's The #MAGA in the US, as well as the #MassShooter.. & the main victim of the  #OpiodCrisis , which is lowering US life expectancy.#AWM is all ages & all classes. But we don't talk about him.Why?pic-@damocrat

UK minister Steve Baker under fire over links to pro #Brexit think tank.  via @ferretscot
Trouble is, it's not self harm, is it,because many in this government stand to make money out of #Brexit. What it is is an act of betrayal and harm to the citizens of this country, who expect (OK, hope/dream) their politicians to act in their best interests.  It's a SCAM #FBPE
Another #Brexit unicorn just died... not to mention an apostrophe. 
Reading comments on #Brexit threads from #Leavers, they make little or no attempt to engage with the numbers, it's all "PROJECT FEAR" or "WE VOTED TO LEAVE GET ON WITH IT". But you can definitely hear them getting shriller and shriller. It almost sounds like...well, panic.

Guy Verhofstadt is looking after our interests more than our Government is.  I have never seen such deceit in UK politics in all my years.  Why does the “Brexit Paper” have to be leaked and not published?  Disgusting. #Brexit #FBPE

The dire news in these assessments should help the MPs of our two main parties to follow their consciences and vote for the good of Britain. Country before party! Integrity before ambition. #Brexit #FBPE
Scotland we cannot allow ourselves to be destroyed by this UK #Brexit shambles! 
Tory minister Philip Lee breaks ranks to say UK government should stop #Brexit if evidence shows it would be 'damaging'  A brave patriot. The Daily Mail will crucify him tomorrow.
Catherine West MP is hosting a public meeting to discuss #Brexit  @CatherineWest1
In a parliament where every vote counts, this reads like a Conservative MP who is considering coming out against Brexit. All the more important that the Labour leadership has the courage to change course. #Brexit can be stopped. 
The Guardian view on the secret Brexit assessment: government in denial - Editorial #Brexit 
#DailyMail gets hot under the collar abt #Brexit. Strangely to use its own logic it has been silent abt an unelected House of Lords for decades while it upheld privilege. All of a sudden it is an affront to the democratic process. 
#Brexit is an extreme right wing coup backed by the most illiberal people here and abroad. It can’t be converted into a ‘jobs first Brexit’, join us @OwenJones84 @Keir_Starmer @hilarybennmp we need your backing to stop this calamity.

Great event tonight @kpmguk talking all things #Brexit #KPMGBrexitDebate #FemaleLeaders
To cover-up real reason Tories want #Brexit (to avoid EU's new anti-#TaxAvoidance laws), Tories covered-up existance of their own damaging Brexit anaysis, but now we know their figures show how bad things'll be, they're covering it up by admitting their incompetence.#StopBrexit
If you and MP who thinks a dodgy report by dodgy 'experts' who got all off their #BrExit predictions wrong is more important than 17 million votes then please resign your seat and we'll see if you are right or wrong.
Let’s hope the #HouseofLords treats #Brexit with the gravity it deserves and abandons the “pointless and ridiculous mechanical voting” ridiculed by Benjamin Franklin. If they do, they will put the majority of the Commons to shame. #whistlinginthewind #newsnight
It’s estimated veterinary certifications for #trade could increase by as much as 325% post #Brexit the BVA President warns, calling for vets to be added to the shortage occupation list 
Watch the leader of the Opposition highlighting the damning DExEU estimates of the cost of #brexit.Oops! No. It was actually my tory MP. @jeremycorbyn is in hiding *again*, as it shows his #hardbrexit would cost us around 12 Leave buses a week in lost GDP.#stopbrext #fbpe
The Express goes after senior civil servants on its front page. The Mail targets the Lords as their favored “Enemies of the People” de jour. Britain’s Politics now in a very dangerous place. #Brexit 
Lord Winston tells House of Lords that some Jewish people in the UK with ancestral links to Germany are now, because of #Brexit, applying for German citizenship.
Lord Triesman, Labour, telling it as it is: economic disaster, racism, xenophobia, hate crime all sold to England by snake oil salesmen #Brexit

Phyrric victory.Two words.Learn what it means.If you voted leave, then this is for you.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
3) so the #Brexit economic argument swaps relative prosperity for short term economic pain & a long term that is somewhere between very good & very bad, we just don't know, and neither do Brexiters, according to their world view.Definite short term pain & 50-50 on long term pain
I hope MSPs will listen to the views of young people that myself, @AmyLeeMSYP and Madeline Brown MSYP brought to them tonight. Young people will be the ones who live with the consequences of #Brexit the longest, so they must be meaningfully involved in the process! 
#BusUnits!Leave said we'd save 350m - 'one bus' every week. But the gov's own figures say that over the next 15 years:• 'softest' #brexit will cost over 2 brexit buses each week.• 'hardest' brexit will cost almost 9 brexit buses each week.#stopbrexit #fbpe #finalsay
Finally a MP calling for the Government to make decisions on the basis of evidence and rational consideration. If that principle had been adopted from the start, we wouldn't be in this #brexit mess. #brexitreality #BrexitShambles
So let's get this straight: UK Gov is telling us to ignore their own #Brexitimpact assessments because assessments are always flawed - and they know that because they have done an assessment on it. This is getting Brexistential; I don't need an assessment to smell brex-shit.
It's like queing up impatiently in line at the supermarket, then moving to another queue to find the one you were in is moving quick & you would've been served if you weren't such a moany greedy stupid wanker.#BrexitShambles#Brexit

The leaked #Brexit impact papers make the case for a second referendum stronger than ever, writes @GreenKeithMEP. The British people are starting to see what Brexit really means.They need to have a #FinalSay on whether this is really what they want.

But it’s not evidence is it. It is just pure conjecture. Pure guess work, written by the very people who do not believe in #brexit. An evidential approach would thus be best to dismiss this as biased bunkum.
Bored with dreary forecasts about how much #Brexit might cost everyone. What price sovereignty eh? How much is it worth to avoid Merkels migrant quotas? Or chipping in the next time Greece goes tits up. Or tarmaccing Belarus? 
You must act in the interest of democracy not against it. No current prediction is as poor as the ones promoted by Treasury during the referendum. People voted for #Brexit fully aware of the Treasury's views. 
.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg is a breath of fresh air compared to @theresa_may's weak and dithering approach to #Brexit. 
I didn’t vote for #Brexit thinking I was going to be better off. I voted to control our laws and our borders. Nothings changed. Move along.
Absolutely agree with @thecarolemalone. #Whitehall’s remoaners, who love the #EU gravy train, are clearly leaking their own papers that @DExEUgov weren’t even aware of. And remoaner MPs are chomping at the bit to use them for political gain and to derail #Brexit. #SkyPapers
My favourite commentator Melanie Phillips gives her view on the current #Brexit drama featuring May/Brexiteers/transition periods/Hammond/Tory leadership/EU/negotiations and all the rest of it.The danger of Brexit just melting away

Pleased to see @keirstarmer is pressing for the immediate release of the #BrexitImpactStudies  Although almost all economic forecasts point to the economic damage of #brexit the political and public debate should benefit from the same evidence as @Number10gov @Labour4EU

We voted in the #Brexit referendum to become again a Sovereign Nation State with control over our borders, laws, money and trade. That was our campaign. At this rate we shall leave in name only, not in substance. 
MP Brexiteer today referred to Patrick Minden as an essential read. Found a critique & this clip is what always concerned me about #Brexit. I campaigned for #Remain. Still wanted reform. Only wealthy free marketeers voted for this. 14% wage falls for unskilled?

RT @Doozy_45: BREXIT: Tory minister announces every forecast his own government has ever done is wrong / #Brexit #Toxic 
The government is creating serious problems for itself by calling the transition an "implementation period" because they are going to need another implementation period shortly after the transition expires. #Brexit
Tories have NO intention of forcing a Leadership election, the #Brexit project is too fragile & fraught with divisionIt's a THREAT by hard core #Brexiteers to KEEP a weak PM in line -in some cases using *neglect* of domestic policy as a cover.#JustMyOpinion
And here is the very nub of it. Our MPs are still collecting salary and expenses, but refusing to do their job. They should have examined #Brexit, looked at the lies used to "win" the advisory referendum, and voted it down. 
Very important point.The conservatives, whatever their other beliefs, are supposed to respect & guard the institutions of the UK.Brexiters however have no respect for anything that does not bow to #brexit. They're cultural thugs, vandals looking to blame anyone but themselves 
So, between the #Brexit referendum and actually leaving at the end of 2020 about 3m voters will have died and the same number come onto the register. Can someone explain how it is democratic not to ask the voters whether the final deal is actually what they want?
It's not easy to picture Michael Gove's fabled "Green #Brexit" at the moment

The Gov't are refusing to answer my question on what WTO trade tariffs will mean for our economy. Government’s own analysis suggests that if we leave the EU on WTO rules the impact of non tariff barriers would have the effect of a 10% tariff slapped across the economy #brexit

Just to be absolutely clear.  I am NOT calling for a 2nd #Brexit referendum.  I agree with @lisanandy that we need to understand the reasons behind the first vote. My preferred approach is for parliament to vote down a Tory deal because it won't be in the interests of the people.

The government's own analysis shows that an extreme #Brexit will hit our economy & put our public services at further risk. How on earth can ministers justify their ideological obsession with a policy that will do so much damage to our country?
Why shouldn’t the #UK get a bespoke #Brexit deal?We are the No1 export market for German manufactured goods for French agriculture. They want free access.No comparison with Norway (4m population) or Canada (36m) - we are ~70m and large economy.
Iain Duncan Smith's position seems to be we must absolutely trust the UK govt to deliver #Brexit while simultaneously absolutely not trusting any models or conclusions the UK govt has modeled Brexit on. Madness. Complete bonkers madness.

#bbcr4today . Pattern of reporting briefly on #Brexit objective facts, then giving air time to subjective Brexiteers opinions. It is monotonous at best & actually a bit chilling.
Leaked #Brexitِ document?1) Timed as PM heads to China, so negates trip positives.2) Job loss fear mongering, yet jobs increasing every month.3) Loss of investment threatened, yet investment coming well at present.4) Who can take a leak seriously when they go to Buzzfeed?
“Nobody knows where this will end up” says IDS on #Brexit @BBCr4today #godhelpus
Now we know why the Govt have refused to release the impact assessments. The leak confirms any deal with the EU will leave us worse off than at present. #Brexit #FBPE
Tory MPs Tory Donors “Theresa May Must Go” “Dithering May Stuck on a Loop” ....  the language has changed... Tory Doners say she must go.... gone in 4 weeks, the worst PM this country has ever had good riddance #brexit 
#Italy remains the problem child in Eurozone. Contrary to the general trend, #Italexit rises to 5.2%. Italy remains the country which is the most likely candidate for exit from euro. These concerns to increase until the election, similar to what happened before the #Brexit vote. 
Britain will be left worse off under all #Brexit scenarios, with financial services, chemicals, clothing, manufacturing, food and drink, cars and retailing among the sectors worst hit, according to secret government analysis 
Conclusions in this broadly similar to @ScotGov view. #Brexit will hit jobs , incomes & investment hard.  Single...

1. The #Brexit question has always been one of what sort of relationship we want with the EU if not actual membership. Brexiters bleat "we just want trade" failing to note that regulatory harmonisation is central to free movement of goods.
Now we know why the @DExEUgov - run by Brexiters - didn’t want to acknowledge that this analysis even existed. Utterly damning and precisely why the British people are entitled to keep an open mind on what happens at the end of the #Brexit process 
Some polls show 85% of 16-17 year olds DON'T WANT #BREXIT.They didn't get a vote in the 2016 EU referendum.If #Brexit isn't going to happen until 2020 then they, and all those who will be of voting age, deserve a say in their future.#2ndReferendum#StopBrexit#FBPE
The vote to leave happened June 2016.#Brexit won't "happen" until December 2020.14, 15, 16 and 17-year-olds who didn't get a vote in the referendum deserve a say in their future! #2ndReferendumOur generation DOES NOT want this future being thrust upon us!#FBPE #StopBrexit
Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg on EU #Brexit terms:"We would take for the first time since 1066 laws imposed on us by a foreign power without having a say over it ourselves."Talking abt England; not a union with Scotland, Wales & N Ireland. Proof that Brexit is abt England. #Newsnight
You own #Brexit, George. Five years of pointless austerity at a point when you needed to invest. Destruction of public services. Tax cuts for the rich. That's where the vote came from.
#Brexit is a Trojan horse to smash the Devolution settlement   and reduce Holyrood to a rump #scotnight
#Brexit summed up in a meme 
NEWLY REVEALED: the #governments own (up to now, secret) #Brexit analysis says #Britain will be worse off in EVERY #BrexitReality scenario:
The Government's own Brexit impact assessments say the UK will be worse off under any #Brexit scenario. When asked why they won't release them, a @DExEUgov source said: "Because it's embarrassing"...
1. 'Asked why the prime minister was not making the analysis public, a DExEU source told BuzzFeed News: "Because it's embarrassing."'No...Damning when coupled with the attempt to force #Brexit thru on the basis of 37% voters & 26.5 of the Ppl voting for a Leave few understood. 
All of the U.K.'s #Brexit plans for leaving the European Union will hurt the country’s economy, according to a government report reviewed by BuzzFeed News 
.@Theresa_May will reject EU’s proposed deal on the #Brexit transition period and go into battle next week over freedom of movement and so-called “rule taking” | @Telegraph #ImWithMay
The government's own Brexit impact reports say there is no #Brexit scenario that doesn't make us poorer. Even leave voters said they didn't want to be a penny poorer because of Brexit.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
#bbcnews #newsnight Why are #Tories surprised that, if the UK asks for a post-#brexit transition period in which we stay in the #SingleMarket , other EU countries will expect us to play by the same rules as the rest of them?
Reminding everyone of the simple principle that May and her lot would not want you to know: a referendum has supremacy over parliament and a decision taken by a referendum is out of bounds for parliament. And if it doesn't like it, it is disbanded. #Brexit
#Brexit Getting pissed off everyday same Remoaners, Libtards, and Snowflakes trying to derail Brexit. Never stops FFS 17 million voted leave we’re leaving. Stop  it usual bloody bores. Tony Blair, Alastair Campbell, Chuka Umunna, Ken Clarke, Anna  Soubry and idiot Owen Jones 
This isn’t exactly a surprise but now it’s incumbent on UK ministers to publish their analysis before next round of talks. Scot Gov analysed same three options and you can read it at  #Brexit

I don't know why hard Brexiters are whining today. You said you didn't want to extend Article 50. You didn't want Efta, you rubbished every possible option - so a vassal state transition is the only option left. You won. Why are you complaining? Celebrate your victory. #Brexit
“All of this begs the question of why the government not only presented a Bill in this form, but then actively sought to scupper amendments designed to improve it.”Me on the parlous state of #EUWithdrawalBill & the need for extensive red pen in the Lords. #Brexit 
Ha!Lots of *knee jerks* & grumpy #Brexiters over EU Transition rules !WHY ?We KNEW these rules would apply !I think MANY of us on Twitter are MORE knowledgeable & informed than the incompetent #Brexit team led by Davis.
What a crazy idea that Britain can't negotiate trade deals with other nations while it's in the process of leaving the EU! Brussels makes up these rules as it goes along. Of course it should negotiate and sign them. That's the whole point of an orderly #Brexit
#EU27 ministers adopted negotiating directives for the #Brexit negotiations detailing the EU27 position on a transition period to last until 31 Dec. 2020For more details, see the meeting page: 
If Britain’s leaving the EU, we’ve surely GOT TO know what the replacement trade deal looks like - so we know where we’re heading? Trouble is, this Government’s ‘implementation’ phase is woeful. Putting a plank on the cliff edge doesn’t make the fall easier. #transition #Brexit
Dear @BBC please check your reporting on #brexit. There is no "supremacy" of EU law in the UK, and the EU doesn't "force the UK to obey" anything. Stop misleading the public.
"The EU position is very clear: the transition will last for 21 months until the 31st of December 2020. The whole EU acquis will continue to apply to the UK, as well as the jurisdiction of the EU Court of Justice". @MichelBarnier #Brexit 
Tomorrow the Lords debate the EU Withdrawal Bill. If they don't add a #PeoplesClause, we'll all lose fundamental rights after #Brexit. 
Mandate received to begin negotiations with the UK on transitional arrangements: No "cherry picking"Existing EU regulatory instruments to applyNo representation in EU institutions/bodiesTransition period to be clearly defined#Brexit → 
13/  has been manoeuvred into a position where it has to choose *very soon* on transition, all options are tricky, and forcing this sort of choice now, rather than in the autumn is a very good call by . #Brexit is about to get even more  /ends
1/ The more I think about it, the more the way  has manoeuvred  on #Brexit transition is masterful.
The lesson for @JuliaHB1, Farage, Stuart, Hoey, O'Neill et al is that if you refuse to engage in the details and deny the existence of complexity then circumstances will make your decisions for you and you won't like them. You were warned. #Brexit
Eurocrat #LordKerr says the UK will “come to heel” for the #EU! He is of course correct if @theresa_may is permitted to stay as #PM! #MayMustGo #FAKEBREXIT  #BBC #SKY #LBC @ConHome #UK @CCHQPress #Tory @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @Conservatives #Conservatives #BREXIT
Barnier: “Phase I has to be put into legally binding language”. Watch shit hit fan in Westminster when that happens. #brexit
For reasons that escape me, @JuliaHB1 has considerable influence in the #Brexit debate. She could have been instrumental in correcting myths about the Norway Option. Instead she chose populist bleating. Now she complains at being a vassal state. Ignorance has consequences.
Just pointed out in Commons that we can argue all we like about transition - but the Government still has NO CLUE about where we are going at the end of it. It’s just a plank off a cliff. Madness. @Open_Britain #Brexit
So the vassal state transition is everything I expected it to be. 2-5 years of the status quo with no voice. That's what hard Brexiters get for rubbishing the Norway option. Congrats. Here's what you've won... #Brexit
And I am not tolerating ANY whinge from any Brexiter about transition being harsh on the UK.UK triggered #Article50 too soon and without a plan. Now it’s hopelessly trying to buy time, and being a vassal state for 21 months is the price for that.#Brexit
1/Home Office shifting language on who they wish to deport post #Brexit: "EU citizens who are pursuing a course of conduct that most people consider to be socially harmful". This is very vague and open to abuse. 
Told #Brexit Minister there must be a free vote on #CustomsUnion or, failing that, they need to extend #Article50. #BrexitShambles
'UK will stay in single market during transition period' - Michel Barnier, European Chief Negotiator #brexit 
John Redwood: Simple negotiatingFirst secure WTO, then EU will be more willing to seek tariff free trade which we know #EU wants.We don't need to pay to trade, especially when we import more than export.We certainly don't need to pay for talks.#Brexit
I am glad that as I recover from pneumonia, I can still do my Tai Chi  warm up exercises while watching on TV that madness of a Tory #brexit. 
Those who claim the #Brexit transition period will be 'Brexit in name only' are unfortunately wrong. As the new EU negotiating guidelines make crystal clear, the UK will have to obey with no say - a huge step down from being a leading EU member 
"The bill is therefore fundamentally flawed from a constitutional perspective in multiple ways."#Brexit is fundamentally flawed too from its Advisory nature becoming an Irrefutable Mandate to 37% voters/26.5% of the Ppl becoming the Unchallengeable Will! 
A little flow chart to clarify key issues for the UK's transition efforts for the hundreds of international agreements that need to be "rolled over" post-#Brexit: 
"Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed" - @DavidDavisMP on EU backing #Brexit transition period to finish by end of 2020 
1. Brexiteers branded 'swivel-eyed' old men by sen. minister'"Whether U voted #Remain or Leave shouldn’t really matter now: there's now a unity of purpose in the (UK) 2 support the smooth & orderly #Brexit that our PM's working 2 deliver."Total utter BS 
Time for @theresa_may to remember that democracy isn't just about the people having a say ... it's about politicians acting on the people's voices.#Brexit #Brexiteers
Today I join my EU27 colleagues to agree negotiating directives which propose a status quo transitional arrangement after the UK leaves the EU. This will provide certainty & limit disruption for our citizens & businesses #Article50 #Brexit #Transition

This discussion is a microcosm of the #Brexit discussion.Brexiter makes it all sound easy. @anandMenon1 & @SNevin1 explain why it’s not, and their objections are just rejected.
When lacklustre Europhobe Peter Lilley boasts "Liam Fox has set up a committee of experts [on #Brexit], of which I am one", you know Brexit is in real trouble. [Lilley has a holiday home in France, so he's probably an expert on that kind of European thing.]
Chris Leslie - I've got a job of work to persuade labour's front bench that actually if we're going to avoid a decade of austerity... participating in the single market & customs union is absolutely cornerstone to that.#Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE @ChrisLeslieMP @adamboultonSKY
In today’s #brexit news: Chris Chandler the billionaire behind #Legatum Institute campaigning for hardest brexit possible has arranged Maltese citizenship for himself so as to retain EU citizenship he is depriving the rest of us. (Report in FT). Just think about that for a moment
UK citizens, as EU citizens too, can chose to study, work or settle anywhere in the entire EU as a right (providing they are not a burden on their host country). Anyone voting #Brexit chose to deny 65 million people that right. Why would you do that?

Surreal: One of the most vocal backers of hard #Brexit has suddenly become an EU citizen of #Malta...

More to the point: how can @UKLabour have a *policy* of being pro-#Brexit when an overwhelming majority of its members oppose Brexit? 
For the rest of the world #Brexit is an aberration and a distraction from other more pressing issues. The government may claim that it is building a new Global Britain, but that's just a slogan without any real policy content 
Can we please stop calling it a second referendum. This would be the first vote on the #Brexit deal. The British people had no idea what Brexit meant when they narrowly voted for it. The Tory government still can’t agree. Back a public vote.

What I would like is for someone passionate and clever to go through the finances of the top ten #Brexit Conservative Ministers, to see how badly the new EU off-shore tax regulations set to start in 2019 will affect them and their family trusts.
Corbyn's #Brexit deception is at odds with mass majority of Labour members. Some FACTS on Labour members:87% want UK to stay in single market;85% want UK to stay in the customs union;78% support a 2nd referendum.Why isnt Corbyn listening? instead he props up May on #Brexit.

People are waking up to the absolute betrayal of #Brexit being planned by Mrs May & cronies like #Hammond. Now @theresa_may is shelving a major speech so she can continue selling us down the river without having to face the public. Unbelievable cowardice!
Why are the media esp the @BBC peddling divisive opinions on #Brexit from “French Algerian broadcasters and Portuguese journalists” as if they were government policy. It’s just seditious muck raking. 
The electoral franchise (those who are allowed to vote) should also include the 3m EU citizens in the UK & ALL @BritishInEurope. #Brexit directly impacts our lives by reducing our #citizensrights. We are part of the social fabric of this beautiful country.And we have no say.
Completely agree with @NadineDorries here. Some #Remainers are such Europhiles that they'd prefer a Marxist Government to #Brexit.

By some distance most worrying aspect of Times #brexit investigation is Peter Lilley boasting of informal links w/Davis, Baker and Fox and could use his influence w/them. There is almost *zero* transparency in Brexit process

*Welcome to our nightmare. @theresa_may will go down in history as the worst prime minister this country has EVER had. This Parliament is weak and lacks vision and the necessary strength and leadership qualities needed to forge our own destiny. #Brexit 
.@guardian has declared President Miloš Zeman’s re-election as a “thin but decisive majority”. He won with 51.5%.Leave won with 51.9%, so that was a decisive victory too, right?!  #Brexit 
If only 45 out of over 600 MPs want #Brexit, then most of the rest are useless placeholders. Wake up, MPs, your job is to DECIDE what we will do. Wake up people, and tell your MP to do their job.

So pleased to see support growing - but it’s not a “second referendum” - it’s a vote on the final deal, & in the light of new information, it’s right that the public, not MPs, have the final say  #Brexit

Public opinion is not rallying behind #Brexit   On the contrary, it is swinging against it - and a majority now want a #Referendum on the withdrawal deal: 
UK GDP growth hits a 5 year low despite a Surge in world economy which has raised growth everywhere except UK or as @afneil puts it „solid not spectacular“. When did UK TV presenters stop being journalists & become crude propagandists? #brexit has a lot to with this I guess.

"As soon as Britain is ready, we are prepared to negotiate an attractive trade deal . [Britain] would go to the front of the line, and not at the back of the line,” - Steve Mnuchin, US Treasury Secretary, WEF, Davos. #Brexit #GlobalBritain #Davos2018
Please note Brexiters, we are exporting to the USA while we are still in the EU. There are no restrictions on selling our products anywhere in the world. In fact the EU backed Bombarier. #Brexit makes no sense. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg BLASTS Hammond's latest treacheryMr Rees-Mogg: “Well I think this is not a good position for the Chancellor to be in, to be undermining the Prime Minister.I think a little bit of freelancing in Davos is very unhelpful”#Brexit #EU
David Davis:“The options that are available to us will change over the course of the negotiations we see what our European interlocutors want."David, we already know what they want - our money!Get us out now...#Brexit #EU
Hey @guardian & @RobertsDan, any chance of including views from the region most affected by #Brexit? The one with an actual land border with the EU? And where people will also vote in any referendum?Britons favour 2nd referendum by 16-point margin – poll 
At a popular level #Brexit is nationalist & xenophobic. It's about frightened & insecure people doing a natural human thing - seeking security in a group (nation). When that's based on fear it means hostility to 'outsiders' & distrust of those who rock the boat.#FBPE #StopBrexit
BEYOND comedy !David Davis - guffawing & posing nonchalantly with a foot on the rail of a boat ! #BBCNewsTrying to appear UBER COOL - and failing dismally !This is the #Brexit head honcho !
'We're not morons': Brexit divisions harden across Britain I'm afraid most of the Leavers' remarks in this article display a woeful ignorance about the EU and #Brexit. Hardly a sound basis for a great national decision. #StopBrexit #FBPE

Jacob Rees-Mogg - "I think the Treasury humiliated itself in the #Brexit campaign by putting out forecasts that were so inaccurate. The Treasury, having bungled it at that period, is now continuing to do its best to obstruct Brexit." 
Lord Spicer - "Nowhere in the constitution of the EU is there a direct relationship between the electorate and the government. The EU therefore is not democratic. It shares this feature with China and Russia." #Brexit 
If you're confused about what @UKLabour is saying about #Brexit this is brilliant: 
Did you read the Directive @Peston before implying more bad #Brexit, did you question whether it’s terms had been put to the British public in a manifesto, its contents considered by the govt of the time or question whether the author/university had EU financial interest? NO/YES? 
'The increased backing has come from both sides of the debate, with one-quarter of leave voters in favour of having another referendum on the final deal.' #Brexit 
Once again the #Brexit naysayers have been made to look incredibly stupid, with economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 exceeding expectations...
As support for a #FinalSay on #Brexit grows, we renew our call for a ratification referendum on the final #BrexitDeal, with the option to stay in the EU. 
Please RT: “In marginal Labour seats, the remain lead has tripled from three percentage points to nine percentage points” - there’s far more for our party to gain from opposing #Brexit than there is from supporting it. 
Correction: the whole country (especially the least well off) will find it out. Most #Brexiteers in fact know the harm that #Brexit will cause but they don’t care because this is blind dogma, not policy. And many of them are mega-rich and will survive comfortably anyway. 
If we had a #Referendum on the final deal - how would you vote? #Brexit #FBPE #LeaveEU #RemainPlease RT Poll after you vote.
Meanwhile the leftists from the UK want to slow a #Brexit deal and ban Donald Trump smfh. What complete morons! #Trump #Liberals #USA #UK
WATCH: UK's economy grows despite #Brexit uncertainty  via @ReutersTV
The fact that 27 heterogenous #EU member states seem more capable of bridging their differences over #Brexit than one political party in the UK doesn’t cease to amaze, does it.
This is the meat and potatoes of #Brexit. It’s what ought to have been debated in detail before the referendum, but never was. At least we are there now: so give us the detail of how, in real and practical terms, you plan to change the country, now that you’re “free” to do so.
Since Brexiters are so incensed by the idea of the UK regulatory regime diverging modestly from the EU’s, perhaps - rather than just heckling from the sidelines - they could tell us in precisely which sectors they’d like the UK to diverge more drastically post-#Brexit and how.
#Tory MPs are critical of the Prime Minister’s #BREXIT strategy. I say she has no strategy. BREXIT must mean independence in all areas of government and administration, nothing less. @UKIP #UKIndependence

My family *does* need the NHS and members of  my family *will* die without it, which is why I have to oppose Corbyn's #brexit. Thousands upon thousands of families in the same boat.
Well, stop bloody supporting #Brexit then! It can be stopped, if enough MPs grow backbones. Why the Hell are you so keen on helping Empress May, anyway? 
The Tory party is completely split over #Brexit with no coherent strategy, despite May's pig headed insistence. The reason is simple, you can't deliver #Brexit without damaging the economy, jobs, services or people's lives. The only strategy that preserves them is to #StopBrexit
Priority in #Brexit negotiations must be to ensure "our businesses can continue to have access for our goods and services to the EU market" - UK Chancellor Philip Hammond tells @bbckamal 
#TheresaMay is a robotic PM. She was a robotic Home Secretary. She has left behind her a robotic Home Office which is inflexibly sticking to quotas to block much-needed foreign doctors from taking up GP appointments they have been offered. May's #Brexit Britain.
Very productive meeting with local businesses and Open Britain on the impact of #Brexit. Key issue for business is that they have no information about what is happening! 
Government's pursuit of #Brexit is causing significant harm to the UK economy now. This means:1) lower wage rises for employees at a time of rising living costs. 2) lower tax receipts for Govt, meaning less money for NHS & other serviceswe need to #ExitFromBrexit
As Labours now former Lords Chief Whip my advice to Steve Baker #BREXIT Minister is to back off & let us do our job. That means sending back to the Commons improvements to a deeply flawed bill on a series of red line issues for a majority of voters.
Jacob Rees-Mogg says he supports Theresa May and her "red lines" on #Brexit, but he's "slightly worried" that the chancellor doesn't 
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says #Brexit vote has cost UK 2% in lost growth. That's £40bn. Or £700m/wk. Or two Boris buses. 
At the heart of the European Union sit four key principles: the free movement of goods, services, capital and labour. #Brexit will not therefore enhance but restrict individual liberty. To do this on the basis of a simple majority is seriously problematic.
We have written to @eucopresident calling on the Council to continue #Brexit negotiations on #citizensrights into the 2nd phase. Certain #EUcitizens' rights are not covered by the withdrawal agreement  @SebDance @ColinYeo1 @FEANTSA @StevePeers @LeanneWood

Of course Rees-Mogg wants a tougher negotiating stance. He and his #ERG pals would love negotiations to crash followed by a no-deal #Brexit with its opportunities for disaster capitalism and Britain forced to slash taxes & regulations to survive economically.#StopBrexit #FBPE
2 points: (i) Carney's comments inappropriately political about UK-EU deal, (ii) Carney claims economy smaller than Bank predicted because of #Brexit. Given Bank's forecasting record, he really doesn't know. 
Rees-Mogg is not a harmless anachronism. He is a ruthless politician who will do everything to create a Britain in which taxes and regulations don't get between the rich and their money. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE #WATON

One mid-sized manufacturer in Wales: “Being part of a German company’s supply chain, operating on a ‘just in time’ basis, meant we had no option but to move operations from Wales to Germany in order to protect against risks of delays.” #Brexit dividend.

Brilliant analogy for farce of EU funding to UK"If I give you £10…”Dimbleby: “thank you!"“Now YOU give ME £20 !!”Dimbleby: “Certainly not!”“And by the way, I'm going to tell you HOW to spend that £10 - that is the deal we have with EU”#Brexit #EU
@mrjamesob Mark Carney is merely the messenger This is the Brexiters dilemma (With apologies to Macbeth):“I am in crap stepped in so far that should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o'er,” #Brexit

This is superb from @CER_Grant - the most ambitious and insightful survey yet of the conversation going on between the EU27 about #Brexit Phase 2
Never forget Whatever disasters #Brexit brings - and the signs are not good -, always remember how very rich people like Mr Rees-Mogg were fixated on “symbolism” like the colour of our passports 
UK is suffering a "#Brexit effect" in the short term, while global growth has accelerated, Mark Carney says

So, after 18 months of May's magnificent #Brexit team working as hard as they are able to, how are they doing? Frankly, they are a bunch of clowns.Here's the Fabulous Mr Fox... He hasn't even worked out what his department is supposed to do.#SendOutTheClowns

To disdain Europeanization is to forget what preceded it. #brexit
Meanwhile, Rt Hon @johnredwood MP stays true to #Brexit. His diary is usually a good read.  Here's today, on the alarming talk by ministers of transitioning the UK into... EU membership: 
If there had been no #Brexit referendum, Britain today would be a United Kingdom.Billions could have been sunk into the NHS, inflation would have remained low & public servants could have had decent pay rises.Farage wouldn't be on the BBC endlessly & people would be content.
So we're not actually leaving then @PhilipHammondUK are we? If you want the sack then carry on. The British public will not stand for your backsliding underhanded approach to a massive democratic victory, #Brexit Get on with it or get out of office!!
“The stakes have rarely been higher, yet Scotland’s man in the Cabinet is now relying on the unelected chamber to fix this mess." - @LesleyLaird questions David Mundell's political judgment on #Brexit Bill Clause 11 and #Carillion  via @TheCommonSpace

Leaving the biggest single market on the planet is a strange way of advocating free trade #Brexit #Davos2018 
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says the #Brexit vote is costing Britain’s economy around 10 billion pounds a year.The UK's economy grew at the slowest pace of all Group of Seven rich economies over the first three quarters of 2017.- Reuters
Philip Hammond reveals MPs won't see the full details of EU Deal before voting on it.Not sure if he's being mischievous, dim or arrogant, but how can we ask MPs to vote on something unless they know exactly what they're voting for? #Brexit 
Because Labour supports #Brexit it cannot launch an all-out attack on the right-wing press hate propaganda that won the vote for Leave and has emboldened racists and bigots. To attack the propaganda is to attack the legitimacy of #Brexit.#StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON
David Cameron is an ex PM responsible for the biggest cock up in our political history, he now says it's not going to be so bad- #Brexit'eers are so desperate to have their decision validated they're prepared to ignore the glaringly obvious! He. Is. To. Blame. 
"What an absolute messAs a staunch Tory all my life the sheer ineptitude of this Govs handling of #Brexit is hard to describeCan't ever see myself voting for @Conservatives unless dramatic changes happen. Democracy it appears isn't happening & many are waking up to this fact!"
UK will "continue to be global advocate for free trade" after #Brexit, Theresa May says #Davos2018
It’s half empty as Theresa May takes the stage in Davos - here’s the pic. #wef18 #wef2018 #UK #Brexit 
100% correct.And as the #Tories pour more time and money into propping up #Brexit..The #FabricOfSociety will more and more cease to exist.It's a tragedy.
How many times does this need to be said?! There is NO such thing as a '#brexit dividend'. Ministers and the media need to sit up and take note. 
Very positive engagement between @LibDems and FF parliamentarians on #Brexit today in Leinster House. 
We're escaping from the tyranny of "unqualified appointed bureaucrats who most of the UK didn't vote for" using an unqualified appointed bureaucrat who most of the UK didn't vote for.#Brexit 
Cameron caught on camera admitting #Brexit is not the disaster he said it would be 
1. In what universe is "it turned out less badly" classed as a success?       2. It looks to most people that Cameron is desperately trying to downplay the negative effects of #brexit to avoid even more damage to his personal reputation. @GuitarMoog @DanielJHannan
Personally I welcome David Cameron’s admission that #Brexit will be difficult, but not as bad as feared. The remain case is weakening, which will strengthen our hand in negotiations with the EU. It will be difficult and we need to pull together.
Why?1. We love languages.2. We love other people.3. We stand with migrants.4. We remember Britons abroad.5. We protest the growth of hate.6. We are for peace and integration.7. We will not be silenced.8. We reject #Brexit.9. We love Britain.10. We are EUROPEAN! 2/2
John Redwood: Transition to what?Neither Remain nor Leave will be happy if we replicate obligations & costs of #EU without voting rights.Leave means taking back control of our money, borders & lawsLeave means Leave on 29 March 2019 as agreed.#Brexit
Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom, dismisses Mark Carney's statement that UK economy is now £200 million a week smaller as a result of #Brexit uncertainty.If we do leave the EU, a smaller economy and less money available for public services will be the Brexiters' legacy. #FBPE

Ready-made Brexit metaphor found at Brighton Pier... lost more pennies than we won, never got the magical unicorn  @mrjamesob @ChukaUmunna @BorisJohnson @DavidDavisMP @Nigel_Farage @jeremycorbyn #brexit 
Unlike other states, UK has no established rules on referendums and each one is treated on an ad hoc basis. UK can therefore determine a different franchise for each popular vote: British citizens living in other EU Member States were barred from voting in the #brexit referendum.
Looks like Dave was telling some porkies back in the EU Referendum campaign! Thanks for the truth now though! #Brexit #Davos2018
.@David_Cameron caught on camera admitting #Brexit is not the disaster he said it would be 
One of the things I hate about #Brexit May is her nationalist arrogance. The EU is fine and good for other European nations but not for ‘exceptional’ Britain. Sorry May, we are European and I, for one, say that with pride.
Labour may enjoy a fertile few months as voters prioritise the #NHS over #Brexit, writes Ben Walker @britainelects 
Looks like #ProjectFear were wrong on the economy! Thanks for finally telling us the truth Dave! #Brexit #Davos2018
#brexit Bored  out of my head today’s politicians !!!!! Pathetic all of them. Theresa Maybe hopeless  Jeremy Corbyn useless, Sir Vince Cable retire FFS. Get on with Brexit 17 million voted leave. Couldn’t organise a piss up in a brewery these 3 Clowns.     
#Brexit costs UK £200 million a week because of poor growth according to Mark Carney.  A spectacular own goal for BoJo, Gove, Rees-Mogg and IDS. #FBPE
In short, anyone honest about the dangers of #Brexit to an international audience is "talking Britain down" and anyone spinning it positively is "busted". Appeasement of extremism never works. People like @Nigel_Farage just gobble up any concession and move further to the right.
Love the last 1 -Davis looked at the facts & changed his mind...the very thing this debased Govt denies the Ppl.I've looked at the Facts..they're much the same..#Brexit looked like a pile of ordure at the beginning & still doesPoorer, weaker + lost Rights#FinalSay #StopBrexit
Difference between Mishal Husain and John Humphreys on #r4today is remarkable. She’s really probing Uk minister Hancock on #brexit - and he’s totally floundering
Main #r4today headline Theresa May to give #Davos speech attacking social media- No balance, eg opposite views or any analysis of the claims she’ll make- No political analysis, eg she can’t talk about #Brexit because its a shambles and she’s too scared of her party

There's little love for #Davos and what it represents among #Brexit's backers in England, either.It's to extract ourselves from precisely the kind of anti-democratic, supranational, technocrat-run corporatism that it so exemplifies that we voted to leave the #EU.
#Leeds for Europe are excited to be supporting this training event 'How to Fight #Brexit'. Thanks @bestforbritain for putting this on in #Leeds and #Wakefield next week. We encourage our supporters to join in if you can make it.
David Davis confirms that everyone has the right to change their mind, based on new information. Okey dokey then, let's crack on and cancel #Brexit, after all, even May confirmed only the other day that she'd prefer to #Remain
If Mrs. May thinks she can get away with a diluted version of #brexit other than the full we leave, no more payments, no more governance from EU she is vastly mistakenThe leavers will rise
And the UK's biggest trading partner is ... the EU! ~45% of trade + ~15% with the rest of the world through EU FTAs.If it's not a good idea for #Scotland to leave UK, then it's an even stupider idea for the UK to #Brexit the EU.Tory #BrexitShambles - give us a #FinalSay
I agree this is deeply frustrating - @RCoANews has raised its concerns about the adverse impact of indiscriminate imposition of restrictive salary thresholds on the NHS and social care workforce in response to #Brexit consultations 
Great @StAlbans4Europe event with #LordKerr tonight. Key msgs: new facts show danger of #brexit; NHS will suffer enormously; #article50 can be REVERSED; #Article50 cud b extended to ask ppl to vote on the Brexit on offer

David Davis was out of his depth at the Brexit Committee. My blog gives a full report @Labour4EU @EuroLabour @labour4europe #brexit 
Seeing this more & more.Government is engaged in pushing through a #brexit process that will be deeply unpopular across the UK by the time it's finally implemented.  Feels like something is broken. 
Indeed. There is not #Brexit dividend. We are and will continue to be paying billions of pounds a year to leave the EU. 
On No Deal #Brexit EU nationals in the UK are back to where we were 19 months ago regarding #citizensrights. @DavidDavisMP committing to no more than non-deportation.
Fascinating Treasury Select Committee with HMT Perm Secretary. They have modelled a range of #Brexit scenarios for ministers, but don't seem to think the public or MPs should know results.But it will be MPs who have to vote on the deal. And the public who have to live with it.

David Davis said some very sensible things about advantages of staying in customs union a few years ago. He tells @CommonsEUexit that he has changed his mind. His new opinions fly in the face of the evidence from business including car industry #Brexit 
Farage shouldn’t be so confident of winning a Vote on the Deal.  People are now far more aware of the costs of #Brexit and the fabrications of the Leave Campaign. Instead of the promised £350m for the NHS, living standards are falling and the health service is in crisis. #FBPE
Folks here we have it: @DanielJHannan blames remain voters for generating climate that EU nationals are leaving UK. That's right it's not those that voted for #Brexit who are to blame but those who voted for EU. No doubt remain voters will be blamed for economic consequencess too

This is the real #Brexit 'dividend' not imaginary one Tory Ministers are pretending exists.They can talk about how to divide up the cake, but it'll be smaller than cake we already have. There would however be a clear boost to the economy from a decision to #ExitFromBrexit

How can there be an interview on @BBCr4today with Liam Fox about ‘how to spend *the* Brexit dividend’ without it being put to him that far from a dividend, #Brexit means lower growth & thus public spending?
We detest #Brexit & the prejudices behind it, however the sheer lack of any preparation for it by this inept, shambolic, clusterfuck of a government is just mind boggling. Customs & Medical supplies are the  two most critical issues facing us & they have done absolutely nothing.
According to the @guardian the UK is opposing strong new EU recycling targets despite the launch of its much publicised 25-year environment plan. The post #Brexit watering down of environmental standards has already begun.
So refreshing finally to have a political voice breaking through, one which's at last clearly calling out the #Brexit BS. I only hope it acts as an inspiration to others in Parl to stand up & be counted..the Ppl must be given a Binding #FinalSay to Confirm #Brexit or #StopBrexit
Many people know this.Just as #TrumpTaxScam gives the rich a cut forever while the poor have a sunset.#Brexit is a tax /financial scrutiny avoidance  ploy packaged   in #nativism and #xenophobia in order to sell it to the "masses".A huge  scam and The People are paying.Again.

Read my comments on the Scottish cross party litigation on #Article50 & the UK Govt’s refusal to admit their notice to leave the #EU could be unilaterally revoked. What else are they hiding? #Brexit #FBPE
"Bored of Brexit" isn't a valid reason to support something which will be hugely damaging to our country. If we don't #StopBrexit now the consequences will last for generations... If you are "Bored" by #Brexit the best thing to do is end the whole farce now and #Remain in the #EU
The financial sector should be pushing the Govt to share both sector impact reports & their post #Brexit plans; as well as the need for a common sense people’s vote on all options by Oct 2018. 
#BREXIT CRISIS SOLVED BY EU!  EU has found replacement for UK: Moldova.  390 more countries like Moldova and the EU will have replaced the UK's economic power.  See thread below. 
PSA of France is cutting jobs at its Vauxhall, Ellesmere Port, plant by a third, or 650 jobs. Now, it may go further because of #Brexit .It says a hard Brexit which results in tariffs on exports of UK-built vehicles would increase pressure to cut costs.

Seven Scottish politicians are trying to determine if #Brexit can be cancelled - and the UK government wants to stop them.
I've yet to hear a tangible and measurable benefit of #Brexit 18 months after the vote. Clearly the NHS isn't getting any more money, so what are the upsides the UK will enjoy after it leaves on the revised 2021 date.
Hi, I'm a LIBDEM supporter & I'm inviting you to use the #FBPE hashtag to attack Labour on #Brexit . Don't attack Tory Gov't, or UKIP or anyone else on Brexit, just try to blame Labour for everything, including the weather.#Remainers Don't fall for it.#JC4PM#TuesdayThoughts

As least bad forms of #Brexit, @CBItweets want to stay in customs union, while @The_TUC want to stay in single market.  Fine, but both imply net loss of #UK sovereignty - so what’s the point? Since “Canada” option is even worse,  coherent answer is don’t leave..
It’s difficult not to conclude that either May & many cabinet ministers do not believe #brexit is going to happen or they are mind-bogglingly incompetent.Either way let’s have referendum sooner rather than later so UK can #ExitFromBrexit
To be fair, everyone else in the #UK is deliberately being kept in the dark on the #Tory #Brexit suicide mission, so why should it be different for the City? #TheresaMay's ploy? Keep 'em stupid until it's too late.

May fudged phase one of the #Brexit negotiations. The reality is the UK never got past the first hurdle. If #Brexit is not reversed the UK will crash out of the EU without a deal and the economy will be screwed.
Noticed that #Leavers are getting angrier and angrier and more vitriolic in their defence of #Brexit, as it becomes clearer the majority of the country never wanted to leave the EU. 
I can’t believe how little attention is paid to the fact Theresa May got us involved in a French war in Mali last week. A NEW war! And for what? No special #Brexit deal, just a 900 year old bit of stitching, maybe. 
So @Conservatives. You will note that the IMF has significantly upgraded global growth for 2018/19, with one glaring exception. The UK.Good job. #Brexit

Although the left don’t like it, Nationalism & Democracy go very well together. It’s Globalism encompassing unfettered immigration that is the greatest threat to Western civilisation. So #Brexit & #Trump are fine for me.
This Tory government and other Brexiteers continually refer to the 'new opportunities' #Brexit will give us yet they never tell us what they are or go into detail for some reason What are these new opportunities that can replace a market of 500 million consumers?#SingleMarket
Only 18% of Brits are OK with Britain "following some EU rules and giving up some controls" to maintain "best possible trade links" - Survation poll.Sorry CBI/Remainers, there's no support for a customs union or other EU institutions that deny us #Brexit#LeaveCustomsUnion
I know it’s asking a lot of committed @UKLabour voters but if you support #Remain it’s vital you vote for an anti #Brexit party at the local elections. It’s the only way to show the leadership they cannot rely on your votes unless they oppose #Brexit.
Tory MPs clearly want a no-deal #Brexit which would would provide fantastic profiteering opportunities for disaster capitalists and force Britain to slash taxes on business & the rich, and regulations, rights & welfare in order to attract business.Tory heaven! #StopBrexit #FBPE
Pro-EU sentiment in Britain was highest in the 1990's. But even back then, only 17% of the British felt 'European'. Britain was never going to fit in the EU political project. The #Brexit vote only cemented the reality.

France would vote to LEAVE #EU"If France had same referendum, it might have had the same result?"Macron: "Yes, probably, probably. Yes"'Middle & working classes & oldest decided that EU adjustments in recent decades were not in their favour'#Brexit
#CBI claims we must stay in Customs Union after #Brexit. So no freedom to negotiate our own trade deals, or change our tariffs! Unbelievable. 
Consistency of our friends in EU27 in stating that post #Brexit we can’t have benefits of being in SM unless we accept Contributions, 4 Freedoms & ECJ, is overwhelming, yet there'll still be Brexiters like May & Corbyn pretending we can have our cake & eat it#ExitFromBrexit
"I do respect this vote, I do regret this vote, and I would love to welcome you again" - French President @EmmanuelMacron tells #Marr  #Brexit 
John McDonnell on #marr agreeing with Macron “too much liberalism” alienated the working classes on #brexit vote while missing out the bit that Labour totally abandoned those very same working class communities

Even IF @jeremycorbyn came out in support of a 2nd Referendum: it wouldn’t be enough to stop #Brexit & it would really damage Labour. Labour don’t have the numbers in Parl. & it would antagonise those who voted leave, who would then take their vote elsewhere.JC path right.

Hi @theresa_may, if you require a master negotiator for #Brexit, may i suggest Edward Gareth Woodward Esquire. Man’s a genius. 
You see what’s happening, don’t you, folks? Groundwork being laid for the blame to be put on @jeremycorbyn over #Brexit. Why didn’t he stop it, etc? Labour do not have the numbers and cannot stop Brexit. It’s the @Conservatives’ mess & blame is entirely with them.
Good to see Diane supporting Tony saying we shouldn’t rule out a Referendum on a #Brexit deal. 
Surely this should read @jeremycorbyn under pressure to form a position on #Brexit How can you shift position when you don't have one 
If "we must choose between Europe and the open sea, we shall always choose the open sea”The EU is a binary choice.But outside EU commercial policy and customs union, Britain can choose to trade and cooperate both with Europe and the wider world. #Brexit #LeaveCustomsUnion
Bath's former Conservative MP Ben Howlett has blamed #Brexit for losing his seat last year to Wera Hobhouse (Lib Dem). He said fighting as a representative of the party leading Brexit was too much in a city that voted 70% Remain in the Referendum.

Jacob Rees-Mogg urges Theresa May to install 200 pro-Brexit peers in the House of Lords to stop remainers from thwarting #Brexit. 
The tragedy is that Britain IS punching below its weight. Because for decades it chose to obsess about past glory instead of building a future: be heckler rather than partner. #Brexit is the tragic natural conclusion of that mistake. Isolation never makes nations more relevant.

#Brexit at least had an indirect role in the collapse of Carillion. Government is too distracted to carry out normal work. This was an example of what can go wrong.
So if UK Govt really want a Canada style deal a differential deal will be required for NI to preserve open border on island of Ireland, keeping them in Single Market & CU. Same deal could  apply to Scotland within UK #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #Brexit 2/2
On whether the UK has the option to change its mind about #brexit:
Billions squandered, families torn apart, jobs lost, lives destroyed, a country split in two; and for what, to keep the Tories in power for a little longer. #Leavers you need your heads examined for falling for the #Brexit con. 
Evidence to @CommonsEUexit quite clear that a Canada style deal is not compatible with the open border on island of Ireland to which UK have committed. Norway also problematic. It’s single market & CU for whole of UK or differential deal for NI #Brexit 1/2 
French vineyard owners are apparently furious that Macron is taking such a hard line against #Brexit, fearing that it may lead to UK supermarkets buying larger quantities of "New World" wines if the EU's stance is to try and punish Britain. Macron is already losing voter support

This has only just happened to me, so I am still a bit in shock! I've never even had a speeding fine before! (well except for that one in France last year!)I have zero legal experience, but am 100% committed to fighting #Brexit any way I can.Suggestions as to what I should do?
IF this happens, @jeremycorbyn will be PM and #Brexit will be stopped: .@theresa_may’s Government to collapse in 2018. A General Election will occur.

Wanting stronger ties with EU nations by supporting #Brexit which tears Britain away from the closest possible ties with our European neighbours. The strange logic of @jeremycorbyn

Jeremy Corbyn living in the past again. This was all agreed in #Brexit phase 1. He hasn't got a clue what is going on. 
#UKFRSummit Yes I know it grates paying 4 French security facing our ports. But it would be a thousand times worse if France just let anyone board ferries to England. We need a decent relationship with France post #Brexit & #Macron is no weakling like Merkel.

All #Brexit  lies are a disgrace @sarahwollaston , but thanks for your recent stand against one of the most cynical. This country needs a #FinalSay  on the deal, with the option to remain. #FBPE #StopBrexit @Devon4Europe
If the #Brexit Trade Bill passes as it is, we might as well get rid of Parliament. It lets ministers rewrite our laws to secure trade deals. So if a country wants us to water down rights protections, ministers can do it - totally cutting out Parliament 
How do you know the @CONservatives have lost it? One day they accuse @jeremycorbyn of wanting a hard #Brexit & being to blame for it. The next they accuse him of trying to stop #Brexit and ignore the will of the people.They chat any old shit & are nothing but CON merchants.
MEP @Steven_Woolfe wanted to make @MichelBarnier understand there is an "iron will to continue and make sure Brexit actually happens" #brexit Watch the full interview here: 
Residency for EU citizens was settled in June and then confirmed again in December... so why is he purposefully misleading public on #NHS and #Brexit? 
This isn't a game showYou don't answer a constitutional question with a "Yes" or "No."What's the offer?What does it look like?The contact for a coffee shop has more scrutiny than #Brexit did. 
EU states have underpaid into NATO £338 billion over the last 5 years.   Britain is one of the few nations paying in the treaty-mandated due of 2% of GDP.  We've spent more money than most for the defence of Europe. EU nations must remember this when they discuss #Brexit 
The "Will of the People" is a democratic sounding slogan of dictators and demagogues used to delegitimise the democratic right to oppose government policy. It has no place in democratic politics.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE #WATON

Rees Mogg now comparing to businesses worrying about #brexit to those who worried about Y2K. Eh, reason Y2K wasn’t a problem was because action was taken... #brexit
A reminder that #Brexit is a xenophobic UKIP project by tax avoiding elites to destroy workers & environmental protections to make them more money. And that there is no brexit scenario that doesn't make the country poorer.It's up to us to #StopBrexit as #WeAreTheOppositionNow

The Sun publishes its own #Brexit Bayeux tapestry. It involves a rejoicing Theresa May standing over the decapitated corpses of Europeans dressed in EU blue/gold. We're really not far off 1930s style media now are we? 
Supporting @steffanlewis' motion yesterday. People say we need to respect the result of the #Brexit referendum. Let's respect the result of every referendum. Twice Wales has voted for more powers. We've never voted to have powers taken away. #SaveOurSovereignty
If we include bailouts, we pay £660M a week says Bruges group.@borisjohnson totally vindicated.    #borisjohnson #Brexit

Bored by endless coalition talks in Berlin? Have a read what German government-building means for Europe and #Brexit, then decide. My thoughts: 
Hey, @JamesCleverly, how can you vote for a #Brexit "process" in good faith if you haven't even seen any impact assessments? How can you possibly say it's in the national interest? How would you know w/o the assessments?
Has anyone heard the Tories or Labour talking about MEDIOCRE UK productivity (due to poor infrastructure and gvt policies) and how to tackle it?#Brexit is pure blessing for them #FBPE
Real wages fell because 1.Low UK productivity partly due to mediocre infrastructure and poor industrial policies2. #Brexit, GBP depreciation and rising inflation made it worse!!! 
Justin Webb needs to do some research, he seems to be constantly suggesting that any post Brexit deal can ignore the rules of the single market. Quite bizarre that the BBC continue to push public expectations of an outcome that is impossible. #r4today #Brexit
Is you local MP one of the 243 who voted to disrupt the #Brexit process?If so, send a message to Jeremy Corbyn telling him to respect the result of the EU Referendum.
The young voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU. If we allow #Brexit to happen it will be a shameful betrayal of the young by the old. They are the future, they don’t dream of past glories, their minds aren’t clouded by outdated chauvinisms-Fight for them! 
Life long Labour voter? Voted Labour in 2017? Thought #JeremyCorbyn would deliver #Brexit?He just instructed his MPs to vote against the EU Withdrawal Bill.I thought you should know. So, is Labour conning you or is Labour conning the other lot?
Young voter? Voted Labour in 2017? Thought #JeremyCorbyn would stop #Brexit?He just instructed his MPs not to vote to stay in the Single Market or Customs Union.I thought you should know. So, is Labour conning you or is Labour conning the other lot?
#Brexit is collective madness. It’s frightening.

Absurd paranoia from some Corbyn supporters. It seems they are in the iron grip of a bizarrely Corbyncentric view of the political universe, in which everything has to be motivated by support or antipathy towards JC. #StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON #Brexit 
Why is @labour voting against #Brexit and not respecting the #referendum result?
Annoyed with @UKLabour posturing on Brexit?Annoyed with the 243 #Labour MPs that voted against the #Brexit Bill today and tried to halt progress?Then please sign this and RT and show #Corbyn you have had enough.
I hope he'll do some research into how lies and deceit from #Tory MPs and the right wing press have fuelled the rise in Euroscepticism amongst the working classes and uneducated fools who voted for #Brexit. 
Theresa May attacks SNP record as Scottish economy grows at half UK rate. - Galling that the SNP have the nerve to blame #Brexit for their own incompetence.
So the EU withdrawal bill gets through the HoC despite the fudge on the #Brexit impact assessments. If #Brexit were a second hand car, it would have just passed it's MoT without even being looked at by a mechanic.
Neither main party in the Commons now cares about or takes responsibility for the consequences of their actions. They're playing a political game and don't care what happens to ordinary people. #Brexit
 243 @UKLabour MP's just tried to block the #Brexit bill going through.It now proceeds to the Lords.  What will the #Labour lords do?Why are Labour constantly trying to delay Brexit?#LabourFail 
If you live in the Labour heartlands and you thought you could trust them with #Brexit you're wrong. They are working to frustrate it. 
Like #Brexit before it #CalExit and #NewCalifornia are Russian active measures intended to divide. Questions ANY secession movements (like prior ones run by GOP allies in the south). It's a Russian OP look who's pushes. CalExit founder lives in Russia now.
Someone buy these Labour MPs a drink at the bar for voting to support our democracy!! @KateHoeyMP @frankfieldteam @JohnMannMP & Graham StringerThank you!! #WithdrawalBill #Brexit 
Nigel Farage - "You don’t want Britain to leave because you know if they do that others will leave too. I fear that you are all working together with Tony Blair and Nick Clegg to make sure we get the worst possible deal." #Brexit 
Nigel Farage to Irish PM - "You’re prepared to put your devotion to the European project above the interest of Irish farmers and other companies." #Brexit 
The EU Withdrawal Bill is being rushed through the House with amendmants impacting Scotland and the other devolved nations being left to the Lords. These decisions should be made by the peoples elected representatives not the Lords #BrexitShambles #Brexit #PowerGrab
MPs approve #EUWithdrawalBill that will sever ties with the EU, after a vote - by 324 to 295 - in the Commons  #Brexit
This BEGGARS belief !There appears to be a campaign promoting the BIZARRE NOTION that if you vote anything except Labour in the LOCAL ELECTIONS it will STOP #Brexit !They just don't GET it !
Just seen the Labour party political broadcast about NHS funding. Laudable sentiments; and if Labour were to come out and fight #Brexit to get it stopped, the UK could save billions, so the NHS could be properly funded. You can't do both.
On this vote the magic 13 Scottish Tories could have ensured UK workers, including their own constituents, would have their EU  derived rights continue post Brexit #epicfail #EUwithdrawalbill #brexit 
Another @JolyonMaugham case. I think he’s entirely right in using the beautiful breadth of the EU legal system to test the legal framework of #Brexit. A valuable contribution. “Britons tell Dutch court their EU rights cannot be removed“ 
Juncker on #Brexit: -"We are not throwing out the British, we want them to stay. And if they want to, they should be able to.-"Be it as it may, once the British have left under Article 50 there is still Article 49 which allows a return to membership and I would like that." 
" #DavidDavis is unhappy that #Brexit means #Brexit "  
Rather disgracefully @UKLabour are officially abstaining on this @theSNP amendment on UK membership of single market and customs union. Plenty Labour rebels though! #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit 
Closest vote so far on a Lib Dem #Brexit amendment. Just 19 votes behind the Govt. Great to have Labour support on a New Clause which would require Govt to extend or cancel Article 50 if Parliament rejects either the Govt agreement with the EU or No Deal.
Just spoke in the Commons in support of my cross-party amendment to #EUWithdrawalBill to hold ministers' feet to the fire on establishing a new, environmental regulator, so as to avoid a governance gap opening from Exit Day #Brexit 
We're about to wrap up our #Brexit survey but there's time to have YOUR voice heard. It only takes five minutes and the more responses we have, the more we can lobby in government on your behalf

There’s a dark irony in that much of the rhetoric around #Brexit referred to increasing the power of the UK parliament, yet the #EUWithdrawalBill strips parliamentary debate out of the process. That puts our hard-won rights at risk.
2/ #Brexit has created a passionate, committed & determined British proEU grassroots of ordinary people, form all parts of the U.K., all backgrounds & all political backgrounds. One that is angry & determined to keep UK in the EU #StopBrexit #SecondReferendum #FBPE #WATON #Remain

Back in 1973 & 1975 British Citizens were told they would be £5 per week(each) better off as a member of the EEC (EU). Our trade deficit with the EU has risen year upon year. Strange how Germany benefit the greatest & UK the least. #brexit #LeaveEU

Ken Clarke makes the #stopbrexit movement proud every time. His refusal to bend to the whims of the #brexit elite, and put the safety of the citizens of this great country first, should be emulated by all MPs. #EUWithdrawalBill #finalsay

If you read only one thing about #Brexit this week, read this.Moaning won't get us anywhere. We need a serious plan.@CarolineLucas has one, and it makes a lot of sense.
Just spoke in Commons about one reason why we should fear scrapping of EU Charter of Rights that protect us in so many ways - the real agenda of the new #Brexit Minister @Open_Britain
Again we are being told we must choose between Corbyn & May.We are told we must choose between a Labour Brexit & a Tory Brexit. We are being told that it’s our only choice. It isn’t. We can reject #Brexit
Donald Tusk: “The door is still open for the UK to stay in the EU if British voters decided to change their mind"about #Brexit. Voters *have* changed their minds.Our politicians - Tory & Labour - need to recognise this.We need a 2nd referendum.

IF #Brexit is the will of the people, WHY do May and Corbyn have to whip their MPs  ?
#Germany never forgave Britain for the defeat in WW2 so it weakened it through  the EU that it controls. It is WW3, people, and Germany is winning  without a shot fired. That is why #Brexit is opposed by enemies of Britain.

John Redwood: Pound climbs against dollar to level before referendum!This week the pound reached $1.38 a level it was at in Feb 2016 before vote on leaving #EUFor some reason, its steady climb has received less attention than its previous fall#Brexit
Very important intervention by the President of the @EUCouncil - if Britain wants to change its mind at the end of the #Brexit talks it can revoke Article 50.He even quotes David Davis saying "as David Davis said:if a democracy can not change its mind it ceases to be a democracy" 
The British government has been complaining a lot recently. It seems to realise only now that #Brexit will actually have an impact. My message to London is: please don’t complain any more, just deliver. #EPlenary #EUCO
Here's something we should accept: Jeremy Corbyn is not going to change his mind about #Brexit .We can't waste any more time waiting for him.The only chance now lies with Tory and Labour rebel MPs working together in the Commons. Country before party. The time is now.
The majority of people in the #UK don't want #Brexit or it's negative consequences.It's being forced by a Gov't who care not of the consequences. The ppl should have the #FinalSay wth the option 2 #Remain.We appreciate your kind words & will do what we can to #StopBrexit #FBPE
My three stage plan to stop this Tory #Brexit. It may not make comfortable reading, but we urgently need to learn from the mistakes of the past - and ditch the tactics that lost us the referendum: 
Boris Johnson said there was an error on the side of the #Brexit bus so we fixed it for him. Hope this helps, Boris! 
Powerful and significant message from @eucopresident Donald Tusk this morning - if British people want to change their mind on #Brexit - door remains open. @Open_Britain @WalesForEurope 
And severing the control over our country by a hugely undemocratic power that appoints its law givers internally. I am proud, proud we won’t put up with it. Very proud of #Brexit

If you want MPs to keep ALL #Brexit options open, please encourage support for New Clause 6 in #EUWithdrawalBill debates today&tomorrow, so Parliament is clear it can revoke the Article50 notification letter if MPs feel it’s necessary in national interest
The President of the European Council   expresses hope on behalf of the other 27 EU countries that #Britain might yet have a change of heart on #brexit 
Unless there is a change of heart among our British friends, #Brexit will become a reality – with all its negative consequences - March next year. We, here on the continent, haven’t had a change of heart. Our hearts are still open for you.
Looking forward to becoming PM and fulfilling our manifesto pledge of more money for everything just as #Brexit hits & we suffer an inevitable economic slowdown with reduced tax revenues. #ShitANDBust
David Mundell chose to ignore the Scottish Government #Brexit impact analysis yesterday.
The Sun and @andrealeadsom want a stamp to celebrate #Brexit. Here's my humble contribution. 
June 2016: @RuthDavidsonMSP warns of the dangers to Scotland if we leave the EU at the BBC "Big Debate".Jan 2018: "#Brexit is great. Brexit is fantastic. We just need to get on and do it. £12.7bn hit to GDP? Who cares!?"#indyref2 better be soon.
Today EU releases it’s Plastics Strategy. By 2030 all plastics on EU market must be reusable or easily recyclable. Implications for UK traders #brexit 
Calls on everybody to get behind the madness that is #Brexit are daft. If everybody had gotten behind the EU project it would have flourished. #Brexit can never flourish - it will cause immense harm, as is already blindingly obvious.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Once again, we can rely on the @IrishTimes for some of the best #Brexit analyses around. This is spot on, from Cambridge professor Nicholas Boyle.
57% of Brits want a fresh referendum if May fails to get a #Brexit withdrawal deal 
The Remain argument stripped of its mask: cowardly, timorous and gutless. True Brits don't lose their bottle, they don't need a big brother to make decisions for them, and they stand or fall by themselves, facing both enemies and uncertainty squarely in the face. #Brexit 
If you don't yet know, #ABTV stands for "anti-Brexit tactical voting". Resident EU nationals can vote in the local elections in May. Let's send a strong message to the government about what we think of their #Brexit policies! #WATON #StopBrexit2018
EU demands veto over UK trade deals with other countries for two years after #Brexit 
@CloughOlive I'm reading Tony Connelly's Brexit and Ireland. NI farmers will be in serious trouble.  87% of farm income comes from subsidies. There is no way UK Gov can match these payments post #Brexit It's insanity what is happening
We’re not looking back in grief @Keir_Starmer, we’re trying to save this country from a colossal mistake. A tragedy you don’t see this. We need your help to defeat #Brexit. 
EU rules are devastating British marine life through electro-pulse fishing. Britain must leave the Common Fisheries Policy. We would be out of it already if it weren't for Remainer foot draggers in Parliament. #Brexit now. 
British politics is totally broken.  Today MPs like @NadineDorries can openly lie to electorates without any fear. #Brexit will fail because it's based on lies.

Oh boy - polished rational Nicola Sturgeon vs quivering incoherent Fluffy saying #Brexit will be absolutely fine, honest. Scottish people aren't daft @bbcscotlandnews
This is shocking Tory spin & disinformation on #Brexit. That the UK & Scotland can somehow get a deal with the EU better & of "greater scope" than being a member. Precious few details on what this could be from UK Govt. 
Hammond says British people want to keep 'European approach' after #Brexit. No Phil, we want to restore the British approach - freer trade and smart regulation - NOT excessive, unaccountable, top-down overregulation a la EU. Not seen the results of the vote on 23 June 2016?

This MP @andrealeadsom is a leader of the #Brexit Leave campaign who came very close to becoming prime minister of UK. This is what she is concerned with in Britain's most complex time since the war. I despair. I literally despair of my country. 
Labour and the Tories are obsessed with satisfying Leave voters. But what about the 16m+ who voted to Remain? They deserve a voice too. #Manchester #Brexit 
I thought the UK were going to be a beacon of free trade across the world after #brexit ?Why would the rUK not trade with an Indy Scotland in the EU single market? 
Andrew - if only you were so keen to hold Conservative Cabinet ministers & Farage to account with their litany of #LeaveLies and #Brexit baloney. Then there could be no justifiable accusations of #BBCBias4Brexit made. However, as it stands... You leave yourself exposed. @Ofcom
Airbus CEO Tom Enders says he thinks it will be "easier to clear the wreckage" from 4 years of #Trump administration and protectionism than  that caused by #Brexit !

Unfortunately @KwasiKwarteng hadn't done his homework before our debate on @adamboultonSKY #AllOurPolitics this morning. What #EEA #EFTA really means is full market access, no European Court of Justice, plus ability to strike trade deals & reform free movement #Brexit #schooled
Good opportunity to convey cross-party views from the UK Parliament with @EU_Commission’s @MichelBarnier this afternoon #Brexit 
Frankly, what didn't? Partly ignorance on my part in regards to original reason for voting leave. Mostly, the real impact of #Brexit now being known then one would have to be pretty dumb to think leave is a viable option.
#Carillion employees’ pension scheme is protected by EU law.Are you listening #Brexit fans? 
 In the next phase of #Brexit talks, job prospects, living standards and opportunities for this and future generations should be the priority. 
This is completely the problem. UK journalism is lowest ranked in trust in Europe, and has failed with due diligence spectacularly over #Brexit. Journo's response? 'Bollocks' 
New #Brexit minister @SuellaFernandes says plan to drop EU charter of fundamental rights would avoid “extra layers” of protections, contradicting govt assurances that no protections would be lost post Brexit. #BrexitReality
You should be ashamed spouting this kind of drivel. Everything you have said can be fact checked and falsified. It's just so bad that I think even The Daily Express would think twice about printing it. #Brexit #BrexitShambles

My latest views on #Brexit and on how Labour under @jeremycorbyn can win the arguments!
Those who promoted LEAVE, stand to make no personal gain if we leave. Many of those who promoted REMAIN, have EU pensions, financial interests in the EU, and prospective new jobs in the EU if we remain. So which side is self serving? #Brexit

Tomorrow at 10.45am (GMT) the EU Committee hears from a senior judge and an official from #EFTA about options for UK’s legal interactions with EU post-#Brexit: 
There is no evidence - none - of any benefit accruing from the #globalbritain proposal. It is merely a slogan.  However there is  plenty of evidence for the damage that will be done by #Brexit.
No #Dexit after #Brexit! 77 percent of Danes don’t agree that Denmark could better face the future outside the EU. Except for the Netherlands, no EU country has this strong support for the EU  #eudk #dkpol @EurobarometerEU
So remind me, is it the same brilliant Government that wrote the outstanding contracts for public services with #Carillion that is also negotiating our world beating #Brexit international trade deals? Still Liam Fox must have lots of business experience gained as a GP and MP. Not

Persuasive #Brexit analysis from @scotgov; it’s clear the best economic deal for Scotland & the U.K. is to remain in the Single Market. @jeremycorbyn and Labour need to get off the fence.

Jeremy Corbyn says 'No' to #EUref2 and understands that the people's vote must be respected.JC understands that to keep asking the British public what they want until the government gets the answer they want to hear makes a mockery of Democracy.#Brexit
Very good question! Who is paying for @Anna_Soubry et al to travel to Europe to meet with Barnier?? If it’s the taxpayer then that’s outrageous! They’re not involved in the negotiations. So if they want to interfere with #Brexit then they should pay for it themselves. 
Why on earth are these MP’s, who are not involved in the official #Brexit negotiations, interfering in the process and why on earth is Barnier insulting the British Government by entertaining them? Nothing but trouble-making to interfere with the process. Outrageous! #Brexit

I think the thing I loathe most about #Brexit is the feeling that it has diminished everyone, including me, internally. It has made my environment ruder, more suspicious, less understanding, frightened, aggressive, closed up. And I have responded in kind. Which I hate.
“A disgrace to the Labour tradition”??? You are so very wrong, @acgrayling! Thanks to @jeremycorbyn our @UKLabour is about & for the people once more.He isn’t in Government. He can’t stop #Brexit. .@Conservatives are “negotiating”. For now.Let’s see “the deal” then act.
Watched @NicolaSturgeon on #Marr this morning she had a superb interview answered every question directly. I did pick up that the #indyref will be announced after #Brexit shambles this autumn & that there is no need to worry about timescale. We have 2 years after March 2019!

Corbyn yet again stating he is in total agreement with Tory #Brexit policy. Rules out Single Market membership but demands tariff free access to the European market, the Tory position. 
The young voters believe that the EU is all cuddles and affords them 'rights' ... we know different eh ?#Brexit #Brexiteers #EUref2
The #Brexit bill will not protect people’s human rights in the UK as the government promised. Find out more about our concerns in a joint letter we've signed with @EHRC, @libertyhq, @fawcettsociety and other experts.

There is no doubt that at every election in Europe now, those opposed to mass migration and EU centralisation are winning support. When Brussels is reduced to threatening the likes of Poland and Hungary with sanctions, you know the system is breaking down. #Brexit
Let’s be clear on facts: as @The_TUC and others have said, you don't have to be in EU to be in the Single Market (see Iceland, Norway etc.); leaving it wasn’t on the ballot paper; we can change our mind on any / all of the issues around #Brexit in any case. Please RT.
"There is zero credible evidence to suggest leaving the #singlemarket will bring any benefit to our economy. Indeed, as our analysis will show - the harder the #Brexit the worse will be the outcome." #NicolaSturgeon #FBPE

#BREXIT records present #DesertedIslandDiscs @spaceangel1964
Independence for Scotland is an argument easily able to stand on its own merits, to improve governance & prospects/growth for Scotland; but we can't ignore #brexit , the biggest political event in decades, in helping to make the argument for self determination  #marr #indyref2
 @NicolaSturgeon: Nicola Sturgeon: the hard Brexiteers have had their chance and failed. #Marr #Brexit 
If #nicola was the PM, we would be leading the EU not leaving it.  England has been taken over by psychopathic roasters.  It's a shame, but Scotld will have to leave this careering train wreck, that is the #Brexitshambles UK. Goodbye and good luck, in #Brexit La la land.   #marr
FM: "I still believe whatever future Scotland chooses for itself, and you know what side of the fence I lie on, that future should not be imposed on it." #marr #Brexit
FM: "I believe that there is a majority in the House of Commons for staying in the Single Market, if Labour gets its act together." #Marr #Brexit
Nicola Sturgeon is looking at the facts about #Brexit; Theresa May is looking at the fiction. That's the difference.And it's an important difference.  #marr
FM: "The @scotgov will publish impact assessments on three possible outcomes… Each of these outcomes will damage our economy but staying in the Single Market will have the least impact on economic growth." #Brexit #marr

5. I'm not surprised at that - I know that the EU is strong on defending its citizens rights (eg data protection, working time directive etc). It's a shame so many #Brexit voters don't.
1. Yesterday my parents announced they don't think I should have a vote on anything in the UK, because I don't live there. I'm guessing this is a very common view. Post #Brexit I will no longer have a vote anywhere, so I will have NO voice. My #citizensrights are being taken away

Regarding #FBPE attacks on Labour/Corbyn. It's more a mixture of frustration, anger & tactics than anything party political. The thought is that only a very painful hiding will get Labour to cease taking Remainers for granted & stop pandering to Leave voters.#StopBrexit #Brexit
There are many with the #FBPE hashtag who, under normal service no doubt would be diametrically opposed to my political views.We have parked those differences because we know that leaving the EU is a far bigger issue for the future of our country.#StopBrexit #brexit
Both the apostrophe. and the uppercase 'M' in the word 'Mean's,' confirm that #Brexit belongs to a person called 'Mean'.For the first time in my life, I agree with #UKIP!
I know I’m biased, so can anyone help me identify a single positive practical outcome from #Brexit vote for #UK to date (actual, not theoretical or ideological)?
Theresa May leads a govt so lacking in achievements or good news that its resorted to disguising EU directives as it's our policy even as it ridicules the EU to justify #brexit while trusting that the British public is so ill informed they won't notice. What a time to be alive. 
Would THIS be the same Wes Streeting who openly supported the Chicken Coup against Corbyn?This isn't about #Brexit policy; this is another Right Wing Blairite Chicken Coup in the making!
Great letter about #Brexit in today's final Berliner format edition of the @guardian
Michael Foot said in 1975 "We will have plenty of problems to solve ... we can solve these problems by using the strength of our democratic institutions". 43 years later we find those institutions shrivelled, expired and corrupted. That is the legacy of EU membership.#Brexit
Think #Brexit is settled? Three top lawyers have laid out a convincing case for us withdrawing Art 50 without the consent of the other 27 EU countries.
We have 460 vacancies at #StPeters #hospital in #Chertsey - I'm sure its due to the same reason. #Brexit is killing our country 
Nobody buys or sells a house unless it’s ‘Subject to Contract’. #Brexit should be no different. If the final deal turns out to be terrible, Parliament and/or ‘the people’ should be able to say ‘No!’ Please share. Link:  #FBPE

Yes, Brexit referendum has forced open discussion on many hitherto taboo subjects such as EU army, UK fishing waters, Agricultural subsidies, immigration etc & I don't think many people like what they hear except for receivers of EU non-jobs & backhanders#Brexit debate harms #EU
PM May forgets to tell that this was implementing the EU directive in UK.No wonder #Brexit happened when the benefits of the EU aren't told 
18 months on after #brexit UK gov’s favourite Brexit ‘charity’ think tank still clutching to canards about German car makers. Penny still isn’t dropping: EU27 politics far outweighs sectional interests
Sorry to tweet this again. But in a nutshell here is why #Brexit happened. UK govt takes sole credit for EU achievements while rubbishing EU at every turn. Decades of this = #brexit 
This about sums up madness of #Brexit #FBPE #Leave
In fact #Brexit has created #Remainers, a fast growing British proEU movement. Before Brexit if pro EU you did not need to be active or engaged. No you bloody well do. It is grassroots bottom up, ordinary people from all parts of the country & all political backgrounds #FBPE
At @KEconomicConf @MichealMartinTD says his party will support any reasonable proposal which will allow Scotland to retain its links with Europe and pays tribute to @SNP MPs for their support for Ireland during Westminster #Brexit debates.

And even more evidence of the public’s shift against #BrexitHow much larger does the Remain lead need to get, before May concedes the country needs to be given the opportunity to #ExitFromBrexit ?
Personally not keen on second referendum. Would prefer ministers and other elected politicians to take their responsibility and show leadership in 2018 to halt a bad #Brexit deal if it is not in interest of Britain and British people.  #parliamentarydemocracy
I guess reason Farage is (possibly) shifting on #SecondReferendum is he senses another debate is coming and prefers to have it on the street than in Parliament. Wherever it happens, must be of higher quality and better informed than last time #Brexit
Economist Julian Jessop - "Britain’s decision to leave the EU provides a golden opportunity for the UK to become a global champion of free trade once again." #Brexit 
Steven Woolfe MEP - "Barnier has accepted very clearly that there will be #Brexit in March 2019 and he is working towards that." 
An even bigger shame that #Farage was so recklessly ill-advised as to make the suggestion in the first place.Arguably the most #Brexit-unhelpful intervention from a Leave-er since the #EURef.Whether retracted or not, much damage has been done.

TV is very careful to provide reasonably equal representation of ethnic minorities, but unless I'm sorely mistaken it provides almost no representation of EU 27 nationals. Has this contributed to #Brexit xenophobia?#StopBrexit #FBPE

Nigel Farage: Doctors reporting patients are dying in corridors under intolerable conditions. Just imagine if the £Billions being spent on #Brexit went to the #NHS instead. And imagine how much £350,000,00 every week would help.
Met with @LoigCG  - good opportunity to set out @WelshGovernment commitment to staying in the Single Market & retaining the closest possible relationship with the EU post #Brexit 
In keeping up with present thinking we propose to have a referendum on whether to have a 'best of 3' referendum on #Brexit & everything else that requires a referendum. We will extend this to the #GeneralElection as well when we do not like the original result. #Manicfesto
If you're a Scottish unionist bitching about #Brexit, you truly have zero credibility. You don't genuinely care about the Scottish economy or EU nationals here. You still want WM to determine our fate.
Dear Michel, these cretins DO NOT speak for the people of Britain. They are maverick agitators. Please deal with the UK, not a bunch of bitter has-beens we rejected years ago! #Brexit pic.twitter.com/nUK5sMF74e
Excuse me @theresa_may @Nigel_Farage All you mad #Brexit voters, I did'nt vote to surrender my right to drive in the EU countries that I choose to visit!!! You've made a right 'effing arse of this. What next? Visa's to visit Spain,France,Germany. FECKIN IDIOTS!!! 
At least @nigel_farage sees the stakes in the #Brexit debate. Remain should match courage of his convictions.   
#NigelFarage says he is close to backing a second EU referendum to end the "whinging and whining" of anti-#Brexit campaigners We say BRING IT ON! Sign up here to stand with us >> 
'Are we old, pasty-white, knuckleheaded Brits as bigoted and ass-backward as everybody thinks? Damn bloody right we are!': Confident the result will turn out the same as the first, Nigel Farage calls for second referendum on Brexit  #Brexit @Nigel_Farage
Nigel Farage is back in the news (again) so enjoy this Twitter response of the year  #nigelfarage #brexit 
Sadiq Khan should stop whining about Brexit and concentrate on running the buses and cutting crime. His report today is just misery porn for Remoaners. Bring on #Brexit - let the good time roll! 
Even Nigel Farage admits #Brexit is not a settled issue... 
HolyMoly.Just when you thought #Brexit couldn't get more surreal.When Pro-Brexit politicians are giving out hampers of products from pro-EU British manufacturers undermining their stunt about power of British trade...#NigelFarage drops this bombshell.Wake up #wonderland.

We’ve now reached a bizarre point within the soap opera of Brexit where Nigel Farage is suggesting a second EU referendum and Jeremy Corbyn isn’t.#Brexit
Now is the time for everyone at Holyrood to unite in a simple message: “Hands off Scotland’s Parliament.” #Brexit #FMQS #Clause11 #powergrab
Protected Geographical Indications are backed by the might of the EU. How does the UK plan to ensure these protections, especially when countries such as the US want to negotiate trade deals including plans to call their whisky 'Scotch'? #Brexit 
The first EU referendum was a vote on an idea/hunch with no details. A second referendum would be a vote on the actual details of the negotiated #Brexit deal. It would be a vote on the terms and conditions of Brexit. The country should have the final say, not politicians. 
What prompted Farage to now say he would consider a second #Brexit  referendum on the UK’s EU membership?Summing up some of his possible reasons in a blog post! 
Britain could lose almost 500,000 jobs and 50 billion pounds investment over the next 12 years if it fails to agree a trade deal with the European Union, according to a report commissioned by London Mayor Sadiq Khan.  #Brexit 
Prime Minister in her “green” speech today cites “waters now cleaner than ever before”.  The reason is because we are part of EU and have had to meet standards like these now threatened by her #Brexit: Bathing water - Environment - European Commission 
The EU has been the greatest mechanism for exporting poverty to the Third World:  #Brexit
Farage believes the Leave vote would increase in a second referendum. How would you vote?Please share widely#Brexit
Looks like Banks and Farage are having second thoughts on #Brexit. Of course they'll blame the incumbent government. But it doesn't matter who's in power, #Leaving can't be delivered without killing the economy, service industries and jobs.
FM: "It is absolutely disgraceful that having launched this power grab on this Parliament, the Tories have failed to deliver on any promises to fix it." #Brexit #FMQs
Labour folk who claim that Labour has no responsibility for #Brexit are wilfully ignoring the fact that the government does not command a solid Brexit majority in the Commons - thanks, of course, to the Remainer votes the Labour Leadership treats with contempt.#StopBrexit #FBPE
'My mind is actually changing’: @Nigel_Farage calls for a second #Brexit referendum 
#poll for U.K people. #Brexit : @Nigel_Farage says perhaps we should have a second #EUreferendum to once and for all silence the #Remainers. What do you think the outcome would be?
#Brexit, even though not happened yet, has already done so much damage to the UK. Wonder if the "United" Kingdom will ever be united again.  #StopBrexit
Nigel Farage: "So maybe – just maybe – I’m reaching the point of thinking that we should have a second referendum on EU membership." For once, I agree with him.#Brexit
Hands up who wants a second referendum!#ToothlessFarage #Brexit #Farage
BREXIT: To negotiate Brexit, Britain must show competence and emotional intelligence  /#Brexit #Toxic #StopBrexit
London mayor @SadiqKhan accused of relaunching ‘Project Fear’ with taxpayer-funded #Brexit report 
Anti-Brexit Mayor asks "experts" who are openly opposed to #Brexit to "analyse" the effect of Brexit on the economy. You can only expect a hugely biased report. And that's what the Mayor got. A tremendous waste of public money, a diversion from his lamentable record on crime.
Farage is on The Wright Stuff. He's whinging that the EU have "stolen" 45 thousand pounds from him, are not currently paying him and he doesn't think he'll get his EU pensions. #Brexit
This point made @TimSuttonC really has to be repeated:People are furious at Corbyn for one simple reason.If May loses her job, Brexit will still happen. If Corbyn loses his, it probably won't.#FBPE #StopBrexit #Brexit
// @theintelligiser: #Brexit is just a symptom of the UK’s decline, a cultural and economic vacuum to which the answer is independence. 
In Brittany to meet with political leaders & discuss Wales’ place in Europe. Wales has always enjoyed a close relationship with Brittany & #Brexit will not change this
.@Nigel_Farage has suggested Britain could hold a second EU referendum to silence 'moaning' Remainers #Brexit 
Do here's the big one, the PM has said #Brexit will not mean a lowering of environmental standards. We will have a strong set of environmental principles and a new statutory body to hold Government to account and give it a voice. So it looks like we'll need an #EnvironmentAct 
Great to see Nigel Farage supporting our call to give voters the #finalsay on #Brexit  
With Nigel Farage suggesting it may be time for a 2nd EU Ref, how would you vote if given more choice on #Brexit?
We voted to LEAVE the European Union. Now let’s get on with it. I will not support a call for a second referendum. #Brexit #BrexitMeansBrexit #LeaveMeansLeave @UKIP @UKIPWales
OK - consider this: "Hard Brexit could cost German car industry €3.8 billion" and tell me there won't be a little more give from the #EU in #Brexit talks 
The real reason farage wants a 2nd referendum is because he wants remain to win it so he can resurrect his career by claiming to be the voice of the "betrayed brexiteers" blame the eu for everything and avoid responsibility for #Brexit as it won't have happened
Anger with pompous intellectuals droning on about #Brexit every day while people are literally dying due to Tory austerity is growing fast. 
Evidence continues to mount regarding inevitable  #Brexit damage to the economy ....Brexit could see UK economy lose £54bn by 2030, Sadiq Khan's impact papers warn

The evolving situation of data transfers and their legality post #Brexit in a handmade infographic. Quite a few question marks I'm afraid. One to keep an eye on. 
Still astounded how many from the Leave camp say they voted #Brexit for the sole reason that the UK has no immigration controls and let's anybody in. The UK is an island and isn't in Schengen.
Many Remainers want to support Labour. Corbyn's support for Tory hard #Brexit (for that is what quitting the Single Market means) is making them politically homeless. Give them their home back @UKLabour - Dump or sideline Corbyn!#StopBrexit #FBPE

Davis and Hammond take note: #Brexit has virtually no traction in the German media or its politics. Many of the people I have met in mainland Europe also don't really give a **** - they just say typical British madness. 
From point of view of Bulgarian British Partnership, #Brexit is not good. I voted Remain, as did Corbyn & his Constituents. However, unfortunately the Leave Vote won. Bottom line for me is - I stand with Corbyn & I am confident that Remain or Leave we are safer in Corbyn's hands 
Labour outperformed expectations to such a degree at the last election because lots of people, especially young people, voted for us expecting us to oppose a hard #Brexit. We cannot let them down.

.@bbcpointswest  Interesting Programme about Doctor Shortages in the West. Pity you didn't  mention haemorrhage of European Doctors leaving because of #Brexit! 
Next time a #Brexshitter quotes the figure of 17.4 million people (including those who have passed away), mention the more impressive figure of 48 million – UK residents in 2016 who did not vote for #Brexit.And that's being generous: the number is certainly much higher now.
Let's hope Lord Malloch Brown is right, because #Brexit is a total disaster that must be stopped!
Lets try to get @vincecable to be a little more Vocal on #StopBrexit2018 . Party politics are irrelevant at the moment but #Brexit isn't and why isn't he going on to all the MSN political progs?
BREAKING: We complained that UK Government’s #Brexit bill breached the #Aarhus environmental convention. Now a @UN committee is investigating:
Is it that Labour do not have a clue what their #Brexit policy is?Is it that they are trying to appeal to both sides by deceiving the other?I suspect it is both. 
BREAKING: #Brexit bill may have broken international environment law, says UN - as it considers complaint from @friends_earth

If anything membership in the EU damaged jobs and living standards of millions in Britain yet prostituting MPs, probably bribed by Brussels, keep claiming that #Brexit would hurt jobs and living standards. This is treachery and they are getting away with it.
Anna Soubry - What is the Labour Party's front bench policy on our future relationship with the EU when it comes to the customs union and how does it differ from the government's policy? I suggest they're exactly the same.#Brexit #StopBrexit #TradeBill #FBPE @Anna_Soubry
There is an irrationality at the heart of Brexit, a small minded insularity that believes that somehow the UK is exceptional...in following the exceptionally stupid path of #Brexit we say that cannot be more than what we are. That common values cannot transcend borders. #Remain

 Oh, Jeremy Corbyn... Turns out the Labour leader all those hopeful young folk were chanting for at Glastonbury is just the same as the Tories - intent on delivering a hard #Brexit and dragging Scotland over the cliff edge with the rest of the UK. 
One day soon, I hope, #Brexit will be consigned to the dustbin of history and we can get back to the task of making Britain a more just, more equal, more compassionate society. Brexit would take us in a different direction.
What a pity @ChukaUmunna isn't Leader of @UKLabour. If he were, the whole British political landscape would be different and #Brexit maybe averted. 
I take no pleasure in saying I can't vote for @jeremycorbyn. You may be a man of principle. You won hearts & minds in 2017, but, now you need to wake up.Do you honestly think your popularity is growing still? Their is a growing number against #brexit. Wake up.
May is a busted flush clinging on by the skin of her teeth. I do wonder if some in the party are just giving her enough rope to hang herself and her conies with, now they've seen the folly of #Brexit. 
18 months on and we still haven’t debunked the myth / feeling among some Leave voters that the EU is responsibly for *NON*-EU immigration and “the Muslim invasion”.Unless we debunk these myths we’re not going to break the back of #Brexit.#FBPE

Weird Davis logic: UK can prepare for no deal #Brexit but unfair if EU does same thing  via @financialtimes
So, let me get this straight, @DavidDavisMP who wants #Brexit is going to take the EU to the European Courts to argue that we, the UK, want to leave the EU but the EU should make us a generous offer to leave and it's jolly not fair that they don't because we are British
Oh dear... Tony Blair launches campaign to avoid #Brexit and Corbyn defends a  hard Brexit and gets closer to the Tories. There is no hope for the United Kingdom, no matter what the #UKLabour Party does. Hopeless. Scotland, wake up!

#FBPEThe first statement confirms that Corbyn believes a hard #Brexit is the appropriate response to the ReferendumThe second statement is completely untrue, which means he's misleading people or he's incompetent

Corbyn insists Britain cannot remain in the Single Market. That means Corbyn wants the same as most Tories, a hard #Brexit which will force Britain to move towards an ultra-free market economy to compensate for the loss of Single Market membership.#StopeBrexit #FBPE /1
Oi, @jeremycorbyn! You're wrong mate. Not only can the UK stay in Single Market and the Customs Union, it damned well should, for it's own best interests. Start killing #Brexit and you'll be PM. Let Brexit happen and you won't. It's that simple. 
That'll be the same @DavidDavisMP who said that Britain was prepared to walk away without a #Brexit deal.Looks like the bluffer's bluff has been well and truly called...

#Corbyn, determined to go down in history as a chief handmaiden of #Brexit. 
Tony Blair’s attempts to derail the implementation of the referendum result are contemptible. There is no sign of a widespread public wish to abandon #Brexit. 
Nigel Farage - "The EU is no longer about reconciliation between countries and it certainly isn’t about the well-being of ordinary people." #Brexit 
Sounds like Corbyn is just recycling the drivel that's been peddled by some right-wing Brexiters that being in the Single Market means being in the EU. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit

Instead of going on the defensive and trying to justify the decision, do your research. Find out more about the EU, how it works and what it does. Look at the mess that’s being made of the #brexit process. 8/
If one thing was clear about the 2016 #brexit referendum, it’s that we were hopelessly misinformed about the benefits of the EU & the drawbacks of leaving. When leavers are told ‘you didn’t know what you voted for’, they often feel patronised or derided as ‘thick’ or ‘stupid’ 1/

One of the worst things about #Brexit is that it forces every single British person to make this choice. Before June 2016 we all had the joy of both identities. 
Nigel Farage - "My concern is the 17.4 million have not had their voices heard, I will endeavour to start a process of doing that tomorrow. Once I’ve been there, there’ll be others from the Leave side who go there as well and that’s a very good thing." #Brexit

Strong leadership on #Brexit in Scotland’s interests from the First Minister; sadly for the Tories #Brexit seems to be a roulette wheel chip for personal career opportunities; for Labour it’s ‘do nothing, it will implode and we can have a General Election’

My view of Labour's leaders: Unprincipled, power-craving political slime balls who think if Labour can just keep people muddled & confused for long enough about its #Brexit stance it can slink into power and blame the Tories for the mess. #StopBrexit #FBPE
I still believe in #FBPE. I don’t care that provocateurs are trying to subvert it. I will still be standing her long after they have gone. I will also always identify as a Remainer. #Brexit will never be a good idea, even if it becomes a reality, so why switch to Retain? Never.
Imagine how much could be achieved if Labour opposed rather than supported #Brexit #StopBrexit
May:-‘We want a frictionless and tariff  free agreement with Europe’In other words: we want what we’ve got now #Brexit
1/. Quick THREAD on #Russia, #Trump & #Brexit: 1 year ago US Intelligence agreed: “Moscow will apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including vs US allies and their election processes’.
The University #Brexodus is symbolic of many of the problems associated with #Brexit. First and foremost, it affects real people with real lives. People who have chosen to make the UK their home and who are deciding that this is no longer their home. /1

The brightest and best are leaving the UK thanks to #Brexit. We must #StopBrexit now.
My friend @AlexTaylorNews, the symbol of Brits in France having to deal with #Brexit... and embracing French nationality as a result.  Bienvenue les amis! 
The corrupt establishment was so horrified that the UK voted for #Brexit they are doing all they can to try & get it stopped, inc peddling the ‘all Brexit voters are racist’ narrative.If that were true, why do so many immigrants live/want to live here if 52% are soooo racist
#Brexit passed on! Brexit is no more! It has ceased to be! Brexit is a stiff! Bereft of life. Brexit kicked the bucket, Brexit shuffled off it’s mortal coil, run down the curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisible!! THIS IS AN EX-BREXIT! - Soon! :)
Europe’s biggest #Brexit fear is that we’ll flourish outside... “You have often been right in the past from Henry VIII to the decision to challenge Hitler. Perhaps, once again, you are seeing the future more clearly”
The BMA says nearly 1 in 5 NHS doctors from the EU have made concrete plans to leave the UK since #Brexit voteIn 2016/17, 11% of nurses leaving NHS were EU nationals. Numbers of Portuguese, Spanish and Italian nurses have fallen between December 2016 and June 2017.#NHSCrisis
"Venture capital investment in technology firms increased by 83% from 2016 to 2017." See latest #Brexit news in 2 simple charts:  More proof of wall of lies from Remain campaign.
"UK GETS MORE TECH SECTOR INVESTMENT THAN ALL OTHER EU COUNTRIES COMBINED" - Read another great #Brexit story from Facts4EU: 
I'd warrant a large no.of ppl still have no idea about nor any real interest in, the implications of this damaging #Brexit. The level of apathy coupled with a naive sense they'll be relatively ok is astounding...talk about heads in sand..Up to our MPs to put UK 1st.#StopBrexit
Lots of #Brexity hate for @Andrew_Adonis he must be doing something right. Keep fighting! You stand with an army #FBPE #Remain #Brexit
Labour is *already* in a fight over #Brexit - with themselves. Seldom does a week go by when I don’t see one bunch of Labour MPs go in the aye lobby, another bunch abstain &another into the no lobby. Lack of clarity or direction is an abdication of responsibility.
Retailers to be banned from charging you extra to pay on cards from next Saturday - thanks not to our government but the EU#Remain #Brexit
Ask about this, too, @AndrewMarr9 @RobBurl! Hold @theresa_may to account. Also: the NHS, Chris Grayling & @Andrew_Adonis’s resignation, ruinous #Brexit, schools crisis, prison crisis, homelessness, housing shortage... ALL have got WORSE over the last 7yrs. #Marr.
Steven Woolfe, John Longworth, John Mills & Digby Jones.Now that's a team I wish *was* representing us in #Brexit negotiations, not the various EU-phile Sir Humphreys desperate for consensus + Remainer-May.     
This is an absolute disgrace and highly concerning. #brexit to swallow £70m meant for developing cancer drugs, says GSK. As new facts like this begin to emerge, important to stop and think whether current path is right one @Open_Britain
More NHS money spent on medicines & less money for Cancer research as a result of #Brexit say GSKI don’t remember reading that on the side of a bus.#exitfrombrexit
I’m fundamentally against #Brexit as I see it as a real threat to all I cherish in this country. I see selfishness, greed and suspicion creeping into our society and I find it chilling.
The most unrealistic part of #hardsun is that the Government would know the world would end in 5 years. They still don't have a clue about #Brexit

If you can explain to me why #retain is so much better than Tory #Brexit and how it can be delivered, then perhaps I will listen.In the mean time, #remain.
#FBPE1) remainers like me are trying desperately to not attack Labour Leadership.We see Labour membership is against the worst excesses of Brexit & Labour is major ally in this fightBut this from @BarryGardiner is just repeating Tory #brexit rhetoric

The awful truth @IanBlackfordMP is that @jeremycorbyn is cheerleading #Brexit with the likes of Johnson, Gove and Farage. 
Shocking abdication of responsibility from Jeremy Corbyn who appears to be no different from the Tories in pursuing a disastrous hard #Brexit. 
I will not be renewing my membership of @UKLabour unless @jeremycorbyn does something positive about #Brexit The youth that voted him in want to remain in the #EU
We were warned the #NHS would not be safe in the hands of #Brexiters. Those warnings are coming true, hence #NHScrisis. So-called #projectfear now very much #projectreality. Best course of action: #FinalSay to #ExitFromBrexit & #SaveOurNHS. Let's drop #Brexit & fix UK's problems. 
Incandescent with outrage & disgust about what happened to a #Peterborough resident, friend & valued citizen in London yesterday. State-sanctioned harassment.  Please RT @GreenJennyJones @natalieben @jon_bartley @CarolineLucas #Brexit @peterboroughtel

Brexiteers to warn EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier of Churchillian 'iron will' to walk away from a bad deal.There is “huge support” for reverting to WTO rules instead of accepting a bad & unacceptable deal.#Brexit #EU @telegraph
An excellent take down by @JolyonMaugham of the Brexiters’ argument that having a referendum on the #Brexit deal v #remain will weaken UK’s negotiating position with EU.It’s clear UK needs to find a way to #ExitFromBrexit
There is NO such thing as EU money - the EU has NO money of it's own.EU budget money is from nation state contributions of which UK taxpayers contribute about £13+ Billion.We just cut out the EU middleman by paying subsidies direct to UK farmers.#Brexit #EU
The Daily Mail in January 1973.If they have the right to change their mind, then so do the people.#Brexit 
Since 23rd June 2016 the UK gvt has maintained the same dreamlike aims on #brexit. We now have 10 mths to get real. Barnier has mapped out where we're heading with T Mays red lines. There's nothing for financial services & definitely no +++ #ExitFromBrexit#FinalSayForAll
Apparently, Trump @POTUS didn't know what #Brexit was 2 weeks before the referendum. Ah well - 18 months on, and @Theresa_may and millions of Leavers still don't understand what it means. #StopBrexit2018
This must be why most of the rich #Brexiteers wanted us to leave the EU. I wonder what Jacob Rees-Mogg and John Redwood think of this. #Brexit 
@jeremycorbyn : Given the Government is on track to fail @Keir_Starmer 's six #BrexitDeal tests, can you now commit @UKLabour to voting against #brexit ? #brexit is a luxury for the few - the #EU is a necessity for the many. #JeremyCorbyn #keirstarmer @Labour4EU
#Brexit Have a great Saturday today everyone let’s have a Brexit free day. Bored out of my head with it. Non stop Bloody remoaners out every day trying to derail Brexit. We voted we’re leaving get over it !! Go shopping, go down the pub, or listen to some pop music.  
These were the promises of #Brexit If not met, it was the stated policy of @UKLabour that Brexit would be opposed in Parliament.Corbyn must be true to his word & stand up for the people against the tyranny of propaganda & jingoism. It is time to #StopBrexitSaveBritain#FBPE
This is a Brexit troll with around 12k followers pretending to be #FBPE. I've just blocked it.#StopBrexit #Brexit 
A warning to #Brexit politicians. Demographic change alone will produce a #Remain majority in 2020, which will grow relentlessly from then on. There will be little tolerance for politicians who have foisted Brexit on a nation opposed to it. #StopBrexit #FBPE
A reminder of some of the #LeaveLies that were sold to the UK. Now that they have used up all of the credibility people assigned to them it's time for a new #Brexit referendum to test the 2018 “will of the people.”  If you want one then lobby your MP to bug their party leadership 
#Brexit Britain is #sweatshop Britain. It’s a place where the wealthy get richer, while the lives of everyone else gets vastly poorer. It will allow you to work longer & for less, travel less & eat less. Don’t let evil liars defeat us, there is an alternative

That #Brexit feeling when you spend two shillings on incandescent lightbulbs on the way home from a smoky pub where you will spend all night nursing the scars of your physically-violent education and admire your funky blue passport to forget about your family members on death row 
2) Those on the right & more recently on the left have talked at length about "rabid remainers" who aggressively attack anyone who's not "pure" anti-brexit. Fundamentally, this obsessive witchhunting meant that the fight against #brexit was doomed to failure.

I've posted this before, and will keep doing so. One example of EU rules affecting our rivers, canals, beaches etc. making this country a better place to live for ordinary people. Can you imagine a UK govt doing this without having to? No. Me neither. #FBPE #Brexit #StopBrexit

So stupid and harmful! The demands of Brexiteers push the UK into a weak trading position after #Brexit. This will do damage to Europe and most importantly to the UK economy.

"He's starting to sound like a broken record" says @MattTurner4L as Tony Blair​ says Brits should be able to change mind on #Brexit after deal. 
Labour's Owen Jones claims that #FBPE has no plan. Yes we have a plan Owen. All that has to happen is for your party to support a #FinalSay referendum. That's simple, democratic & feasible. Why are you so frightened of it!#StopBrexit #Brexit
16) Labour has understandable issues with minority kipper movements in Northern seats, but this also means Labour could pivot back to a harder #Brexit at any time, for political reasons.It's just something we need to be aware of and try to encourage against
Some people in Labour (only some) are now trying to discredit, divide and weaken our #FBPE campaign. That means we have got them badly rattled. So let's step up our efforts to make the Labour leadership listen to its the majority of members and supporters. #StopBrexit #Brexit

At Paddy Power you can literally bet on whatever you want #Bitcoin #Brexit 
5) he also even now quotes YouGov surveys that have long since being discredited to "prove" that a majority actively want #Brexit.His priority is getting Labour in power, which is fair enough, but anything he says on Brexit is only with this aim in mind (as seen in article above)

Once again Blair is right on #Brexit, once again he is cynically dismissed. 
Brilliant article by my @CommonsHealth colleague @PaulWilliamsMP on how the #NHS crisis is made much, much worse by #Brexit 
‘Blair articulates the case against May’s #Brexit strategy more clearly than anyone else in public life. If Jeremy Corbyn made the same case, which is backed by an overwhelming majority of Labour party members, things would be very different’ @martinkettle
The Treasury drew up a report on the economic implications of #BrexitThe govt knew it would be carnage. Everything Leave told the public was a lie.Here's a slice of a layer cake of pre-known ramifications.In a legal case of assault, the law would call it a PREMEDITATED crime 
No serious person ever promised an economic miracle from #Brexit. My view was that it would be a catalyst for a political renewal and from that flows the opportunities for economic reconfiguration. In that estimation, GDP is a useless and irrelevant metric.
"Germany has to do a lot more because the Americans can't be counted on. This is the new world order." @IanBremmer on how #Brexit talks will impact the coming year: 
Investment firm Rabobank warns a no deal #Brexit would slash 18% off GDP growth by 2030 & leave workers £11,500 poorer, while FTA & ‘soft’ Brexit alternatives would leave them £9,500 & £7,500 poorer respectively.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Rules which ensure our food is healthy & meets the highest standards?? It's chlorine-washed chicken for us all, I'm afraid folks  #Brexit 
Really? I cannot remember British politics ever being remotely as childish as it has been since the referendum (and I’m 63). #Brexit, like most forms of nationalism, panders to crude emotions and prejudice, not mature reason.
FACT: The Gov't has said it is not bound to honour the pledge to spend £350m extra a week on the NHS made by the Vote Leave campaign. This is a disgrace: had people known this was a LIE, remain would have won.We MUST have another vote.#NHSCrisis #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE
Here is Ryan. He voted for #brexit but now he has seen the “data” he believes #brexit is not good. He also highlights the lies he was told before the vote and govt’s terrible handling since! A lot of people feel like Ryan and are #remainernow
As the prime minister and Heath minister apologise for what is happening in #NHS they need to consider apologising for #Brexit which is sucking the system dry. There is not enough money for #NHS and #Brexit. Make your choice #Crisis

I'm very angry at that #r4today interview from this morning. John Humphrys "interviewed" Blair, but it was a series of lies and interruptions from Humphrys. I agree with Tony Blair on #Brexit. If you listen to Humphrys' pro Brexit comments, you realise how absurd his case is.
Leavers didn't give a thought to #Gibraltar when they voted and they're still ignoring the problem. #Brexit is fundamentally impractical. It's like weighing 200lbs and trying to fit into a 50lb dress. Not gonna happen without tearing the dress apart at the seams & trashing it. 
If Blair is pushing so hard for this, and BBC are hell bent on giving him air time to do so, then we know we have made the right decision #Brexit
Tony Blair's bid to manipulate us into staying in the EU is the farthest thing from democracy imaginable:  #Brexit
Harvey has a bone to pick with #Brexit and is calling on other dogs to join the #Wooferenum It's barking mad, so get woofing! #StopBrexit #BrexitShambles #FBPE #BrexitReality
Blair doesn't rule out a THIRD referendum on the UK's membership of the European Union. We must make it very clear to Blair that (1) he's no longer the PM, (2) it was the EEC we voted on first time, (3) we voted in 2016 by a majority of 1,269,501 to leave the EU. Get it?#Brexit
Don't blame #brexit for problems in the NHS! Grow up.- 5,000,000 extra NHS customers from the #EU- £365,000,000,000 Labour PFI debts to be repaid by #NHS- Blair's GP contracts sent patients to A&E instead.For goodness sake, do your homework!
We don't accept your apology for the #NHSCrisis @theresa_may - the suffering caused is all yours to own. The Institute for Fiscal Studies made clear your policies would cause misery, just like HM Treasury has done with #Brexit. You have ignored them both.#StopBrexit
Austria STRIPS benefits from children living abroad“It's an unfairness built into the system that, for 2 children who do not even live in Austria but Romania, roughly €300 a month are transferred to Romania & that is almost average income there”#Brexit
Dan Scavino, some may recall, retweeted an anti-Semitic 4chan account on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. That incident was how I discovered Trump-Russia botnet collusion. This piece covered bots for Trump and noted the same bots were for #Brexit 
I'm in Budapest today to meet with Hungarian PM Vicktor Orbán. We discussed #Brexit, trade & cultural links. Ireland & Hungary agree on many issues inc tax sovereignty, competition and Brexit. Our views diverge on other issues but dialogue is the best way forward.

If #Leavers are so sure #Brexit is the will of the people, why are they so vehemently against a vote on the final deal which included a no-brexit option?
In an interview with #LBC, Lord Adonis said he "absolutely wants to sabbotage Brexit, in a democratic way". This is the man who wants a final referendum on the #Brexit deal, but didn’t want a referendum in the first place...

#Retain appears to be a new hashtag from Corbyn’s labour supporters which I will not be getting behind. Mostly because the idea we have any influence over what deal the EU will strike with us is deluded. So I will continue to oppose #Brexit, which is an unambiguous stance.

My brother (the intelligent one) did some analyses of @YouGov #Brexit polling in 2017. The swing against Brexit is clear, we need to accelerate this trend in 2018! 
How on earth did Scottish Labour and Labour become the effective cheerleaders of the likes of Johnson, Gove and Farage on #Brexit? Scottish Labour are lost at sea.
When Tony Blair urges Labour to take ‘the high ground on opposing Brexit’, he wants it to look down on the ignorant plebs.Fighting for #Brexit remains the best path to the democratic summit of taking control back from the political elites. 
"Over the last couple of years I’ve been so appalled with of Barnier, of Tusk and Juncker, bullying this country. I’ve got to the stage where I am a committed Brexiteer. I want us out." #Brexit

We are hiring again! Fantastic opportunity for researcher to lead our #foodpolicy and #Brexit work. 
Tony Blair just broke a new record as the most out of touch British politician of modern times!! He's clearly learnt nothing & doesn't understand why 7/10 Labour constituencies voted #Brexit. He's a major part of the reason as people felt left behind & that they had no control!!
That makes sense. Scotland is one of the Nordic Countries. And after #Brexit and the break-up of the UK, it will be very welcome! 
Eight out of 10 grassroots members of Britain’s opposition Labour Party want a referendum on the terms of the country’s exit from the European Union.  #Brexit 
#TonyBlair was wrong on many things, but on #brexit, the #Brexiteers, the Tory #brexitshambles, and #BrexitReality, his analysis is clear and incisive and well worth looking at :
The idea that calling for a democratic vote on the #Brexit deal is an attack on democracy is Alice In Wonderland-levels of surreal.
Britain’s services sector, including hotels and banks, grew at a faster rate than expected last month - despite #Brexit 
At @ORFC Sec of State @michaelgove talking v big vision ideas with @ZacGoldsmith sounding almost revolutionary from #truecostaccounting to a shift in public procurement to more “progressive farming” open to new entrants -& quality + welfare = future #Brexit not a race to bottom. 
Tony Blair tells UK voters - time is running out to stop #Brexit folly 
A second #brexit voteWhere there's better understanding of benefits & consequencies now they've become apparentWould reflect the educated will of the people.Yet those normally spouting "the will of the people",all prefer the uneducated optionIt's time to get real!#fbpe
Which part of “Leave “ is confusing some people. Lets just get it done now. #Brexit
Exclusive first look at the new #Brexit commemorative stamps 
Someone who egregiously lied to murder over 1 million people, won't give a seconds thought about whether he should lie about #BrExit.Tony Blair 
1. Read in full & RTSee the message not the messenger...this encapsulates the case perfectly & rightly seeks a #FinalSay in 2018 to Confirm #Brexit or #StopBrexit. Of course he's for #Remain & it's easy to see why. I have one small caviat.....
I think it's time our MPs debated the result of the advisory referendum. I think they should discuss whether #Brexit is a good idea or a bad one. Then they should have a free vote on whether to take the advice or #RemainInTheEU. Simple. Easy. Quick.
Every day, more data confirms #Brexit will deprive our NHS and public services the vital revenues they need. Politicians who think this can be ignored and who turn a blind eye will end up sharing responsibility for this sharper austerity ahead. 
Nearly 80% of @UKLabour members want a vote on any #Brexit deal & 90% want us to stay in Single Market.  Time for leadership.
HA!Gove (the knife) is promising UK farmers that current EU subsidies will be replaced by UK tax payers subsidies post #Brexit until 2024.What ABOUT the £350m promised to the NHS ?
UK Food Standards Agency @foodgov cut from seven floors of offices to one. Trading standards officer numbers halved. How will #healthyfood be guaranteed if we #Brexit? Who sets standards? #foodsecurity #ORFC2018 #ORFC18
That's why the people voted for #Brexit It was their one and only chance to vote on the unrecognisable, expansionist, monolith, that the trading bloc we'd joined had become. Ruled by bureaucrats, we'd never had a vote on Maastricht or any other significant changes within the #EU
This report is just out: "#Brexit: what we now know" It's a factual report, properly referenced, plenty of sources to follow up.Does what is says on the tin, in a 29 min. read.(Don't shoot the messenger.)#FBPE #StopBrexit2018 By @InstituteGC, here:
Brexit to cost £400bn by 2030. That's more than £350m a week that could be spent on the NHS.Every pound that is lost on Brexit, is a pound that could have been spent on the NHS.Put that on a bus.#Brexit #NHSCrisis
Michael Gove agrees 5yr #Brexit transition period for farmers, guaranteeing the same level of subsidies under the EU's CAP until March 2024  #OFC18
Given polls show a majority of the public now favour a referendum on the Deal v Remain, this shows how out of touch Tory members are on #Brexit 
Whatever you think about Tony Blair's record as PM there can be no doubt this is an excellently argued article by @InstituteGC exposing the painful contradictions at the heart of both Tory and Labour positions on #BrexitWe need to #ExitFromBrexit
I'd have more respect for Tony Blair's argument if he was honest for once in his life and admitted that the neoliberal policies he and Thatcher espoused for 40yrs are the root cause of Britain's problems and that a Corbyn-led government is the answer rather than #Brexit.
#Brexit-induced #inflation shock, the #gbp sharply devalued after the referendum. More at .
If there is likely to be one good outcome of #Brexit, it is freeing ourselves from this pointlessly destructive, monumental waste of public money.
Would have been nice to actually hear what Tony Blair had to say. John Humphrys constantly interrupted and talked over, and obviously had his own pro-#brexit anti-Blair agenda. A terrible display of interviewing. John, it is time to retire.
#Humphrys putting on valiant defence of #brexit again. Can someone at #r4today please explain to him that is NOT his job. And no John, people didn't know exactly what they were voting for, nor did democracy end in June 2016. #StopBrexit
John Humphries, I like you, but this level of interruption is unacceptable. We are ABSOLUTELY entitled to vote on the negotiated deal. People are ALLOWED to change their minds on something so monumentally important #Brexit #bbcr4today
There is legitimate devil's advocacy by balanced journalists and then there is the naked, dismissive, partisan hostility of John Harrumphrys as displayed this morning during his interview of Tony Blair. He has to go #r4today #Brexit
Well. John Humphrys is showing up Tony Blair embarrassingly easily. Seems that Blair = Leave's trump card. #brexit @BBCRadio4
#BBCR4today Humphries: “We’re already the sixth largest economy in the world and set to overtake France” Hang on, we were the *fifth* largest economy in the world before #Brexit. This disaster is taking us *backwards*
Depressing to see some Labour people failing to grasp that if the Tories get their hard #Brexit, then that will be Britain hard-wired as a an ultra-free market economy and Labour will be able to do nothing about it.#StopBrexit #FBPE #StopBrexit2018
Raised the potential border chaos, in Parliament, numerous times, after listening to those who work in the airports and ports, there aren't enough people to cope now, let alone when #Brexit makes much longer border queues inevitable. Tory UKGOV simply ignoring resulting impact 
"GERMANS START TO COUNT COST OF MUTTI’S MIGRANTS" Fascinating full story & analysis from the #Brexit Facts4EU team: 
Is anybody keeping score of how many times over this #Brexit Govt is spending the UK's contribution to the EU?At this rate the Tories will spend 10x our membership dues just to keep us in the same place. You know what that means for the #NHS, don't you? *Nul Pounds*
as someone who voted #Leave I regret it massively and would vote #Remain if we got another vote but I also think we need to stop blaming #Corbyn for #Brexit. Heres why:
The knowledge that my vote for #Brexit helped stop the loathsome Tony Blair's lifelong aim of becoming EU president, is a truly wonderful feeling#r4today
And the @APG_Agroecology have today released the results of their inquiry into #Brexit impacts on food + farming trade, in time for #ORFC18, covered here by @BBCNews
The pound will shake off #Brexit blues and hit $1.50 this year, says ING 
No - it is impossible to divorce #brexit from any of these issues. To pretend it is, is to significantly mislead people who are on limited incomes & who will suffer badly. As people of social conscience we should not even be thinking of doing this. #stopbrexit #FBPE
#Brexit The British, 'permanently offended' Left want to turn us all into humour-less clones, who all think the correct thoughts, 'in the correct way'The EU, EU Commission and associated fascist structures want much the same Thank God we are leaving

Which political party do you think offers voters the most credible #Brexit policy?
UK government considering TPP after #Brexit. Britain voted to leave the EU and be free of TTIP. Immediately surrendering our sovereignty to TPP would make the whole exercise completely pointless. 
The important fact is more people voted leave than remain; as a proportion of votes cast, eligible voters or population, it is the same result. It is not dificult to understand. #Brexit 
Letter @UKLabour MP in Bristol NW.Very pro EU MP.Notifying him that I will not renew my Labour party membership.I joined the Labour due to Brexit but as they are a Brexit backing party I joined the @LibDemsI will vote for any party to stop Brexit.#Brexit#FBPE#FinalSay
Eighteen months on and still waiting to hear/read of the tangible, measurable benefits of #Brexit to the ordinary UK citizen. Maybe one of you could explain.
This is precisely why the " Jobs First #Brexit " espoused by @jeremycorbyn is absolutely bonkers. Brexit will only do one thing and that is to suck public finances into black hole.#StopBrexit2018 #EXITbrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain #FollowBackProEU

Tories are masters of the fogscreen. The outrage prompted by the appointment of the repugnant Toby Young usefully distracts attention from the bigger issues of #Brexit and #NHS. Beware.

Facts dear friends facts. In every region of the world the disparity between rich & poor is accelerating with one exception. Yes the EU. The only major economic region where it is going in the other direction. Why do you think the super rich & right wing want #Brexit? #FBPE

Nigel Farage: #Brexit deal is “humiliation” & hit out those calling it “victory”“It’s victory if you think paying gargantuan sum of money is good thing, if you think giving foreign courts jurisdiction over this country for nearly a decade is good thing”
UK may be looking to join TPP but hard to see how countries like Peru can rival Germany given exports hit a modest £223m in 2015 vs £46.5bn to Germany #trade #Brexit
Tories want UK to leave the world’s biggest market where we shape the rules  to join a smaller one on the other side of the world where we don’t. Bonkers #Brexit 
Never forget...this ultimately is what #Brexit is about...the theft of our rights especially that of being able to take our Govt to an international court if it decides to remove our rights.

Hello @LiamFox. I'll be ignoring your plea to stop criticising #Brexit & will instead be exercising my democratic right to oppose the shambles. I'm calling for MPs to order an immediate referendum to confirm that the 2018 “will of the people” differs from 2016 & then #StopBrexit.
My #Brexit concerns for 2018 in today’s @TheScotsman :
Yes, #Dugin has said that long time ago and #Brexit was heavily interfered by #Russia/n #trolls.
I love BBC World Service. Apart from the fact that they coverage a huge variety of internationally important issues... The external opinions on #Brexit are less insane. It's a shame we have to stay up all night to hear some fact and reason on the radio.  #StopBrexit
Brexit: the broken media - much as Brexit has revealed the fault lines in our political system, it is also demonstrating that the fourth estate is not up to the job. We are being badly let down by a broken media, and are worse off for it...  #Brexit. 
#CarryOnEurope#Brexit related gem from #KennethWilliams 
Keith Starmer finally spells out UK Labour's policy on #Brexit. 
If Labour has "a vision for #Brexit" it has yet to reveal it. "Jobs-first Brexit" is an empty platitude, not a vision. This is probably the main reason it is not doing better in the polls. #Newsnight

The UK’s vote to leave the EU (#Brexit) has sent Britain sliding down a ranking of top destinations for European and non-European workers, research shows.There are fears that if UK businesses can't attract foreign workers the skills shortage will deepen.

Govt’s “weak legal analysis...falls demonstrably & critically short in plugging the post-Brexit rights gap.” My thoughts in @Guardian on #EUCharter #FundamentalRights #Brexit as @Keir_Starmer says Govt analysis “woefully inadequate.”
This is spot on. We urge anyone who has time, to write similar letters to the #BBC demanding that they stop using the term 'Remoaner' as if it is normal. Goebbels would have been proud of this normalisation of a term of abuse, as a propaganda technique. #Brexit #FBPE
As the hard core #Brexit people get more threatening and aggresive so those of us who want to #StopBrexit must become more inclusive, engaging and kind. Hurling insults, even at the Tory party, tempting though it is, is no longer useful.
Great if so but #Remain supporters need to send a strong msg by not voting for Leave backing parties...this is the last real chance to make a protest that really hurts them where it matters.Binding #FinalSay 2018 to Confirm #Brexit or #StopBrexit & save rights & controls!

John Major said "As politics has become more rancorous – I have often thought back to that time, and wondered how we lost that tolerance of opposing views."I seem to remember he told #Brexiteers they were all ignorant ... tolerance personified ? #Brexit 
In light of misleading information exposed, accurate information obtained, a deeper realisation & understanding of the complexities & consequences & because it affects the destiny of millions, it is wise & our duty to reconsider Brexit.#StopBrexit #brexit #remain #leave #fbpe
Making the short trip from Dublin to Belfast. If the Tories and DUP have their way, I'll need my passport for this, which is a psychological disaster for most people on this island. Back to the dark days of the Troubles #Brexit #Border #StopBrexit #brexitshambles #Ireland #FBPE
This is the #Brexit mentality. 
Nigel Farage is coming to Dublin next month to launch the Irexit campaign. 89% of Irish people support our EU membership. Using his own rhetoric, Nigel Farage can fuck off back to where he came from! #Brexit #FBPE #brexitshambles #nigelfarage #StopBrexit #BrexitChristmasMovies pic.twitter.com/UKLlgKwrra
Now that artificially upped immigration numbers have done the job to give us #brexit readjusting statistics post Brexit will also provide illusion of taking back control of our borders. Crafty. 
For once, just once, it would be nice to hear something positive on #brexit from brexiters, and not just the tired, old "you lost, get over it"It's literally all that's left to keep #brexit going, the fact that an impossible fairy tale Brexit was voted for 18 months ago 
John Redwood MP: Freedom is the prize...When we leave the EU our vote to choose an MP & governing party will once again have more power & authority.Brexit also brings us the ability to press them to change, or to change them if they refuse.#Brexit #EU
Leaving the single market and the customs union is more than just consistent with the referendum result. It is an essential part of seizing the opportunities and reaping the rewards that #Brexit can bring.  
Daily, public support for UK fishing industry continues to grow & people now realise industry has been betrayed over past 40-years.“Labour Party are no fishermen’s friend; unless of course, they are French, Dutch, Belgium or Danish fishermen”#Brexit #EU
Only 12% of UK GDP is result of exports to EU, so why should majority of our exporters continue to be clobbered with EU red tape?British goods exported to EU is falling, from 61% in 2000 to under 50% in 2015 & expected to drop to 35% by 2025#Brexit #EU
4) so to you hardliners on #Brexit, we've nothing to say to you.  It's the reasonable majority we're talking to.Happy new year#FBPE #StopBrexit

Former leader of Camden Conservatives joins Lib Dems, cites Brexit  #brexit
Toby Young will now be promoting ‘free speech’ on University campus. Guess that means regular sermons on climate denial, but no #Brexit criticism...

Eyes peeled for M&M (aka Merkel + Macron)flops, the #Brexit phase two rollercoaster ride plus the populists of Italy. My thoughts on potential European surprises 2018.. 
Welcome to 2018 Theresa May, the year where actually most of the country doesn't want you to get on & deliver a good #brexit BC there's only 1 good brexit and that's #stopbrexit. If you don't believe me hold a #finalsay - you'll see! #Stopbrexit2018 #FBPE
China’s new era, #Brexit, U.S.-#DPRK ties, APEC in Vietnam, elections in S. Korea and Kenya…What’s the biggest thing for people around the world in 2017? #TheSpark
Happy new year all! It’s going to be a big 2018 for the #remainernow movement as we work to make it clear to the govt that their #brexit policy is not wanted by so many that voted #leave in #Euref but also those that did not and could not vote! #FinalSayForAll #ExitFromBrexit
#Brexit Brexiters I know you have your reasons and were trying to be helpful. What has really happened is you were used to nudge some bottom lines-Thats all! You helped save billionaires' tax havens from EU regulation. 
Happy New Year and Welcome to 2018! I have a feeling it's going to be anything but Strong and Stable. Election anyone? Second referendum on #brexit? Trump to be impeached? Lets see... 
#Brexit is a fraud on the British people. The deal being done is nothing like what was offered to Leavers in the referendum. I have yet to hear a single benefit to ordinary people. Article 50 may not have been properly triggered. Time to #StopBrexit. #FBPE #a50challenge
Three wishes for 2018: less #Brexit, less #Trump, less #PRI
MASS IMMIGRATION.... Where you ever consulted..? Well I wasn’t. I was never asked if I wanted mass immigration of low IQ men raping and robbing and killing my fellow people #StopIslam #FGM #EU #Juncker #Brexit #StopGlobalists
In 2018, Labour will show how the old political consensus is finished.By aiding #Brexit, we will keep the Tories in power so that they will carry on until 2022, get re-elected and guarantee #Labour will stay out of power, perhaps forever.#HappyNewYear
Want to stop #brexit in 2018?Here’s what you need to do.1. NO.1 of all - e-mail your MP! They hold the power.2. GET ON YOUR FEET. MPs need to know we don’t accept #brexit. Marching makes it clear!3. Make your view VISIBLE. Stick a sticker, windscreen logo? UK NEEDS TO SEE!
I'm a German living in America & I want a United Europe; despite the naysayers all these years the EU turned out to be best thing for Europe. #Brexit threatens this unity. So I ask #TheResistance #FBR movements in America to Unite with the #FBPR #ProEU Movements in Europe
#Brexit has had one brilliant effect - it's mobilised a huge force of activists, campaigning for an open, generous, tolerant Britain. Our movement will be a force for good for years to come. Happy New Year people!#StopBrexit #FBPE

#HappyNewYear 2018 #Brexiteers!May all your #Dreams of a #Hard #Brexit come true!#Britain #WILL #Brexit soon & #GoodRiddance to #Junker and the #Totalitarian #EU#Cheers #NigelFarage & #DavidDavis
2018 is going to be even more messy and complex in all things #Brexit than 2017 was.Whether that’s a good thing or not depends which side of the debate you’re on!

I have been fighting #Brexit for 1200+ days.I have 29145 followers.I am trying to protect the lives of 3.7 million people.684.That's the number of people who have, so far, cared enough to help me with that. You tell me what's wrong here.
56.5% of people in Cornwall voted for the fantasy #Brexit peddled in 2016. Very few people we speak to on the streets of Cornish towns every week now think Brexit will turn out well for jobs, the NHS or investment in Cornwall, And there is strong support for a #PeoplesVote.
“Testiculi ad Brexitam” Bollocks to #Brexit!You know what to do.... 
It's not good enough just to be anti #BrexitWe need to promote the alternative with positivity & hopeAnd make them care enough about what we are set to lose to demand a #PeoplesVote  We must show pride in our #European identity #WeAreEurope 
The way this government is treating EU27 citizens should be regarded as a crime against humanity, considerably less grave than ethnic cleansing, but enough to merit jail sentences and compensation for the victims.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
@YvetteCooperMP captures the feelings of 48%+ of the #UK population right now #Brexit
Any plan involving Norway/Efta was always going to require an incentive for the Efta states. The UK as a committed Efta member could make it in the strategic interests of Norway - but if we're just using them for temporary convenience it's a disruption and an insult. #Brexit

.@BBCNews .@SkyNews .@itvnews Let's not kid ourselves  - #Brexit Britain is just as divided by Nationalism and racism as Trump's#USATime for you to start reporting this awful reality.#FBPE
#Brexit is about a bunch of greedy rich bastards exploiting the fears and grievances of ordinary people to gain themselves a brutal #Brexit which forces Britain to slash the taxes, regulations, workplace rights & welfare that eat into their profits. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Many thanks to @YvetteCooperMP expressing eloquently how we all feel about HM Government’s #brexit preparations. 5 months off and @carolinenokes was absolutely clueless.
Labour ‘confident that its poll rating.... would improve & that they would win power.’Labour would move quickly to strike a deal with the EU focused on protecting jobs.’At best it would be a hung parliament & they want #Brexit .I want a #PeoplesVote
As the sun goes down for a second time on a #Budget2018 that had almost nothing to say about #Brexit beyond a triumphal new 50p coin (and not much more than that to prepare for no-deal), this is the reality we will wake up to again tomorrow.#EndTheChaos
If Tory Brexiters had put their plan for an ultra-free market tax haven economy in a general election manifesto that would have been honest. But instead they've been trying to sneak it in by stealth behind concerns about inmigration and strong borders. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE
That’s how so many of us feel about #Brexit and the ruination of our country 
I'd be more inclined to take this seriously if it wasn't for the fact that Iain's fellow #Brexit travellers in the Tory party are the greatest collection of boil in the bag incompetent rent-a-clowns this country has ever seenGlass Houses & all that 
At this point @BBCPolitics could pull up a clip with @afneil & Penny Mordant, Brexiter MP from over 2 years ago when he asked her "are you seriously saying the intelligence services are wrong and #Brexit won't risk our security?"To which she answered "no, it won't" 
Brexit is 3600 hours away. #brexit
Bit out of date that one.Corbyn has his own #Brexit policy..."Labour will end free movement""Britain *is* leaving the EU""There was a vote, the people decided to leave the EU, I respect the vote"
The 'running down of the UK motor industry' would cost tens of thousands of jobs and devastate communities in the North East and West Midlands in particular.#Brexit will finish the job Thatcher started. #Labour must stand against it and stand up for a #PeoplesVote
This is how I feel every day when I know I am still a bargaining chip in the #Brexit negotiations and the Vote Leave promise of "automatic grant of all existing rights" for @The3Million was undeliverable.
Turns out wishing really hard for unicorns doesn't make them real. #Brexit is an absolute disaster and must be stopped
#Trump and #Brexit: two cheeks of the same rancid arse.
Yes. All properly managed immigration is good immigration. It’s been both essential and positive for the UK for a long time. What’s bad for us is the stirring up of anti immigrant feeling and racism unleashed by the appalling #brexit referendum and monsters like @Nigel_Farage
.@RossSHouston had only 1 min to speak on #Brexit, and @ArjunMittra didn't get to speak at all - particularly poor form from @BarnetTories @barnetcouncil. Don't worry though, we'll carry on raising the issue....
Here's @bbclaurak with a #Brexit update 
This thread  contains a series of quotes from Leo Varakar's predecessor as Taoiseach of Ireland. If you have heard that there has been any change in the Irish government's policy on #Brexit, you heard wrong. 
I'm just gonna say it.SCREW the 17.4 million we keep being told have to be so respected.Don't care about them anymore.If 17.4 million idiots voted to poison the water supply would my family have to go along with that aswell?#FBPE #Brexit #peoplesvote #FinalSay #NoDeal
In Britain we call it #Brexit
This is not new news, this is not fear mongering, this is not remoaning.It’s a statement of the bloody obvious & a sober warning. Let’s minimise the damage & get a #Brexit deal ASAP! 
#Brexit To claim the EU brought about the downfall of Nazism and Soviet Communism isn't only laughable, it's ungracious and deeply insulting to the USA. The federalists are trying to rewrite history says @Nigel_Farage .

NEW PODCAST: @jeremydcape of @SPB_Global and our very own @TaxStew sit down to chat about the various tax issues arising from #Brexit  
Quite evident from this clip that these people haven’t actually risk assessed the impact of ‘no deal’.  Like everyone else, they are crossing their fingers in the hope that some kind of #Brexit deal will be cobbled together.  Thank goodness I have already started stockpiling.

Like #Brexit.  The country voted to Leave the EU and our MPs do not represent the voters.  Every vote counted in the referendum, unlike under FPTP which is used to elect MPs.  See the problem?  We need #ProportionalRepresentation
WATCH: “Tough luck Minister” Caroline Nokes didn’t want to answer any more questions today from me and other MPs about the #Brexit shambles at @ukhomeoffice - perhaps she forgot who she’s accountable to?

Sarkozy in @LePoint on #Brexit  : the EU needs a new treaty which would redefine the rules of the game. “It would allow to say to the British: you’ve refused to continue to be part of the old Europe, let’s build together the Europe of tomorrow”. 
Unbelievable - @BarnetTories flat out refused to debate #Brexit motion I proposed. Did any of them bother to read the LSE report?!

Having your life ruined by ineptitude & a poorly managed government is incredibly frustrating. This isn't just a bad day, it's two + bad years.That's why @theresa_may should resign, her investment in our country has been a pitiful display of unforgivable mismanagement. #Brexit 
Heartening (in a karmic kind of way) to read from a High Court Judge and Lord Justice of Appeal that legal precedent set by @thatginamiller's #Article50 case would introduce hurdles which now make a "#PeoplesVote" on the #Brexit deal nigh-impossible 
Figures given to the HoC Library by @uklabour show that party membership fell by some 24,000 between December 2017 and April 2018. That’ll be JC’s #brexit dividend. @Another_Europe @Remain_Labour @Labour4EU #PeoplesVote #WriteThisWrong
Jaw dropping stuff, when we see a lot of blank faces from decision makers, regarding our boarders after #Brexit#PeoplesVote is now essential
The uncertainty caused by the lack of will amongst our 'elected representatives' to deliver on our democratic vote has hurt our economy.When we get our #Brexit, we'll be expecting a better quality of MP.One who remembers who they work for. 
Jaw dropping. And this can be replayed out with most Government departments (including Treasury) as there seems to be barely any preparation for, or acknowledgement of, the scale of the challenges as we move at pace towards the #Brexit cliff edge #PeoplesVote
Some personal perspective on #Brexit: today I had to cancel an academic commitment abroad in April, because simply put, in event of no-deal, I don't know whether I will be allowed to re-enter if I leave the country.

In ANYTHING we do in life there is a get-out clause or an opt-out option. With everything we purchase, with marriage, with every contract we enter into - a cooling-off period. It makes complete sense and protects us from mistakes. #Brexit should be no different.#PeoplesVote

Imagine the chasm between your inflated self-image and your true competence being so great you cannot conceive that even the direct, catastrophic consequences of your own deranged project could possibly be your own fault. This is the mindset of the high priests of #Brexit.

The Tories never warned us that the side effects of #Brexit would include a depreciated pound and a rise in inflation, and they tricked the country into believing countless false promises. How can we let a PM and Government that deceives continue deciding our future? #PeoplesVote
Nigel Farage - "You go to our European friends and neighbours and treat them as friends and neighbours.“But you say ‘look we are leaving. Now look, guys, this is entirely up to you. If you want we can be grown up about this and have a free trade deal." #Brexit

Bullshit. Not only would it *not* be spend on that, not going ahead with #Brexit means not addressing the systemic political malfunctions that brought us here to begin with - and business as usual definitely won't heal the county. 
Brexit is the political enema we've been waiting for. We have a national crisis of competence in government and the problems are too deep set to resolve without a radical political reboot. It's more important than a Sunderland car factory. #Brexit 
It makes perfect sense: reward those who vote for you and punish those who dont. #brexit is shrinking the state and the money saved is ending up in the pockets of the already wealthy.

#Brexit election rumours are flying around since #Hammond’s  #Budget2018 What will you vote? Write tweet if you’re party isn’t here (twitter only give 4 boxes for polls).
Jeremy Corbyn: Extra £500m announced by chancellor for #Brexit preparation is "not about planning, it's about panic"Live #Budget2018 updates: 
Peace? This is hugely divisive and inflammatory.Prosperity? All studies on #Brexit show we will be poorer. But friends, let's refuse to accept #brexit50p in change or collect them, taking them out of circulation and donating the money to charity.
Told my Italian host parents that the U.K. government are creating a Brexit coin with ‘Friendship With All Nations’ written on it. I’ll tell u what they think once they’ve stopped laughing. . .#brexit #50p #newcoin #joke #notafunnyone #ScottishEuropean #RomyItalia 
Remember the days when the budget was about how many fags you’d have to cut out or pints you could afford on a Friday? #Budget2018 is about just how completely fucked we’ll be as an entire country and whether the facists will totally win. #brexit #peoplesvote
"#Brexit may well go down as one of the greatest & most unnecessary self-inflicted wounds of modern history"RT if you agree with @HillaryClinton...
Throughout history change has happened because we’ve made it happen.Let’s make change happen by demanding a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal:
Still waiting for fiscal Phil to refer to the #Brexit black hole at the heart of his budget.Brexit with, a without a deal, hurts us all in our pockets. And that gimmicky 50p commemorative coin won't change that. #PeoplesVote#Budget2018
I have the #BudgetDay on, but not listening. Seems completely pointless when we're staring at complete economic devastation with hard or No-Deal #Brexit
Economist Ruth Lea - "I would personally say ‘let’s go for a no deal situation - where we actually trade under the tried and tested WTO rules.’"It works for 55% of our trade, why shouldn’t it work for all of our trade?" #Brexit 
The Philip Hammond commemorative #Brexit 50p piece is going to cheer us up no end.#50p #Budget2018 #PeoplesVote
Staggering figure. Just how many police, nurses and teachers could that have paid for? Instead we are wasting billions on #Brexit - shocking. Time for @peoplesvote_uk #NoBrexitDividend #Budget18
Just met a NI member who has serious concerns re a 'No Deal' #Brexit - 60% output exported to ROI- WTO trading would slap on a whopping 50% tariff- one ROI customer already initiated a new supply chain ex GermanyA No Deal Brexit shouldn't be an option for NI businesses
On #BudgetDay it’s appropriate to remind people that @PhilipHammondUK gave the best argument for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Video: 30 seconds. Please share widely. #Budget2018 #Budget #FinalSay
And another #Budget18 idea for #PhilipHammond post #Brexit when we can make our own rules:Goods bought on High st = zero VATGoods bought on Amazon (for example) = 20% VATThat should inform shopping habits
#Labour and #tories are fixed on #Brexit.Brexit will deliver disastrous fascism.Brazil just elected fascist president, universities are being raised as we speak.How can members of these parties change the direction of travel?
Many jokes about #BrexitCoin today. But issuing this at this stage of negotiations shows the utter contempt the Govt have shown to #remain and the majority of the country for two and a half years. #Brexit isn’t even agreed by the Cabinet so why would be celebrate? #shameful

Fun Fact: The number of Brits currently applying for Irish passports in London (80-90,000) is equivalent to the population of Hastings (E Sussex) or 1.5 times the number of Irish born in Ireland in 2016. #Brexit 
#Ford warned recently that if there's a hard #Brexit they'd reconsider their operations in the UK. Now they're sending staff home. They can see this negotiation is going nowhere fast - and it's all becoming increasingly real for their workers #EndTheChaos
A 50p fucking coin to mark the end of our membership of the EU! I will never fucking forgive the fucking politicians who orchestrated #Brexit nor those, who by their fucking cowardice, failed to fucking oppose it. A fucking 50 fucking p fucking coin. Fuck!
Cross-party group of MPs in plot to thwart #Brexit by tabling a 'killer' amendment to demand a second referendum as soon as May comes back with a deal 
Finally, history will rightfully blame #Merkel for letting #Brexit happen. She refused to give #Cameron some flexibility over the control of immigration into the #UK and contributed to the British Brexiteers’ success through the perceived chaos of her refugee policy.

Brexiters wanted to take us back in time... Well done, lads. (It is mostly lads. Only 36% of women are daft enough to back #Brexit.) You're taking us back to a time when we were poorer, when life was grimmer and opportunities more limited.

When all the bluster passes, this is the sort of thing we'll be left with if we crash out with no deal: cancelled operations, delayed diagnoses and long-term hits to staffing numbers. We don't need to do this, and we didn't vote for it #Brexit #EndTheChaos
Who will look after the sick and elderly when #Brexit drives  thousands of EU nationals out of the country, leaving the UK desperately short of care workers? Answer: Families - and overwhelmingly women. @InFactsOrginvestigates:

Those now opposing #Brexit and demanding a "people's vote" strike me as dishonourable, cowardly and selfish. The arrogant assumption was that they are entitled to frame the issue & decide who should govern us. That was shown to be misplaced. This is purely about them saving face.

#BudgetDay Overshadowing everything in the #budget is the cost of #Brexit. The government’s own figures show that ANY kind of Brexit costs a fortune. Imagine what would be possible if we weren’t wasting so much !

Blue passports, the Festival of Brexit, the commemorative #Brexit coin... It's as if these brain-dead nationalists think we're all as susceptible to the power of vacuous, self-congratulatory symbolism as they are.
Screenshot of a message from my mother.The No Deal #Brexit planning is starting in earnest in my parents home!   
I grew up on a council estate in Bermondsey, your typical working class family. I went to school in Peckham, had loads of black mates, some I still know. My wife is Turkish, my mum is Irish. Yet I've been called "far-right" & "xenophobic" on twitter because I voted for #Brexit 
Believe it or not, but the Govt is set announce a 50p coin to mark #Brexit. @thomasbrake said "If the PM was to feature on one face of the coin, the other must of course feature Corbyn, because the catastrophe that is Brexit is very much a joint enterprise." #ExitFromBrexit
Happy Halloween! #Bolsonaro #Trump #Pittsburgh #Brexit #Merkel #Khashoggi @nrc
Simon has perfectly described my situation and how I feel.A #Brexit 50p is a total insult.#StopBrexit
This coin would represent the complete subjugation of this country to the will of your foreign paymaster Rupert Murdoch, so let's call it the "One Murdoch Piece". But, even better, let's give Murdoch a mighty pain in the brexits by having a #PeoplesVote and binning #Brexit!#FBPE
Stepping stones to a superstate: French finance minister calls for a banking union and centralised eurozone 'investment' budget  #Brexit
30% of academics at UK universities are of international origin, bringing essential knowledge & critical skills. Report from @CfSocialScience indicates that no broad subject area is immune to the risk of losing high-quality academic staff post-#Brexit 
In currency news: a new #Brexit 50p has been announced... 
I cannot wait for all the British commentators advising us that #Merkel 's decision not to stand for re-election will change everything about #Brexit . Trust me on this one: it won‘t.
Dear Mr Starmer @Keir_StarmerIf this is true then your 6 tests are meaningless. We are on course for a whatever #Brexit and @UKLabourwill be complicit in whatever happens. The time to act to stop this nonsense is now, before it's too late.
Social care is already suffering a staffing crisis. #Brexit would make it worse by cutting off “low skilled” care workers from the EU.It begs the questions; who will look after our sick and elderly if we leave the EU?#PeoplesVote
Millions of #Remainers are deeply worried about the rise of the far-right, facilitated by #Brexit, which threatens our democratic rights.We don't want cake. Be nice if you could stand in solidarity with us Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn.
‘Several’ WTO members block Britain's attempt to avoid #Brexit chaos by fast-tracking WTO deal. So, let's leave the EU without a legally binding deal & rely on the rest of the world not blocking WTO membership. What could possibly go wrong? #PeoplesVote
Really clever how the new #Brexit 50p is designed with serrated edges for attacking people in the exciting new Mad Max world we’re going into. 
THANK YOU Drs @sarahwollaston @Dr_PhilippaW @PaulWilliamsMP @DrPhillipLeeMP for tabling this #FinalDealReferendum amendment demanding #InformedConsent. Glad to see 100 MPs from across the Commons already support it. Let's please ask ALL our MPs to do so too. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
We're preparing to stockpile food & medicines, seeing billions slashed off economic growth, disrupting investment, weakening our global standing, deterring vital care staff but... hey, we're getting blue passports & now a new 50p #brexit coin

This is why I have steadfastly maintained a positive, pro European narrative from the beginning. & why I try so hard to communicate the benefits of Remaining with my #24ReasonstoRemain booklets to compliment the overriding negative narrative about #Brexit 
1/I think @DeborahJaneOrr makes a really important point. It's pointless telling people they were wrong to vote for #Brexit & they should think again without selling them the positives of the alternative. People need to know what the EU did for them to realise the cost of #Brexit 
Brexit (not just a no-deal #Brexit) will be a disaster for #SocialCare sector, leaving women at a particular disadvantage, argues @lucianaberger :
Sarah Smith nipping at Barroso for the EU to 'change its position' in #Brexit negotiations on #r4today - genuinely, why should it? It's been very clear for years, well before Brexit vote.
The list of benefits from #Brexit just keeps growing:- Crap looking 50p coin- A village fete of Brexit on the South Bank- Blue passports printed by a French company Pathetic.#PeoplesVote #stopbrexit
It is the #Budget today, it would be great if the Treasury actually announced some preparation for #Brexit, you know, things like tariffs, VAT etc.i mean, its 5 months away, and @PhilipHammondUK has actually said very little, if anything, about real preparations #Budget2018

After #Brexit everyone born in Northern Ireland will have Irish citizenship and continuing EU rights and protection. So what’s all this nonsense from the DUP about ‘wanting no difference from the rUK?’
Nish speaks the truthTory #Brexit is a living hell 
So now we have 2 #brexit benefits:1 a blue passport we could have had anyway.2 a commemorative „50pence brexit coin“ that’s now worth 20% of what it was worth pre-referendum.Jesus wept what a country. 
On Budget Day we take a #Brexit look at EU's 2017 expenditure. MPs didn't even get a vote on that - meaningful or otherwise. A must-read:

Doctors across parties in Parliament want the #Brexit deal to be subject to a #peoplesvote once we know what we’re signing up for. The deal won’t fulfil Leave campaign promises. So it would be wrong to proceed without #InformedConsent based on the facts
If I am wrong about #Brexit you can laugh at me and call me a fool. If you are wrong then you must face criminal charges. 'Respect for the vote' is no defence.
Desperately sad for #Brazil, #America and the looming disaster of #Brexit We live in dangerous times.

UK served A50 notice to #leave. Gina Miller aided that by insisting it became law after parliamentary vote rather than executive authorisation. The withdrawal act 2018 repeals the European communites act 72. The EU is expunged on 29 mar 2019. That’s the law! #PeoplesVote #brexit 
With threats to food supplies, fears of medecine shortages and the potential for tens of thousands of job losses; the UK Government is to launch a new #Brexit 50p coin. This must be what the Tories mean by 'getting on with the day job'.

Frightening possibility! UK voted for @UKLabour and @Conservatives in GE17 because they said they would deliver #Brexit we now know they were lying again. Please support @UKIP in any election, FPTP is unfair, but if enough people believe YOU can make a difference.

The world is broken. The rise of the far right should worry us all. Nothing is going to change until we admit that our systems are broken. The rich are getting richer while more and more people live in poverty. Nope, it's not 1918, it's 2018! Depressing eh? #Brexit #Trump
This government is way ahead of you in the polls. Just think on that. You are taking the country down by providing no opposition to #brexit. So don’t try and occupy moral high ground that doesn’t exist. Your colleagues and members distrust you #peoplesvote x

Our petition calling for the next #Labour manifesto to pledge a #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain is only 7 days old. We are already at nearly at 7,000 signatures.#Brexit could collapse this govt at any time. We need to be ready for all scenarios 
Just to recap.Scenarios proposed so far: minus plus plus Any of the above with extras Max fac Transition No transition Bespoke No dealWhich of these #Brexit options exactly is the "will of the people"?
So the 20-odd countries that have objected to the UK's proposals to trade under WTO rules in the case of a no-deal #Brexit include the United States, China, Russia, Australia and New Zealand.This is all going splendidly.
Please can people remember May's words: #Brexit means #Brexit. All #Brexits will be TERRIBLE, just in different ways and/or speeds. "Deal", "hard", "soft", "jobs", "red, white & blue" are all euphemisms for "backward, nationalistic, populist, racist, xenophobic" #Brexit.
And there it is - the paternalistic left who think the plebs need saving from themselves. The very evil that made me vote for #Brexit
We could be seeing the end of the establishment @Conservatives and @UKLabour as a electoral force in our country. What with so many disgruntled politicians on all sides of the fence with splits in both party’s sooner rather than later it’s bound to happen. #Brexit
The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has found that EU staff in 19 out of of 36 #NHS Trusts in #London make up more that 10% of total staffing, with the lowest percentage being 5.7%. Yet only few NHS Trusts have made any #Brexit preparations so far, with staff #InLimbo
Pls RT @The3Million @BBCBreaking . #brexit puts #citizensrights in peril for #Europeans living working in #UK and #Brits  in #EU. Words not good enough. Rights need #ringfencing. We are one of #5million
Why all the angst about a ‘second referendum’! We want a 1st legal, fact based #Brexit referendum that treats the UK electorate with a modicum of intelligence. The electorate of the United Kingdom (#Leave and #Remain) deserved better than the 2016 debacle. We still do. #FinalSay
We need to sit down and discuss the future of our country rationally and that cannot be achieved while people are mud slinging and focusing their attention on applying blame. Refusing to see the hurt and pain and reasoning of Brexiters is just as inhumane. #Brexit #Peace

Once upon a time in the green & pleasant lands of UK, U could work 40hr/wk, your partner didn’t have 2 work & U retired @ 60 with a pension. Now 40hr/wk is not enough 4 rent & food with dual incomes & I doubt we'll ever retire.What happened? Blair,Brown & the EU happened! #Brexit

If you read one article on #Brexittoday, make it this superb piece by @NickCohen4 "The #Labour movement was founded to represent the interests of the working class. Brexit is shaping up to be the biggest disaster for the working class since Thatcherism"
Imagine if we were to stay in the EU now after all. We would be an even better member than before. The whole country - including MPs - is so much more clued up on the trade deals and parameters of EU membership. We would take a national interest that did not exist before. #brexit
So you're in the minority again Sarah. Polls show the people don't support a second referendum and you have shown MPs don't. Remember you were elected on a manifesto commitment to deliver full Brexit. Clearly you can't be trusted #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StandUp4Brexit
Labour MP David Lammy accuses #Brexit voters of being xenophobic, nationalistic & fascist. Yet it’s not them threatening & vandalising signs/stands of other political groups, protest marching with vulgar posters or linking Brexit to every catastrophic prediction or heinous event. 
Astonishing. For the avoidance of doubt - the NHS will *not* get £350m a week after #Brexit - they were fibbing. There is no Brexit dividend. 
#Brexit is NOT the reason for Uncertainty in the UK today, Remainers, deliberately undermining the future of Britain are deliberately damaging the UK economy in an attempt to reverse public opinion on Brexit.Their treachery is obvious, dangerous & real.
Remainers didn't learn a thing in 2016. #Brexit

The people who should really suffer the dire consequences of #Brexit are not the poor (& poorly educated) but the fat-cat politicians like Boris Johnson who have deliberately spread misinformation and weaponsied lies. They are much better cushioned from those consequences, though 
There's a UK election next week & Labour scrape a win... So. #Brexit. We want a Brexit that satisfies these 6 tests. No can do. Unicorns. We already sold it to voters. What is this? 2016? You need us more than we need you.  We'll walk away. Get out!

So brexiters #brexit is backed by Vladimir Putins Russia a hostile foreign power with the intention of damaging Britain. So either Putin is a fool or you are
#Brexit is like a #PremierLeague side wanting to be relegated, says @williamkeegan #MOTD
WW2 is often citied in #Brexiteer quibbling; but #Brexit actually reverses the outcome of WW2.It revives the supremacist delusions of the 3rd Reich.It satiates an egotistical imagined history to justify a reactionary future.It invokes autocracy.We will resist.It will end.
Don’t forget the clocks go back tonight huns and then they’ll go back another 40 years on the 29th March 2019 #Brexit #ClocksBack
Another attempt by this appalling government to silence dissenting voices. For the first time in living memory, and probably much longer, we have a government that shuts down democracy whenever it finds it inconvenient & has the power to to suppress it.#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Hello, motor industry workers of Swindon, Birmingham, Sunderland, Oxford, Essex & elsewhere in the UK. Did you vote to leave the EU? If so you might like to hear what the main Leave economist Prof Minford thinks will happen to your jobs post #Brexit #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
There is NO such thing as EU money - EU has NO money of it's own!EU budget money is from nation state contributions of which UK taxpayers contribute about £10+ Billion.#Brexit will allow UK to cut out the Brussels middleman & pay subsidies direct to UK farmers & businesses.#EU
‘ What we are witnessing may be a nation, not just going into economic recession but a regression into political or cultural infantilism. The centre ground of politics has completely disappeared; the mad, the bad and the fools are now in charge.’ #Brexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE
It's great to see MPs on both sides of the #Brexit divide hold public meetings to answer questions from their constituents. @SteveBakerHW held a meeting yesterday, @heidiallen75 held one today (video below).RT  to your MP if you also would like one.
Apparently Mr. Corbyn will take us back to the 70s.. This from a tory govt that will destroy workers rights/human rights, aided and abetted by the MP for the 18th century Jacob Rees-Mogg, if you support #Brexit, you are helping the vulture capitalists get rich, as we get poorer
Nigel Farage - "Now Italy is beginning to realise that you cannot be a democratic nation and a member of the EU. "I’ve said it before, I’ll say again, it is only a matter of time before this breaks up. And the betting is Italy will do it." #Italexit #Brexit 
It doesn’t get mentioned enough but the reason so many people are advocating a #PeoplesVote on the final deal is because the #brexit campaign promised the UK would be better off out but this deal is shite compared to EU membership.
You don't get it either. Whether there's a #Brexit or not is irrelevant. Millions of us won't vote for either party if they've backed it. If that means Labour loses...tough. It will be Labour's fault for ignoring us & supporting this #BrexitShamblesPS It was c. 3/4 of a million
The #Brexit supporter tribes! 
In 6 months we can stop Brexit, put this country back on a sound economic path, start restoring the nation's reputation, and shatter the Tory party. We can do all that, but only if Mr Corbyn and 99% of Labour MPs commit to getting a #PeoplesVote. #Brexit #StopBrexit
These NDAs are yet another #Brexit assault on our democracy. MPs and voters need to be well-informed to make reasoned decisions. The government is cynically denying them that information. #PeoplesVote #FBPE
Nigel Farage: Italy is stuck inside a German-dominated currency that's done their country no good at all.Now beginning to realise cannot be a democratic nation & member of #EUOnly a matter of time before EU breaks up!Betting is Italy will do it!#Brexit
Should the #EU fail I sincerely believe that it will usher in a #populist #fascism that will destroy the precarious #liberal #democracy we have attempted to nurture since 1945 and that those that led #Brexit will be at the vanguard of this alt right renaissance.
I was one of those ingI may only be 1 voice, 1 vote, 1 pair of feet.. but my #Brexit bonanza has been joining forces with the most wonderful, vibrant, knowledgeable, compassionate, vociferous, loving, caring, determined army of people I could ever imagine.  7/
A little thread on MY personal Brexit "Dividend" I have been waiting patiently & with barely baited breath for someone.. anyone to provide a single benefit to me & mine of #Brexit.. The question has been asked of many MPs & talking heads on both sides of the debate…1/
#Brexit has already caused 2.1% damage to GDP (we've dropped from the top to the bottom of the G7). To put this into context 2% GDP = £440million per week.... We've already suffered more economic damage than the "BrexitDividend" that #Boris promised us! #Brexit: #Isitworthit? NO!
John Redwood: Well done Chris Grayling!Transport Secretary went to Calais & nailed Project Fear lie Calais to mount economic blockade or go slow on UK goods.Mayor of Calais made clear they value UK trade & will ensure port runs smoothly after #Brexit#EU

A positive but cold afternoon on Slough's Farnham Road with the #Brexitometer.Most Slough people think #Brexit isn't going well and that they aren't going to benefit from it.We need a #PeoplesVote to resolve the mess the government has created.
There was no “Lie” on the side of the bus. It didn’t say we will GIVE £350million to our nhs, it said “let’s fund our nhs instead” #NotFakeNews #Brexit 
It was the cynical lie on the side of the VoteLeave bus that swung the referendum result, but most #NHS staff & scientists know that #Brexit is bad for health, science & research. That’s why four 4 current & former clinicians will be leading the final deal referendum amendment
It is not a myth.It is an outright lie.They knew it was a lie, and still told it.They know we know it is a lie, and they still tell it.#Brexit is a scam. We want to #StopBrexit and #RemainInTheEU, @eucopresident,@MichelBarnier, @guyverhofstadt.
This man does not want The People to have the benefits he has and will do anything, including harming the UK, to stop you. Let’s STOP HIM by stopping #Brexit 
The all powerful Jamie Oliver could easily stop #Brexit with a flick of his power. Instead he is too busy culturally appropriating rice and trying to stop kids being fat. I suspect he has gone far-right.

Given the impact it will have on the economy you can't support  #Brexit and at the same time support putting more funding into teaching or any public service. Labour are talking dangerous mince. 
Conservative leaders who love the EU more than their party have in the past lost their jobs. Theresa May should learn the lessons of history, and show some backbone against the bullies in Brussels. #Brexit

So today marks 29 years since I rode my CitroenBX into Camden town, after a long drive from Germany. Two weeks before the wall came down in Berlin and no one had an inkling. And now #Brexit and I feel I have lost my home all over again.
Apparently the Royal visit to Tonga is 'especially important' for a future trade deal with the U.K.  Tonga - population just over 103,000 - will that replace our losses from #Brexit - or will it be of as much value as a chocolate fire guard? You decide #PeoplesVote

OK I’m kind of seeing a slight flaw in the argument “#brexit is the will of the people and we can’t have a #PeoplesVote because it will show that it no longer is” but I might just need to lie down for a minute.
Hey @BBCScotlandNews I see the UK govt consultation about trade with USA ended today. Thanks for telling Scotland’s public absolutely nothing about this. Zilch. You are an utter disgrace to independent news reporting and best described as ‘Courtesans’ not journalists.  #Brexit
Ten reasons that justify the UK’s decision to leave the European Union:  #Brexit
In 2016, 17.4 million people voted to take back control of our money, laws, borders & trade from the EU. They voted for a better future. We have so far failed to achieve the full #Brexit we voted for. This must change. Britons never, never, never shall be slaves. #StandUp4Brexit

Not just in Ireland, but across Europe & further afield @tconnellyRTE is peerless in his coverage of #Brexit Public service broadcasting at its finest  
To say that a #PeoplesVote would be divisive is a now a moot point. That horse has bolted. The greatest danger of further and longer lasting division is when brexit enevitablebly fails to deliver and gap between wealthy and poor widens still. #EndTheChaos #FBPE#brexit #NoDeal
This is a ridiculous state of affairs and the Government was warned this would happen. #Brexit has got to stop. Fixed it for you Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn.
Will @BBCScotlandNews #GMS cover a huge #Brexit story that broke yesterday: namely that the WTO has rejected UK application to join after veto from many countries inc NZ & USA. Will @LiamFox or any UK government minister be asked about this? Editors decided you don’t need to know

Schoolgirls on #Brexit: ‘The adults are not thinking straight’ - spoke to six kids who live at the Border in Crossmaglen, Co Armagh (one lives right on the Border) to hear what they think of the UK leaving the EU & how it might affect them - @IrishTimes 
Everyone should watch this remarkable @SiCarswell video w/school girls in Crossmaglen, on Irish border. One girl literally lives on border. The kids are streets ahead of British politicians, and understand so well #brexit risks.  
Tony Abbott nailed the #IrishBorder red herring in this @spectator article."How to save #Brexit".
@carolecadwalla is spot on. Unless we know how the referendum was won we don’t know whether the result can stand. I think you would agree that an anti-democratic #Brexit is a disaster for us all. Please make this your first job at Facebook, @nick_clegg
The EU dictating - What if Remainer MPs were denied a 'meaningful vote' on the budget on Monday? Read our #Brexit wake-up call here: 
Okay. So 1) You'll find it's my democratic right to "stamp my foot" and protest - don't need to go to Africa to do so. 2) #Brexit is wholly undemocratic because #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw & won with a restricted voter franchise + the result was advisory only. 3) we need a #PeoplesVote
What the EU & remainers really fear is Britain making a success of #Brexit. Nations around the world far smaller & less powerful than the UK thrive outside the EU. Once we Brexit & we succeed not only will remainers have no chance of making us rejoin but the EU will disintegrate! 
Dear #HIGNFY. Last Saturday ranks as one of my most favourite waste of time moments. I met so many fantastic time wasters there. All very much in favour of reversing our least favourite waste of time, #Brexit. Just thought you ought to know. Funny show apart from that.
Waiter in town (#Leicester) recognised me from my political activities and said “I won’t ever be voting for your lot again after the #Brexit stitch up”Feeling amongst working class floating voters is certainly hostile re: Chequers. Let’s hope it’s not too late to change course.

The thing about the EU is that power only ever travels one way. Once the EU has the power it never gives it back and we have already given it the power to accumulate more by stealth - for those few instances where our own politicians wouldn't gladly hand it over anyway.#Brexit

"The governments own impact assessment show that we will be worse off under any #Brexit scenario" says @Anna_Soubry on @BBCAnyQuestions and politely offers a heckler to go through them with him. It's time to admit that Brexit is not in the national interest and act on it.
#Brexit has facilitated xenophobic racist thuggery, will of the people innit? 
You'd think it was pretty obvious that 2 years isn't nearly enough time for a large, complex economy to undertake the preparation needed to remove itself from its continent's integrated political and economic union without causing huge damage. They fluffed #Brexit from the start.

This can't be true.For years leavers have insisted that UK merely has "to fall back on WTO rules" if it leaves the EU.It's almost like people campaigning for #Brexit had not the slightest idea what they were talking about.
It remains baffling that there are those who champion #Brexit over the continued existence of the UK itself. What do they think the first two letters of 'Brexit' stand for...?#EndTheChaos
I think it’s the casual arrogance with which he coolly suggests we run down thousands of jobs that makes my blood boil. This guy is THE ONLY ‘economist’ who supports #Brexit. And at the launch of his “plan”...Let’s #StopBrexit - we don’t have to do this...

When a referendum has a 52-48% split, you can't talk of the will of the people, you odious shit! In 2016, you said that if Remain won narrowly, you would demand and expect an immediate 2nd referendum. Your part in this sorry affair (#Brexit) will be remembered. Not in a good way.
.@jeremycorbyn had been lying and @UKLabour did and still does nothing. There are still a lot of Labour MPs I consider decent, not to mention the over 80% of Labour members who also want a #PeoplesVote. I say decent on purpose because #Brexit is a deeply indecent concept. /3

While I have every sympathy for the fishing community I'm not going to risk the future of my children and grandchildren because of pleas by a Tory-led fishermen's union. There are more things to worry about with #Brexit than fishing.
The President of the Hautes-de-France region (which includes Calais) hits back at claims they'll institute a go-slow after #Brexit. On the contrary, they're talking about using a FastPass like a system trialled in Austria

Not necessarily #Brexit itself, but the impossible and destructive fantasy that has been sold to the people as if it were something virtuous is extremism popularised.It's not extreme to want to leave the EU, but it is to want to do it at any cost, in a manner that harms people.
When you underfund the #NHS, it loses capacity. This opens the door to the increasing privatisation of the service. It’s one of the many mechanisms of privatisation that this Government is using to undermine our public services. #Brexit will accelerate these processes

Strong new data shows demand for British services abroad is growing. Service exports up 6.9% on this time last year to £286 billion #Brexit will strengthen this trend.  
If no-deal #Brexit: flights grounded, City of London decimated, food & medicine shortages, martians to land! Maybe. But daily coverage reminds me of #Y2K bug hysteria, where change to the new millennium was expected to wreak global havoc, but in reality had little affect at all!
Govm't guidance on how to prepare for a #Brexit no deal can be summed up as "All the things we denounced as project fear will happen". You've had 6 months notice UK business, so if it all goes wrong it will be your fault. Don't say you weren't warned. #PeoplesVote perhaps?
Reminder: #Brexit is a xenophobic UKIP project by tax dodging elites to destroy workers/environmental protections, to escape EU tax avoidance rules, also to sell off the NHS to US corporations and UKLabour should be ashamed of being part of . It makes us… 
French PM Charles De Gaulle opposed ENGLAND'S membership of EEC’s around 1960. He knew ENGLAND would eventually try to control EU or try to destroy it from within. UK's attempts to join was ignored in 1961 & 1963He died 1970. UK joined 197360 years later #BrexitHe was right!
#OnThisDay 899. Death of Alfred the Great.We could do with his sort now.Law maker. Educator. Held the line and eventually made peace with difficult continental neighbours.#History #Brexit 
I'm glad to see #Brexit is going so well.Not only have the remaining 27 EU countries capitulated and bent the knee, but all 164 WTO member states have unanimously agreed to let the UK rule the world for old times sake.I love it when decades of meticulous plans come together.
.@TonyAbbottMHR: “The EU’s palpable desire to punish Britain for leaving vindicates the Brexit project... Britain has nothing to lose except the shackles that the EU imposes on it.” #Brexit #auspol

Frank Field standing shoulder to shoulder with Farage, Murdoch, Mogg, Trump, Putin, May, Gove, Redwood, IDS, Dacre, Dorries et al. And shamelessly parroting their deceitful far-right propaganda. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Well done @andreajenkyns on a brilliant performance on tonight's #bbcqt - thank you for always standing up for #Brexit!! 
Even if temporarily, you need to ditch your party loyalty to Labour. I have. There'll be a post-Corbyn Labour to return to. For now, #Brexit is the overwhelming issue. You don't prescribe an Asprin when there's blood spurting out. 
Well said by @HannahB4LiviMP on #Brexit  "whatever you voted, I bet you didn't vote for this shambles". #bbcqt
"You say you are patriots Andrea, but they have shown they are willing to burn this country to the ground to impose Brexit". #bbcqt #Brexit 
“I despair. We should all work together to make #Brexit work” says #BBCQT audience member. But it’s not that simple is it. It’s a complex mess with various highly politically charged “solutions”. I despair of the general level of understanding of #Brexit
I've just seen the love child of Michael Gove on #bbcqt, he's called Sebastian Payne, then you hear Andrea (let's go over the #Brexit cliff) Jenkyns promoting either Boris Johnson/David Davis as the next PM, what did we do so wrong to deserve these people? Please god rescue us.
Great to see @andreajenkyns on #bbcqt. She is eviscerating the hardline #Brexit cause with her inept performance

Northern Ireland and the Republic already have different duty and VAT on fuel. Is it checked at the border? NO! Spot checks are done elsewhere to combat smuggling. Does it violate the GFA? NO! Same quality on traded goods are NOT central to the GFA @Femi_Sorry #Brexit 
Come on Mrs May, wipe the grins off the faces of your backstabbers, knock the wind out of the #Brexiters & #Lexiters & just for once put UK 1st; forget the stubborn technocrat.Fess up, admit the #Brexit BS & offer a #PeoplesVote with a #Remain option!Reputation Win People Win!
The #Brexit robbery is a crime too far. We have to ensure we win this fight for our children’s future. It’s all that matters right now. And we are at the crunch point.
Good to see @nealerichmond today in @ScotParl and to discuss the ongoing chaos of #Brexit which is a source of huge difficulty for both our nations.  Ireland however has the steadfast support of the other #EU26 and the normal powers of independence
Height of hypocrisy here: "Settlements no one voted for, that aren't in our country's best interests being forced through without informed consent.:That's what happened with every European treaty from when we joined but none of these remoaners said a word about that!#Brexit

‘We didn’t starve.’ No, but my father’s family - my grandparents and my aunt who was 19 - were all killed in that conflict by a direct hit from a V1 and anyone who tells me I should square up to a self-inflicted #Brexit like my father squared up to Hitler has my utter contempt.
Question: how many young people have got £100000 to spare...?  It's not worth paying a penny for #Brexit... The #EU on the other hand is well worth it's membership fee...

We don’t need a phoney #PeoplesVote. We need to push for what people actually voted for – #Brexit, rather than a bodged-up, half-cocked Remain by another name, says Mick Hume
The UK used to be able to strike bilateral air services deals. Without a treaty, without debate in parliament, without public debate, the ECJ decided it was an exclusive EU competence.  The EU is a silent thief of power, not a democracy.#Brexit

From "the easiest trade deal in human history" to "we can't even trade under WTO rules."#Brexit UK is screwed.
For some people lack of essential medicine can have serious consequences, even death. I wonder if the #Brexit leaders have considered that and decided how many deaths are an acceptable price to pay for their Brexit

The #Brexit non-disclosure agreements are just one of the ways in which the government has subverted democracy in its fanatical attempt to force #Brexit through. Democracy demands a #PeoplesVote.
#AftertheMarch I knew I wasn’t alone in my passion to #remain. Millions shared my belief #Brexit is not the answer. Yet as the week’s gone on, I realised many people hadn’t a clue about the march. We have to work harder to break out of our bubbles. To talk and debate locally
EXCITING NEWS: Our #IsAnyoneListening podcast is launching next week, bringing together speakers with a lived experience of poverty to share their views on #Brexit and what their lives will look like after we leave the EU. Look out for more info next week. #PovertyAfterBrexit
Raab and the Tory Brextremists have invented this story in a cynical attempt to blame the French for no-deal chaos & shortages, and to whip up hate against our democratic EU allies. They might as well be working for Putin.#PeoplesVote #Brexit
The reason that the #EU is driving a hard bargain is simply this: they fear that #Brexit will set a good example and the whole 'project' will collapse
There is nothing about #brexit that is worth all the damage. Correct me if I’m wrong.
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "The backstop of the Irish border is not a question raised by the Brexiteers, it was a question raised by the EU. "It’s hung by the highest order and Donald Tusk knows it is. I think he’s having a joke." #Brexit 
Grand theft #Brexit Parliamentary Edition. 
It's saved my life twice in the past 10 years so obviously not.  They're a bunch of top notch professionals for whom I have the highest possible regard.   Does the NHS need more funding? Of course but #Brexit will put paid to that thanks to the @ScotTories
My speech in the #EuropeanParliament on the #Brexit deadlock and the growing demands for a #PeoplesVote :

#McDonnell disastrous interview.On #Brexit option for PV said ‘All options remain on the table.’ - non answerHumphreys: ‘That’s like having no policy isn’t it?’ Ouch.Why is #Corbyn so quiet on EU. Last 85 tweets only 2 have been about brexitListen
This is right. Every MP who has publicly supported Brexit should step down if predicted problems arise. If they are certain that #Brexit is the right thing for their constituents this should not be an issue. If they are wrong they must be re-elected.I want a #PeoplesVote
This is undoubtedly correct but with unlimited backstops and transitions we won't be delivering Brexit and that opens the door for Jeremy Corbyn to take us back to square 1#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit #ChuckChequers

Brilliant to join @bbc5live in person today, chatting to listeners and presenters on Breakfast and Drive about how close we may (or may not be) to a #Brexit deal this autumn. Thank you for having me #Salford #mediacity
#Brexit shafts our country, our people and our fellow EU citizens. On every level. We don’t have to do it. #remain is still an option and I will support everyone who is fighting to keep that on the table. It’s that simple. I will do all I can to #StopBrexit 
Any #Brexit deal that doesn't match what was promised in 2016 requires the #InformedConsent of the people via a new public vote.Please help us get this message through to our MPs by donating to the #C4PV campaign:
Lords @DExUKgov minister Callanan says a Commons vote for a #PeoplesVote would not be binding on the govt. So much for #Brexit being about an increase in UK parliamentary sovereignty!
I cannot overstate immense danger of the handover of our military to EU military unification. This is not something planned for the future - it's happening now as the public is lied to & distracted with the theatre of #Brexit  Emergency Briefing Totnes Devon Please spread word 
Talks with EU are deadlocked over how to keep the border open. Yet Dominic Raab has not visited the Irish border since becoming Brexit Secretary.Excuse my language, but Jesus F* Christ, do you know how colonial this is? Have you learnt NOTHING?#Brexit 
"Committees have a job to do. Lack of engagement from Govt, keeping us in the dark, means we can’t do that job. #Brexit was meant to be about enhancing the role of Parliament, not diminishing it.” 'Control' has been 'taken back'. But not by Parliament...
If you have a business and are concerned about the outcome of the #Brexit negotiations, you deserve to make your voice heard. Make sure you write to your MP to #WriteThisWrong

Best for Britain, Best for Doncaster, People’s Vote supporters staged an emergency protest outside my office today against trying to get any #Brexit Deal. Three men turned up but not the organiser. Unconfirmed if any from Don Valley. 
#Brexit explained... 
Hang on!#Brexit Ultras told us the UK held all the cards and a winning hand.They said the EU was an incompetent decaying corpse (led by drunks).They said the EU needed us more than we need them.How is it possible such a corpse can now 'bully' the mighty 'Great' Britain? 
This is why I left the @Conservatives & joined the @LibDems:1. A dangerous hard right #Brexit.2. Hostility towards immigrants.3. Their lurch to the right.4. A 'them & us' attitude.RT if you agree...@LibDems @LibDemPress @Femi_Sorry @acgrayling @ThatTimWalker @GaryLineker
I PLEDGE NOT to vote for either @Conservatives or @UKLabour in the next forthcoming General Election because..They always put themselves and Brussels first. Very few stand up for Britain and it's people and most have completely ignored the 17.4m who voted #Brexit. VOTE @UKIP !
In the name of democracy, Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn leader of the opposition, respects a vote achieved by cheating and breaking the law. Fine.Respect my democratic right to oppose his position concerning #Brexit. I am criticising the policy, not the man.
Hard to know where to start with this… the @Telegraph has carved its place spreading disinformation and lies about the EUThis is like McDonald’s saying “the problem with the young these days is obesity…” #Brexit

Just been paid aff...Christmas should be great this year for my wains eh? Cheers to all who voted for #Brexit!Fuckin dicks!!!
Considering the lack of progress the Conservatives have made in two years of negotiations, do you think Theresa May should step aside to allow Labour to agree a deal with the EU and deliver #Brexit?Please RT after responding

Richard Tice - "I founded Leave means Leave, we have a slogan. No deal, no problem, and no money."That’s the reality. If we have no deal we’re not going to pay £39bn unless our negotiators are incredibly weak and that really concentrates the minds of the EU." #Brexit

Dominic Raab has just said in Parliament that a no deal #Brexit will be the fault of @UKLabour, his fucking party called the referendum, they're negotiating, they own #Brexit, it's their baby, but let's not blame him for the impending disaster, it's #Labour and the EU, fuck off.

John Humphrys (75), anchor of self-described “flagship” @BBCr4today says @peoplesvote_uk is “ludicrously named”, after 700k marched to call for one on Saturday. Time he went - and time for informed consent by UK public on #Brexit At 3’03” here 
Just asked the #Brexit minister how many of the #EU’s 37 free trade agreements that we currently benefit from, the Govt has got agreement to retain after 29/3/19 in the event of no deal. Answer = 0
We’re #prosecutingBrexit with @MarcusJBall! Monday 29th October, 6pm, ELG03 - This is a conversation you won’t want to exit #cityunilawsoc #brexit 
At least #Brexit will teach Brits a salutary lesson in how power and control really works when you have a choice between being a little island dependent on imports and exports or a large bloc that isn’t. Still time to grow up, apologise and #exitbrexit though.
"A blind #Brexit is damaging our business and our international stance." Read why the facts on #Brexit has changed and we need a #PeoplesVote:
A new @IpsosMORI poll has revealed that 78% of Brits lack confidence in @theresa_may getting a good #Brexit deal.That's over three quarters of the population! 
People voted to leave the EU in the full knowledge that negotiating our exit would not be easy – Brussels would want to deter any other EU country from going down the same road:  #Brexit
Now that it looks like #Brexit is definitely happening the only thing I’m looking forward to is going from ‘Remainer’ to ‘Reminder’. Ten years from now I’m never gonna tire from giving it “I told you this was gonna be nightmare!” 
Except for viewers in Scotland, and indeed the U.K. Lets stop the #Brexit madness. #PeoplesVote #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
Russia blocks the UK's post-#Brexit tariff proposal at the WTO. Yet another way in which #Brexit is undermining our sovereignty, and making us more dependent on brutal and corrupt regimes.#PeoplesVote
Please @theresa_may, get this #Brexit malarkey done & finished.If for no other reason other than to shut this incessant whining from @SkyNews & @BBCNews up for one bloody day.
The Remainers’ caricature of Leave voters is wrong and shows they still fail to understand why people backed #Brexit 
If you voted for #Brexit and are angry that you were lied to, and are angry at the loss of each & every business, organisation & joint initiative, please show your anger by becoming a #RemainerNow and joining the ever-growing call for a #PeoplesVote.We can still #SaveBritain.
Why do I think Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn has some responsibility for #Brexit? For:not opposing #Brexit.not saying he doesn't think it's in the best interests of our country.suggesting that his idea of #Brexit will be.not supporting a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain.
If they'd reported in a more balanced way before #Brexit ref we might not even be talking about project fear now 
#brextremists they just wanna make a beautiful world ugly. The country is now uglier than it was. There is still beauty as shown by those marching last weekend but the #brexit MPs, ugly people with ugly souls spending their time puking ugliness on our green and pleasant land
John McDonnell @BBCRadio4 stating we have to respect the Ref but keep all options on the table...would not clearly state 'yes' to allowing a Stop #Brexit #Remain option..ME: You can't state you're respecting the Ref result w/o ruling out a chance to reverse it.He backs #Brexit
BREAKING: Fury as Germany must pay BILLIONS more to the EU after #Brexit£13.2 Billion PA + the predicted £20 Billion PA for Merkel's pets. Suck it up Germany, you deserve everything coming your way.
So this goverment in order to settle an internal argument in their own Party has screwed everything up up so badly we need " war-time preparations" in peacetime. If you stand back even half a metre from #Brexit you can't help noticing what total absurd madness it is. 
I’ve woken up to @BBCr4today for years. I love John Humphreys and like Robinson. But their liberal left, gender obsessed, anti #Brexit agenda is nauseating. No wonder @NickFerrariLBC show is booming.
I'm on my way to an event with the Information Commissioner where she is presenting her report on #Brexit cheating in Brussels. We need to ensure this is the last time we see Democracy DisruptedI'll be live tweeting
Many #Brexit scenarios have been discussed some with widespread support. But the one, reportedly, being proposed by the PM (staying in the EU in all but name until they agree to let us out) is supported by no one and a betrayal of the vote. #StandUp4Brexit
How can you negotiate with or trust a person like #TheresaMay? She tells so many lies, distorts figures, denies the truth & makes empty promises. At #PMQs, she follows one mistruth with another; seems it's a #brexit #nodeal or a bad deal unless we #GetTheToriesOut #PoliticsToday
Info for truck drivers if there’s no #Brexit deal. The process to apply for permits to drive in the EEA (ECMTs) will run 26 Nov - 21st Dec (and there’s a limited number). Sounds like getting Kylie tickets @BastidonPauline!

#MPs cannot blame #Brexit for their own failure. If they cannot properly deliver on the result of the referendum that they gave to the people, then what are they doing in Parliament in the first place?  #StandUp4Brexit #ChuckChequers @DCBMEP @andreajenkyns
Last time we had a civil war in this country was in 1642-1651, between the Parliamentarians and the Royalists. I sense another one coming on if we don't get the #Brexit we voted for, only this time it will be between the Parliamentarians and the working classes.
Brexit: the inevitable consequence will be chaos - Mrs May should be under no illusions. Aviation is not something she can fudge and, even if the media are currently ignoring it, IATA – however imperfectly – has just marked her card...  #Brexit. 
Dear #FBPE brigade,If/when Labour backbenchers defy Jeremy Corbyn by voting for Theresa May's fudge of a #Brexit deal, thus propping up this shit-show of a Tory government and ensuring we leave the EU, will you apologise for spending the last 2yrs slagging off the wrong man? 
No. Stopping #Brexit is what's essential. A "deal" simply facilitates corrupt #Brexit. Anyway, we already have one: full voting-rights EU membership with opt-outs. The best possible deal. Unless you're a racist, xenophobe, nationalist, fascist, rich tax-dodger or just dim. 
I see Iain Duncan-Smith is now saying the UK car industry is not that important. Funny that, because wasn't the previous line that the German car industry was so important they were able to tell the EU what to do. Patriot my arse. #Brexit
If this is true it will make an absolute mockery of those in the #FBPE brigade who have spent the last 2yrs slagging off Jeremy Corbyn for not opposing #Brexit. Not that they'll admit they were wrong. 
You are absolutely deluded if you think #Chequers will appease the electorate who voted to leave and #Brexit Government will deserve the fall that comes its way for the betrayal of the UK. You Sir are complicit. #ChuckChequers #NoConfidence
Despite my criticisms, if #brexit is to happen, I would still support Corbyn.  Politics is always the choice between the imperfect, and in the end I feel it will come down to that dichotomy of the two party state. I believe in Labour.
Businesses in North would opt for a backstop arrangement over a no-deal #Brexit “any day”, Northern Ireland businesses leaders tell House of Commons committee - @IrishTimes

Right wingers losing their shit that they might need VISAs for mainland Europe post #Brexit, whilst simultaneously demanding a curb to migrants to the UK, is the most hillarious yet depressing act of hypocrisy I've seen since the last time they did something stupid.
Tonight I found a Churchill quote worth recalling in #Brexit Times: ”We must build a kind of United States of Europe, and we proclaim our resolve that the spiritual conception of Europe shall not die, that it shall live and shine”.

And yet STILL weak and feeble @Conservatives #Brexiteers don’t have the make up to do whats right for OUR country as they prefer to put  their failing party first. On the #5thMay2022 your party will be obliterated at the ballot box. #BrexitBetrayal #Brexit

This is mind boggling. The reason why agri-food businsess are currently worried about #Brexit is because they fear new UK trade deals? Let's try and deal w/the here and now. FFS, it's about their existing supply chains, not keeping out future competition  
Quotes that seem unfortunate at this stage in the #Brexit negotiations. 78% say we won’t get a good deal and only 14% expect to be better off 
The Tory, Labour duopoly on #Brexit will go down in history as the most ill-conceived Political Pantomime in U.K. post war history! Time to call an end to this nonsense! Support #LibDems for a #FinalSay to #Remain
A no deal WTO #Brexit is not to be feared. It would bring some short-term challenges, but also brings a great number of long-term opportunities. It means the ability to diverge from EU regulation, and to strike new free trade deals with emerging markets. 
1) Leave supporters and "what we voted for"@andrew_lilico here really highlighting a strange phenomenon I've seen a lot of in #Brexit supporters, a marked inability to see any variation in the leave voteHe says "We are not...", But we *know* these things apply to many leavers

Very excited to see my book in November’s @BirdwatchExtra .Thanks to delays & fears about a hard #Brexit it is available next week 
#1922Committee Should be renamed the 1922 invertebrate committee! the great betrayal of #brexit is now signed sealed and delivered by Treason May and the spineless so called #brexit Conservatives to the #EUSSR!
The vote to leave the EU was a vote to become an independent country - and that means becoming a distinct customs entity in control of our own external relations. A customs union, therefore, is an intolerable betrayal of #Brexit.
.@Telegraph cartoon#TheresaMay #Brexit 
I think @TomTugendhat should recognise that #Brexit will have ‘profound consequences’ right across the UK, but esp in Kent.  What on Earth did he think would be happening? @LibDems @JasonJHunter @PimlicoPlumbers
Contrary to claims by Brexiters in the event of a no-deal the EU won't close its borders, it will simply apply the normal EU checks to goods coming from a third country operating under WTO rules with no other trade agreements.#PeoplesVote #Brexit
MPs loyal to May aren’t just participating in a betrayal of #Brexit, they’re propping up a wave of incompetent administration that threatens to define the Conservative Party for a decade 
Poll: Remainers, how do you feel about #Brexit?Please RT.
We all need to get into the spirit of #BREXIT.So throw way your shoes.Empty the fridge into the bin.Turn off the electric & heatingAnd sit freezing in the dark with a candle, crying.
Why I feel betrayed by May and her Cabinet on #Brexit. And why, despite his obvious flaws, I have to recognise Trump’s growing list of conservative achievements. My thirty minute interview with @StevenEdginton...
Important meeting today with the Border Communities Against #Brexit & @MarianHarkin. Our work in the European Parliament will continue until we find a real solution for the Irish border & secure the Good Friday agreement.
If #Brexit goes through to keep the peace, then political violence will have been legitimised and normalised. For this reason alone Brexit must be stopped. Political violence must be shown to fail. Violence and threats of violence must be punished not rewarded.#PeoplesVote
What does a treacherous & duplicitous political ‘elite’ look like?Well, they spend £9 million of YOUR money on a leaflet which says “This is your decision... we will implement what YOU decide”.....then do EVERYTHING possible to try & reverse what the majority decided#Brexit

We entered a referendum on #EU membership.  Rules were clear.  People voted Leave.  Not to everyone's taste, but that's democracy.  Now we have a PM forcing through a deal that looks nothing like #Brexit. Biggest #UK shame in my lifetime.
"The Metropolitan Police Special Enquiry Team dismissed complaints relating to potential Misconduct in Public Office offences related to Brexit without investigating, documents show." - @J_amesp #BrexitCrimes #Brexit
#Brexit should mean that the UK is no longer the property of the #EU.
There's no other way of saying. #brexit is the most undemocratic political weapon since the war. It's not about reflecting democracy. It's about killing it and putting all "control" in the hands of the economic elite, a global establishment. And when it's done, so is democracy
Is @theresa_may forgetting that 'nothing is agreed until everything is agreed'? Meaningless to talk of 95% progress when the Irish border remains wholly unresolved. Without an answer to that there's no #Brexit deal. And answer comes there none #EndTheChaos
National Crime Agency warns the ability of UK #police to tackle serious and organised crime could be “significantly impacted” by a no-deal #Brexit. Who voted to give gangsters and people-traffickers a boost, and how do blue passports solve it? #EndTheChaos
Patrick O'Flynn MEP - "Do not believe the bulletins brought to you by has-beens from the UK political class. "The likes of Heseltine, Blair and Clegg, who tell you that by keeping the punishment up you can bring Britain to heel." #Brexit

Nick Ferrari had this scathing message for Sir James Dyson, who talked up Brexit yet decided to build his new electric cars… in Singapore @NickFerrariLBC | #Brexit 
We think the claim that 45 #Labour MPs will bail out @theresa_may and back her #Brexit deal is baseless.But we need to send a strong message.Sign & share our petition, calling for a Labour manifesto pledge to a #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain 
It was interesting to hear from Dr David Shiels, Policy Analyst @OpenEurope say that a No Deal #Brexit would not be a disater for the UK economy during @CommonsEUexit committee today.

Today's House of Commons at #PMQs and the band played merrily on ..the iceberg; a mere rumour #brexit :))
For Brexiters, Chef Corbyn’s ‘Brexit fudge’ will have them salivating.It will make their #Brexit dreams that much sweeter.Indeed, it will go well with a glass of Raab’s 'Confusing Concoction' and the Eton mess being served up by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg.#StopBrexit
The time for compromise with the #EU is over. We are dealing with people who wish to seriously damage #BRITAIN! @theresa_may is complicit in this #EU plot to Block #BREXIT and STOP our #INDEPENDENCE! #MayMustGo #ChuckMay #StandUp4Brexit #BBC #SKY #LBC @LBC #TheresaMay @DCBMEP
A not so “Global Britain” when time and time again academics, artists & NGO representatives are being denied entry to the UK. The hostile environment remains. Is this a sign of things beyond #Brexit? #PMQs @ccfest @alison_phipps @WOMADfestival @ScotlandMalawi
An imperious @ChukaUmunna gets right to the heart of the matter questioning an embarrassed @annietrev: the ERG do not have the mandate or the parliamentary numbers to push through their extremist vision of #Brexit democratically, so they’re trying to blackmail it out of the PM. 
Dear Corbynites if JC loses the next GE don't pin the blame on anyone other than him.You may worship the ground he walks on & back a #Brexit that Removes Rights without Consent, Threatens Jobs & Publ Servs & Leave us WORSE OFF,WE DON'T.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #Remain#FBPE

It is no longer about #TommyRobinson. It is much bigger than Tommy now. It is about ordinary, decent people fighting back against a corrupt establishment. First, it was #Brexit, next it will be @Waspi. Be careful @theresa_may, the troops are finally rebelling.
#PMQs  well said .@cajardineMP !May is going to break up the UK with her #Brexit belligerence ! May’s robotic response is beyond tone deaf! 
He’s possibly onto something as the UK Govt have gone awfully quiet on the issue of governance of the Withdrawal Agreement #Brexit #CJEU
The #1922Committee need to understand that we do not like the way @theresa_may is handling #Brexit. She is giving too much away, tying us too closely to EU controls & damaging the perception of democracy in the UK.Time for her to go.@Graham__Brady @CherylGillan @bernardjenkin
Please do me a favour, respect that I am pro EU which is why I use #FBPE . I am anti #Brexit which doesn't mean I am anti @UKLabour and absolutely doesn't mean I am a cultist. I respect you want the Tories out, me too, and some of you are using #GTTO. Don't make them mutually 》2

Theresa May's track record in the Home Office and since shows her to be a lying, scheming, abusive, xenophobic authoritarian nationalist who is all too willing to override democratic and legal checks and balances whenever she can. She is a Brextremist. #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
If you think #Brexit might not be worth it just watch this: senior MEP suggests locking European leaders in a room with no change of clothes until they agree to  top down migrant quotas and to Hell with democracy or what is best for individual countries. Thank God we're leaving! 
Andrew Bridgen MP is a walking challenge to the Theory of Evolution. His awareness hasn't evolved beyond that of an amoeba. #Brexit
Nigel Farage accuses the UK civil service of being a "rogue element" that's out to sabotage #brexit... they are the "enemy within." This is an #outrageous slur against UK civil servants.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
It’s worth reminding us all that we didn’t need to trigger Art50 until we had a plan - but instead the Tory hard right & the Corbyn ‘left’ insisted on an immediate activation - and the consequences of their rush to Brexit are now self evident - economic & political chaos. #Brexit
29 #NobelLaureates including our President, Venki Ramakrishnan, have signed an open letter to @theresa_may on #Brexit
In response to @Nigel_Farage in EP: I don’t know what the result of the #brexit talks is going to be. But I know that it is the Brexiteers, who are 100% responsible for bringing back the problem of the Irish border.
Channel 4 will be holding a live studio discussion #Brexit: What The Nation Really Thinks, on Monday 5th November, hosted by Krishnan Guru-Murthy  @krishgm 
If France decides effectively to blockade the Channel ports, it will be shooting itself in the foot. UK suppliers, freed from EU trade barriers, will quickly shift to buying cheaper products from the rest of the world instead.  #Brexit

After decades lobbying for a referendum, two years on from the Leave Vote, and senior Tory MPs STILL cannot decide what #Brexit means. This is a historic calamity for Britain. 
Theresa May will face Tory MPs who are increasingly concerned about her #Brexit plans in Westminster on Wednesday.The showdown comes as the number of Tory MPs publicly committed to oppose her Chequers blueprint for leaving the European Union reached 50. 
In the event of a no-deal #Brexit, the government plans to charter commercial ships to bring in emergency medicines and food. (Financial Times) Makes the normality of being in the EU really attractive, don't you think?
Despite the pathetic & somewhat unpleasant tweets over the last 48 hrs, I will reiterate that my vote is not yours to take for granted, you have to #EarnMyVote. It is contingent on #Brexit & supporting a #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain. Insults & intimidation don't work.
It's almost like they didn't realise that #Brexit means Brexit... 
A #Brexit deal can be reached as it’s in the mutual interest, but one last push on #citizensrights will help: an offer of unlimited onward movement for UK citizens in EU27, in exchange for lifelong return to the UK for EU citizens. I know the UK could agree, so let’s deliver it.
Our indolent, Brexit-obsessed, lame Transport Secretary has finally woken up to the fact that there might be a few problems at Dover post #BrexitAward for slowest learner?#PeoplesVote to #StopBrexitSaveBritain
I have started blocking anyone who claims to have voted Remain and now demands we get on with #Brexit. I don't believe anyone could be that stupid, so I assume they're lying Leavers.
Progress on the #Brexit negotiations can be 90%, 95% or even 99%, but as long as there is no solution for the Irish border, as long as the Good Friday agreement is not fully secured, for us in our Parliament progress is 0%.
The duplicity & sheer arrogance of the disaster capitalists pushing for a hard #Brexit would make your head spin

Udo Bullman MEP - Last Saturday, 700,000 people marched in London to demand a #PeoplesVote. The British people deserve a #FinalSay on their future once they've seen the consequences of the #brexit divorce... this is my firm belief.#FBPE
Northern Ireland was always going to be impossible. You KNEW THAT. Yet you pushed on with a flawed Brexit anyway. And your only plan was always going to be to blame the EU. Totally irresponsible. I was born in Belfast. Grew up in the troubles. #Brexit threatens our peace
Dyson, leading #Brexit supporter sets up new Electric car manufacturing in Singapore as Brexit economists & Leaders start saying "car making is only 1% of the economy, no big deal if we lose it post Brexit"Sunderland, you've been had lads 
In the event of a no-deal Brexit, and to allay Project Fear, the government has published this detailed, instructive advice for citizens. "Remember: Leaving the EU will be as easy as 1-2-3!"  #NoDealBrexit #Brexit 
This is utterly unacceptable , especially given what we know. Now about the #Brexit referendum funding.  Facebook should say what it knows and the donor and the organisation should be subject to normal public scrutiny. 
"It’s the kind of stuff governments do in a time of war” said one member of the cabinet. “It is as serious as that”. He added that perhaps it would be the “sobering moment” that showed colleagues why a no-deal #Brexit would be “so damaging”.-via @Peston
Post #Brexit feeble excuse kit:It would have been a huge success if:1. The EU hadn’t been determined to punish us;2. Traitorous Remoaners had got behind it;3. Lazy businesses had adapted;4. May had been a leaver;5. Everyone believed harder;6. Grayling had been in charge

A devastating leak. If this is the direction of travel, such an eternal transition would be- unacceptable to the EU- unacceptable to the Brexiteers- democratically scandalous- create perpetual uncertainty for businessthus worse than either remaining or leaving. #brexit 
3/ To get my vote at the GE, you WILL have to give me a #PeoplesVote, or withdraw A50.If you won't, you are part of the #Brexit catastrophe. I don't vote for parties that are part of this self harm, no matter what the rosette colour.P.S. @uklabour you need my vote.
My pledge1/ I will never vote for a party which supports #Brexit or "respects" the insult to democracy that is the 2016 ref.2/ I will hold all future governments responsible for holding to account the people who weaponised nationalism, lied and broke the law to cause this.
#Brexit , the hard way - © Chappatte in The New York Times @nytopinion > 
"The UK government has told the House of Commons that it has “not seen evidence of successful use of disinformation by foreign actors, including Russia, to influence UK democratic processes”, which without doubt includes the #Brexit referendum." 
Out of interest, Sir James Dyson once said (of #brexit), “Britain is now approaching its own change. If we embrace it, Brexit can supercharge British technology and refocus minds on global trade.” I guess he meant Singapore 
FT: "Plan for ships to bring in emergency supplies in event of no-deal #Brexit".@ajcdeane gives this the short shrift it deserves.#SkyPapers
Secretly?Must be bloody joking..this has been obvious since Corbyn helped May invoke A50 w/o due diligence...It's why he may well not win the election. Millions of us will never vote for him or #Brexit backing Labour.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexitSaveBritain

Instead of suffering any awkwardness telling immigrants they need to fulfill some basic requirements, the U.K. decided to commit economic suicide instead. #Brexit
I have never felt so despondent about UK politics as I do now and I blame Cameron for that. He shld never have called a referendum. Having done so, he shld have run a positive campaign for Remain. My children and grandchildren will bear the consequences #Brexit #disaster
Should be interesting if they do depose May. If a Brexiter takes over then he/she/it will be facing the exact same dilemmas or crash out without a deal - and either way will be carrying the can for a catastrophe. #Brexit
Theresa May’s arrogance triggers such a fundamental Brexit disaster, the UK media is covering for herBy @wrightismight Via @TheCanaryGlobal #Brexit

Michael O'Leary is absolutely right & he is expressing a view that is widespread across Europe. Brexit is insane and will cause immeasurable damage to the UK for decades to come. And the majority in the UK are now very probably against Brexit. #Brexit is tyranny. #PeoplesVote

So many areas of UK that benefit from regional investment will lose out massively from #brexit, this massive one in Stirling is just one example.If you are concerned about your area and voted leave, know it's ok to change your mind. Be a #RemainerNow
How long till we hear the usual ignorant “project fear” sound bytes? There’s no such thing as a good #Brexit but we need a deal to avoid the sheer chaos & disaster of a no deal; this can be achieved 
I'm a remainer & no fan of Italy's new far right gov, but an unelected EU body telling a sovereign country to redo their budget is not a good look. If we'd had an adult debate on issues like this & not written off leavers concerns, perhaps we wouldn't be in this #Brexit mess.
A reminder - Farage was calling for a 2nd referendum (a straight replay, not a vote on the final deal) if Remain won by 52%/48%, and Raab, Redwood and other Tories made it clear they would demand a 2nd referendum. They were not going to 'accept' the result. #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Brexiters are running scared of a #PeoplesVote. If they are so sure they have the majority on their side, why don't they enthusiastically support a vote to finally put us Remoaners in our place!#Brexit
This is so true, Young scientists are deeply depressed about #Brexit and this government

Aston Martin will cope with no deal #Brexit. And so will the the rest of the car industry. 
Parliament is and always has been sovereign, for gods sake i don't understand why the tories are trying to mute our democracy, i think privately they want a no deal #Brexit, they want to destroy our people and country, this must be stopped, meaningful vote must happen.
But Corbyn is STILL pushing for Brexit, Starmer is still flip-flopping like an acrobat & McDonnell & Thornberry are rabidly desperate to get a #Brexit at any costs. I’ve totally lost all faith in @UKLabour. I can’t see anything happening to help me get it back. #FBPE #OFOC #FFS

So now #brexit is to be survived not prospered. Bloody marvellous well done little England.

Back in school I remember learning about "Developed" and "Developing" nations. We need a new category. #Brexit Britain is a "regressing" nation. What sort of country deliberately makes itself poorer and needs to stockpile medicine for fucks sake. A regressive one that's what.

If Remainers really care about this country they should rally round #Brexit and try to shape it rather than railing against it. Failure to deliver the democratic instruction of the British people will release some very dark and dangerous forces into our politics.

The greatest prize of #Brexit was the freedom to do free trade deals. The EU is so bureaucratic and protectionist it struggles badly to strike meaningful ones or takes forever to do them. Stay in the CU would be a disasterous mistake#StandUp4Brexit
Of course it will. Corbyn and Milne are betraying everything the Labour movement has ever stood for. If @UKLabour ever wants to be trusted again it must stop #brexit now. 
Who would you rather have in charge of British #Brexit negotiations with the EU ?
When every week brings more news of prominent Leavers taking their money and business out of the UK - despite talking up the alleged opportunities of #Brexit - should we not wonder whether perhaps actions speak louder than words? #EndTheChaos
.@CommonsHealth told UK’s pharmaceutical companies have already had to spend £100s of millions on contingency planning for a no-deal or hard #Brexit. What a waste! #brexitshambles #PeoplesVote
Does anyone else find this insulting?Is this the language of an elected MP, earning £77k of our taxpayer money?#tories #brexit #finalsayforall
Brexit was a victory for ordinary British people against a pervasive and self interested Establishment. Now, the same Establishment is fighting tooth and nail to water down and thwart #Brexit. Fight back with @Facts4euOrg's Brexit Battlepack: 
Official Met Police estimate numbers attended March over the weekend at 130,000 The wildly exaggerated figure of 700,000 comes from people’s vote Remain campaign HQ #Brexit
Yesterday I challenged the PM that 1.5 million young people have not had their say on #Brexit despite being eligible to vote. It’s their future that is at stake with with this damaging Tory Brexit @peoplesvote_uk #PeoplesVote
Dyson rejects UK and chooses Singapore for his new car plant. Seems like even business supporters of #Brexit are not prepared to invest in the UK economy at present. 
INVESTIGATION: NHS Applications from frontline staff from other EU countries have dropped "like a stone" says Chief Exec of NHS Employers#BREXIT
Yet another #Brexit warning!This time from the chief of the National Crime Agency (NCA).A #PeoplesVote is imperative to #StopBrexit & all its insanity..
Hey @LeaveEUOfficial, you do realise #Dyson's going to be building his new electric cars in #Singapore don't you. Hardly a resounding vote of confidence in post #Brexit Britain, is it? 
Here is Tommy Robinson telling his idiotic sorry loyal followers that he has no free speech and is censored....whilst on a stage outside the Old Bailey in London.  Irony ladies and gentlemen. #UK #Racism #Politics #Brexit 
The government:Underfunds the NHS, blames waiting times on the EU.Fails to build enough schools, blames class sizes on the EU.Fails to build enough social housing, blames shortages on EU.Cuts policing, blames rising crime on EU.Is it any wonder people voted for #Brexit
Who has an independent trade policy with the rest of the world? NorwayWho is not in a customs union with the EU? Norway.Which option did the ERG wail most about? Norway. What you get is what is left. It's the #Brexit you deserve.
Impressive keynote from @JohnBrutonIRL at #NegotBrexit Pointing out that whilst within the union of UK Scotland is unable to veto #Brexit, in #EU Ireland has same veto as Germany. “The EU protects smaller nations from bigger nations.” #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
I'm not sure what question the PM was answering yesterday during her statement on #Brexit but it didn't seem to be mine. In a democracy people have the right to change their minds. 
#Brexiters are happy to Remove Rights w/o Consent as long as it affects others.Some don't mind others' financial loss as long as they gain financially.Some want to take back Control..over others.Some only want Democracy when it goes their way.There's a pattern to #Brexit no?
If @realDonaldTrump was in charge of #Brexit we would have left years ago and the EU would be paying us £billions annually for free access to our lucrative markets.@theresa_may  is a hopeless #REMOANER.
Over the past TWO YEARS This Government has DELIBERATELY allowed a conflation of: refugee/migrant/seasonal worker/EU citizen into ONE term of abuse: Illegal Migrant. NO politician has countered the lies in the Mail/Express. #brexit #theresamay #finalsay

Come on Tory MPs,get those letters inTory MPs need to realise that they're finished if they don't deliver the #Brexit they promised at Election & #EURefTory MPs need to remove PM & get a new PM who actually believes in Brexit & who will get us out of the EU prontoNo more delay
This Thursday the @BrexitReadyIRL roadshow reaches Dublin. You can join me there for an update on #Brexit and receive bespoke support from all of our state agencies under one roof. Businesses should register here: .
#Brexit “patriot” James Dyson announces manufacturing of his new electric car (along with over a thousand jobs) will go to Singapore. 
It would be nice if our elections & referenda were at the very least legal, but have we ever had one that was truly informed, unbiased & free from lies and ludicrous promises? If we voted on the #Brexit deal, would it be any cleaner/ fairer/ truer? Or bilious rantings repeated?
The Conservative Party would be “rent asunder if it tried to abandon #Brexit”; ⁦@Jacob_Rees_Mogg⁩ talking to @ConHome’s @PaulGoodmanCH about possibility of ‘second referendum’
#MillenniumBug didn't happen 'cos experts put detailed plans together & then spent thousands of man-hours implementing them, with IT engineers often working around the clock to ensure the risk was mitigated.Do you see that kind of sensible, thought-through approach to #Brexit? 
Tory MPs had better realise that they are finished if they don't deliver the #Brexit they promised at the General Election and in the #EURef.Tory MPs need to remove the PM and get a new PM who actually believes in Brexit and who will get us out of ther EU pronto.No more delay.
Just me, hanging out with the best looking group at @peoplesvote_uk #brexit 
James Dyson has a funny way of demonstrating his faith in the #Brexit Britain he advocates: his electric car factory will be in, er, Singapore.
Aren't we allowed to have a bit of fun while you take away our rights? humiliate the country on the world stage and wreck our livelihoods without our consent? Must we meekly surrender to your will?#Brexit #PeoplesVote
It's been brought to my attention that this is all my fault for calling a general election. Shocked and confused x #Brexit
Almost half the time available to make changes to the law needed for #Brexit has passed.But nowhere near half the work has been done. It's clear the only way out of this mess is a #PeoplesVoteREAD: 
It looks like young people are becoming disillusioned with Corbyn due to his support for #Brexit.Labour has a choice; enthusiastically back a #PeoplesVote or see its youth vote drain away.
brilliant to see #Brexit cheerleader James Dyson to build his new electric car in Singapore - clear confidence in #Brexit Britain #PeoplesVote
The #pound dropped on Monday amid more #Brexit uncertainty and unsettled Irish border issues. See how the major stocks performed:

You campaigned for remain because #brexit wasn't in the national interest. 
Science needs "the flow of people and ideas across borders," write 29 Nobel laureates on #Brexit and research 
Everyone criticising James Dyson - supporting #Brexit doesn’t mean you have to build everything in the United Kingdom. He can make wise business decisions which don’t include the home market, that’s how globalisation operates.
It now appears that Stuart Rose the extremely disengaged, lackluster chair of the Remain campaign was just a few years previously......founder of the extreme eurosceptic “Business for Britain”, one of the pro #brexit organs of the highly secretive Tufton street organization.... 
.@JeremyCorbyn and the @UKLabour leadership have defied us all with their ‘Brexit fudge’.Inspired by Willy Wonka himself, the Labour’s opposition to #Brexit is just ‘pure imagination’.
Government is issuing emergency no deal instructions to businesses.If anyone is seriously implying there's going to be no significant impact on confidence, investment or the economy from this utter #Brexit shambles they need to go and have a good lie down
The conservatives are apparently signing #Brexit Backstop agreements they didn't understand & are now making a mockery of the parliamentary process by making these agreements "illegal" after the fact.Yeah, if only Remainers had been more "reasonable"The UK looks ridiculous 
I imagine, as a @UKLabour member and or voter, it must really rankle being told you are not 'true Labour' and don't care about ordinary people, if you don't support Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn as well as not supporting his #Brexit. Not the language of a united party is it?
#Brexit supportersI mean seriously, how many of you voted thinking that the end result would be emergency "no deal fire drills" being issued to Businesses?What do you think this is doing to investment & confidence in the UK?Who voted for this?
Read the full #Brexit letter to @theresa_may signed by Sir Paul Nurse, Venki Ramakrishnan and 33 other #FieldsMedal and @NobelPrize winners 
I’ve been banging the drum for an #EEA-based #Brexit for 2 yrs now so great to have colleague @frankfieldteam join me, alongside wide range of MPs from both sides of the House. Only option that can solve Irish Q, respect 52:48 vote & help reunite Britain
@bbcquestiontime When will you be inviting @JasonJHunter and @mikegalsworthy on the panel? It would be good to see somebody who has a firm grasp of the #Brexit facts. #PeoplesVote
Dear Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, you were in Geneva on Saturday instead of London. We marched to protect the NHS, our human & workers rights, our jobs, economy & prosperity, our childrens futures. Do you believe your #Brexit will offer the same protection & benefits as we have now?
A lifetime’s experience of negotiation (much of it international) leads me to agree with Mr Levenson #Brexit 
Actual homelessness > Faux "Political homelessness"That's why many remain voters like me back Corbyn, who stands on the most socially progressive platform in decades, ahead of the "But what about Brexit?" circle jerk. #GTTO #JC4PM #Brexit

You know what? Can the fucking politicians and #brexit lot please stop using WWII metaphors to describe Brexit! A modern society should not be invoking a spirit of a war that killed millions for a constitutional change! It's also pissing on those who died! Stop it! Arseholes!
To the EU May’s hardening on backstop looks again like her putting  her party and her survival as PM ahead of negotiating an agreement with Brussels and avoiding a no deal #Brexit
When the govt says the #Brexit deal is 95% done, it’s talking of only HALF the deal, namely the divorce arrangements. The other (more important) half is the yet-to-be-reached agreement on future relations, covering trade, security, research & a multitude of small practical things 
Amazing - @BBCr4today leads with this story about Nobel scientists warning about impact of #brexit on science 
THIS is the most damaging impact of #Brexit ; lost business, lost jobs, lost tax revenue; see the replies, similar experiencesI wonder how many lost jobs this thread represents?Hoping they & their staff explain this to their MP especially if s/he is of the "party of business" 
Yesterday @Stuart_McDonald & I met with @The3Million. We understand that without proper legal protections the UK Govt’s unilateral guarantees to #EU citizens are worthless @theSNP will continue to argue for proper protections for #EU citizens. Thread#Brexit 
I met a German banker last weekend who successfully applied for  citizenship after the Referendum so he could stay in London where he has lived for over a decade. Now he’s been told by his employer that they are relocating his job to Frankfurt because of #Brexit ....

The thing that always strikes me about #Brexit discussions is how it seems like it's just a debate between the various factions in the UK. There's hardly ever any mention of what the EU want or will accept. #Newsnight
Demand? Does @theresa_may not remember the agreement she signed in December or the letter she wrote in March? We all want a #Brexit deal, we need a Withdrawal Agreement thy includes an Irish specific backstop; that we hope will never be needed. 
Ah -  but there we were, a million of us marching - police contingent expecting 140k of us, but not a murmur of trouble - even when we were standing for hours, logjammed, unable to move. Now if you knew nothing about the pros & cons of #brexit - which side would you support?

I don't care whose mess this is - as in who started it.  It isn't a playground fight.  The Labour party feel they can try to fight another Tory mess, Austerity, but not #brexit - bc it is a Tory mess.  False position - (we aren't dupes).   23/n

Nigel Farage: EU like creepy stalker in Fatal Attraction!Refuses to accept relationship is over & keeps coming back with greater demands & threats!May incapable of escaping bullying #EU monster.Time to show some mettle PM & stand up for Britain.#Brexit
Mrs May @theresa_may says 95% ready.The Mayreto principle, also known as the 95/5 rule, is a theory maintaining that the last 5 percent of the alleged #Brexit deal will still require a further 95 percent effort from a divided, incompetent, backstabbing government.
Watching Theresa May today in the commons on #Brexit and the #PeoplesVote it's striking when comparing to Margaret Thatcher and the Poll Tax.The game is up. It's over.Thatcher stumbled on for a few more months but everyone knew it was over.#PeoplesVote
Thought I had heard it all on #Brexit but now Brexiteer, John Stuart Agnew accuses EU of trying to ban oxybiodegradeble plastics because they are made in Britain! 
It's not 'implementation' as the Govt calls it, it's not 'transition' either.Transition implies change toward the end state,implementation happens once something has been agreed. This is just plain postponing, or even thwarting #Brexit. May's govt thinks we don't get it? 
Theresa May's #Brexit statement leaves Scotland's future relationship with the European Union still in limbo, and moves us even closer to a no deal Brexit. Here are four important takeaways. 
Protect Scottish jobs? Protect Scotland's economy? Aye right, yet more 'get back in your box Scotland' from the Tories. #Brexit #Scotland
Out for dinner and Brexit came up (again) with my Italian host family/friends.Their opinion of the mess the U.K is in and Mays handling of Brexit is what they call a ‘grande imbarazzo’ (big embarrassment) and May is a ‘scherzo’ (joke). I agree. #Brexit #TheresaMay
Treasury Minister @JohnGlenUK told me it’s vital we negotiate frictionless trade for the strength of our aerospace and automobile sectors. Gov’s dog’s dinner of a #Brexit means it’s unlikely. 
He's right - just supposing she agreed to a #Brexit deal to build a wall across Ireland and pay the #EU a trillion over the next 10 years -  would that be OK?  Same principle - small print  #PeoplesVote

JLR mothballing production & sending workers home & #failingGrayling plans for no-deal #Brexit lorry park on M26 show desperate state as we move towards leaving the EU. This is a govt out of touch, ideas & time. It’s now all about saving themselves, not the country #FBPE
Regarding the #PeoplesMarchDid it ever occur to those opposing #Brexit that the EU is in itself fascism?Hitler‘s conquests throughout Europe had the end goal of control over a one world government; one currency, one language, etc.The EU is straight out of Hitler’s playbook.
During latest PM #Brexit statement @ScotTories MPs getting visibly agitated about @theresa_may failure to guarantee no sell out of #fishing industry during negotiations. Shows their political naivety that they didn’t see this one coming
We can't leave. Not because we need them more than they need us, but because they need us *as much* as we need them  Watch. Retweet. Rethink. [3 vid thread from @Channel4News with Michael Moore on #Brexit] 
For anyone still requiring #Brexit clarification..We are leaving the EU on 29th March 2019 BECAUSE of the outcome of a #peoplesvote in 2016There’ll be NO 2ND REFERENDUM as confirmed by PM @theresa_may on multiple occasions to multiple MPs over & over again in the HoC today

Who voted Leave to see the price of beef go up 29%? Who voted Leave to lose up to 40% of our food imports from the #EU? Who voted Leave for food prices overall to rise by up to 22%? And who warned them about all this in 2016? #EndTheChaos #Brexit
Welsh communities and businesses will be hit hardest by #Brexit compared to rest of UK. Minister agrees with me in #EU debate this afternoon, but offers no solutions. Will UK Govt make that sacrifice? #ToriesFailingWales #PeoplesVote
Anyone who knows the first thing about Scottish politics knows what a turnaround this is - and he's by no means the only one. How could #Brexit possibly be worth the disintegration of the UK? Can it even be 'Brexit' if Britain becomes a thing of the past?

On #SundayPoliticsWales I reminded viewers that amongst the chaos is a #Brexit that reflects the 52:48 vote, solves Irish border, protects jobs & livelihoods, allows us to reform migration rules, & can help reunite our deeply divided country; an #EEA-based Brexit + Customs Union.

- Ireland rejected the Lisbon Treaty by 53% to 47% in 2007 on a turnout of just 53.1 per cent- In 2009, after the facts had become clear, it voted again and approved it by 67% on a 59% turnout. #Brexit
Instead of chanting "Where's Jeremy Corbyn?" at the #PeoplesVote march, why not chant "Where's that tw*t @David_Cameron at?" Considering he was the one that got us into this #brexit mess and quickly went into hiding.
Why are so many MPs moaning about the meaningful vote being between the govt's #Brexit Deal Vs. a #NoDealBrexit? The British people voted to the leave the EU and MPs voted overwhelmingly to trigger Article 50. This country is now solidly committed to that exit. #RespectTheResult
Superb speech by @johnredwood in the #HouseofCommons blasting the government #Brexit deal: "When will this government stand up to the #EU? When will it rule out signing a withdrawal agreement which is a surrender document we cannot afford?"  @DCBMEP #Tory

Hi Owen. Maybe you could also go a look up ‘Opposition.’ It’s been more than two years now and Jeremy hadn’t been near it on #Brexit. He’s been stuck at the page in the Dictionary where ‘supine’ appears.
Dominic grieve pulling the government up on the backhanded methods they've used to prevent MPS ever having a meaningful vote on the final #Brexit deal.Dominic Raab now wriggling on the hook and having to confirm that it is indeed the case that MPs won't get a meaningful vote.
I'm in the depths of despair !Just listened to Tory #Brexit Minister replying to an "Urgent Question"on EU Customs UnionStumbling & blethering his way through & keeps referring to an imminent statement by the PM who has very clearly cut him out of the loopHe hasn't got a CLUE,
Having watched this unfold with the original attempts to stymie the phone hacking investigation, this is bang on. It’s a CPS problem. In the end it took @Keir_Starmer to reopen the phone hacking inquiry. Maybe we need him again for #Brexit campaign law breaking 
MPs from across the house questioning the government about the benefits of #Brexit and the negative impacts on tens of thousands jobs. Nothing, they've got absolutely nothing but fluff and nonsense. What a bunch of useless twats the UK has got running the country.
Martian Tory John Redwood MP (earns £180,000 per year from City spiv links above his MP salary) has Urgent Question now on #Brexit impact on UK Budget. Should have thought about that before Referendum@peoplesvote_uk #PeoplesVoteMarch #fbpe
I have never known a more nasty/evil/vile/disgusting organisation that today's tory party, the language they are using against their own PM, in the wake of the murder of Jo Cox is appalling, this is what #Brexit has done, hatred/bile/division, fuck you @Conservatives #StopBrexit
Blue on blue attacks in Parliament today continue - with arch Brexiter John Redwood arguing for us to crash out of Customs Union as soon as possible. Bonkers. Time for a @peoplesvote_uk to end this #Brexit chaos.
We want a good agreement and we need it urgently. Now the key element for a final deal is on the British side. My interview with @BBCOne @AndrewMarr9 #Brexit #marr
Considering the mess the Government has made of #Brexit the fact 95% of the shambles is complete is unlikely to bring confidence to anyone.
Brexit is 3800 hours away. #brexit
READ: Young people came out in force last Saturday to March for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Read why @FFSake_ supporter @kiramillana_pg marched to demand a #PeoplesVote:
#Brexit isn’t just about 2 or 3 big issues. What about the little things that need to be solved if we leave?  #brexitdogsdinner
Meanwhile, @HansardSociety has a rather damning update on #Brexit. Just 71 of the 800+ Statutory Instruments needed to prepare the statute book for exit day have been laid before Parliament. #DONTPANIC?
Is that all of them yet? Yet another major #tech employer warns that, if there's a hard #Brexit or no deal at all, our status as a manufacturing hub would be under threat - and they'd need to "rethink" their presence here...#EndTheChaos #Philips #FinalSay
Superb essay!Long read: how EU membership undermines the left  #Brexit
It is absolutely clear that the government is implementing a #BrexitGate cover-up. There should be no way that #Brexit should be allowed to take place before this scandal, both crime and cover-up, is fully investigated. #PeoplesVote
WATCH: @Hugodixon addresses the crowds at this weekend's People's Vote march.An estimated 700,000 marched to demand the final say on #Brexit That’s 1,000 for every MP. We now need to keep up the pressure on MPs to give us a #PeoplesVote.READ MORE: 
Theresa May is right, #Brexit is about the future of the UK ... and she is selling the UK into slavery to the EU. @Conservatives are being blamed for this. They either get back on track with a new leader or they will suffer the dreaded Portillo fate.

Whenever I argue that #Article50 could be extended as a way out of the #Brexit impasse, I am asked: but what about the European Elections in May 2019?In this blog post I conclude there's no major hurdle to organising #EP2019, even in UK
So the Tories are demanding confidential papers on #Indyref2 from Scotgov. Ahhhhhhhhaahahaha - Heres an idea. Tories give Scotgov all of your papers on #brexit then Scotland will talk about it! | #Scotref
Looks like @MichelBarnier is meeting the whole spectrum of British #Brexit opinion this week. 
In the tradition of Cornish shanty singing, we sang this at the #PeoplesVoteMarch on Saturday: What shall we do with this rotten #Brexit?Let's have a vote & see who wants it!#PeoplesVote
It’s still surprising to me how many CEOs and financial experts agree on #Brexit being severely detrimental to the UK economy and yet we still seem to be steaming at full power towards a trainwreck.... 
8/10 firms say #Brexit has had a negative effect on investment decisions, according to our latest research on business preparations. Businesses’ reluctance to invest will have a knock-on effect for jobs, wages and living standards. Find out more -

On Saturday there were almost three-quarters of a million people demanding a #PeoplesVote on whatever the Government staggers back from Brussels with.  If #Brexit, the way it's turned out is really the will of the people, prove it. LET US DECIDE! #PeoplesVoteMarch @peoplesvote_uk
If only there was an opposition to stop it Clare @Hepworthclare. The will is certainly there from the people I marched with on Saturday, sooooooo many angry, disenfranchised, disappointed @UKLabour members and voters that I spoke to who will not support a Corbyn #Brexit either. 
Drive on lads we’re 95% there. #Brexit 
David Davis is one of the reasons Brexit is in such a mess, says James O'Brien. Why on earth would we make him Prime Minister?@mrjamesob | #Brexit
Theresa May: "What we've put forward in terms of #Brexit is something that works for all communities in Northern Ireland." Also Theresa May: 
This is an important point. #Brexit is become more and more contentious because Brexiters keep on changing what it means. Nothing that has happened in the last two years - exit single market, customs union, crash out - was on the ballot paper.

My brother is a whistleblower who is now fighting to change the media led governance in U.K. Please follow and support his work. Judicial review of May’s decision to block #LEVESON2 happens in 2 weeks. It will be a game changer. Remember the media pushed #Brexit.

When the #Brexit dust settles, many prominent Remainers are going to reflect on their treatment of Jeremy Corbyn with a combination of shame and embarrassment. None more so than @JolyonMaugham.
A view from the border: Ireland on the brink of #Brexit.“Suddenly it is Ireland and not Britain that appears to be the adult in this dysfunctional family.” 
Afraid ERG/Rees-Mogg mantra "We want a change of #Brexit policy, not a change of PM" is rapidly becoming transparently-thin excuse for doing nothing.Must be obvious now to all that there will be no change of Brexit policy *without* a change of PM.#ChuckChequers means #ChuckMay
My thoughts on @DominicRaab’s #brexit backstop comments in today’s @telegraph
Michael O'Leary(CEO, Ryanair) - #Brexit is a shambles. #Brexit is a disaster & it's a disaster for the UK economy. To leave the biggest free trading area.. so a couple of halfwits in the Tory Party can do "great deals" with smaller economies.. is insane.#peoplesvote #FBPE
Hundreds of thousands of you took the streets on Saturday to demand a #PeoplesVote, but the battle is not yet won. The next few week may be the most critical in the entire #Brexit process so far. Now is the time to take action, to write to your MPs & #WriteThisWrong - here's how:
As a #Labour MP, I often disagree with @theresa_may & think she is making a mess of #Brexit but I found the violent language used by some Tory MPs about the PM in this weekend’s papers nasty, offensive and totally unacceptable. They should hang their heads in shame & stop.
“Having put a lot of pressure on us to vote a certain way and being disappointed, the establishment is now trying to find a backdoor way to keep Britain essentially in the EU -- that’s what May’s plan is all about.”Larry Elliott on #Brexit
Quick poll please rt:Are remainiacs lying about attendance figures from #PeoplesVoteMarch ? #PeoplesVote #Brexit
May's two #brexit concessions:-First, she agreed to consider extending the transition period- Then, she signaled she’s willing to drop a key time limit on the Irish backstop clause, opening the possibility that the U.K. will be bound indefinitely to the bloc’s customs rules

.We also need to do more to reduce the use of antibiotics in farming & not just here in the UK. It won’t be a ‘#Brexit dividend’ if we are flooded with cheaper meat from intensively reared animals that have been stuffed with antibiotics, & terrible for animal welfare too
PM’s claim “deal 95% done” is utter misrepresentation, designed to make you think #Brexit is nearly over...when reality is divorce terms are merely clearing of the throat before arduous five years+ negotiation on future trading relationship. More like 5% done! (Ask Singapore...) 
#John Major on #Brexit: a ‘colossal misjudgment’ that could break up UK. “There is irony here: over 70 years ago, Britain stood alone to fight for Europe, now we freely choose to stand alone and, in so doing, undermine Europe. 
No we are winners, because our country will no longer be on a ratchet to a United States of Europe. #Brexit will go ahead, we’ll get our country back & the #EU will be chucked into the dustbin of history where it belongs! #LosersVote
Sometimes popculture knows best #brexit Photograph by Justin Tiffany Case 
Theresa May says "It's not about me" ... It is about you Mrs May, we don't trust you to deliver the #Brexit that people voted for and we want a Brexiteer in charge of the process.
Pop facts matter. Geri actually had 4 UK No.1’s & 4 other UK Top 10 hits. Her solo career was well prepared, she had support from huge organisations & there was tremendous public goodwill towards her.Nothing like #Brexit 
"It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled" - Mark Twain #Brexit 
It is so easy to criticise someone from the sidelines. I doubt those criticising the PM for her #Brexit negotiations could survive an hour let alone a day or months in her job. It’s a incredibly tough job, and she has my full support and the admiration of the silent majority.

If Tory Remainers really wanted to act in the public interest over #brexit they would resign their party whip and stand in alliance with all the other parties to have a vote of no-confidence in the May Government. 10 MP's would be enough to form a "rainbow" government.
Massive crowds in London protesting for a second #Brexit vote. 
“What do we want?”“A #PeoplesVote”“When do we want it?”“Everytime we lose!”#BRexit #LeaveEU
Some Corbyn supporters say we must unite with Corbyn against the Tories & forget opposing Brexit. Brexit will hit the poor & vulnerable hardest. It can be stopped within 6 months. the rest can be done afterwards. And a #Brexit defeat will utterly shatter the Tories.#PeoplesVote
For all you unhappy Remoaners out there it’s time for some good news. I’m back @talkRADIO tomorrow morning. Don’t forget to tune in for my take on the #LosersMarch - unusually I start at 6.30am in for @JuliaHB1 - Don’t miss it #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
More risible #ProjectFear. So the ex-Head of MI6 has forgotten the Russians also assassinated Aleksander Litvinenko on British soil, in 2006, long before #Brexit was even being talked about.Comforting our spooks have such short memories, isn't it?    
Let's translate this from Lord Adonis:1 The march yesterday hasn't changed anything 2 Corbyn and his front bench are so useless they didn't even turn up3 Vote Labour anyway and get the useless idiots in government and hope they change #PeoplesVoteMarch #PeoplesVote #brexit

Praying that the @Conservatives party grows a spine next week and gets rid of @theresa_may and puts a REAL #Brexiteer in charge of the party. Either @Jacob_Rees_Mogg or @BorisJohnson will do. #Brexit
I voted remain in the #Brexit referendum, but the more I have seen of the EU's behaviour since I am now firmly in the leave camp. The EU is turning itself into a European superstate imposing itself on member states using economic power. This is reason enough to leave on its own.
A timely & thoughtful intervention by Sen. George Mitchell, the man who negotiated the #GFA, and certainly someone who certainly can’t be accused of any #Brexit fear mongering 
2. Make sure you have signed both the official #PeoplesVotePetition & the @Independent one. Send them both on to any friends & family who you know are concerned about #brexit. Let's not let apathy get in the way.(2) 
Noticed over last few days a few consistent "Corbyn wants soft #Brexit" supporters starting to like or even comment on Corbyn's silence on #PeoplesVoteMarch Think running to Geneva to avoid the biggest march in 10 years might be the final straw for a lot of people
@LBC when are you guys going to start fact checking #FarageOnLBC? Simply having @mrjamesob calling out Farage's bullshit isn't good enough anymore. Regular listeners to Farage's show deserve to know they're being taken for mugs.#Brexit#BrexitShambles
Husband: “We are the country that is driving straight into the ocean because satnav told us to go there.” #Brexit
"The disadvantage of being intelligent is that it hurts to watch someone act dumb.". #Brexit is a shambles, the UK government is an international laughing stock dragging Scotland down. Time to bail!

Last week @MichealMartinTD #Brexit wasn’t an excuse not to call an Election.  This week he,s saying an election would b bad.  Any wonder he and @fiannafailparty have No Credibility.  Labours Way.
Meanwhile on #Brexit protest in London  
Remainers are thick. The UK cannot legislate where the EU has competence. Though I agree those powers were not "robbed". They were given away freely by an indolent, narcissistic and arrogant political class. That is why #Brexit of itself is only half of the remedy. 
So let's commit natl suicide to save the faces of the worst bunch of politicians in decades?It resolves nothing.A #PeoplesVote at least salvages our democratic credentials.If we vote #Remain & #Reform we'll repair & renew. If not #Brexit happens & we're still in the ****
None of the #Brexit options still available for May can get sufficient support in Parliament. (via @InFactsOrg)
“History will remember him as the Prime Minister who ripped the nation apart, then left others to try to clear up the mess.” Sorry to personalise. But this comment is spot-on. #Brexit 
The Observer: "Hard Tory #Brexit-ers worship a past that never existed while hailing a future that will never materialise." Spot on!
I have not seen one Brexiter willing to take responsibility for the failings of #Brexit. Not one! They all have to blame someone else, even fellow Brexiters. You cannot take back control when you won't accept responsibility.Let's start taking back control with a #PeoplesVote!
Just remember this. If the people most affected by #Brexit, 16-17 year olds, EU27 citizens in the UK and Britons abroad for 15+ years had been allowed to vote #Brexit would have been soundly defeated.#Brexit is unfair and unjust. We need a #PeoplesVote
"I swear to god that businesses are more worried about a Corbyn government than any form of Brexit."@AndrewCastle63 | #Brexit
One thing leavers were right about is that it's a lot easier to give power away than it is to get back. Having done so without consent we now see that we gave away more than our politicians realised. That's why they're not trusted and that's why compromise is impossible.#Brexit
Anything is possible with #Brexit, including a snap General Election. We must be ready.**Sign our new @Remain_Labour petition, calling on @jeremycorbyn to guarantee that a #Labour GE manifesto would pledge a #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain**
Not much to brag about when you failed to join the 2nd biggest demonstration in British history. By failing to oppose #Brexit you'll let the hard/far right get exactly what they want.And you're trailing this shambolic government in the polls. 
We already HAD the "#peoplesvote" - and the people voted to #LEAVE! It seems like #TomBaldwin (#EdMiliband's spin doctor) didn't read the question.... PATHETIC !  #StandUp4Brexit @DCBMEP @andreajenkyns @BrexitStewart @BorisJohnson @johnredwood #Brexit #UK
Hearing leading #Brexiter politicians now say that #Brexit is something that the UK 'can survive', is a bit like saying an unnecessary amputation without anesthetic is something you 'can survive'.Why would you do either?#BrexitShambles
As @Jon_Danzig writes in his blog today, ‘If the UK was run on the same democratic principles as the #EU, then we couldn't do #Brexit without the agreement of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.’ Please widely share his in-depth report #FinalSay
Irish gov source - in @IrishMailSunday - “the DUP will be told ‘cause an election if you like, and then take your chances with Jeremy Corbyn.’ Paper reports that UK Gov officials told EU & Irish that DUP would not be allowed to hold up a #brexit deal.
Irish Gov source involved in #brexit talks tells @leeofthemail “everyone is very relaxed over there (EU) as they all believe she’ll drop the DUP, throw them under the bus once the budget is through”
Why are brexiters so scared of a second vote? If leaving is what the UK want you should have nothing to worry about right? Truth is, thousands were mislead by #brexit campaign lies and want the opportunity to vote on facts. The leave camp know the result will be different. KD

It takes being ill to realise all this round-in-circles arguing on Twitter is exhausting and not worth it half the time. Entrenched views are entrenched views. Most of the #Brexit noise on here = monotanous echo chambering, not informed debate/exchange of ideas #zzzzzzz
750,000....?? @peoplesvote_hq ! #MetPolice reckon approx 150,000.. If you grid square locations where all the marches were and assume 5 people per square metre then approx 200,000 tops! More deluded #REMAINER lies! #LosersMarch #LosersVote #PeoplesVote #PeoplesMarch #BREXIT 
This is astonishing. The Conservative  Party are inflicting enormous damage to higher education and research. And with a hard #Brexit it’s going to get worse. 
Utter nonsense from @patrickharvie. Scotland went into #indyref with no clear plan on currency or EU membership, and we also had oil revenue projections which were negligent at best. Foure years later what's changed? Despite #Brexit, the argument for #IndyRef2 is no stronger.
The #PeoplesVoteMarch was genuinely cross-party Large numbers of Labour voters attended. This backs up credible research showing that around four in five Labour members want a #FinalSay on #Brexit So @jeremycorbyn , get off the fence!Back a #PeoplesVote
David Owen on why #Chequers has been dead from day 1. #Brexit 
Very misleading to use "no deal" to mean "no TRADE deal". It actually means no withdrawal agreement. That means no transitional period. Also means a hard border between NI and Ireland, and a last-minute scurry for side deals to keep transport links between EU and UK open. #brexit
Do you read foreign press? The national humiliation has already happened. The UK is a laughing stock. Our allies are bemused at what we're becoming.A reversal of #Brexit will be viewed as the country coming to its senses, regaining its pragmatism and rightful place in Europe. 
Simon Allison on why the @Conservatives obsession with #Brexit betrays everything the party has stood for. The party would do well to heed the fact that this has undermined our support base. The voices of a few activists cannot compensate for the loss of millions of voters. 
Graham thinks you have to have wine to not like Corbyn. I’m having sweet tea currently and I still think Corbyn is rubbish. Anyone else? #WheresJeremyCorbyn #PeoplesVoteMarch no #lexit or #Brexit 
All you get from #Brexiters these days is 'you lost' Never do they attempt to persuade, cajole or change minds by citing the benefits of #Brexit.Is it because they've forgotten or mislaid them? Or is it because they no full well there are no benefits?
Cameron opened a can of virulent worms # EURef and subsequent #Brexit.The EU is the issue that has riven the Tories for 40 yrs. & as the current contortions demonstrate - #Brexit will NOT heal those divisions.The EU has been the Nemesis of Tory leaders & will also *do* for May
UK rally calling for #Brexit re-vote draws 700,000 people, largest protest since Iraq war. 
Brexit was NEVER about chucking foreigners out. There is a desire to have more control over borders but hard working people from the EU who have made our country their home are always welcome deal or no dealThe EU must reciprocate! #marr #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch #PeoplesVote

Thought of The Day .............................Never a truer word spoken #Brexit #ImIn #Hackney
Whether it be suppressing Catalonians, aiding Saudi Arabia's genocide in Yemen, arming fascist militias in Ukraine, or financing and supporting ISIS here in Syria, a great many Europeans seem to only respect "democracy", let alone morality, when it suits them. #Brexit
But he can support one that decimates a whole range of other key economic sectors ( some more important to his own constituency) such as hospitality , agriculture , pharmaceuticals, food  and research and even areas such as health and social care .  #Brexit #hypocrisy
I don't live in the #UK. I live in Syria. Regardless, many British people constantly dictate to me the superiority of their morality and, supposed, "democracy". Here's a question then - why should the result of a second #Brexit vote be honoured if you can't even honour the first?
If anyone is aiding and abetting a Tory #Brexit, it's the politically toxic Alastair Campbell droning on about a 2nd referendum ad nauseam. If he's the best spokesman the #FBPE brigade have got, God help them. Corbyn is wise to keep as far away from that proven liar as possible.
MP @MPphilwilson speaking at #PeoplesVoteMarch talks about how #Brexit is a symptom but not a cure for the problems people are facing. Calling for a #PeoplesVote
Brexiters are #RunningScared of a #PeoplesVote, because they know the majority will see through the lies and fantasies of 2016 and will kick their shitfest of a tax-dodgers' #Brexit into the dustbin reserved for delusional national projects.
In a Glasgow hairdressers, listening to a pensioner explain why #Brexit is great because of all the Pakistanis coming here with "suitcases of cash" after Pakistan independence, which Brexit will stop apparently. I really despair for this society.
Patriotism is when one seeks to prevent harm being done to one's country @AndrewMarr9 ..the approach to #Brexit has already done irreparable harm to the UK, more to come & an entire  level of Rights will be Removed w/o Consent.Do the math.Who are the Patriots?#PeoplesVoteMarch
If you weren't able to make it to the #PeoplesVoteMarch yesterday, you can see all of the speeches plus some amazing helecopter footage of the 700,000 person crowd in this video:The campaign for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit is growing every day. Please RT!
Many people I speak to in the academic community are, like Billy, rethinking their position on independence. Facing a brutal #Brexit, with the accompaniment of the most dangerous xenophobia, people are now considering which union is most important to them. 
Listened to a bit of Farage on LBC with @Andrew_Adonis Seemed a microcosm of the #Brexit debate: Adonis’s reasoned, calm facts shouted over by the boorish, fearful and ill-informed.
#Ridge - You previously said a #NoDealBrexit would be great... do you still think that is true? Suella Braverman(#brexit minister) - It will be something this country will be able to survive... it won't be a walk in the park.We've gone from sunlit uplands to survival #marr
This is my dad, Brian. He’s 88. He lived through WW2 and helped rebuild this country. He knows the value of the #EU to the #UK and is  very angry about #Brexit Dad couldn’t make the march in London but here he is spreading the word in his nursing home near StratforduponAvon 
Andrew Adonis runs rings around Farage over #Brexit - LBC @LBC
OK so we lost on Friday night. I get that.But we don't have to take it lying down. Whos up for getting a few Wednesdayites together, marching down Division Street and demanding the match gets replayed?? And we can keep replaying it til we win?? #swfc #Brexit
A super thread comprehensively illustrating the utter inadequacy of Tory MP @CPhilpOfficial in any role in society that involves separating fact from fiction, let alone public office.#Brexit 
Whether Theresa May is axed or limps on, all the government’s choices for leaving the EU are hopeless. Asking people if they still want #Brexit is the only sensible option.
No true believer in the #Labour party of @frankfieldteam can possibly claim to be passionate Remainers. The Labour that believes in the EU is the Labour of the luvvie, metropolitan, middle class. What happened to the party that put British workers first? #brexit

Dear rUK, those of you citing @NicolaSturgeon re #brexit you do know her @theSNP spent more money on a by election than they did on Remain. She's an opportunist and a Charlatan.
Britain’s attitude to Ireland over #Brexit is sharply reminding the Irish what our problem with Britain always was - it sees Ireland as a vassal state.  It thinks it owns us.NEVER AGAIN!#BrexitShambles
Oh dear! You appear to have missed the news. There was a march to stop the rise of fascism, preserve NI peace, protect workers rights, save our NHS & combat climate change. All in one march! Because #Brexit will affect all those issues. #PeoplesVoteMarch
Please RT, it is crucial that those who never thought about implications for Northern Ireland when they voted in the #Brexit referendum realise what’s a stake #PeopesVote
A remarkable feature of #Brexit is the manner in which knowledge about #GFA & #Ireland has deepened across #Europe-many Europeans can’t get their heads around the risks U.K. us willing to take on this issue.

I remember this contribution well in EU Parl. It was a time when many of us looked to British leadership and vision to help shape an optimistic and ambitious future TOGETHER for an enlarged EU. We need UK leadership again today to keep the EU and UK close post #Brexit 
I have just clicked what # GTTO is all about and can only conclude that it will suffer the same fate as # PCPEU. I think the country would vote @UKLabour in the biggest landslide in history were it not for Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn and his deluded vision of #Brexit.

Frank Field says its a myth Labour was always pro-EU. Every time he has voted against the EU there were two men always there with him: Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonell. #Brexit 
There were never visas to visit France before the EEC from the UK, the current French president Macron wanting them post #Brexit - proving he's just an arsehole! #marr #marrshow

Really?  People’s Vote March is low down running order on #Marr - looks like he is doing his BBC best to ignore anyone who opposes #Brexit.
Hello labour press team. Are you stuck in a bunker? You obviously didn’t see over 700,000 people marched in London yesterday to demand a say on the deal. #brexit breaks Britain, threatens the Union and shafts the poor. There is NO jobs first Brexit. Stop lying. #peoplesvote
Britain needs the backbone of Thatcher to deal with these EU bully boys  #Brexit

"Let's get back to being the British Empire again".The insanity of #Brexit is beyond normal comprehension now. Whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad.Incredible video capturing the insanity of Britain. 
READ: "I want to tell my grandkids that at least I tried" - People from across the UK joined us yesterday at the #PeoplesVoteMarch to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
#PeoplesVoteMarch : Take Back Control! Let the people decide! Pro-Brexit or anti-Brexit, we all deserve a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. As part of the EU, Britain can better stop climate change, corporate tax evasion, pollution & consumer rip-offs @peoplesvote_uk
Yes @campbellclaret, #Brexit was very different from the Iraq issue.We're not telling lies that will lead to a million deaths, or leaving prominent scientists lying dead in the woods.You are literally trash.#Ridge
The terrible realization is dawning that @theresa_may has no plan whatsoever other than to keep us in  a transitioning limbo #Brexit
#Brexit: Scottish Green Party formally back #PeoplesVote campaign
What a triumph! Almost 700,000 people demand a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit at the #PeoplesVoteMarch for the future. This is Europe!We've turned the tide! 
Our new survey published today shows that 8 in 10 firms say #Brexit has had a negative effect on their #investment decisions, while the majority will implement their contingency plans by December, if there is no further certainty. Read the survey here
"Civil servants have reportedly begun contingency planning for a second #Brexit referendum amid fears #TheresaMay is unable to get parliament to back a deal."
We've marched against #austerity a few times in London over the last few yrs..#austerity the very thing that caused #Brexit in the first place, forgotten communities etc..@Anna_Soubry where were you then? We've marched in favour of the #NHS. Where were you then?
Jeremy Corbyn represents an alternative to the failed neoliberal/neocon political consensus that led to #Brexit. Alastair Campbell, Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry and Vince Cable represent the neoliberal/neocon status quo. Why the hell would Corbyn have anything to do with them? #Marr
Well they've got one thing right.... We are ALL losers from #Brexit...  I mean I find this whole Ad campaign slightly odd, do they not realise we are campinging for a vote for EVERYONE not just Remainers? They are People too, so they are calling themselves losers...  
Blaming Jeremy Corbyn for #Brexit is like blaming Susan Sarandon for Donald Trump. Brexit and Trump are the symptoms. 40yrs of uninterrupted neoliberal/neocon policies are the cause. Corbyn and Bernie Sanders are the cure. It certainly ain't Chuka Umunna or Hillary Clinton.
They've had their wee tantrum & had their big 'protest'.It's now over & we're en route to #Brexit (159 days left).There will BE no #PeoplesVote, no "2nd Referendum" & no amount of further crying will change that.Can we now focus on getting #Brexit right?
And like all fascist language an immense and blatant fraud : Bannon has regularly been funded by an ultra rich elite who want  an ever more privileged existence.  Bannon helps by pursuing far right policies that dismantle rights & protections for ordinary citizens - like #Brexit 
WATCH & RETWEET what really happened at the anti-Brexit rally in London yesterday.These people are seriously cray cray. #Brexit #Remainers
#Brexit is not worth the economic and social damage it is certain to cause in the UK. It is most certainly not worth the threat to #Peace it poses in #Ireland. We HAVE to stop it NOW. We can't let the fascists win. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote @PoliticsFestDub
Yesterday I was waiting for a German TV crew (ZDF) to get tube tickets, when a woman came up to me, "Good luck today, I'm Irish & #Brexit is going to kill my country. I don't know what we can do about it." All I could do was look her in the eyes & say "We're going to stop it."

The "Losers' Vote" march - Another great Sunday #Brexit article by the Brexit Facst4EU team, after the EU attack on Poland.  Full story is here: 
EU imposes law on Poland. @Jacob_Rees_Mogg 's vassal state is already here. Essential Sunday #Brexit reading: 
"They do not see that on a planet of finite resources, sharing is a necessity, not a choice. They do not realise the British are Europe’s citizens, too.. [They] worship a past that never existed while hailing a future that will never materialise." #Brexit
Billions? British empire? Is this man stuck in some time wharp? Someone needs to tell him there is no empire, in fact the very UK itself is on the verge of extinction, #Brexit is seeing to that.

Sir Michael Caine on #Brexit: 'I'd Rather Be a Poor Master of My Fate' Than a Slave to EU Bureaucrats  via @cnsnews
I voted #Remain There shouldn't be a second vote on #Brexit because that would make a mockery of #democracy but if there is a second vote I'll be voting #Leave #EUHaveYourSay
The concessions #TheresaMay has made to the #EU have been truly horrendous. May is a #NevilleChamberlain wannabe whose #Brexitdeal is attempting to separate #NorthernIreland from the UK & is overturning #Brexit to trap the #UK under perpetual EU rule. May is an #enemyofthepeople!
Look at Europe last year. This is what we are facing, folks. Same attack both sides of Atlantic. Undoubtedly some of these men now are trying to arrange another vote in Britain so they can reverse the #Brexit result given by British citizens. #caravan
'In short, hard Tory #Brexiters worship a past that never existed while hailing a future that will never materialise.'The #BrexitShambles can't be legit w/o a #PeoplesVote to Confirm the maj Will.If a maj want to Stop #Brexit how dare MPs deny it! 
A really exciting thing happened yesterday.We were a mere 160 days away from #Brexit.Then the frothers had their #PeoplesVoteMarch & sang a lot of weirdo songs.And guess what?Now it's 159 days until #Brexit.Well done all.
And please don't forget those of us ... about 1,000 ... who turned out in Belfast.  #brexit #stopbrexit
Protests and the will to change things did not end with the #Brexit referendum. In a democracy, people have the right to change their minds and overturn whatever they dislike!  
When a biased #BBC reporter asks #MichaelCaine if he still supports #Brexit, the legendary actor speaks up for the will of the #British people. We must control our own destiny as a nation!   #StandUp4Brexit #SKY #LBC @LBC @DCBMEP
But it is dismissed, as we are told #Brexit was a "United Kingdom vote".Such a dismissal suggests a UK which is not, in fact, a "union" but merely a "Greater England", always subject to English majoritarianism.That just isn't going to fly in Scotland or NI in the 2020s.2/2
Well I never. Endorsement of #democracy from Andrew Neil. I’ll take that big time. #PeoplesVoteMarch#london#brexit 
IF we leave the EU, there would indeed be a threat to workers’ rights which would need to be countered. We protect rights at European level to avoid a race to the bottom. What the #Tory Govt would do if we #Brexit and drop out of EU standards doesn’t bear thinking about.
Two hundred and eleventy billion eligible UK voters descended on London today for the #PeoplesMarchVote.What did they achieve, other than a wee day out?159 days to #Brexit 
What an AMAZING day at the #PeoplesVoteMarch !! Thanks SO MUCH to the incredible team @peoplesvote_hq the thousands of volunteers and the over 700,000 who turned up to demand a @peoplesvote_uk to get us out of this #Brexit chaos! #PeoplePower #FinalSayForAll 
I don't understand this. Remainers like @Anna_Soubry have spent the last two years telling us that #Brexit is not "the will of the people" because only 17.4 million out of an electorate of 46 million voted to leave. So if 700,000 were on #PeoplesVoteMarch, 45.3 million weren't...
At a Dublin concert, an English performer mentions a well-known radio programme.Well-known to him that is. No-one near me has ever heard of it.Lads, #Brexit is hard enough for Irish people to take.It would help a little if you all realizedIRELAND IS A DIFFERENT COUNTRY.Ta.
Fucking ridiculous. Sorry. Get this man out. Our country is in constitutional crisis. Our democracy under attack from foreign influence. And we have some back bench activist wandering around unable to lead any effective opposition. Enough is enough #Peoplesvote #brexit 
We need to avoid this total madness & win back our futures - Delia Smith speaks out against #Brexit at #PeoplesVote
Important to note 700k people *showed up in person* to demand a say. I’m certain there are millions more all over the WORLD who also want to vote again knowing the facts, not fantasy. #brexit #PeoplesMarchVote #PeoplesVote #stopbrexit
If it gets to March 2019 & #Brexit hasn't been aborted, I hope @peoplesvote_uk have been planning the next protest march that will need to he even bigger than the #PeoplesVoteMarch today.We'll be facing an emergency situation and a massive political crisis. #FinalSay
Bill Cash: People’s Vote march insult to democracy.We've already had People’s Vote authorised by Parliament.This is authorised by nobody!Except reversers to take us back into utterly undemocratic #EU trying to bully & intimidate British people.#Brexit
Such resounding numbers cannot be dismissed.  As #Brexit bears no resemblance to what was promised, more and more people demand a right to reconsider... 
Utter shower, abrogation of responsibility"What can Corbyn do on #Brexit?"He can f**king march with his members for a start 
@warren_oates  Do you speak for 17.4M uk  Citizens who voted with fully open eyes and considered judgment? Happily we live in a Democracy. Please celebrate that, and respect the vote of the Majority. Uk  #Brexit #Leave #Out
Your lack of knowledge on this fundamentally important issue has been seriously exposed in this thread. It wouldn’t matter if you weren’t in a key position of influence and power. But you are. I despair #Brexit
This was no vote accident... #Brexit 
700,000 on the #PeoplesVoteMarchFewer than 1500 at the Pro #Brexit equivalent in Harrogate.BBC article gives first quote in their story to...Nigel Farage.Come on guys, nobody could credibly call this 'balanced' reporting...
I’m a member of @UKLabour. I voted #Remain.I voted for @JeremyCorbyn in the 2nd Leadership Election AFTER the #Brexit ref.I voted Labour in the GE AFTER the #Brexit ref.I would vote Labour again tomorrow. Brexit belongs entirely to the Tories.I stand with Jeremy Corbyn!
Where is Jeremy Corbyn? Utter disgrace. Move aside so we can have an effective opposition leader. #loser #PeoplesVoteMarch #Brexit is NOT a done deal  Well done every single person in #London today. What a day. What a turnout.
Could the Brexiters manage to assemble nearly 700,000 people to demand that Britain proceed headlong into the monumental mess that is #Brexit?Not a chance. The only counterprotestors we saw today were these sad sacks.#peoplesvotemarch
It's beyond leaving the EU now. This is about liberty, justice and democracy. We are at the brink of losing all three if #brexit goes ahead. Supporters of leave are happy to deny these to anyone who disagrees with them. #peoplesvote
Tens of thousands of opponents to #Brexit protested on the streets of #London today, demanding a second referendum. Brexit supporters argue that the "People's Vote Moment" is simply made up of sore losers.
Are you flipping serious? Why is this Jeremy Corbyn's fault because he didn't go on a march? Why did you back Cameron and then May those very people who brought us #Brexit? #Hypocrites
17.4 million voted to leave the EU and 16.1 million to remain. 700k (allegedly) protested today for a second peoples vote. How on earth that shows a need for a 2nd vote only two years after the first god only knows! Let those numbers sink in! #Brexit

Here’s the thing #FBPE If so many of you hadn’t voted Tory, there would be no #Brexit to deal with. #Simples
The marchers were right on Iraq.... and they are right on #Brexit. 
Complete silence from @UKLabour while at least 700,000 people march against #Brexit.  This could have been an election winning shoe-in but you've just lost a lot of support.  It's quite simple, if you're not supporting #remain you're supporting #brexit.
It was amazing to be at the #PeoplesVoteMarch today.700k people having fun with no aggression.Shame it had to be dispersed at the end because 20 #Brexit fascist thugs turned up looking to cause trouble.What a great day. Now let's get a #PeoplesVote
My pro #Brexit neighbours shuffled their feet and looked embarrassed today as I spoke of the #PeoplesMarch They know we're in a mess and have no answers, except to talk of foreign invaders claiming benefits. I fear the result was tinged with racism #peoplesvote
My #Brexit ballot paper saidRemain in the EUOrLeave the EUNotMake a conditional offer and see what the “price” is, a bit like your preferred car/mortgage analogy, then vote againHow about yours?
#London came to a standstill today. This is the will of the people. This is democracy. This is the Great in Britain. #peoplesvotemarch is simply asking for a say on the deal. Is #brexit what we were promised? Why can’t we think again? Well done to everyone there today x 
Be warned, @UKLabour. You are out of touch & are moving further & further away from the people who form your core. This will end in disaster. Wake up, support the people - and ditch your suicidal support for the #Brexit Britain does not want. #fbpe #ofoc #ffs #peoplesvote
An amazing day marching with some wonderful people for #PeoplesVote.  We all have a democratic right to simply say “No” and this was our moment to shout “No” to #Brexit.  We must try to stop this nonsense! #PeopleVoteMarch
Judging by the state of Twitter, I'm glad I just spent 13 hours on a plane w/out comms#Brexit is important, but I'd love to know where most of these people have been during the fight against austerity & the misery its caused this country's most vulnerable #PeoplesVoteMarch
Who is actually behind all this? Because @BBCNews & currrent affairs haven't been covering #Brexit to basic journalistic standards of impartiality with normal news judgement, for at least 18 months.
Powerful concluding speech by @SeamasBelfast at today's #Rally4Remain at Belfast City Hall, outlining why the people on the island of Ireland won't let #brexit destroy their hard-fought peace agreement.#RallyForRemain /cc @SorchaEastwood @naomi_long @brendanjharkin
The Labour Party on #Brexit: an abdication of leadership on a historic scale #lestweforget
Remainers headed by May's government like to bang on about how #Brexit divided the nation. Well, guess what? Every single election divides people into winners and losers. Remainers have lost but are trying to present it as if it's a sign of a divided nation.
If #Brexit threatens workers’ rights and jobs @jeremycorbyn, then surely the right thing to do is fully commit to a #PeoplesVote with the choice of remaining in the EU on the ballot.
“I am very worried about the future for my children & grandchildren. That’s true for all of us angry grannies.” Granddads too, believe me. #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch
I was amongst those who marched against the illegal war in #Iraq, and I also voted for "Remain" #Brexit. However, you will never see me marching behind "war criminals" #Blair #Campbell. I stand behind men of peace and integrity  #Galloway #Corbyn.

We do not know the level of crisis and the duration of suffering for UK if we have a hard #Brexit . What we know for sure is that if Europe dissolve the next years as many expect, Britain will have won one of the biggest bets of last decades and will have a tremendous advantage. 
Dear Fellow #Patriots The judge about #Grooming gang: "Pure Evil"Greatest common divisor: According to their IDEOLOGY this is 'normal' OK Britain, your next #Brexit march against violence to your children? Faces names naming and shaming 
Heart rending stuff. Businesses come in all shapes and sizes. Fishermen are entrepreneurs in every sense - resilient, hard working and self reliant. #Brexit was their chance at renewal.We cannot let them be betrayed by the Establishment. 
It’s entirely possible to be against @campbellclaret’s stance on Iraq 15 years ago, and yet recognise that he’s totally correct on the clusterfuck that is #brexit.Indeed I reckon the vast majority of @UKLabour supporters would agree.#PeoplesVoteMarch
Inspired by the 700,000 on #PeoplesVoteMarch and want to join our campaign to ensure #Labour backs a #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain?Please take 60 seconds to sign up to our mailing list and join our movement.#Brexit is not inevitable 
Today's #PeoplesVoteMarch showed that the #PeoplesVote campaign us a major force in UK politics.  @DanielZeichner @heidiallen75 @lucyfrazermp @JDjanogly @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer take heed and give the UK a vote on any #Brexit deal with the option to stay in the EU! 
Amazing day with over 700,000 people marching to demand a say on the final Brexit deal. Great to see people from all over the UK and all walks of life coming together to stop this chaotic Tory #Brexit. Democracy in action! 
In the last year no fewer than 75 official polls were carried out on #Brexit. Out of those 75, only 2 showed a lead for #leave. Our politicians have simply run out of excuses. Public opinion has changed. WE MUST NOT LEAVE THE EU. The British people unequivocally reject it.
Young, old and everyone inbetween, a fantastic peaceful protest, time to give the people a voice again. Whitehall was stickered @peoplesvote_uk #PeoplesMarch #PeoplesMarchVote #brexit 
"It's not good for our children's future and I just think we need a rethink"Hundreds of thousands of people join protest in London calling for referendum on final #Brexit deal  [tap video to expand]
Total disgrace that Jeremy Corbyn doesn't even have anything to say about 650,000 people marching against #Brexit. The real question about Corbyn is no longer Where, but Why and What the hell is he for?
350 million went on the #PeoplesVoteMarch. One for each of the 350 million lies on the fascist Farage's red bus. If each one paid £1, they could pay Britain's EU contributions for a week. #Brexit isn't worth it. 
LOL1. Lying about the numbers2. 17.4m already voted to leave3. “We can win this” means subvert democracy & stop #Brexit from taking place4. She wants another referendum because the first one didn’t come up with the answer she wanted#LosersDayOut
If you laid on free buses from here to John o'groats you'd be hard pushed to get a pro #brexit march 1/10 of the size of this.Yet we're not represented by the Tories or even, despite the members best efforts, by Labour, who are essentially siding with them#PeoplesVoteMarch
Amazing!New estimates suggest some 700,000 people are marching in Central #London demanding a #PeoplesVote on any #Brexit deal/no deal! #PeoplesVoteMarch
.@Telegraph cartoon#Brexit #plasticpollution #Chequers
And it has shown that there is more passionate will for the UK to #Remain in the #EU than there is for #Brexit. #Leave simply cannot, and have not, motivated this level of public support. #Farage may bribe a few into a scruffy pub with the offer of a free beer, but that's it.
#brexitCertainly starting to look that way. Think back to just after she was put in post by @Conservatives MPs. Seeming flurries of activity but no real info. Eventually, periodic vacuous speeches, conveying nothing of value. Then the sellout #ChequersPlan.  We've been played :/
Truly moving to see so many young faces today at the #PeoplesVoteMarch - they know they are being robbed of something precious. Nearly 2 million younger voters today had no voice in 2016 - surely, given all we now know, they deserve a say on their own future? #EndTheChaos #Brexit 
A simple message to Parliament.Push the button to enable a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit. Let we the people vote on the facts of Brexit and decide if we still want it before the point of no return next March.#peoplesvotemarch
If the #labour leadership had been at the front and leading today's #PeoplesVoteMarch, they would have taken HUGE steps forward in the polls. Sadly, they have not been seen or heard from. Nonetheless, the fight against #Brexit goes on
If people's vote were out there demanding a referendum on Efta membership I would be out there with them. But they lack that kind of pragmatism and vision. #Brexit

All those Tory and Labour MPs, committed to a catastrophic #Brexit , did you hear the hundreds of thousands of voices on the #PeoplesVoteMarch ? They demand better than a job-culling, influence-destroying, isolating #BrexitThey demand a #PeoplesVote  a chance to #StopBrexit
To those that marched today I salute you. No one voted to be poorer. No one voted to stockpile food and medicine. We need to stop this chaotic #Brexit process and call a #PeoplesVote. #PeoplesVoteMarch
People's Vote march: Hundreds of thousands attend London protest Long way short of the 17.4 million people who voted for #Brexit

Joan O’Brian is back! Out with other desperate Remainiacs campaigning for a second vote on Brexit. After all, half the people who voted LEAVE are racist. Or dead. #Brexit 
One would think @Conservatives would have 48 MPs with a spine 2 save #Brexit & the tory party from oblivion.I find it suspect that the transition betrayal comes same time as #LosersMarch & the increased remain trolling on social media; its almost like a co-ordinated effort
If I work on the assumption your figures are accurate, you are still 16.7 million short of the real peoples vote that happened in 2016. Only 1 in 20 Remain voters have turned up. Time to accept the referendum and respect the result. #PeoplesVoleMarch #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
I voted out but now have changed my mind, think we were lied to, #Brexit
Even a bellend like you must realise that when 670K people mobilise to protest, then it is clearly no longer the will of the people. You had your chance to sell your vision of #Brexit and it has been roundly rejected by the people.
Lots of bots and trolls out today aren’t there?  some of the #FPBE tweets today are hilarious. I’m with you regarding #Brexit but Corbyn bashing is not the way to resolve the issue. The enemy is in 10 Downing Street .... unless that is you are a #Tory troll #Iseeyou
Meanwhile, out on the doorsteps of Boosbeck and Marton today...people tell me to get on with delivering #Brexit. London might as well be the moon. 
Frank Field speaks to Labour Leave about the Brexit vote, "it is the job of parliament to implement that decision" #Brexit #LosersVote
The #PeoplesVoteMarch: Over 500,000 people rally for new #Brexit referendum - the biggest march in the UK since the 2003 Iraq war protest. Second largest UK march since 1945. The people, not MPs or Government, must have the final say on Brexit  #PeoplesVote

Our Father Tony Benn looking down from heaven on the Rugby Club outing to Waitrose Burberry and Co today wouldn’t have had the heart not to laugh. Mr Benn could see clearly through the fog of privilege, class, obfuscation and he could see right through the #EU #Brexit 
I see this “oh if only Remainers had backed the Norway option we’d not be here” is doing the rounds. The #Brexit line May pursued was driven by her narrow party interests.And while Norway option isn’t so bad economically, it’s awful politically.Forget it. Resist still!
So after today’s #PeoplesVoteMarch where sore losers took to the streets to demand a second vote in the hope that they’ll win this time - THE PEOPLE’S VOTE RESULT STILL STANDS - WE WON! WE’RE LEAVING #Brexit#LeaveMeansLeave
Aerial footage shows 'hundreds of thousands' of people attending protest in London calling for a referendum on the final #Brexit deal

This is massive. Parliament and government must listen and legislate for a new vote that gives people a say on the final #Brexit deal. There also needs to be an option to stay in the EU if the deal’s not good enough - we can’t ignore the 48% that voted to remain #PeoplesVoteMarch
Blaming Jeremy Corbyn for #Brexit is like blaming Susan Sarandon for Donald Trump. Brexit and Trump are the symptoms. 40yrs of uninterrupted neoliberal/neocon policies are the cause. Corbyn and Bernie Sanders are the cure. It certainly ain't Chuka Umunna or Hillary Clinton.
Call to #EndTheChaos was heard loud and clear at the #PeoplesVoteMarch this afternoon - extraordinary range of people demanding that their voices be heard. Time to #LetThePeopleDecide on #Brexit! 
WATCH: this is HUGE!! Well over half a MILLION marching for @peoplesvote_uk from every walk of life and every part of Britain -amazing! Parliament must LISTEN and ACT. Please RT so everyone knows what’s happening here at #PeoplesVoteMarch #Brexit #FinalSay
Can you just imagine David Cameron, Theresa May, and Dominic Raab all just watching this unfold thinking: well, well, well, if this isn’t the consequences of our own actions.#PeoplesVoteMarch #Brexit
#PeoplesVoteMarch: Thousands take part in London protest calling for vote on final #Brexit deal 
In their insistence that #Brexit voters are fickle, dim and untrustworthy, continuity Remainers have revived some of the oldest and foulest anti-democratic prejudices, says Brendan O’Neill#PeoplesVoteMarch
  Tens of thousands of people opposed to #Brexit join the #PeoplesVoteMarch in a bid to convince Theresa May to hold a second referendum by @dmitryzaksAFP @niklashallen for @AFPphoto
What an amazing turnout at #PeoplesVoteMarch today! There must be a #peoplesvote on the final #Brexit deal including the option to remain in the EU. Don‘t let Leavers tell you otherwise 
#PeoplesVoteMarch.They will lie about the numbers.They will lie about their reasons for being there.They will lie over basic Brexit facts.They merely lie to themselves.#Brexit in 160 days, that's the truth. 
Crowd reaching Parliament Square ahead of 570,000 demanding a final #Brexit say on #PeoplesVoteMarch - great to see so many MPs here from across the parties, albeit if from the backbenches
Fantastic atmosphere on #PeoplesVoteMarch with plenty here from #Scotland @euromovescot #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope

.@Howard_Goodall, who knows whereof he speaks, on how #Brexit will devastate British music. Surely it’s unpatriotic to damage a successful UK export?  
Please join todays #PeoplesVoteMarch.Demand a final say on the future of your children.If we live in a #democracy this is how you prove it.Lets make the last #PeoplesMarch look like a warm-up!Bin #Brexit @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer@rickygervais @Protect_Wldlife @PeterEgan6
Proud to march to give voters a say on the #Brexit deal - 95% of our members back a #PeoplesVote! #PeoplesVoteMarch
Today I’m marching for a #peoplesvote and a second referendum on Brexit because I care about my country too much to give up on it. It’s time to end the chaos and take back control!...#peoplesmarch #peoplesvote #eu #brexit #brexitshambles #finalsay #togetheragainstbrexit
Hey Chuka muka, 17,410,742 eg 51.89% have already marched............to the ballot box, which is the way we conduct our democracy.  You lost.  Please just get over it and support #Brexit
 Our message to the Government 1. Democracy didn’t end on 23 June 2016.  2. A #PeoplesVote is the only democratic way forward.3. Our movement for a #FinalSay is growing fast - and with your chaotic handling of #Brexit, it will continue to grow. #PeoplesVoteMarch 
My favourite sign so far today on the #BrexitMarch #Brexit #PeopleVoteMarch
Wonderfully optimistic atmosphere at the #PeoplesVoteMarch today - come on down to Parliament Square to demand a #FinalSay on #Brexit! #EndTheChaos
So many people at today's #PeoplesVoteMarch!  Our MEPs are there to say that if the #Brexit decision is revised, the EU should welcome the UK back with open arms!  #PeoplesVote
#Whitehall absolutely packed. And this isn’t even the official start of the #PeoplesVoteMarch. That’s actually behind us. This is huge! Reported  estimates of well over half a million. #Brexit #FinalSay
Veterans from campaigns in Cyprus, The Gulf, Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Cold War, Afghanistan, Iraq parading against the cowardice of #Brexit The British never run... Lead not Leave #peoplesvotemarch
I'm marching at the #PeoplesVoteMarch - because in a court case, if your evidence comes out as false, you'd have a retrial. #Brexit #PeoplesVote

It’s all looking a bit white and middle class guys #FBPE #LosersMarch #PeoplesMarch #Brexit 
Thousands of people are in London to take part in a protest calling for a referendum on the final #Brexit deal - says @ChrisMasonBBC
So risks of #Brexit include worsening of #mentalhealth & suicide rates with poor people carrying burden, loss of ££ & staff for NHS & care homes & rise in intolerance that could harm national well-being. This is why so many in health care want a rethink.
The IRA doesn't get to veto the democratic will of the majority of British voters by stoking fear. As Margaret Thatcher said after they tried to assassinate her and murder her entire Cabinet: "..all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail." Democracy includes #Brexit 
This is superb! #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch #Wooferendum
Delighted to be here at the #PeoplesVoteMarch to see a wonderful mix of people trying to put an end to the #Brexit madness 
Hitting @theresa_may where it hurts  #brexit #PeopesVoteMarch #antibrexitmarch #starwars #thephantommenace
At the #PeoplesVoteMarch : Take Back Control! Let the people decide! Pro-Brexit or anti-Brexit, we all deserve a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. European unity is needed to stop climate change, corporate tax evasion, pollution, consumer rip-offs @peoplesvote_uk
A walk in soft shoes chiffon scarves in a waft of expensive cologne, Waitrose bags bulging, does not “The People” make. Especially when it’s led by blood-soaked war criminals... #Brexit
One of my daughters is on the #PeoplesVoteMarch - it‘s a huge deal for her future. And I’ll hopefully be with you in Parliament Square later.... Giving British people the #FinalSay on #Brexit is the only way we’ll heal our divisions @peoplesvote_uk
.@EdwardJDavey says the Tory Govt #Brexit mess is an embarrassment. He says it is up to the #LibDems to make the case for the UK in Europe and a #FinalSay #ExitFromBrexit #PeoplesVoteMarch
Dogs gather around the Pee Station at Speakers Corner ahead of the #Wooferendum #PeopesVoteMarch. Dogs join us here & at the back of the march. #PeopesVote #PeoplesMarch #Brexit #StopBrexit #BrexitShambles
.@vincecable tells #LibDems they are the vanguard of the #ExitFromBrexit campaign. He says #Brexit is not inevitable and we are winning the fight for a #FinalSay #PeoplesVoteMarch
Waiting for the off!The Shropshire contingent on the #PeoplesVoteMarch gathers outside the Dorchester. To halt the #brexit mess, we need a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay referendum with option to #Remain leading to an #ExitFromBrexit
Expressing my sympathy to all those marching against #Brexit in #London and beyond in the #UK today #Europe is with you @europeanbalcony The time has come for Theresa May to tell the nation: Brexit can’t be done | Alastair Campbell | Opinion | The Guardian
Worsening economy isn’t only way #Brexit can harm #mentalhealth. Debate has condoned intolerance of difference - on race, nationality, religion. In clin practice we see effects of alienation that follows: isolation, psychosis, lives at risk.
Democracy is not just about votes as Brexiters pretend, it is about information. If voters lack sufficient information then a vote cannot be democratic. In 2016 they were very far from having the information needed to decide on whether to complete #Brexit#PeoplesVoteMarch
To all those marching for a 2nd referendum (and potentially a 3rd if the 2nd one doesn't go their way either) just remember you're marching for this fool to be our President #Brexit #Standup4Brexit #PeoplesVote #PeoplesVoteMarch #PVRoadTrip #FBPE
Second interview of the day, ahead of the #PeopesVoteMarch on Parliament — hope to see many of you there while we demand a #FinalSay. Let’s #EndTheChaos of #Brexit! 
I'm marching today for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit deal. Join us! Take back control. Let the people decide! Thanks to EU we have clean beaches, no roaming charges, visa-free travel in 27 countries, consumer protection  Via @peoplesvote_uk#PeoplesVoteMarch
Here is @damidude talking about why, despite voting leave in 2016, he is at #PeoplesVoteMarch.He is a #remainernow demanding a #finalsay on #brexit#PeoplesVote #stopbrexit
Sorry, @duponline, obviously NI and the UK aren’t different countries. NI can’t possibly be allowed to be any different from the rest of the UK #brexit. Unless you are gay & want to get married or you are #pregnant, then NI is a different fucking planet @TRPNI @Love_EqualityNI
Germany’s Der Spiegel/#Brexit talks: *How a nation is making a fool of itself: no other country has cultivated arrogance like the British. The sad truth is that the former world power can‘t even find its way to the exit without falling over its own feet* 
George told us there would be a recession if we voted to leave, hundreds of thousands of jobs would be lost, it would cost every household £4,300 #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch
After 2008 recession, suicide rate in England rose over next 4-5 years, esp in poorer areas, an extra 700 deaths/yr. This is the predictable risk we are taking with #Brexit.
Today is the #PeoplesVoteMarch in London.Also known as THE MARCH FOR THE VOTING IMPAIRED.The concept that we have already voted to leave the EU is something that has flown over the heads of these loons.Don’t waste your time on a counter march. Toast #Brexit at home 
Respect and thanks to everyone on the #PeoplesMarch today. Wish I could be there marching alongside you. For all our sakes, shout it loud and proud, we deserve a say on the final #brexit deal and the future of our country. @peoplesvote_uk
James McGrory - Good morning... it's a fabulous day for the #PeoplesVoteMarch. #Brexit shouldn't be decided by 650 MPs... it will affect all of us & it will affect all of us for generations.. so #brexit should be decided by all of us in a #PeoplesVote. #FBPE
These charlatans, more intent on imposing their minority wills on the ppl than the majority Will of the Ppl, have sought to subvert & flout every democratic attempt to hold them accountable or to scrutinise their increasingly invalid #Brexit coup.#PeoplesVoteMarch#PeoplesVote
BREAKING: The #PeoplesVote coach, carrying all the important potatoes for today's march to parliament, take a wrong turn. How unfortunate, tragic, never mind.#Brexit 
Thousands of young people will be heading the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. Why? Because they have the most to lose if #Brexit goes ahead. Brexit will steal the future opportunities of the UK's young, and must be stopped.
Get yourself along to Park Lane at midday if you want to tell the Government that #Brexit is not the will of the People.  Join the People's Vote March today! @peoplesvote_uk #BollockstoBrexit
At @peoplesvote_uk march in #London today? We'd love to collect some of your #placards afterwards! Help add to our collection of #protest material to keep this story growing. Send details to collections[at] #ideasworthcollecting #PeoplesVoteMarch #Brexit 
"Waaaah! The #Brexit vote was bought by dirty money!", they wail.As they travel to London, to try & overthrow the biggest democratic mandate in UK political history, on buses paid for by George Soros.#PeoplesVoteMarch#LosersMarch#MarchAgainstDemocracy
BREAKING: As it's the dribbling #PeoplesVote march today onto Parliament, it's appropriate that I relaunch my Wheels On The Bus video. All your favourite crybaby characters inside #MarksVideos #WheelsOnTheBus #Brexit 
Have you noticed, #Brexit fans have given up claiming that it’ll be easy, good for the economy, save money, enable better tradedeals, etc?The only justification they still give is that it’s the will of the people.In which case, best to check that it still is!#PeopesVote
BREAKING: All aboard the Remoaner Bus, delayed on their way to the #PeoplesVote Park Lane meeting point. Stopped several times for nappy changes, dwinky top-ups and a fresh application of strawberry window spray.12 noon sharp for the grizzle to parliament.#FinalSay #Brexit 
I rarely felt so unease.In #EU we work together not against each other. Unfortunately we had no opportunity to speak substance. Facts matter little these days... And this isn’t about giving lessons to anyone. Suddenly v sad for Europe. That’s how #brexit happens. With big lies. 
Before the day becomes all about #Brexit I wanted to share these beauties that I’ve just picked from the garden. No filters.See you there! #peoplesvotemarch
Joining many other @TheGreenParty members. Calling for a #PeoplesVote - the only democratic way forward. Let the people clean up Theresa May's #Brexit mess.

On the morning of the #PeoplesVoteMarch @sianberry explains why she and other Greens are taking to the streets for a final say on #Brexit 
Sky News talking about today’s #losersvote have just shown pictures of a few people in Bournemouth demonstrating for our right to #brexit and then showed a mass demonstration of Remain votersClearly sowing the thought that many more ppl wish to stay in the EU.Sky bias as usual.
I’m marching & speaking on #PeoplesVoteMarch today. Marchers from #Scotland are meeting at the 7th July Memorial in Hyde Park (close to the March Assembly Area) at 11.30 thanks to @euromovescot. See you there! #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope @peoplesvote_uk

Big crowd already gathered in Bristol heading to the #PeoplesVoteMarch in London. NINE coaches have been filled from here! Bristol demands democracy and a #FinalSay on #Brexit. 
On the #PeoplesVoteMarch today there will be socialists, conservatives, liberals, greens and other political persuasions but we’re all united in our demand for a #PeoplesVote to end this #Brexit catastrophe. 
Who is the biggest asshole in British politics?#TonyBlair@sajidjavid@nick_clegg@ChukaUmunna @Conservatives@UKLabour#Brexit#Remain#PeoplesVoteMarch#askingforafriend
If you voted #Brexit to stop EU migrants coming to the UK and claiming benefits you were conned. EU migrants that cannot support themselves and their family after being in the UK for 3 months can be removed. The #Leave campaign lied to you, EU migrants come to study & work.
BREAKING: A big day today for the bedwetters on the #PeoplesVote march. I do hope the drop is very long I bet MSM say there were 850 Trillion Thousand Million people there, in a 10 square metre plot #Sheep #TakeMeToYourLeader #Brexit 
Right,  time to get up,  get showered and get out. First time marcher but I must be there. I am marching to protest the removal of our rights, the dimming of our children's futures the lies sold to millions and the utter absurdity of #Brexit#PeoplesVoteMarch
The pro-brexit march attracted 12 supporters this week. The #PeoplesVoteMarch will attract hundreds of thousands. Do you see @theresa_may, the will of the people is not to #Brexit at any cost. The people want a vote on the #deal with an option to #Remain.
Pro-#Brexit and frustrated?  Here's how to stop the Brexit-Bashers: 
Live in London or visiting get yourself along to Park Lane as yours & your family's future depends on it! 12.00 today for the People's Vote March @peoplesvote_uk March for the Future - Time is running out to send out the message that #Brexit isn't the will of the UK people! 
Clear skies and perfect weather today for the #PeoplesVoteMarch. Join us at 12 on Park Lane to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal.

“You can’t leave Europe. There’d be no Europe without you. You saved Europe. You sacrificed hundreds of thousands of lives to save Europe. Not once but twice.” Michael Moore on #brexit#FinalSayForAll#PeoplesMarch#peoplesVoteMarch
Incorrect. They want to stop #Brexit altogether. Regardless of the consequences. #PeoplesMarch
Today we show the country that Labour voters want a change in party policy. Today we show the country that #Brexit is not inevitable.Join @Remain_Labour on the #PeoplesVoteMarch from 11am onwards, at the corner of Curzon St and Park Lane.#ForTheMany 
If you're angry about #Brexit, Leaver or Remainer, then ask yourself if your grandchildren will care that you were angry? Or will they just want to know that you knew the facts, thought carefully and made the right choice. Make them proud. #PeoplesVoteMarch
History will record that it was @libdems who led the fight against the disaster that is #Brexit and started the campaign for a #peoplesvote.
When #TheresaMay & the #Tories finally agree on what sort of #Brexit they want, will we all get a chance to say we don’t want it? #peoplesvote
938,812 people have signed the petition for a #FinalSay so far.This is good.But not good enough.Can we try to get this up to 1 million before the #PeoplesVoteMarch? #Brexit #EndTheChaos #PeoplesVote
I am so excited! I am seeing people beginning their travels to London, II am buzzing with excitement!We ALL need a vote on the final say, a democratic #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain if the #Brexit deal is a shitshow. pic.twitter.com/T2bCfsDc6f
Europe gave us the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, Shakespeare, Goethe and Picasso. The EU gave us Jean-Claude Juncker, the plunging of Greek pensioners into poverty and 2,000-word documents on cabbages. Europe and the EU are very different things:  #Brexit
The reason I'm going on the #PeoplesMarch is quite simple, we were lied to by RICH spivs/snakeoil salesmen and liars, the only benefit of #Brexit is that they'll get even richer, while we get poorer, ffs folks wake up, do you think right wing Brexit cares for us? #PeoplesVote
Threatening violence to try and stop #Brexit really isn’t a good look. Especially not from a world leader who should know better, @campaignforleo

Dear Twitter, the @LibDems are the ONLY POLITICAL PARTY CALLING FOR A #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. Join us. March with us on the #PeoplesVoteMarch on Saturday and help us stop this  #Brexit madness!
So apparently the delay in #Brexit negotiations is due to the civil service having difficulty translating Jean-Claude's 'divorce bill' 
The speech @Theresa_May should now make, by #AlastairCampbell: “As your leader, I have concluded that #Brexit cannot be done without enormous damage to our economy, to your living standards, to our public services...” Please share. Link:  #PeoplesVote

EU’s secret plan to tie UK to its tax rules post #Brexit @Telegraph
If the EU is helping to fund the 'People's Vote' march then this is an appalling abuse of taxpayers' money, as well as a reprehensible attempt to meddle in the UK's internal politics.  #Brexit
Nobody voted for this dog’s dinner #Brexit. That’s why I’m joining the #PeoplesVoteMarch for the Future tomorrow because we deserve a #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk
Excited for the #PeoplesVoteMarch tomorrow. Time to demand a #PeoplesVote on this dog's dinner #Brexit 
6) the most ridiculous part of this "but we must accept the vote" line by progressives is that none of the people who were fooled will thank us for indulging them when it all goes wrong.When #Brexit hits living standards, they won't just shrug and say "oops"

Should there be a second #Brexit referendum? Watch our debate with @DanielJHannan and @Andrew_Adonis, moderated by @mehdirhasan 
Decided to go on People's Vote March tomorrow. Got a dose of reality today. Look at how incompetent Brexit negotiations are, when we can't  even organise a school trip across the Channel, since we don't know visa/EU travel arrangements after March 29!!!  #PeoplesVote #Brexit
Time has come to boycott ALL EU goods cos they are trying to stop #Brexit. 
I don't believe any right minded #Brexiter voted for a no-deal #Brexit which will damage the UK economy and businesses, threatens jobs, will leave the general public with less in their pockets and starve the NHS of much needed funding.
The #Brexit process has proven the age-old wisdom that the longer time period one has to complete a task, the longer that task will take. 
Hey @DamianCollins and @carolecadwalla where are you loud voices now with regards to foreign collusion and interference in our democracy??? Your silence is deafening. #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch #LosersVote #LosersVoteMarch
Dominic Grieve - Theresa May refuses to answer this question... will we be better off out of the EU? She refuses to answer that question because she knows #brexit is an "exercise in self-mutilation"@BathforEurope #peoplesvote #PeoplesVoteMarch #FBPE
Nick Clegg has taken the Facebook job because he smells #Brexit defeat & sees no future profit in continuing to bat against UK democracy for Brussels.He'll take a cool million quid a year now, telling us he's "cleaning up Tech".Remoaners are suckers. 
Trade deals are easy, right? #Brexit 
Now seems HMRC would require 5,300 new staff if there’s no deal – and spend an additional £450m on #Brexit preparations next year alone. When, exactly, were we warned of this in 2016? Its Brexit debt not dividend! #EndTheChaos #LetThePeopleDecide
All ready for tomorrow? Wall to wall coverage on Sky News of the same people having a breakdown about not getting their way. Bring your dummies and Kleenex as people emerge from their safe spaces to have a collective moan#PeoplesMarch #PeoplesVoteMarch #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Don't listen to Liam Fox. Trade deals with the rest of the world can't make up for what we'll lose by leaving the single market and customs union. UK exports 2016£235.8bn£99.6bn£16.8bn£5.7bn£4.3bn£3bn£1.3bn#Brexit 
We all need the courage of our convictions. I’m immensely proud that my parents (in their 70s) have the courage of theirs & will be marching in #London tomorrow supporting a #peoplesvote. Whatever you think of #Brexit it is vital that people can express their political opposition
I was finding it tough to put into words...so I enlisted the help of a friend!If you also feel Theresa May’s #Brexit is an utter disaster, join me tomorrow at 12pm for the @peoplesvote_uk march.#PeoplesVoteMarch #PeoplesVoteBanners
Saying 'Bollocks to Brexit' on Saturday is possibly the most important thing you will do this year. Join the #PeopleVoteMarch @peoplesvote_uk!! #BollockstoBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
More straw-grasping and substance-free emoting that wilfully misses the point. #Brexit has nothing to do with any trade deal. This is a dishonest and degrading campaign to overturn democracy and keep us in the #EU. Everyone involved should be ashamed.
It now emerges that a no-deal #Brexit could leave an £840m hole in the UK’s legal services sector. Brexit is not biased in this respect - there appears to be no profession that isn’t facing a bleak future in the face of this Brexit chaos #EndTheChaos

Some think it’s ok to win a referendum by any means however mendacious then to demand the result be respected in perpetuity. I don’t. That’s why I’ll be marching & speaking at the #PeoplesVoteMarch in London tomorrow #Brexit #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk
The EU are using OUR tax money to fund a protest that seeks to overturn OUR democratic decision.They must seriously be laughing at us.161 days until #Brexit, we'll have OUR laugh soon. 
Even if miraculously #Brexit were stopped, I still believe we'd have an independent Scotland soon. One thing this whole EU referendum clarified is that Scotland is absolutely powerless within a UK union.
The #Brexit deal being delivered by the #UK government is a looming disaster for #Britain & #Europe. People need to be given a final say on whether to accept it or not. That is why we call on everybody to join the #PeoplesVoteMarch through Central #London tomorrow! 
"I would not vote in a second referendum," Tory MEP & senior Vote Leave figure @DanielJHannan tells me on @AJUpFront today, effectively calling for a boycott of an "illegitimate" second referendum on #Brexit:
Iain Duncan Smith claimed it's easy to sort out the Irish border issue. This is James O'Brien's stinging response.@mrjamesob | #Brexit
Federation of Small Businesses warns of “catastrophic” consequences of no-deal #Brexit, and the jobs it will put at risk, as “stalemate” negotiations cost members “time and money”. Businesses, indeed all of us, must be freed from this deadlock #EndTheChaos
WATCH: This week is National Hate Crime Awareness Week. These activists are concerned about the rise in hate crime and believe it will get worse after #Brexit. That's why they'll be coming to the #PeoplesVoteMarch tomorrow:  #NHAW
Be sure to turn out tomorrow & let the UK hear your voices at #PeoplesVoteMarch.Time is running out for public displays of crying, so enjoy while you can.Don't forget to grab a free placard from whichever marxist outfit is supplying them this week.161 Days until #Brexit 
What a nasty piece of work Mike is. Absolutely no need to be rude like that. Showed himself up good & proper there. A perfect example of #Brexit ignorance - doesn’t understand but more importantly doesn’t *want* to understand.Well done @Femi_Sorry for keeping your cool

The Tory MP Christopher Chope who is famous for blocking the upskirting law also wants to scrap the Working Time Directive after #Brexit.This basically means if you want leave from work you wouldn't get paid. He wants to steal your paid holiday. Typical Tory.
Almost 30% of UK birds are threatened with extinction. As #Brexit approaches, UK government are rewriting our environmental laws. Click here to find out how you can help ensure these laws put nature first:  #FightForNature
.@TheGreenParty MP @CarolineLucas will share why she is demanding a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Join her at the #PeoplesVoteMarch for the Future: 
 #Belgium: After Theresa May was dumped in the ongoing #Brexit negotiations, the usual suspects of junta's Politburo with Merkel, Macron & Co. sat at Grand Place drinking a large beer. Juncker was not seeing, probably his sciatic pain was already too strong at this time. 
Irish Gov are trying to stop #Brexit.Time has come to stop buying Irish goods.
Winston Churchill founded the European Movement in 1947 as part of his drive aiming “at nothing less than the union of Europe as a whole” - with Britain as “an integral part of Europe” His vision then was peace and security after 30 years of war.#stopbrexit #Iameuropean #Brexit 
Saying 'Bollocks to Brexit' on Saturday is possibly the most important thing you will do this year. Join the #PeopleVoteMarch @peoplesvote_uk!! #BollockstoBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
hope zillions of #Guildford #SurreyHills #Woking #Dorking #Cranleigh #Godalming people are going to the #PeoplesVote march tomorra. Clearly brexit is such a huge thing we should get a vote on final deal. What would you vote for? #WATON #FBPE #JC4PM #BREXIT #GTTO
This #MayorsQuestionTime is unbelievable.Crime is out of control, housing targets being missed, the tube is in constant difficulties-all of which #Khan is responsible. Yet what does Labour discuss #Brexit -where the Mayor has no control! Talk about ignoring his responsibilities
10) or, they can continue to hide, to opt out of #Brexit because they look ridiculous when questioned, whilst the rest of us try to fight itEnd/
A timely reminder that Merkel cannot (and will not) ‘save’ the #Brexit talks or May.(Have only been repeating this since 2016.) 
My cartoon Friday @TheTimes....#TheresaMay is shredded. #Brexit #Chequers #Banksy
Last year Sweden-born @AngelaSpang was named Women Entrepreneur of the Year.But this serial entrepreneur in the medical devices and medical training sector warns that #Brexit could force her to leave the UK.March with us for a #PeoplesVote tomorrow
Brexiters rage against a #PeoplesVote. But the pressure for such a vote has only been able to arise because the referendum majority was small. Most sensible democracies have super-majority provisions to prevent such situations arising. Once again our democracy has failed.#Brexit
Dear ⁦@DailyMirror⁩ this is not true.  ⁦@JohnnyMercerUK⁩ did not skip the health select committee for #Hunted.  Further, he returned to Parliament TWICE during the show in order to vote in crucial #Brexit debates.  Please correct this.  Thanks  
British exceptionalism is telling 400 million people to bow to the will of 17 million UK citizens polled two years ago regardless of the own laws/interests--failing at that-- then demanding 7 billion people represented by a global trade organization do the same. #Brexit
Dozens of MPs - Tories, Labour and Lib Dems - are uniting to turn out for the @peoplesvote_uk march tomorrow Oct 20 in Central London on a second referendum. #brexit 
2) the fact is, simple messages work, obfuscation doesn't."We must just #Brexit" gets applause"Get me out of this Brexit nightmare" gets even bigger applause"There's no majority for being poorer" would be a winnerHowever....
'NO IRISH NO GAY' banner put up on a bridge in Northern Ireland today.Don't kid yourself that the DUP and Brexit aren't emboldening bigots, and believe me, the minorities will be the first to suffer. #lgbt #Brexit #loveisahumanright
This is brilliant.#PeoplesMarch#PeoplesVote#Brexit
Tomorrow the @Independent is marching with @peoplesvote_uk to demand a #FinalSay on Theresa May’s botched #Brexit “deal”. Join us - if not for yourself, for all the one year olds like mine whose entire future is at stake 
On way to a meeting, listening to @mrjamesob on #Brexit (#BrexitShambles) and agreeing as always..."There is no plan...We're not even back to Square One. What comes before that, Square Zero...? We're at about Square Minus Seven...!" 
'They'll huff and they'll puff but they won't blow the house down'Labour MP @ChukaUmunna says the majority of MPs no longer have a strong will to push through #Brexit and leave the EU. 
Previously apolitical, I’m fed up of watching politicians, the media and others deceiving the UK on #Brexit. Saturday will be my first march & I’ve convinced a fellow apolitical friend & a despondent remainer colleague to join #PeoplesVote 
So the two strands of foreign influence in #Brexit go like this. Bannon meets Farage sometime 2010. Three years later Bannon starts up #CambridgeAnalytica and Breitbart London to help Farage. Both men intensify their Russian connections.
In other words, the #Brexit trilemma: 
Should there be a second #Brexit referendum? @DanielJHannan says a second vote would be “utterly illegitimate” but @Andrew_Adonis argues the majority of the public is calling for it. Watch our full show at 1930 GMT,  or .
Saying 'Bollocks to Brexit' on Saturday is possibly the most important thing you will do this year. Join the #PeopleVoteMarch @peoplesvote_uk!! #BollockstoBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
I am marching in London tomorrow, people will be marching tomorrow in Belfast. Why? Because we think that #Brexit is an unmitigated disaster and threatens the unity, prosperity and security of our country. London or Belfast, be there, don't not be there, this is far too important 
Well done @LeaveMnsLeave this is hilarious  #LosersVote #Brexit 
I’ll be debating #brexit on @SkyNews just after 10:35 UK time
What are you Quitters so terrified of? Nige told you: 48/52% is indecisive. Now we all know what a glorious #Brexit future awaits, a vote on Facts would mean a crushing victory over us Remoaners, surely? With a 65/35% result you'll seal it for good.Game? Thought not. 
Losers' vote .. love it  #Brexiteers #brexit 
No deal is a complete catastrophe.Brexiters promised continued free trade with Europe, "the easiest deal in history", etc. etc.Not to mention lots of money for the NHS.Empty promises and barefaced lies.#PeoplesVote #PeoplesMarch #Brexit

Icelandic foreign minister to UK: Please join EFTA: #efta #brexit
I used to think British Exceptionalism was just that thing where Brits would justify their feelings of inate superiority over all foreigners.  But now I realise the British are indeed exceptional, because no other country would self-destruct though #Brexit in the way the UK will.
"Project Fear Mark II, this idea that we’ll be impoverished after #Brexit, is complete cobblers. I’d rather have a clean break than what currently seems to be on offer: Remain in all but name"Guardian economics editor Larry Elliott talks to spiked 
Excellent article by Iain Duncan Smith. The car industry is a relatively small part of the economy (less than 1%). And their howls of protest over #Brexit need to be kept in perspective. 
We’re all used to government projects going past deadline and over budget. But politicians were tasked with a job to do in June 2016, and the #Brexit negotiations need to get done.This week's @CityAM article:
Many saw this 2+ yrs ago.#Brexit was lost when May backed by Corbyn invoked A50 w/o a clue or due diligence..an act ofGROSS NEGLIGENCE.Whether there's a fudge or no deal ALL versions of this #BrexitShambles Threaten Rights Jobs & our Future.#PeoplesVote #Remain option NOW.
A well constructed, well researched and somewhat terrifying analysis of the Truth about #Brexit  
My wonderful hubby @TimAStephenson nailed it this morning, as I am absolutely worn out after this rollercoaster week of #Brexit stupidity:“It’s exhausting giving a shit. Keep going”.Then off he went to work in his #StopBrexit t-shirt  pic.twitter.com/iqdqYjYCxq
ITS TIME TO GET SOMEONE IN WHO CAN DELIVER THE #Brexit WE VOTED FOR #GetMayOut
Research from Nexus finds that 51% of decision makers in large and medium-sized biz are planning to use #blockchain to help manage the negative impacts of #Brexit  #cloud #iot #bigdata
In our opinion, ANY #Brexit must be avoided. It's bad for Britain, it's bad for citizens, and it simply leaves a bad taste in your mouth! Time to #StopBrexit.
The UK's bid to stay in the World Trade Organization's Government Procurement Agreement post #Brexit has been blocked by the USA. Consequently, the UK will potentially lose access to a $1.7 trillion public procurement market. 
Serious question. Do you feel @BBCr4today is disproportionate in its coverage time regarding Trump and American politics compared to the attention it pays to #Brexit and the EU?  I do.
Their Brexity wet dream is slipping through their sweaty fingers and they're lashing out in impotent rage.We must be doing something right.#Brexit 
From all over UK ppl of all ages, backgrounds and political views including former #Leave voters will march tomorrow for a #PeoplesVote deal or no deal w #Remain on the ballot paper You can take back control of #Brexit & end the chaos @peoplesvote_uk See you there!
Rees Mogg stating that the Govt is failing to stand up to the EU RE #Brexit & has a weak negotiating plan letting the EU set the terms.Largely because you & your Govt forced A50 thru w/o a clue having failed to undertake any due diligence.That's GROSS NEGLIGENCE#PeoplesVote
But actually Robert there can be a #brexit deal but we'd need a GE & a @UKLabour government to achieve it. It would be helpful if the MSM told it how it is. May's stalling will  cost £billions more & just delay the inevitable. It's clear we need @Keir_Starmer & #JC4PM @itvnews
The Indian Vice-President  @MVenkaiahNaidu tells @SkyNews “let’s wait and see what happens with #Brexit first” when I asked him if a trade deal with the UK is doable. He and repeasentives of 51 countries are arriving in Brussels for EU/Asia summit.
The current #Brexit proposal is the #1 risk to the UK’s creative industries. Want a #FinalSay on #Brexit. Join us at tomorrow’s @peoplesvote_uk & follow our simple guide to how you can directly pressure the government to hold a second referendum: 
A counter-intuitive maxim to bear in mind in #Brexit endgames The closer we get to no deal, the politer and more reasonable the EU side will get. No one wants ownership of a no-deal. EU has the clock. No need to sabre rattle. But don't be fooled.
Absolutely amazing! Thank you so much for making such an epic journey to the #PeoplesVoteMarch, @tweet_HISA! See you tomorrow, as we march together for the future and demand a #PeoplesVote on any #Brexit deal.For info, or to RSVP, visit: 
I can't see Dan's tweet as he has blocked me but it's clearly a part of the strategy to wind Brits up so much that their pure raw emotion can then be counted on to deliver #Brexit at all costs.
Singapore PM signs a trade deal with the EU today incl the UK 'whilst it is within the EU'. 7 years to get there; still another year for the EU Parl & each member state to ratify.He says the UK can't be Singapore as it's nr Europe & won't infl from within#Brexit#PeoplesVote
Oh the panic from those Tories who can see those new financial regulations looming after all.  Just when they thought they were safe.  Surely nobody thinks the exit date of 29th March 2019 was plucked out of thin air? #Brexit #peoplesvote
Retweet if you think it is time for Mrs May to step aside. #Brexit 
New #EU #Singapore free trade agreement being signed today in Brussels. Result of years of  negotiation. Follows recent EU agreements with Japan and Canada. UK benefits from these because we are an EU member. #Brexit

Things are so bad that a Conservative MP says he wouldn't vote for the @Conservatives. And it's basically due to #Brexit, the most divisive idea in modern British history.
#Brexit: 'They'll huff and they'll puff but they won't blow the house down' - Labour MP @ChukaUmunna says he believes there isn't a majority in the House of Commons with a continuing will to leave the EU.  More on the negotiations: 
Vradakar is a clown.Keep talking, you're hardening resolve daily.Nobody wants Ireland crapped on because of #Brexit, but you're making it reality. 
#Brexit Can we have a day without usual lot of Halfwits  come on TV & Radio. Brexit bashing & banging on about the People’s Vote. Alastair Campbell, Charlie Mullins, Nick Clegg, Lord Adonis, Bob Geldof, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Owen Jones, & David Lammy. BORING.  
I wonder where we would be now with #Brexit if we had a PM who believed in, and fought for, our country, and we didn't have elites and remoaners perpetually undermining the democratic vote to leave.
#Brexit can not come soon enough. The European Union states that the #UK can accomodate 184 million refugees.
"It isn't leadership to ignore concerns of people in small towns & communities for 10 yrs before the #EURef. At the #EURef they roared!"& they will roar even louder in places like Crewe if the #Brexit they voted for isn't delivered,cos they have been shafted by the Tories & Lab 
USA and New Zealand are blocking Britain's bid to rejoin the WTO. Japan, South Korea, Ukraine, Moldova and Israel have also expressed concerns.Perhaps these issues will pass, but they illustrate the difficulties ahead if we proceed with #Brexit
Oh the ironic laughter as one realises this latest mess is caused in part by Home Office denying visas last year to Moldova’s economic counselor to the #WTO and her team #HostileEnvironment #Brexit #ItsNoFunny

Has anyone nailed the impossible farce of #Brexit better than @MrNishKumar  on #BBCQT?
"It's cleary a challenge...and progress is slow," says @jimkelly2006 of Brexit talks. "All sides are very motivated to ensure that in the end, despite all the challenges, that there is a deal." #Brexit #pnpcbc

"In the referendum people were promised they could 'have their cake and eat it'.. Now we are having to face reality". #Brexit #bbcqt
"The leaders of Brexit have fled the scene. Nigel Farage is a moron, and Rees-Mogg is the ghost of a Charles Dickens villain" #Brexit #bbcqt
England wants #Brexit and Scotland does not. So it only makes sense that Scotland has an opportunity to leave the UK and stay in the EU. #bbcqt
Jeremy Corbyn is a lifetime Eurosceptic until he became leader of the Labour Party & put opportunism first. He's siding with those who still don't accept the result to try & get into Downing Street. This kind of hypocrisy is why the public don't trust politicians. #bbcqt #Brexit
Even at a new, slower pace, will Theresa May drop the ball on #brexit? To find out, watch and RT  #bbcqt

Friday's Times: "Revolt grows over May's handling of #Brexit talks" (via @AllieHBNews) #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday
We know what we voted for! sound what's that then? #Brexit means Brexit and tha, we want what we voted for! Paid for the Russians, championed by billionaire right wing zealots and campaigned for by non dom media barons #BrexitShambles is it any wonder
If #Brexit splits up the United Kingdom with a United Ireland and independent Scotland  leave voters will be able to boast of succeeding where  where  Hitler and Napoleon failed namely the  dismemberment Great Britain itself
If it teaches us one thing, #Brexit puts paid to the utopian dreams of libertarians, who believe the ‘market’ magically happens. It’s underpinned by regulation, law, fair trade, weights and measures. Without governance no market could ever exist.
I am very concerned that Labour refused to support @peoplesvote_uk this evening. As an EU citizen I feel let down and just when I thought @camcitco will be protecting EU citizens’ rights, they lament #Brexit and refuse to take the same clear position as so many other Councils.
How on earth did Government make such a mess of #Brexit?The BBC sum it up as Theresa May's strategy being "get through the day and muddle through until the next day."Absolute shambles and laughing stock.

There is absolutely no doubt.The vast majority of UK citizens now wish to remain in the EU. #peoplesvote #fbpe #brexit
How can we have a prime minister who openly lies? She’s on tv right now saying that she’ll get a deal which is « good for the UK and good for the EU ». But if there were such a deal, its benefits to both sides could be quantified in £. They can’t. She’s lying. Stop #Brexit
For me, societal progression is quite simple - each generation has the duty to make the world better for the next, and to some degree that's what's been happening in the UK up until #Brexit - which literally removes rights and opportunities and is a huge step backwards. #Insane
According to @Peston it's leave without a deal or Remain in the Customs Union and have our trade policy controlled by a foreign power breaking every explicit promise the Prime Minister has made for months. The choice is obvious: WTO here we come!#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
This was not advertised by leave campaign! Thought we were supposed to get a #brexit dividend? That's what many leave voters were made to beleive!Feel misled and betrayed? Would you rather this money went on schools, hospitals & housing? Become a #RemainerNow & fight #Brexit 
Theresa May’s Chequers Deal now in shreds. I think we always suspected this whole #Brexit-thing was all just performance art. 
Russian trolls (and dirty DUP money plus criminal Leave campaign spending - 10% of their total) pushed for #Brexit on poll day. We need informed consent for Brexit, or Remain in a People’s Vote⁦@peoplesvote_uk⁩ #FBPE
Preston’s scenario of May ‘s “Robert Peel moment” has Labour delivering #Brexit and splitting her own party - but also, I would think, Labour itself. 
While the Tories were busy messing up #Brexit and #UniversalCredit today, 70 people in Mansfield came up with a plan to genuinely transform people's lives.This is the team that will elect @Sonya_Ward as MP - and @jeremycorbyn as PM. A team ran #ByTheMany and #ForTheMany
Does anyone else occasionally forget about #Brexit for a few hours and then remember and go  or is that just me?
Disturbing to realise that when commenting on #Brexit I now too often omit to say how damaging & misguided the whole thing is before being sucked into the parallel universe of multiple Irish backstops & extended transitions.. #boilingfrog #realitycheck

#Brexit quote of the week: "We will thrive after Brexit. We built  the Titanic." Richard Price-Stephens, #DUP supporter tells  @StephenSmithBBC on #Newsnight. 36 mins 50 secs  in.
Maggie Thatcher: "I envisage closer and closer co-operation between the nations in the community; not only on the economic matters, but also on common foreign policy, energy and other."There you have it. #Brexit 
The Brexit elite is so detached from the lives of ordinary Britons and shows so little care for them, while being so reluctant to pay its taxes, that I find myself thinking of France in 1789. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Discussing politics with an American democrat in Berlin, he says "You must be thankful you have @NicolaSturgeon as your leader" when I asked why, he said "well with respect, the full world is watching your exit from the EU, and she seems to be the only one interested"#Brexit

Would you be prepared to support a Leadership bid from David Davis, @andreajenkyns? We need to put an end to the indecisive and inconclusive #Brexit negotiations that May continues to (or perhaps fails to) lead. There is however a candidate who can fulfil total withdrawal.#DD4PM

#Brexit: 5 things that happened at the EU Brussels summit 
Construction industry tells Govt #Brexit hurting brand UK all over the world and costing us all money @BuildingNews An industry worth 6% of GDP and 3m jobs. Maybe it’s about time Tories started listening to people outside of their own party?
Theresa May does not have the votes in parliament to pass her #Brexit proposals and she has lost the confidence of her party.Having lost her authority, her premiership is effectively over.It is likely that her position will now unwind rapidly, triggering a general election.
Good lord! Look what I just found on FB. It’s a miracle? The #brexit nightmare is over. March on Saturday with Andrea and together we can #StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVotemarch#StrongerTogether with Andrea. Who knew?! Brilliant x
The financial crisis led to a wasted decade of lost economic growth. We now face another decade of needlessly mediocre economic growth because of #Brexit. Twenty wasted years! What damage will be done?#PeoplesVote

Join @thatginamiller and the #EndTheChaos team on Saturday to march on #Westminster + demand a say on the defining issue of our time: “Young people won’t forgive, and they certainly won’t forget, anyone who fails to give us a vote on this botched #Brexit.”
Sorry, @duponline, obviously NI and the UK aren’t different countries. NI can’t possibly be allowed to be any different from the rest of the UK #brexit. Unless you are gay & want to get married. Or you are #pregnant, then NI is a different fucking planet @TRPNI @Love_EqualityNI
I will be singing LOUDLY on Saturday ‘where is Jeremy Corbyn’ and I say this in advance so no one can accuse it of being a Lib Dem thing. He’s a total disgrace as an opposition leader and history WILL judge him. Activists who can’t see bigger pictures aren’t leaders #Brexit 
This week, @BigPhilCampion argues that, when it comes to #Brexit, "it's easier to keep a small bed made, than a massive one".Make sure you watch #ThePledge on @SkyNews Thursdays at 8pm
Former Chancellor Ken Clarke tells us the Commons is now so “shattered and hopelessly divided” that it will never agree a deal on #Brexit.  It’s now blindingly obvious that we must #LetThePeopleDecide if we are to #EndTheChaos!
WHERE ARE YOU NOW?We remainers can obviously claim that the people from the other side have  now moved to our side. There are a lot of FBPE hashtags around! What about you?  #FBPE #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StandUp4Brexit

It was close. But a Labour MP has managed to out-stupid every Conservative on Brexit.By @wrightismight #Brexit
Thread.I am so angry, what an omnishambolic clusterfuck of epic proportions.I hate #Brexit, Brexiters, the govt & Leavers who still think it’s a good idea.I hate what Brexit has already done, is doing & will do to the UK.On Saturday we’ll march to #StopBrexit#PeoplesVote
Tomorrow's @Independent cartoon... #TheresaMay #Brexit 
Two members of my family have already lost their jobs, another extended family member has business issues due to the low pound.Your #Brexit was supposed to make us richer and fund the NHS better. You sold us a lie and expect people to accept your lie.No. 
#Brexit: "We have reaffirmed our confidence in @MichelBarnier & his mandate. Today, it is very clearly up to @theresa_may & her team to come back with a solution based on the political compromises necessary– on the part of the United Kingdom."- President @EmmanuelMacron #EUCO
the EU can f*ck off, trying to tell remoaners its an option to extend the implementation periodlets look at that word 'implementation'  The process of putting a plan or decision into effectTHAT DOES NOT MEAN EVERYTHING STAYS THE SAME FOR 2 YEARS: INCLUDING FREE MOVEMENT #bREXIT
"We cannot accept an agreement that is harmful to #Ireland," said French President @EmmanuelMacron in #Brussels #Brexit #UK #EU #Macron
#Brexit #EUCO Macron in his press conf : It is not a technical issue anymore. It is not up to the EU to make concessions in order to answer to a British domestic political issue @IanDunt @mrjamesob @jonlis1
For 3 years the #Brexit debate has been dominated by wealthy & powerful men of a certain age.If we don’t give women, BAME people, young people, migrants, disabled people and everyone else a say, public will be right to lose faith in politics #PeoplesVote
No one knows what #Brexit is, so no one knows why they voted for it. Apart from the Brexeratti, who stand to gain a shitload of money, while everyone else loses. That is why I will be in London on Saturday marching for a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain11/11
We have a special status in the EU, for the cost of 1p for every £1 of tax, the benefits far outweigh the cost.  #Brexit will put paid to that. WE ARE ALREADY A STRONG INDEPENDENT NATION, Mr Farage, enough of your bilge.7/11 
Look! The government saying 10 or more years of uncertainty & potential economic disruption, reducing investment & costing jobs. Jobs first #Brexit Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, seriously?  The government said it would be difficult to strike a good deal. How right they were.5/11
This is the first mention of leaving the Single Market, not that 'we will' as Farage keeps saying, but leaving will create uncertainty & risk. The government made it clear being in the Single Market means more jobs which rather disagrees with Mr Corbyn's Jobs First #Brexit3/11 
With full trust and support of #EUCO, @eucopresident, & @JunckerEU, I stand ready to resume negotiations with #UK for an overall Art 50 agreement. Orderly #Brexit must include a solid, all-weather backstop to avoid a hard border in IE/NI. 
Join me at the @peoplesvote_uk march this Saturday to represent the voice of the many in our community. Looking forward to seeing friendly faces and demonstrating #Lewisham East's support for a final say on #Brexit, with an option to remain. 
NUS Deputy President @AmateyDoku will share why students and young people support a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Join him at the #PeoplesVote March for the Future:  @FFSake_
Crunch time is fast approaching. We may only have weeks to get a #PeoplesVote. And if we fail to get one, that’s it. So anybody who wants to stop #Brexit needs to make the maximum effort now. That means marching on Saturday. It can make a difference.
Macron says negotiators have looked at every possible solution to Irish border issue - now he says it’s a matter of UK internal politics - he can’t be clearer than that, he said #Brexit
#Brexit #Summit - Failure to conclude talks, as previously agreed, at this October summit - November summit postponed - Talk of extending Art 50 deadline - Talk of a longer transition period They said it would be easy. In fact it’s #BrexitChaos & #brexitshambles ....
This way of dismissing enormously complex and delicately balanced world issues like customs unions, national borders and peace treaties as merely made-up obstacles created by fastidious EU bureaucrats to make #brexit difficult; is that how the Brits want to be taken seriously?
Theresa May's press conferences on Brexit  are as about as helpful as asking a purser on a sinking ship which way to the lifeboat station and being answered with what the daily specials are in the dining hall. #brexit
May’s deliberate deception. Keep ‘transitioning’ until Remain take power. What purpose would voting have for the 17.4m? #Brexit 
"No deal would be dangerous for Britain and for the European Union"@JunckerEU tells @BBCkatyaadler his working assumption is that we will not have a no deal #BrexitLatest: 
Nigel Farage - "Come on, Tory MPs, have a bit of courage, recognise that Brexiteers in the country is as strong as they ever were."You’ve got a chance now to get rid of a bad PM to put somebody in place who can win you the next general election with a huge majority." #Brexit 
.@moneillsf : “It is an appalling failure of her (Theresa May) responsibilities as a co-equal guarantor of our peace and political process and there is an onus on the Irish Government and EU27 to defend our best interests during this critical stage of the #Brexit negotiations.”
Michael Caine - "I don’t listen to all these pundits. I’m a Brexiteer myself. People say, ‘oh you’ll be poor, you’ll be this’."Well, I’d rather be a poor master of my fate than having someone I don’t know making me rich by running it." #Brexit

Nigel Farage - "Let’s just remind people that every single major player on both the Leave and Remain side of the debate said we will leave the EU, the Single Market and the Customs Union. "We couldn’t be any clearer." #Brexit

Corker for today: 50ish hard-#Brexit fan. Calls me a snowflake then says: "It's been 2 years since we left and *nothing* bad has happened at all. It was all remainer lies and project fear, see!" There's no (point) arguing with world-class, gold-plated ignorance like that. 
Brilliantly succinct summary from @Femi_Sorry on we need a #PeoplesVote. If you agree, join us for the #PeoplesVoteMarch this Saturday and demand a final say on #Brexit - more details here: 
After #Brexit, a top priority for UK & EU was to protect the rights of citizens living abroad. Macron's threat to make Brits 'illegal immigrants' in light of no-deal is nasty politics, and flies in the face of his other principles (mainly that immigration is a good thing!) 
It's not just tiny Moldova, it's pretty much EVERY country with ANY KIND of grudge with the UK... we're HANDING THEM THE POWER to wreak havoc on the British economy... THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS when you UNILATERALLY slap TRADE SANCTIONS on YOURSELF; ie #Brexit

ICYMI: as the #Brexit chaos gets even worse - there IS a way to resolve the crisis - whichever way you voted before. Even @piersmorgan admitted to me yesterday on @GMB with @susannareid100 that that he now thinks there *should* be a @peoplesvote_uk #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
Bad move by the PM. This will rightly strengthen the turning of backs on Westminster, and accelerate the gravitation towards Dublin for shelter. Eyes are being opened! #brexit 
Some, including the @ScotTories think it’s ok to win a referendum by any means however mendacious then to demand the result be respected in perpetuity. I don’t. That’s why I’ll be marching & speaking at the #PeoplesVoteMarch on Saturday #Brexit #FBPE
.@allianceparty: “The PM claims to be acting on behalf of the people of Northern Ireland but is only listening to the DUP, who are presenting a distorted position.Northern Ireland voted Remain and there is also a majority support for the Backstop"#brexit 
Must-see interview with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg today, where he rubbishes the proposed #Brexit transition extension & debunks many of the scaremongering around No Deal.Tough gig for Adam Boulton, but at least he let the man speak, fair play.
"If science loses, everybody loses" Venki Ramakrishnan, President of the Royal Society on the dangers of #Brexit. Read our #NoDeal fact sheet 
READ: The #Brexit plan B's won't work. It's time to stop pretending. #PeoplesVote:
So first we had 'the backstop to the backstop'.  Today British officials were talking about 'the implementation of the implementation period'.  My head hurts. #Brexit
.@SinnFeinIreland deputy leader @moneillsf says Theresa May "continues to ignore the majority voices in the North" #brexit 
.@SDLPlive leader @columeastwood says Theresa May "refusing to meet the pro-remain parties is disgraceful but not surprising"#brexit 
So @Jacob_Rees_Mogg thinks the UK would be better spending money on Universal Credit than extending #Brexit deadline.Here's an idea for Jake, why not stay in the EU and spend the divorce payment on hiking Universal Credit, paying more to the NHS, to schools and to the Police.
Downing St told Northern Ireland's 'remain' parties that it is "not able to accommodate your request for a meeting with the Prime Minister at this time..... but the PM's Chief of Staff is happy to find time to speak to this group individual or collectively."#brexit 
Why oh why does the @bbcnews only interview 2 opposing views on #brexit only from The Conservative Party?You ignored libdem Lab and SNP Remainers during Referendum too!
It is understood that Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has agreed to hold a meeting with the leaders of NI's four 'remain;' backing parties.#Brexit
So today's good news: the paper I was missing about my first period living in Germany has been found by the Berlin archives people. I will have the right to become German on 9/3/2019, i.e. *before* #Brexit, and before #EP2019!   
The Donald Tusk offer of a free trade deal with Great Britain is still on the table. The priority for the Government should be to insist that this offer be made available to the whole of the UK. Only by doing this can we have a #Brexit deal that delivers what the people voted for 
EU citizens in the UK: if you have questions about your EU rights and #Brexit now it's the time to ask! An immigration lawyer will answer your questions on Facebook live on Friday 19 October from 18.30. Tune in and ask about #EUcitizensright on our FB page @ECinUK

Mr Farage @Nigel_Farage talking #Brexit bollocks as usual, he lies like a cheap watch, the leaflet, which I still have, clearly states "The UK is a strong, independent nation". You aren't going to win friends and trade deals by insulting countries smaller than us Nigel. 
How to win trade deals! Farage talks #Brexit Bollocks as usual, I still have the leaflet he refers to & it doesn't make it clear we would be leaving the Single Market & the Customs Union. In fact Mr Farage @Nigel_Farage the leaflet doesn't mention the Customs Union not even once!
Why then did the UK agree to *precisely that* in December 2017 then?There is no honesty from the UK side here at all. They are going back on what was already agreed.#Brexit 
#Brexit is not difficult.Offer a free trade deal and walk away.The #REMOANERS are deliberately making it difficult to try and get us to stay IN.
#Brexit is falling apart before our eyes, the PM is a figure of ridicule, and the future of the United Kingdom is at stake. It's the perfect time for the final push to #StopBrexit. Attend or promote the #PeoplesVoteMarch, donate to a pro-EU campaign! Let's get this fight WON!
The EU was intrumental in ensuring that bans on British meat were not unfair and when they were (France) helped overturn that bad. After #Brexit expect zero support on that score. 
A massive point about the #Brexit transition period from @NickBoles today on @SkyNews.It was supposed to be to allow businesses to find their feet and adapt to our new trading arrangements, not to be an extended negotiation period.
If the monthly figures from the ONS are sustained, then it tells us that Britain is already on the brink of recession. #Brexit isn’t helping.
IF we do #Brexit, I really hope there are still a lot of Brexiters around to witness our inevitable rejoining of the EU - and having lost our current vetoes, our entry into the Eurozone and Schengen. Oh, how I'll laugh.... 
I'm so fucking angry with @BBCr4today, Roger Daltrey, Michael Caine both extremely wealthy being wheeled out to tell the plebs that #Brexit will be good for us, easy to say when your wealthy, like all Brexiters they get prime time on #r4today to spout their crap unchallenged.
"Roger Daltrey. Do you keep any of your wealth in British overseas tax havens?" is a question @BBCNews @BBCr4today journalists never ask any wealthy Pro #Brexit guests on their programmes. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay #FinalSayForAll #FBPE #EndTheChaos #OFOC #PeoplesVoteMarch

In dealing with #Brexit I have two main concerns: the European citizens in the UK - we need legal certainty for them. Second, we won't accept a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. These are red lines for us. 1/2
EU governance is corrupt, undemocratic, bureaucratic, over-regulated and, ultimately, unworkable:  #Brexit

As per this statue of George Orwell outside the @bbcworldservice I must tell the good people of the UK, there is no such thing as a good #Brexit

I will dedicate my life campaigning and voting against the @Conservatives to make sure that they NEVER see power again l. You can’t have a functioning democracy if you betray it by ignoring the majority’s decision in 2016. #Brexit #BrexitBetrayal
Theresa May has confirmed that her Government is now considering an extension to the #Brexit transition. 
Nigel Farage: Isn’t it interesting when she’s asked what ‘about another year on the transition?’She doesn’t give an answer at allI’ve said from the start, the transition was the trap.Article 50, that 2 years process, that was the transition!#Brexit #EU
I know I keep banging on about Fintan O'Toole's "Nightmare of History" lecture, but it really is one of the most important & illuminating that I've heard since the whole #Brexit debacle kicked off. I urge you to listen, and to the Q&A session that follows.
So there IS a brexit bonus EU citizens with dual nationality who can cross borders seamlessly, will get all the higher paid jobs from companies who need access to EU markets at the expense of UK workers who will have travel restricted. Another #BrexitOwnGoal #fbpe #Brexit 
Michael Caine & Roger Daltrey on #r4today prove that age does not necessarily result in wisdom. It can lead to entrenched stupidity instead.There are no benefits to #Brexit for any but the ultra rich. Their support of Brexit can therefore only be seen as ultra selfishness.
"Signing agreements that allow for the potential ‘carving off’ of Northern Ireland ... is something British Prime Ministers have been doing for much of the last 100 years." @LisaClaireWhit1 argues that #Brexit rhetoric is a symptom of selective amnesia. 
Maybe we shouldn't be too hard on the politicians ballsing up #Brexit. After all, their judgement is clouded by their monumental over-estimation of their own competence - it's hardly their fault.#BrexitShambles
#Brexit is a Tory-inspired, Tory-owned, Tory-controlled catastropheIt hasn’t stopped the #Tory Civil War- more cleavedIt hasn’t unified the Nation - split wide-openIt hasn’t stopped #Austerity - deepened it#GEnow
Today it’s clear that Raab and May are backsliding on their meaningful vote promise over #brexit, so the question has to be “why on earth does @heidiallen75 think she can trust DWP assurances that they are listening to #UniversalCredit concerns?” Surely she is not that naive?
The @ForBritainParty policy on #Brexit is clear.Withdraw immediately, no ifs, no buts.Simply to deliver what the British people voted for in 2016.
The Govt is after forcing through a Blind #Brexit...to get us out of the EU w/o any honesty about our Final Destination...& that film didnt end well...#PeoplesVote for a #FinalSay with a #Remain option
What a quote from Finnish politician Alexander Stubb on @skynews just now “you can be against the EU but it’s like being against the internet, you can do it, but its better to try and influence it” #Brexit
The question on my mind after no #Brexit progress overnight:When is the UK going to panic?
The triumph of the Remain Campaign is to have changed their vernacular to ‘The People’s Vote’ The challenge for Brexiteers is to resist the narrative. The People Already Voted. #Brexit

Both  @theresa_may and the @Conservatives  are TRAITORS! They are trying to kick the democratic will of the people into the long grass and keep us tied to the EU. Send them a message by letting them know we will never vote for them again. ReTweet if you agree.#Brexit 
So we are discussing a 3 year transition to allow time to discuss an UNLIMITED BACKSTOP if no FTA can be agreed in time.Complicated, unaccountable, needlessly bureaucratic and expensive. Classic EU. For God's sake Mrs May just get us out on WTO terms!#StandUp4Brexit #Brexit 
People who think a backstop is a threat to the union have not been talking to soft unionists who - until Brexit - would never have even entertained the thought of supporting a United Ireland.The backstop isn't the biggest threat to the union, a No Deal Brexit is. #Brexit
Easy for Caine to say; he'll never have to face being poor!Also, it's not "someone we don't know running it"- it's us & our mates. #Brexit is tantamount to saying "I'm not going to go down the pub with my mates any more unless I'm the one who always gets to decide what we do."
There’s only three #Brexit options left right now:1. Theresa May's bad Brexit deal2. No deal3. #PeoplesVote 1 - doesn’t work2 - destroys the country3 - decides democratically
Y'know what was *missing* from my visit to hospital yesterday?NOBODY asked me 'How do you want to pay?'Post #Brexit, & once US Healthcare companies are invited in, that will be the FIRST question! #stopbrexit #PeoplesVoteMarch

Truly remarkable from Theresa May she has somehow managed to turn her shambles of a #Brexit process in the biggest clusterf*** ever seen. Every time you think she can’t be anymore useless, she smashes her own record. Getting rid of her with a #GENow is the only way out.
Brexit means a bunch of sleekit wee chancers talking out their bahookies and conning the country with a bunch of lies.Please retweet if you think that folk should have a vote.#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
For all those fed up with #Brexit dominating the news - don’t worry. In another month or so, the #NHSCrisis will take over. The chronic underfunding of the #NHS & social care has left the whole system in a desperate state. It will be much worse this year
Two days in a row Today have had right wing celebrities on and allowed them totally uncritical interviews on  and #Brexit
Extending the transition would obviously cost billions because it would extend full UK payments into the EU budget. It would also extend full membership of the single market and customs union with no friction in trade. You get what you pay for. #Brexit 
Dr Hannah Barham-Brown will share why a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal is healthier for the NHS and the UK. Join her at the #PeoplesVoteMarch for the Future this Saturday 20 October: 
Not just since #Brexit. Ever since the 2014 indy referendum, all the Scottish Tories have is "no to Indy Ref 2". No policies of their own, no ideas, nothing except stopping the SNP.
Just read Adam Tomkins piece in FT yesterday. What is most striking  is what #Brexit has done to Scottish Conservatism  - reduced it to a visceral, hard line, irreconcilable #DUP style unionism with no policies and no plans for our country save shouting ‘no surrender’ at @theSNP
Met up again with European Parliament President @EP_President this morning with @HMcEntee. We’re discussing last night’s @EUCouncil meeting on #Brexit, ensuring a backstop for Ireland, and today’s meetings on migration and security. 
Hi @Royston_Smith,As a pro #Brexit MP in the leave constituency of #Southampton, please will you join the other 38 Conservative MPs who have already pledged to #StandUp4Brexit?It would be great to have your support.
Two possible options:Theresa May is utterly incompetent in #Brexit negotiations.Theresa May doesn't want the UK to leave the EU.Either way, this means she 'has' to go...FGS will someone put her out of our misery?
Q to Irish Gov"Will you implement a hard border?NoQ to UK Gov"Will you implement a hard border?NoQ to EU"Will you implement a hard border?NoSo entire #Brexit is being scuppered because of a hard border that will never happen ??We are being taken for idiots.#BrexitNow
Importent to remember in all furore over possibly extending transition that there will be no transition period at all if no #Brexit (divorce) deal agreed
Imagine if #Trump was negotiating #BrexitHe would tell EU that UK has a £80bn a yr trade deficit with EUIf there were WTO tariifs, EU would be £8bn a yr WORSE off.Only way to avoid that is to have a free trade deal.Trump would then walk away & wait for the EU to come running. 
May brought no new ideas to the #Brexit table last night. But I'm struggling to think of any ideas to have emanated from this most vacuous of politicians, other than the 'hostile environment' which contributed to the Windrush scandal. #r4today
Another day, another bit of evidence regarding the damage caused by Tory #Brexit chaos....Survey suggests fall in business optimism over Brexit - BBC News 
Actually, reflecting further, I’m happy about May’s faux pas of asking to extend #Brexit transition.It shows Brexiters her plans aren’t implementable.Remain people rightly say such a long transition with no say is a democratic outrage.It hence hastens her end.

Successful #Brexit, the fabled fantasy dream of the Brexeratti. Extremely rare and vastly expensive.  Impossible to define, impossible to deliver. Toxic to democracy. A No Deal, No planes, No jobs, lorry park, stockpiling Brexit, increasingly more likely.#Brexit = Unobtanium
Take a look at this for an idea of what British citizens living in Europe are now faced with to guarantee they can live their lives as they do now in the event of #NoDeal. The hugely unpleasant #Brexit uncertainty for them goes on. 
I want stay in the EU, yet even I find the "People's Vote" campaign & it's hardcore supporters, off-puttingPatronising leave voters isn't going to win them over. Even the name "people's" is condescending...The way they've campaigned may have done more harm than good. #Brexit
If they get the contingency planning right, no problem, says the Dept of Health. The department that has planned so exquisitely well as to allow the NHS to end up with a shortage of 42,000 nurses & 11,500 doctors. #Brexit

 After the EU leaders summit dinner last night, time for some impromptu beers - Merkel, Macron, Battel & Michel in Brussels’s Grand Place  - no late night panic over #Brexit then  (video via @hkresic)
And these guys that were sitting next to #Merkel & co - a cell biologist from Germany, a neuroscientist from the US, etc - so they found a soulmate in Merkel, a chemist. But when asked about #Brexit, Merkel replied: Please, it’s a wonderful evening... let’s not spoil it! #EUCO

Stockpiling for a chaotic #Brexit - according to the New York Times "Brexit preppers" fear chaos in March when the UK leaves the EU and have cupboards crammed with food and medicines. Are you getting ready for a chaotic "no deal"? What would you stockpile? #BBCTheBriefing
162 days until #Brexit.As explained here, in 3 simple tweets, all we have to do is keep our nerve.The default is No Deal Brexit, nothing stops that as things stand, except an acceptable deal. 
For the people leading it, #Brexit is about ripping up employment and environmental regulations and evading tax; for many followers, it's about seeing fewer foreigners. The former are misleading the latter to enrich themselves further. That's basically it.
The proposed year-long extension to the transition period will see us pay an additional £20b to the EU and take us right up until the next general election, which the Conservatives will surely lose if they continue along this path of appeasement.Voters will not forget! #Brexit

I'll take no lectures from a man who is so determined to get his own way he doesn't care how many laws are broken, what sort of dirty tricks are used or even if foreign agents interfered, & certainly not one who continues to back #Brexit despite all the loss it has already cost.
If you insist on being so tedious: YouGov - co-founded & co-owned by a #Brexit-bonking MP - has been running a tracker for years. Oldest, respected, consistent. Shows a clear shift to #Remain, especially amongst women.We're not too proud to admit it when we make a mistake.

Lots of people seem to think we're "still in the EU" during "transition" so that an "extension to transition" means longer to "choose to stay". Nope. After "#Brexit day" we're out. Transition THEN starts. But we're out. 
Precisely. Democracy didn't end in 2016. Much of what was promised by Brexiteers, were simply lies.. Enough is enough. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
To try to prevent our sovereign Parliament rejecting a botched, blindfold or no-deal #brexit would be scandalous & spark the worst constitutional crisis in modern British history. #PeoplesVote

An interesting tweet by Tory MEP @CharlesTannock regarding the destructive and terrifying global ambitions of our own Brextremists. It is very clear that for them #Brexit is just the first step in creating a new world order.#PeoplesVote

'We will make a success of it''No deal #Brexit looks increasingly likely'Not going so well is it Mrs May @theresa_may?Get yourself off the hook, why not give the people a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain?
Forgive my possible ignorance, but what does a 3 year #Brexit transition period solve that a 21 month transition doesn’t?It just kicks the can down the road a bit further. But other than that...?
Great work from @DerekMackaySNP and the @scotgoveconomy team. While the #Brexit extremists in the UK Tory Government want to pull up the drawbridge; @theSNP Government will continue to be outward looking and ambitious for Scotland. #ScotlandIsNow
"The positive impact on growth would be significant, influential thinktank says of reversing #Brexit - as it forecasts £40bn cost of ploughing on"
Nadine Dorries is first Tory to call for Theresa May to resign and make way for someone more competent. But wasn't it Nadine who had to ask fellow MPs what a customs union was? #Brexit
Has a country ever been more consistently and roundly humiliated than the UK is over #Brexit? - and every single moment has been self-inflicted by the absolute arseholes in charge of it, and the liars and frauds who misled the voters.
BREAKING: EU officials say European Union leaders have dropped plans for a Brexit summit in November because not enough progress has been made #EUCO #Brexit #March29 #2019
My inside information from #EUCO #EuropeanCouncil tonight on #Brexit is that Theresa May said exactly what she did in Salzburg (“but more nicely”) - and deadlocked reigns. November summit likely to be cancelled. Can kicked down road to December. And then...?
The SNP oppose a hard border between Ireland and the six counties. But if an independent Scotland joined the EU there would have to be a hard border between #Brexit Britain and EU Scotland. Go figure...
Brits increasingly believe voting for #Brexit was wrong in hindsight, polls show 
If Theresa May is asking for a longer transition period, she is stalling. It’s time to stand aside and let someone who can negotiate get on with it and deliver. I fully support DD as an interim leader. I’ve done my bit. It’s time for my colleagues to do theirs. #Brexit
Just to say, I was in a room full of business people this afternoon when the low wattage Brexiteer Owen Paterson said "Ask any business, they say five words - Just get on with it". One businessman replied: "'We are fucking shitting ourselves' would be better.#Brexit #NoDeal
After this evening's developments in Brussels, I give a hard #Brexit no more than 10% chance.
What @daraobriain said... #brexit 
If the PM extends the transition period, then Labour will win the next general election and we will never leave the EU. This cannot be allowed to happen! #StandUp4Brexit #Brexit #ChuckChequers #BinTheBackstop
Theresa May is willing to look at extending the transition period for Brexit to three years, the EU Parliament President has suggested.This would mean we’d be subject to EU rules without having a say in them#MayMustGo#Brexit#LeaveMeansLeave

No matter HOW you voted, it’s OBJECTIVE truth that Digital Interference took place in #Brexit. How do I know this? It’s my job to research digital interference in domestic affairs. This act broke Art 42 of the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations. This is not #FakeNews.

The collapse of empire often doesn't end at the borders of the former imperial power, but crosses those borders to wreck that state from the inside. That is what is now happening to the UK. The state is torn apart by a failure to adjust to post-imperial life. #StopBrexit #brexit
Insanely stupid self-harm. People in other countries are shaking their heads in pity and derision at Britain's folly. Time to take back control with a #PeoplesVote and to start restoring respect by stopping #Brexit.#StopBrexit

We can’t have a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit, says @Theresa_May Share this 8-min video so the world knows #Britain has a PM who doesn’t believe in #democracy and to show we have MPs from the 3 main UK parties who are trying hard to give us a meaningful say Link 
So let’s go for a Full English #Brexit  
Nigel Farage had a booming response to this angry caller who claimed everybody who voted Brexit did so to “ship back migrants the next day” @Nigel_Farage | #Brexit 
“much much more time”.. that does not sound like a November #Brexit summit .. 
Looks like @DominicRaab might be planning to tie the hands of the so-called sovereign parliament. @theSNP don’t accept the only choice is between a @theresa_may deal or no deal & we won’t let the Tories get away with this #meaningfulvote #Brexit #PeoplesVote

Final preparations for Saturday's #PeoplesVoteMarch are underway, with our placards, banners, t-shirts, flags, & equipment being delivered today.This will be a great event, so remember to RSVP at , and join us to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. 
Great The Express is campaigning against overturning #Brexit but mistake to use the Remoaners’ branding. Its not a People’s Vote but a second referendum (a third if you count the GE). And it’ll be the last if Remain wins. The door will THEN shut on us voting against EU rule. 
In May 2016, a lying buffoon boarded a #Brexit bus emblazoned with a massive lie about the NHS. In Truro, #Cornwall.On Saturday we're getting a bus to London to protest the lies & false promises & demand a #PeoplesVote.We suspect @BorisJohnson will be making himself scarce.
If govt tries to blackmail parliament into a vote between May's deal (if there is one) & No Deal, they will lose.We were once told #Brexit gives back parliamentary sovereignty - now the Brexiteers try to take it away.All this will do is accelerate a #PeoplesVote. Bring it on.

Galloway trying to insinuate that the SNP are trying to do a deal of supporting #brexit in return for #indyref2. Factious unfounded defamatory rubbish. He must have missed the part where @NicolaSturgeon said she got into politics BECAUSE SHE HATES WHAT THE TORIES STAND FOR.
Raab has said the Government wants the Commons "meaningful vote" on the Brexit deal to be un-amendable. Someone should tell him we're supposed to be a Parliamentary democracy not an autocracy. #Brexit

MISSED LAST 18 MONTHS #Brexit negotiations? Lithuanian President has provided a summary: "We do not know what they want, they do not know themselves what they really want - that's the problem. If you have a negotiator who has no strong mandate, it's very difficult to negotiate."
2 years and the only #brexit plan so far is for the UK to remain bound by EU law for 3 more years until someone comes up with a way for the UK to not be bound by EU law but without it noticing. Seriously people. Seriously. 
Family picture of today's #ALDEPreSummit with Liberal Prime Ministers and European Commisioners ahead of the European Council meeting #EUCO  On the agenda, European elections #EP2019, migration, internal security &amp; #Brexit  
Oh, God, they cannot be serious....#brexit 
I think you'll find @mrjamesob that Rees Mogg and many other Brexit supporting Tories admire greatly the amazing Mrs Thatcher; the daughter of a grocer from Grantham.Nothing to do with class, it's to do with Major being a mediocre PM at best and Thatcher being a legend#Brexit 
Julian Lewis MP - "Next time EU negotiators claim that a hard border is necessary in Ireland, will the PM kindly ask them who would construct it?“The Irish won’t, the British won’t, so unless the EU army plans to march in and build it, it surely can never happen." #Brexit 
The next time a former Prime Minister comes out to warn people against #Brexit remember that it was their neo liberalism that caused the conditions for this madness. It's time for a new deal for the people. 
Peter Bone MP - "The House of Commons decided we would come out on the 29 March and if there is no deal we will trade on WTO rules, which we deal with most of the world on.“The idea there is anything irresponsible about that is patently absurd.” #Brexit

From today's @FinancialTimes #Brexit #climatechange and a lot of other stuff too
#Leavers, the UK sat at the top table of the EU. It was a rule maker, not a rule taker. It had opt outs from what it didn't like, had a huge discount on its membership, enjoyed all of the benefits and always controlled it's own bordersUnlike #Brexit, there were no downsides.
#PMQs proved that Theresa May is on the ropes with no deal and no solution to preventing a hard Irish border. Join me and thousands more at the #peoplesvote march in London on Saturday to demand a democratic say on our future. @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit 
Union 1st, Tories 2nd, Scotland last. It’s clear from #ScottishQuestions today that the Tories don’t care what impact #Brexit will have on Scotland’s people, economy, or the devolution settlement as they push ahead with the #powergrab
It took the SNP decades to live down their 1979 waltz with Mrs Thatcher. Let’s see how they fare after dancing with Mrs May #Brexit #SNP
Before coming here to Brussels - Angela Merkel told the Bundestag: There "must and will always be a distinct difference" between the way EU member states and third countries (which is what the UK becomes after #Brexit ) are treated

On #Brexit referendum day, the Russian troll accounts posted on #ReasonsToLeaveEU 1,102 times. A mix of retweets of genuine people, and their own posts. NOT a full-on pro-Leave campaign, but certainly an attempt to make the hashtag trend on voting day.
85% support in Ireland for staying in the EU, that’s up from 80% in last year’s poll. Strong result & strong response to the #irexit nonsense being propagated post #Brexit  
They say #Corbyn was a threat to the #UK Theresa May has just potentially sacrificed both the north of Ireland and Scotland in the same play! Just to keep her own miserable lederhosen in the prime-ministerial chair! #Labour #Brexit
#PESLeaders ready to start the discussion on EU elections, migration #brexit 
 WATCH: #Brexit can lead to a fishing boom in Scotland worth up to £2.7bn. Yet the SNP want to betray our fishermen and coastal communities by locking them into the hated CFP. @DavidMundellDCT is right that’s this position is “incomprehensible”. #SeaOfOpportunity 
IMPORTANTWithin data check out Russian troll tweets on Brexit referendum day using #ReasonstoleaveEU - it was posted more than 1,000 Times#disinformation #Brexit 
Why are @BBCNews anchors so flippantly patronising about #Brexit? @Jo_Coburn apologises daily for discussing it, @BBCNormanS rolls his eyes at how “this will go on and on”. If you’re bored of your well-paid jobs, make way for journalists who are interested in discussing the news.

European Union (EU28): Kantar Public poll finds that voters in all EU28 countries would vote remain member in the European Union - on average 80%. The lowest support for remain is in the United Kingdom, with 60% approving the country's EU membership. #Brexit #EuropeanUnion
Merkel in Bundestag today: "...it must always be clear, that, even if we want to avoid hardships at the end, there always needs to, and will be, a difference between having membership of the European Union and a partnership with the European Union as a third party." #Brexit
Matt Lucas, James O'Brien, Dan Snow – it's remarkable how many of the people wailing about #Brexit are multi-millionaire ex-boarding school posh boys, while the people telling them they haven't got a clue are from the working class they pretend to speak for. 
Barnstorming forensic speech from @theSNP Spokesperson @NeilGrayMP in @HouseofCommons #UniversalCredit debate. He says the Tories are deaf to the facts on #UniversalCredit Sounds familiar? #Brexit
The bloke in charge of medical supplies says #brexit keeps him up at night with anxiety. However I'm sure some brexiter with no knowledge of healthcare logistics whatsoever will claim to know better and dismiss it as #ProjectFear
How do you know someone is stupid? - they say a #PeoplesVote is not democratic.. I could go on.. You can say they're not funny.. They're not, but neither is #Brexit.

Having lived in France for sixteen years I'm to be interviewed tomorrow for a 10 year resident's permit. I have to provide original proof, and copies, amounting to 142 pages that I've been here legally as an EU citizen. Thanks #Brexit
. Right now I don’t care one bit what Theresa May, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Corbyn or anyone else on the Brexit side say. What John Major, Tony Blair and Co on the Remain side say makes perfect sense. There must be a 2nd Referendum on #Brexit. A simple fact.
If we allow 16 year olds to pay tax or serve in the army, then we should not deny them the right to vote.With #Brexit risking damaging young people’s opportunities, they deserve to have their voices heard. #ExitFromBrexit#PeoplesVote
The backstop? The Chequers plan? Our refresher will help you beat the #Brexit jargon

And just to really put this argument to bed: We can't be 100% sure that flying directly into the sun is bad for your health because nobody's ever done it before. And nobody (happy) ever will.Why? Because experts say IT'S A BAD IDEA.#Brexit 
Always remember who were responsible for 8 years of unnecessary #Austerity & who campaigned for #Brexit referendum.... all in this together! #ChangeIsComing #ForTheMany
Yet another survey out showing a majority for #Remain if a new #referendum on #Brexit were held tomorrow – this time with a lead of 17 points(!). Can we please stop treating #WillOfThePeople as somehow static on this issue? #EndTheChaos #LetThePeopleDecide

I know there’s many of you that don’t think these negotiations are going well. But can you please take a moment to think about the absolute shower of crap it would’ve been if Corbyn had been leading them? #Brexit #PoliticsLive #PMQs
Has @theresa_may turned up to this #PMQs? I hate to say this but #Corbyn has rightly asked why she signed the backstop agreement in December with no time limits.This is a dreadful situation we are in. Dreadful showing by the PM.#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit

Simon Coveney has been really strong, clear and on top of the arguments on #Brexit credit where it is due

The trouble with the @BBC being the mouthpiece for pro #Brexit propaganda is that there's a generation or two out there that believe everything it reports. It's a bit like North Korean state media holding sway over their indoctrinated population.

HOW HAS IT COME TO THIS?  May has boxed herself in stubbornly backing a deal nobody wants but her. Now idiot Hammond insists we need to pay EU £36BB WITHOUT a deal.  They can go whistle!  @borisjohnson #borisjohnson #Brexit #boris johnson 
I must say I was every bit as taken aback as @simoncoveney by John Humphries’ tone during parts of his interview on @BBCr4today. It was very much a case of “Ireland, know your place!” A tone all too familiar to us Scots #Brexit #FBPE
Instead of repeatedly insisting he can get a better #Brexit deal than Theresa May, Corbyn should've spent the past two-and-a-half years explaining to his Leave voters why the 2016 referendum was unsafe & explaining that any form of Brexit will leave the UK permanently worse off.
Excellent interview by @simoncoveney, putting John Humphrys @BBCr4today straight repeatedly on what the UK govt has already agreed to, in writing, on NI border issue. Why are so few UK politicians able to show similar level of expertise on #Brexit & its implications? 
Former Mi6 Chief Sir Richard Dearlove accuses Theresa May’s civil servant, Europe advisor Olly Robbins of “covertly working to lock #UKDefence and security under EU control after #Brexit”.“He’s HOODWINKING the public”

This filthy rag does not respect the fact that many of the 17.4M have changed their minds & in any event didn't vote for a No Deal #Brexit. They also think there will only be 100,000 marching on Saturday for a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain, let's prove them wrong, bigly!
Roger Daltrey, rich, old, privileged, safe and comfortable, says #Brexit will be just fine for him. Well that's a relief, eh. I was so worried about how he would cope. 
A one year extension to #Brexit negotiations would not only be a slap in the face for democracy but will further highlight the farce that is Teresa May.Get on with it. Get out. Never look back.#BuildingBritain#FreefromEU#SDP4Brexit
17.4 million people already #voted #LEAVE love.#BREXIT #UK
Every MP that voted for A50 to be triggered before the UK knew how it was going to deal with the unique problem of the Irish border is culpable of putting the UK in the position it is now. It was like leaping off a bridge without checking the bungees cord was tied.#Brexit
Hugely poignant piece in today’s @IrishTimes about murder at a customs post on the border, a must read for those who dismiss these legitimate #Brexit concerns 
I say again, I do not have a problem with those that voted for #brexit based on the lies they were given. I have a problem with those that lied to them.   #FBPE #PeoplesMarch #PeolpesVote #MarchForMe #stopbrexit
Latest: If you're a Brit legally living & working in #Finland you'll have to reapply to stay here in the event of a #Brexit no deal scenario - and there's no guarantee your application will be approved. 
Do #PeoplesVote not realise having Nick Clegg and Tony Blair fronting their campaign is toxic? You won't change people's minds by using the blokes most famous for being liars! #Brexit #skynews
Is the EU really united over #Brexit ? My video explainer: 
Ok huge ask. Lots of people have told me that they can’t march on Saturday and I’ve put their names on my banner. There are other ways to demonstrate against #Brexit Everyday @SODEMAction is outside Parliament. If you can’t march Saturday can you join him? Anyday? Please?
Powerful @IrishTimes front page today on risks from #Brexit & reminder of the danger to life from a hard border - compulsory reading for politicians as EU leaders gather in Brussels for summit to try to crack the negotiations deadlock

"You Brits seem to think that you're the most important thing in the world, actually you're not." Brilliant answer from German journalist @sebastianborger to @BBCGaryR question on whether #Brexit was weighing heavily on Angela Merkel?  #bbcgms
As we near #losersmarch what unites Major/Campbell-a sneering condescension towards millions who voted #Brexit Major denied the UK a people's vote on #Maastricht which so speeded up the conveyor belt for countries to lose sovereignty and be lost in a federal superstate. #Brexit 
Another early morning flight to Brussels to meet the leaders of our sister parties @PES_PSE from across Europe. Pressing the case, again, for our interests to be protected in the #Brexit negotiations. 
"We need new facts," says EU Council President Tusk."Oh no you don't," says the #Brexit Facts4EU team.A must-read : 
We are off to Brussels, looking for the deal! #Brexit 
Philip Hammond happy to pay EU £36 Billion for No Deal!Rees-Mogg: It's simply wrong!House of Lords report say we have No obligation under UK, EU or Int law to pay anything if we Leave without Deal.It's a cavalier approach to taxpayers money.#Brexit #EU

Rees-Mogg is getting flustered and letting his true personality slip out from under the mask of upper-crust gentility. And what we see is no gentleman, but rather a low crawling thing of gutter politics spitting out petty malice, bile and venom.#StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Late night in my office, prepping for ‘Politics of #EU’ lectures & what do I find? An entire book dedicated to Britain’s struggle/dedication to JOIN the EEC. Britain was rejected twice before joining, because De Gaulle believed they showed a distinct ‘lack of commitment’. #Brexit 
Arlene Foster re #Brexit: "you can not separate out part of a nation from the rest of that nation".Arlene, do you mean the British partition of the Irish nation?I hope Mr Barnier said: get your head out of your arse & stop looking a gift-horse in the mouth - accept our backstop 
Retweet if you're a Tory voter, member or otherwise who won't vote for ANY Tory if #Brexit ends up as #BRINO
Well, I have a personal message for all those who belong to the European Research Group (#ERG) and it goes like this... Pedicabo ego vos omnes!#Brexit #PeoplesVote #FinalSay #FinalSayForAll #FBPE #OFOC #EndTheChaos #PeoplesVoteMarch
I have huge respect for @Conservatives MPs. It's important that in the decisions they make in the next few weeks on #Brexit and the party leadership, they know precisely why we are where we are #truthtopower
Man the tax haven life boats! #Brexit #EU #ATAD
What will never be forgiven or forgotten will be selling the UK to the EU by forcing through Maastricht without a referendum.John Major damaged the country and destroyed the Party. The rebels who fought him have been vindicated.#StandUp4Brexit #brexit
I have no idea why it has taken so long for someone to write a thread on why prices will go down rather than up under WTO rules (so called "no deal" #Brexit) but it is long overdue and essential reading for anyone interested in the facts not fiction. 
... Jacob Rees-Mogg joked about how glad the Government whips would be to see such close DUP/Tory co-operation. Sammy Wilson made a short speech and stressed that the DUP is - like the ERG - against the UK being kept in a customs union after #Brexit. 2/2
Of course he had a ‘right go’ at youHe’s a working man & you’re a condescending luvvie intent on subverting democracy in BritainYou’re like the rest of the preaching, self righteous, virtue signalling ‘celebrities’ increasing support for #Brexit
BREAK: @FT "Barnier has said he is open to the possibility of a one-year extension to #Brexit transition in return for Theresa May accepting a “two-tier” backstop to avoid a border in Northern Ireland, according to EU diplomats".
Mrs May is now PRINO – Prime Minister in Name Only!How can she talk for so long without saying anything?Truly, a PRINO skill, some might say her only skill !To chunter verbiage like some demonically possessed printer!Where's the Off button!#Brexit #EU
 This way to #Brexit  
Red Brexit or Blue Brexit#Labour  or Tory, same #brexit.Same Policy of Leaving EU Single Market that wil kill jobs!Fight to #Remain join or support the #LibDems #FinalSay
#Brexit was never going to be easy. The EU is a ruthless oligarchy determined to punish us for daring to vote Leave. But May's capitulations have made its job that much easier. Her cowardice has put British democracy in peril, writes @Tom_Slater_
Surely some of the high priests of #Brexit must have at least a niggling feeling that the pesky remoaners could be right and a dogshit tsunami of biblical proportions is about to hit the good people of the UK?
Original take on #Brexit from @andreajenkyns. Apparently the EU has been holding us back in the fight against malaria...
“They persuaded a deceived population to vote to be weaker and poorer.”[John Major]#Brexit
I've spent all my life working in the dirty end of British industry (well North of London). On Saturday I will be losing my overtime to march against #BrexitHow on earth I've suddenly become elite I'll never know. It hasn't removed the cuts or the callouses from my hands!
I honestly have no time for the people who blame #Corbyn for #Brexit we know its nothing to do with him and we know you aren't that stupid to blame him for it either which means you are being disingenuous and I honestly can not stand disingenuous people
I totally agree! Wise words indeed, from Sir John Major.He’s thinking of what’s best for the country, our future status & security, let alone economic prosperity.#Brexit#Accountability‘Colossal Misjudgement’ ‘Deceived Population’ ‘It will never be forgotten, nor forgiven’

A Customs Union limits our ability to do global free trade deals which is the golden prize of #Brexit. We voted to be global not insulated inside the EU jail
And #Brexit will make us more dependent on the Saudis. Weakening our ties with European democracies and having to grovel for business at the feet of brutal regimes - is this what we want for our country? #PeoplesVote #FBPE
Shut up, you child-the adults are going to take control and end this mess. Take that from someone who believed the lies & voted Leave and is a #RemainerNow. The #PeoplesVote & an end to #Brexit will SAVE ordinary people. Brexit would bankrupt ordinary folk, not that you care.

The prime minister says she's "convinced" that if the cabinet retains a "firm" unitary position that Britain will get a breakthrough in #Brexit negotiations

Former PM John Major telling it as It is on #Brexit  “a colossal misjudgment that will diminish both the UK and the EU. It will damage our national and personal wealth”  
I met today with young people from all parts of the UK who will be marching on Saturday for their future - and for all our futures. I’ll be with them and I would urge you all to join us too and demand a #PeoplesVote on  #Brexit: 
My latest on @RT_com on #Brexit #Ireland #TheresaMay #Corbyn #EU
#Brexit Britain is a country governed by psychopathic greed, lies, bigotry, hate, political cowardice and ignorance. And it is the will to reverse that debasement of our society which drives most pro-EU activists, not economics. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

EU27 ministers reviewed the state of the #Brexit negotiations and prepared #EUCO (Article 50).Find out more: 
This mess and dishonesty of the Govt’s handling of #Brexit has got to stop.It is time the people were given an opportunity to pass their judgement with a final say on the deal, including the opportunity to remain.#ExitFromBrexit#PeoplesVote
The *great* thing about #Brexit is not only can you promise lots of amazing stuff you can't possibly deliver... ...You also get to blame everyone else when it goes wrong! 
7/ Thus, we are urging you to take the moral high ground tomorrow and start planning to work with the UK Govt to rescue the already (painfully) agreed #citizensrights agreement and make it non-dependent on an overall outcome of the #Brexit negotiations.

What i don't understand is why #Article50 was issued before our government had a clue what to do about the Irish border. #Brexit
Gosh. Uncompromising words from @BrexitStewart but from everything I’ve heard about Team May’s behaviour during the days/weeks before Chequers... not unfair words. All so sad for party, country and for the squandering of the reset opportunity that #Brexit should have been 
Richard Pendry voted to leave the EU. But after carrying out a risk assessment, he tells James O'Brien he's now a People's Vote campaigner.@mrjamesob | @RichardCPendry | #Brexit
Five ACTUAL things we did not know about when we voted for Brexit:> The EU immigration crisis> The USA declaring a trade war on the EU> Italy, Hungary, Czech Rep, Austria & Poland falling out with the EU> Italy's imminent economic demise> The euro's imminent demise#Brexit
The sheer contempt with which the EU is treating the UK is reason enough to #leave.#Brexit
#Brexit isn't just causing foreign investment to dry up. It also risks overseas investors suing the UK for breaking its promises of a business-friendly environment - thanks to something called "BITs". @benjaminbaccas explains.
Nigel Farage - “Labour no longer has any desire for this country to be able to make its own trade deals - we’ll have them done on our behalf by the EU.“There are 5 million Labour voters who as we speak are being betrayed, and it’s time we told them how wrong that is." #Brexit 
With 26 EU Foreign Ministers in Luxembourg with @HMcEntee at GAC debate on #BREXIT. Absolute solidarity from all with @MichelBarnier and IRE on need for a legally operable backstop in the WA, a backstop that must apply “unless and until” another solution is found. @BrendanHowlin
Then he promised he would go next June after he had frustrated #Brexit 
On #WorldFoodDay met @Minettebatters President @NFUtweets. #Brexit  cost: lower standards via new trade deals; long term threat to farm income; loss of food security; curb on  migrants in food processing. @DefraGovUK plans for slaughter half sheep population

BREAKING: Tory MP broke election spending rules in order to see off Nigel Farage's parliamentary ambitions forever, court hears.If Nigel wasn't conned out of that seat he would have been battering all of them in parliament over #Brexit continuously.
James O'Brien - #Brexit's gone from "we'll all be better off" to "we'll survive" & "it's not the end of the world" .... & the #Brexiteers are getting away with that because the debate shifts every week into damage limitation & reverse ferrets.#peoplesvote #FBPE #LBC @mrjamesob
Nicola Sturgeon wants mass immigration, wants to keep fighting against #Brexit, wants Scottish borders open to huge numbers & wants to give everyone access to benefits, schools & the NHS because she thinks she can blame Westminster for all of Scotland’s problems.#SNPlogic #Fail
Richard Pendy voted to leave the EU. But after carrying out a risk assessment, he tells James O'Brien he's now a People's Vote campaigner.@mrjamesob | #Brexit
To #Remainers it has come as no surprise that the govt cannot deliver #Brexit. A promise based on lies will always flounder when reality kicks in. I just wonder how long it will take for the penny to drop in the minds of dogmatic #Leavers who refuse to believe they were conned.
Tánaiste & Foreign Minister @simoncoveney on the #brexit & the Irish border: “Our bottom line on this is that we must have a backstop in the withdrawal treaty. That backstop cannot be time limited. .. It needs to be there unless & until something better is negotiated & agreed.”
The Electoral Commission passed its findings(that #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw in #Brexit referendum) to the police. #Police cannot now fail to investigate because it’s politically sensitive! ..
This is turning into our Watergate, a big cover-up clearly intended, at the least, to conceal the facts until #Brexit is effectively through the door. This is #BrexitGate#PeoplesVote

But there is no evidence that this will happen. How do countries outside the EU survive? How did we survive before 1974 and before the EU was foisted upon us without a vote! Frankly this is Project fear on overdrive!! #Brexit
Businesses such as mine, will not have easy access to parts & components made in the EU & this problem not only impacts the running of a business, but also slows down jobs, impacting the customer hugely! This is only one of the many reasons that #Brexit is bad for business! 
Here's one of the placards we'll be carrying at the #PeoplesVoteMarch.Any trade deal with Trump would mean imports of US products made to much lower standards than those currently underpinned by the EU.Bad for consumers and ruinous for Britain's farmers.#Brexit #PeoplesVote

US CEO explains reasons for choosing Ireland as post-#brexit investment location: “it’s an English-speaking EU member state that boasts a diverse talent pool, entrepreneurial spirit, and long-standing support for technological innovation.”

The sheer stupidity and pointlessness of #Brexit is maddening, but the fanatical zeal with which the Brexit ringleaders are going about wrecking our livelihoods and taking away our rights in pursuit of their demented fantasy is alarming to say the least.

Given we have now proved there isn’t a version of #Brexit which Brexiters can unite behind, it’s time to take this back to the people. #FinalSayForAll#BrexitBreaksBritain#BrexitReality#ExitFromBrexit
I challenged the Prime Minister on her inability in being able to keep her party together, let alone the country. No one in #CardiffNorth voted to be poorer 2 yrs ago. The right thing is to put the deal back to the people for a final say. #Brexit @peoplesvote_uk #PeoplesVote
"There is a strong sense here that the EU27 stand united, and that the unity of the union is far more important than anything else". #Brexit 
I wonder how negotiations are going with the Cypriot government? Britain still occupies two large areas of Cyprus.The forgotten borders of #Brexit.
Bloody doctors have a bias too. They keep diagnosing serious illness so they can have an excuse to treat people.Bloody teachers! Telling our kids what to do, so they grow up "educated" and create more teachers! It's a goddamn ponzi scheme!!#Brexit
PM taking up reigns post #frauderendum should have appointed a royal commission to sculpt #Brexit. Once that vision was clear, it should’ve been put to the people or parliament BEFORE sending the notification letter to the EU. PM decided to create a runaway train wreck.
They don’t even know their own history - Boudicca led a failed uprising and then poisoned herself.  Though admittedly much unnecessary damage , ultimate failure and sudden catastrophic conclusion common themes. #Brexit 
The Brussels elite have always wanted to punish the UK for leaving – Theresa May must not let them succeed:  #Brexit
The UK cannot leave the EU. We can cease to be a member, but we can't sail off into distant oceans. The economic superpower next door will continue to have a huge influence over us, but we will have lost our very powerful say in its decision-making.#PeoplesVote #Brexit
When acolytes of the “Conservative Madrassa” - the toxic YBF or Young Bullies Foundation investigated after the death of a young activist - are at the forefront of calls for HoC speaker John Bercow to resign, then you know this is a #Brexit related hit job

DUP #Brexit negotiator Sammy Wilson tells @TodaySOR the Irish border has been "dreamt up as a problem" by Dublin and Brussels. Words fail me.
Always a pleasure to accept your invitation. The 56% (now 63%) of N Ireland who voted Remain have no voice in Westminster. On this the DUP do NOT represent the majority. They have no authority to scupper the PMs #Brexit deal
BREAK: EU Senior official:EU are listening to Theresa May in regards to her domestic difficulties. Goes on to say:Those difficulties might have an impact on the choreography but NOT on the substance of #Brexit. 
At some point, surely there will be enough sane people in Britain to shout stop.No deal cataclysmic for Britain, very damaging for Ireland.Ireland will still be in the EU.Britain will, overnight, become a "third country" to the rest of the world.Insanity on stilts #Brexit
The European Council has said it would welcome Scotland with open arms. Why? Because one is staying in the EU and the other one (#brexit) is shitting on the rug on the way out the door. So no! An entirely different situation completely! Independence = apples and brexit = shit.

#TuesdayThoughts Arlene Foster on #BREXIT affecting Northern Ireland "You can't separate one part of a nation from the rest of the nation"...That is literally what Britain's occupation of six of Ireland's Counties is, you thick unionist moron. 
We should have seen the #Brexit vote coming. For too many in UK life is unstable, unfulfilling & unfair.Those in power owe the people action to rebalance our unequal society.Some thoughts on healing our divided nation from my @openDemocracyUK article:
.@Theresa_May’s #Brexit problem is that she is trying to negotiate in the interest of the @CONservatives & to keep them together & in power. .@JeremyCorbyn would negotiate in the interests of the country; The Many! We need these nasty, lying, cheating Tories out!

Corbyn is right to keep his mouth shut. At this point he either has to side with sick neoliberals, or a government determined to shit over the peace he brought to Northern Ireland. #Brexit
This Brexit impasse is entirely of May's making. She thinks her job is to placate the elites who hate #Brexit rather than represent the people who voted for it. Her capitulations to Brussels have brought us to the brink of betrayal, writes @Tom_Slater_
Happy #TuesdayThoughts#Brexit is dying, the misrepresentations have hit reality & it's clear there is no way to do brexit well.It will be stopped.And the more and more sensible leave voters that speak out as #RemainerNow the quicker that will happen.#FinalSay #PeoplesVote
Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn is mistaken, there's no #Brexit deal better than the one we already have, therefore any Brexit plan would be unacceptable. Marí is right, we need a leader who puts country before their own party and dogma & supports a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain
Move over #Brexit technocrats - political leaders now take centre stage. And what are they thinking ahead of the EU summit dinner tomorrow with Theresa May? I’ve headed to Berlin: 
If #Brexit ruins research, many scientists will be leaving the UK “Many of us will be forced to move our research abroad or seek joint affiliations in the EU” @leecronin
Unelected, unaccountable appointees, operating in the shadows, are making a shambolic mess of #Brexit but have the audacity to complain when the public voices their legitimate concerns and opinions. An apology would have been more appropriate. Jog on. 
Don't tell them your name Raab!#Brexit #dadsarmy
#Brexit thoughts - Absolutely NO ONE voted to leave EU with no deal whatsoever, right? So in context of an outcome no one wanted, can we all stop using the phrase ‘will of the people’, now? (More accurate is ‘will of a few rabid back benchers with dubious motivations’).
'Border or no border, the Irish will shoot one another if they want to' says Boris Johnson's father Stanley on @GMB @piersmorgan with no one picking him up on that statement. Not funny. It just shows the mentality.  @campaignforleo @simoncoveney #brexit

Oh dear!The Brexiteers thought #Brexit Britain would be the Singapore of Europe.But now its looks as if Singapore will be the EU's Singapore.And Britain won't get a look in.Trade deals are so much easier when you have a big population of buyers to offer.
Any MP thinking of voting for any decent #Brexit deal May might broker could find themselves walking through the divisions with right-wing Tories, something I only did a couple of hundred times. 
Laughter as Theresa May updates the House of Commons on #Brexit negotiations 
Will those who claim patriotism necessitates supporting #Brexit be contributing their incomes to plugging the hole in the communal kitty when the Brexit dividend fails to materialise?.I'll start by asking John Humphrys.And perhaps he can ask Jacob Rees-Mogg & co.#r4today
One explanation for this behaviour is that May and the Brextremists are deliberately running down the clock, so that in the end our fractured political system lacks the time to prevent the country falling off the no-deal cliff. Disaster-capitalism & a #Brexit tax haven beckon. 
Switzerland is in Schengen. Ireland is NOT. It IS in a Common Travel that is separate to the EU and existed long before it! No Customs Union or backstop needed! An open border is fine and all this wrangling is just an attempt to keep us shackled to the EU#StandUp4Brexit #Brexit 
.@hermannkelly says in event of 'No Deal' ,Ireland's interests would be to leave the EU and make a trade deal with UK and other countries . #Brexit #Irexit #TonightVMT
Theresa May states that she is entering the final stages of #Brexit negotiations to the amusement of the House of Commons 
"#Labour's position on #brexit is unclear" ??? I genuinely don't understand this point of view. Either people aren't paying attention or the media isn't reporting it. And the #EU seems pretty happy with what labour has put on the table.
This from @BobbyMcDonagh1 demonstrates how far official Ireland’s understanding of unionism has come in 20+ yrs.He accepts the seriousness of unionist concerns re: #brexit and fully respects the integrity of unionist identity.#ProgressByCompromise
Don’t worry folks Brexiters know more about running Ford than Ford do.In the real world, it’s not surprising that the case for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit is becoming overwhelming & a clear majority of the public now support the UK remaining in the EU.
As the Tories #brexit shambles gets even worse, the prospect of a General Election gets closer. Some good insights here from Paul mason about some of the issues us Labour folks need to start thinking about now to be ready if and it is a big if, we win.. 
When I was a young man and first saw these continental street urinals I thought them the most revolting things imaginable. Nothing over the last 40 years has changed my mind.  #BuildTheWall #Brexit 
You what?!? Backstop to the backstop?!? #Brexit in danger of becoming incomprehensible to all but the political anoraks... 
This is bad news. We need to keep our world-class research base if we want our pharmaceutical industry to survive & thrive. That’s one reason I got an amendment to #Brexit law to make sure the Govt keeps us in the European medicines regulatory network. 
If Theresa May were a cat, still believing she could get a good #brexit deal 
#Brexit shouldn’t proceed while serious doubts remain over the legitimacy of the 2016 vote. @UKParliament should expedite a new vote, this time explicitly outlawing interference by foreign governments, also individuals & organisations with malign intent
FIRST EPISODE OF #REMAINERNOW PODCASTHere we talk to @damidude about why he voted leave, why he changed his mind & what he's now doing to fight #BrexitIt's a bit rough & ready (awkward pause at start) but hope it's interesting.Links to articles etc 
Just noticed that the Edinburgh Agreement was signed 6 years ago today - seems like another age of civilised politics now replaced by complete #Brexit chaos presided over by a Tory party at war with itself and listening to no one. #allbetsareoff
The Tory party should be absolutely ashamed of what they've done to this Country by calling the pathetic EU Referendum in the first place and expecting innocent people to make such a decision when provided with a complete pack of lies. Disgraceful CON #Brexit
If you think about how many people will actually be happy with the final #brexit deal (or no deal) it will hardly amount to a democratic majority will it?
May says her aim with #Chequers is 'frictionless' trade with EU post #Brexit.Sorry no, that's what Remain warned, people still voted to leave. Because sovereignty matters more than the frictions the EU may throw our way.If this doesn't prove May is a remainer what will? 
#Brexit needed a 10 year plan just to try and understand its complexities. The bottom line is that we have a bunch of amateurs trying to sort out this debacle in a 2 year window, so the woeful mess which has resulted, has been completely predictable
I berated @Nigel_Farage in Torquay recently, and @SkyNews went with this! #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE
'Nobody will be happier that Meghan Markle is going to have a baby than Theresa May because the PM is utterly clueless on #Brexit at the moment.'  @Kevin_Maguire on May's Brexit statement. 
From day one, I’ve said the DUP supported #brexit so they could build a border to shut NI off from rest of Ireland, before demographics brought about a UNited Ireland.
I just want this to be over.So many people's lives and livelihoods are on the line.A once-prosperous country is severing its economic lifelines. The values I stand for are being replaced with nationalistic hate.My children are emigrating.WHY?#Brexit.
#Brexit is unpatriotic and treacherous act, as it will damage the country by destroying jobs, wrecking the economy and harming people lives. The dishonourable MPs that support it should be prevented from ever standing for parliament again.
You can only imagine the furore if an Irish political representative summoned the example of the Irish Volunteers in 1916 in the midst of all this #Brexit chaos - yet more irresponsible hyperbole from Brexiteers 
On most #EU issues we are like-minded, such as the negotiations on the new #MFF, the eurozone, ongoing efforts to destroy the business model of people smugglers or #Brexit.

Sinn Féin wants Northern Ireland vote in event of no-deal #Brexit 
#Brexit talks have collapsed as there’s no agreement on how to avoid a hard border on #Ireland. A no-deal #Brexit is now perilously close. Nobody voted for that, but @Theresa_May has ruled out a #PeoplesVote. Watch the video and share @Jon_Danzig’s report:

For everyone obsessing about regulatory divergence, here’s @IPPR research that shows #Brexit was a vote for re-regulation not deregulation... 
Just met PM to discuss state of play in #Brexit talks. Appreciated her update. Clear though that there are some fundamental differences still to be resolved. My view clear that single market and customs union membership is best way to find resolution and secure way forward.
Wow! The ITV 6:30pm news bulletin out BBC’s the BBC. @romillyweeks gets through a long report on the May’s #Brexit statement WITHOUT mentioning or covering Jeremy Corbyn’s response. No doubt to allow idiots to say Corbyn was silent? Shameful. Anyway, here’s part of his response.. 
What the #Remoaners are saying is that #Brexit is just too difficult,So we'll allow the 5th biggest economy in the world to be run by the unelected EU dictators.Well, the 17.4m Brits who voted #LEAVE are made of sterner stuff than that & we won't let you betray us in this way.

1) Germany’s Europe Minister @MiRo_SPD tells me #Brexit negotiations have been paused so the U.K. side can ‘go into a huddle’ - and ‘see how far they can go at home’. Mr Roth said the EU was also mulling over if it had any room to manoeuvre on its Irish border position
For those who missed the PM statement on #Brexit this afternoon,  heres a clip to sum it up.#BinTheBackstop #StandUpForBrexit
Astra Zeneca has announced that time has run out and it is stopping all future investment in the UK as a result of #Brexit uncertainty.May today confirmed they are still a way off a deal with the EUWhich large manufacturer will next break ranks and announce it is pulling out?

Tomorrow at 9h Tusk @eucopresident meets EU’s chief #Brexit negotiator @MichelBarnier to prepare #EUCO Wednesday evening.Confirmed that PM @theresa_may will address the EU27 leaders on #Brexit Wednesday evening.Updated public agenda here:

"As we reach a critical point in this nation's history, we need a Prime Minister who will for once make the right decision - and put the country before her party."         Jeremy Corbyn.#Brexit #GeneralElectionNow #BrexitShambles #ToriesOut #GTTO #JC4PM
Exactly which of the many versions of #Brexit did people vote for? No one was able to set out what form this major constitutional, economic and social surgery would involve let alone the evidence of the risks and benefits. There is no #InformedConsent to this mess
A lot of stupid stuff has been said on #Brexit but this will surely be up there when the worst Brexit tweet prize is handed out. The bellicose language is just plain insulting-UK is free to leave the EU, just not cost free. EU not making demands just protecting its interests. 
I’ve just challenged the Prime Minister on her inability in being able to keep her party together let alone the country. No one in #CardiffNorth voted to be poorer two years ago. The right thing now is to put the deal back to the people for a final say. #Brexit @peoplesvote_uk
Today I asked @theresa_may if she wants the #meaningfulvote on 27 Nov, the same date as #ECJ hears Scottish case on whether Article 50 can be unilaterally revoked, because she’s afraid of MPs knowing the answer to that question before they vote. #Brexit #FBPE

Nothing new in the PM's #Brexit statement, but a growing call on both sides of the House for a #PeoplesVote.  As it becomes increasingly obvious what a mess we’re in, with no consensus in Parliament, it is the only way forward.
There is absolutely no need for all this mess & muddle over #BrexitJust walk away.The EU would soon come running.We have all the cards.With WTO tariffs the EU would be £8,000,000,000 a year WORSE off.Stop the dither.Get OUT now.No more delay.Respect the vote of the 17.4m.
Remember how Brexiters said the Irish border wasn’t a problem? Now it's clear #Brexit hinges on the issue. The government still has no answers. The only way to solve the problem now is a #PeoplesVote
WATCH: @nusuk President and @FFSake_ supporter @ShakiraSweet1 is marching on October 20th and she's bringing supporters along. Make sure you join her at our #PeoplesVoteMarch for the Future this Saturday, October 20th to demand a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit: 
Sarah Wollaston - Here's some #brexit reality... AstraZeneca have announced, this afternoon, that they will no longer invest in the United Kingdom! Once we know that final deal wouldn't it be reasonable to go back to the people and get their consent in a #PeoplesVote? #FBPE
RT! Open invitation to Brexiters in the Conservatives, DUP and other Unionist parties to tell the readers of NI's Border newspaper @impartialrep WHY you support #Brexit and answer our Qs. Please email me for more information: redwards@impartialreporter.com. Will anyone respond?
Is it me or is May not expressly ruling out a #PeoplesVote in case of a no deal #brexit scenario?
And now @AstraZeneca reportedly stopping investment in UK because of #Brexit debacle. If we’re faced with an inferior deal - then the public deserve the right on whether to proceed #PeoplesVote
Please bear in mind. These are the muppets behind the @peoplesvote_uk - who is funding them?  #brexit 
After an hour of debate following May’s statement on the #Brexit stand-off, these are the MPs who’ve called for a People’s Vote: Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Chris Bryant, Chris Leslie, Ben Bradshaw, Heidi Allen, Dominic Grieve, Stella Creasy, Tom Brake
Failure by the UK and European Union to achieve a breakthrough in #Brexit talks has sent #sterling lower and London share prices down. The Irish border issue is still an impediment for consensus on the terms under which Britain will leave the EU.
Anna Soubry - It's time to face up to the fact that #brexit cannot be delivered.. so take it back to the people & have a #PeoplesVote. #FBPE @Anna_Soubry @campbellclaret @sarahwollaston
The problem is that #Brexit, once enacted, isn't a policy that can be easily reversed, cancelled or kicked into the long grass, and never spoken of again. There is no turning back, for decades at the very least. #PeoplesVote Let’s get out and march!
If I was an MP (or cabinet minister) who wanted a firm commitment to a fixed end date on a customs arrangement I would not be reassured by what I have heard from PM this afternoon #Brexit
"This really is beginning to feel like Groundhog Day"@jeremycorbyn reacts to @theresa_may's #Brexit statement from "a shambles of a government" by calling it another "nothing has changed moment". 
UCU members have overwhelmingly backed a referendum on the final #Brexit deal secured by the government. 89% of members who voted said yes to the question:“Should UCU support a referendum on the final Brexit deal negotiated by the UK government?” 
Every time I see Theresa May speak I just think "how did you get here!?" "how did we all get here" "what am I looking at?" #Brexit #Commons
Should the nation be given a second vote on the terms of #Brexit?@piersmorgan | @campbellclaret
The SNP's plan for #Brexit would see us stay in the Customs Union and Single Market: without being able to influence the laws that we will have to live by. It's going backwards from where we are now.
If you’re listening to the PM on Brexit and thinking there must be a better way than this - Read @NicolaSturgeon speech this morning on the alternative way forward #Brexit 
Utter shambles in @HouseofCommons for Brexit statement. Conservatives and Labour howling at one another so loud people can barely be heard. Feels like there is no reasonable way out of this mess. 165 days to go. #Brexit
#Corbyn not one word about #Remain or #PeoplesVote#Labour want their own #Brexit Their very own cliff edge! 
Theresa May's Emergency #Brexit Statement to Parliament said nothing - with 844 days gone and only 165 days left until leaving day, this Tory government still has no idea how Brexit will (or can) work.

When asked are you happy living in the EU by Eurobarometer, 66% of those in the UK who were asked said yes & just 25% said no!The UK appears to be #RemainerNow On that basis #brexit is clearly not the #willofthepeople. Surely the democratic option is to have a #PeoplesVote?

Today @theresa_may will dance to the Hard Brexiteers’ tune. But if she gets a deal, it’s shaping up to be bad for Britain. MPs mustn’t feel bullied into rubber-stamping it. #Brexit #PeoplesVote

75% of doctors and nurses now say they would vote to #Remain in any new vote on #Brexit – up from 66% in 2016 – with 83% saying the famous £350m for the #NHS was a deliberate lie. Is an injection of chaos really what the #health service needs? #EndTheChaos
Brexit politicians, media and many Leave supporters have treated Remainers with contempt, arrogance, abuse, insults, bullying, intolerance and threats. We owe no respect to them and their wrecking-ball of a project. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #Brexit
Our party under @RuthDavidsonMSP has lost members lost voters support and has shamefully elected a number of right wing sectarian bigots into public office. Ruth has flip flopped on #Brexit many times. Remember this Ruth? Remember this? 
The only miscalculation has been by the entire #Brexit lobby  believing (despite being repeatedly told by all those pesky experts) that this was going to be a disaster.

When the Conservative government privatised the railways, it promised the process would be easy, and would bring about "profound and lasting improvements". 24 years later, the privatised system is still causing chaos. So don't believe a word they say about #Brexit.
Hugely impressive keynote #Brexit speech by @ScotGovFM at @theRSAorg this morning. Q&A session particularly interesting. It's just so refreshing to hear a politician listen, think and give solid, honest answers.
Remoaners for the past 3 years: "No deal means 20 mile lorry jams, no cheese and the NHS collapsing!"Remoaners now: "No deal will make us 0.04% less well of than we would have been."I think we'll cope!#StandUp4Brexit #Brexit #ChuckChequers
Wow. Nicola Sturgeon forensically tearing the Govt’s hapless and misguided #Brexit debacle apart item by item. Fluent, reasoned and most importantly, accurate. Can we get an SNP Govt fur the whole of the U.K.?

I have followed the speeches by the Scottish First Minister since the first press conference after #RefBrexit . The position of the Scottish Government has always been clear and coherent (and forceful). Nothing has changed (IMHO).#Brexit #ScotlandInEurope
This @CompassOffice report should be compulsory reading in Whitehall. My chapter calls for an overhaul of our working lives & our democracy to start addressing grotesque inequality that blights UK.We must address the reasons people voted for #Brexit.
People are angry, very angry. #Brexit has been bought by lies, hate, gerrymandering, cheating, electoral crime, foreign interference, tax-dodging press barons & Arron Banks' dodgy millions. To proceed with Brexit is to reward this assault on democracy.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

The biggest crisis facing the UK since 1945, and the leader of the opposition has gone missing. A pro-EU Labour leader would now be presenting the British people with a clear path out of this Tory mess. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #Brexit
There is no question. The alt right, Bannon, Mercer, Rees Shite and their horrific cabal the ERG are the most poisonous influence on this country since the Second World War. They are free market fascists, religious fundamentalists who worship capitalism. #brexit is their doing.

The EU's negotiators' decision to make an issue of the Northern Ireland border looked clever a few weeks ago ... but now could backfire given it pits them directly against the tough negotiators of the DUP #Brexit
Anyone wondering why - after so many months of #Brexit talks - the Irish border issue hasn’t yet been settled should consider that - according EU sources - the Irish backstop was not discussed in negotiations by U.K. request between Dec and the end of the Tory party conference
#Brexit If a backstop is only temporary,  it’s not a backstop.....

#Brexit talks hit a "real problem" over the Irish border, government sources warn 
" it is probably inevitable that we will end up with a no deal scenario." Says DUP's Sammy Wilson MP, buoyed no doubt by Davidson and Mundell falling in with DUP line. The great union dividend: a cliff edge #Brexit.
Rochford MP Mark Francois has told @BBCNews that Cabinet members "have been treated like mushrooms" by the PM over #Brexit. "They've been kept in the dark and fed a diet of BS". He says there are 3 - 4 members of the Cabinet who are "very unhappy" over NI backstop. #VictoriaLive
‘Bollocks to Brexit’ joins the #PeoplesVote !!March for the future - Park Lane, Saturday, Oct 20. - Stopping #Brexit is top of the agenda! 
If you thought Arlene Foster talking about 'blood red' lines was bad, here's a DUP official promising 'guerilla war’ against #Brexit plan, adding “We are going to squeeze their balls until their ears bleed." Makes Tory gaffes on @StephenNolan seem quaint

Johnson is partly right. Yes it’s time for the PM to stand up to the bullies. Both the bullies inside and outside our political system. They are not interested in facts, compromise or our country's welfare #Brexit 
Dear UK MPs, Voting down May's deal in @HouseofCommons does NOT mean No Deal. Other options:1. Extension of 2 year limit by EU consensus. 2. Revocation of notification by EU consensus. 3. ECJ to decide in January if UK can UNILATERALLY stop #brexit. Yours truly.
If you’re listening to this morning’s depressing #Brexit news and screaming to yourself “this is insane - I’ve got do to SOMETHING!”... then join the #PeoplesVoteMarch on Saturday. Let’s get at least a million people onto the streets of London!
How did we get here? Well, it was entirely predictable, and actually, inevitable given the enormity of the task, the punishing timeline and the ill-preparedness (and delusion) of Brexiteers. #Brexit 
Just in case the Tories need pictures.. #Brexit #NI #Maybot

I've long since ceased listening to #BBCR4today & John Humphrys et al because of #BBCBias but it sounds like @Keir_Starmer ran rings around the pro tory bigot today & exposed his lack of knowledge of #brexit. We must #GetTheToriesOut or apparently suffer a #NoDealBrexit @bbcnews

"It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled" - Mark Twain #Brexit 
From "the easiest deal in history" to "not the end of the world", there is no denying that #Brexit is not what was first offered. The mandate to leave the EU is dead and there is no consensus for a way forward. Government should #SuspendA50 or call a #PeoplesVote.
You have to give it to the SNP. Spent more £ on a by-election than the #EUref, appointed an old school free marketeer as their #Brexit spokesperson, haven’t presented a single viable solution to constitutional fallout - yet the supine commentators still line up and applaud.

-Hi, we want to leave the EU-OK-Can we have a trade deal?-Let's agree on the backstop first-Yeah fine, whatever-Thanks-Can we have a trade deal now?-OK. Any preference?-The best deal in the world please-OK. As long as you honour the backstop-Which backstop?#Brexit
I'm told that yesterday's #Brexit talks faltered because the Ireland protocol still contained the option of N Ireland remaining in the customs union, despite extensive tweaks to the text. This has given birth to the hideous phrase "backstop to the backstop." (1)

Shall we book the coaches? Tractors ready for a trip up to Westminster? If Theresa May fails to deliver Brexit then the 2002 Countryside March will start to look like a school trip. Betray us & face the consequences, Mrs May. #brexit #csm #TheresaMay
Language matters. No deal = chaotic & catastrophic hard #Brexit. If UK gets WA through but does not change red lines (leaving CU & SM) = hard #Brexit after transition. Political declaration = non-binding intent. Backstop = contingency unless & until an alternative is available
Blairite MPs who vote with the Tories on #Brexit are not just traitors, they're also brain dead. It's poltical suicide. A future "Centrist" party will rely on remainers to form its core support base. I don't imagine "voted for Tory Brexit" going down too well with them, do you?
The so-called 'environmentally friendly' EU is allowing electro-pulse fishing to continue for another 4 years. This devastating practice turns sea and ocean floors into deserts of death. Even China had banned it! We need #Brexit to save our fish. 
Early start @GLA_Airport. Heading to London to make #Brexit speech @theRSAorg. As talks reach impasse in Brussels, @scotgov will continue to exhaust all possibilities for compromise and common sense. Staying in single market/customs union only credible Brexit option for UK.
Absurd that this @RolandRudd a bigoted, wealthy, public school, Oxbridge, multi millionaire, elitist EU Nationalist who funded the Remain campaign is playing a major role in #Brexit & insults @DUPleader an elected leader of 10 @duponline who does actually represent voters.
Once again @Anna_Soubry shows her #BrexitBetrayal character. The referendum was clear "Leave the EU". The uncomfortable truth is that #Remoaners worked hard to make #Brexit undeliverable, lie about the future outside EU. & owe a huge apology for being treasonous EU nationalists 
#BrexitThe story so far.UK to EU."We want to LEAVE."EU "It is too diificult."UK"OK, We won't LEAVE."

There is no “Northern Ireland”. It is six counties in the north of Ireland. It should have never been in the British state in the first place. It is past time for a United Ireland and let Britain Brexit cleanly. It’s not rocket science #Brexit #Ireland
Brexiters like @piersmorgan sometimes compare #Brexit with football. So let's do that. When Juventus were found to have cheated they were stripped of their title, relegated and docked points. That looks a good model for #Brexit!#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote

Ross is a #Brexiteer .  When an expert asks him to think again about his opinion on a crucial , life changing subject Ross gives the Brexiteers standard response by doubling down and lashing out at political opponents.  That is why #Brexit is such a disaster.  And Ross… 
100% correct.That  neither #Tories nor #Labour -our main parties - know  this / or won't admit to knowing it or don't care is a tragedy that historians will study & ponder  in wonder. Politicos'  first duty -after protecting us -is #DoNoHarm.#Brexit 
#brexit quick takeA technical deal on backstop seems to have been there. But one that it’s clear that ERG and DUP can’t buy. IMO that ‘deal’ is unlikely to change that much. But May couldn’t agree w/o certain revolt.So plays it long. Deal won’t change, but pressure will.
Our patience is growing thin with the corrupt political class. Leave NOW. #brexit. Please Retweet. 
Disappointing move by @ClaireHanna . May I remind you that your party along with @sinnfeinireland, the Greens and Alliance went to Brussels a week ago, unified by one common and progressive position re #Brexit. Shameful political expedience at its finest.

#Brexit talks breaking down because:- If the Govt wants the whole UK to stay in #CustomsUnion until an alternative solution is found to the Irish border problem, then it can’t end until such an alternative is agreed by BOTH sides- that  makes it unacceptable to Tory #Brexiters
EU source close to #Brexit tells me things ‘are back to square one’ on the Irish border issue. Negotiations went on through weekend, good progress at technical (not political) level. Things got tricky when Mr Raab arrived. Political posturing on both sides at play for sure.

Dear Ms Jenkyns, I don't believe anyone voted for a 'go down fighting' #Brexit. Are you really, seriously a Member of Parliament? Did you actually swear to serve this country or to 'go down fighting'?
Interesting reading for anyone who wants to understand the scale of the trade between Ireland and UK, in both directions, in context of #BREXIT. UK continues to have significant trade surplus with Ireland.  
Wise words from @DrPhillipLeeMP. The lack of willingness to compromise around any single vision for #Brexit from all sides leads us into a stalemate and a new public vote is the only way out. Let's use that chance to make sure it's not beset with the same problems of the last one 
Remainers are such a bunch of sorry whingers they have become a national disgrace.  You had the chance, you failed, now wind in your necks and get on with  grabbing the opportunity that #Brexit offers.
GREAT PATRIOT: @andreajenkyns says she will go down fighting for a real #Brexit. It is our #MPs duty to stand up for the people! We thank you, one of the very few honest #politicians!  #ChuckChequers #TheresaMay @CCHQPress #StandUp4Brexit @DCBMEP #Tory #UK

"Barnier has rushed to London this afternoon for urgent Brexit talks with Raab..."Nah, kidding.  Raab has rushed off to Brussels.Distinctive #Brexit research & news daily: 
A new vote on #Brexit isn’t an outcome in itself. But sadly it is the only way out of this pointless, self-inflicted mess. It must be clean, though, to be legitimate. We can’t allow the manipulation, lies, threats and deceit that characterised the last 
Can think of a few folk who might appreciate these tips #Brexit ! 
EU27 ambassadors will meet at 1830 Brussels time for a #Brexit update. They’ve heard positive mood music coming from the talks this weekend but let’s see.
Green Party Leader @sianberry: "We need a #PeoplesVote."Sarah Vine: "We had one. It was the referendum. We voted leave."Boom! #marr #brexit 
From '£350 million more per week for the NHS' to..."It is better to go down fighting."Even the most ardent supporters have given up claiming there will be any benefits to #Brexit.Their message to the British people is we should stick it and out and suffer, no matter the cost 
Cork Harbour, beautiful today - great to clear the head before heading for Luxembourg/Brussels. Important week to come for #Brexit negotiations. We will only support a fair outcome, consistent with commitments already made by UK+EU to Ireland.

Dear U.K. people, #Brexit is a Trojan horse for authoritarian rule. It has been built so that power is taken from the MPs in parliament who represent the people and we go back to a sovereign ruler. Whoever is PM after Brexit can change any laws without parliament approval. 1/2

Utterly, heartily sick of being told that tariffs & the NI border are either: catastrophic OR easily solvable. One of you is lying. #Brexit
Always remember that when a Tory MP says "it's better to go down fighting"-they mean you the  public b/c they will have an escape route and a  sack full of cash to rest comfortably upon. #Brexit 
Was."Sunlit uplands."Then."Not the end of the world."And."There will be adequate food."Now."We will go down, but at least we go down fighting."#Brexit 
In a single tweet, this is why so many utterly despise politicians. "#Brexit can't be delivered" in the same breath as "it's time we were honest". Their opinion is more important than yours, and yours is invalid anyway. They are a disgrace to our country. 
4/ For many months after the referendum most of the media and almost all MPs treated speaking out against #Brexit as a kind of blasphemy. Pro-Remain opinions were all but totally shut out of the mainstream. This is the politics of populist dictatorship, not democracy.
It grieves me greatly that having seen Lord Wolfson from @nextofficial this morning on #marr after 25 years of shopping there I will be taking my hard earned cash elsewhere.  I am not going to pay the wages of a man who diminishes the damage of #brexit on my business and family.
2/ The right to oppose #Brexit has been relentlessly attacked by Brexit politicians and media. They have screamed that Brexit is the "Will of the People", demonising opponents as enemies of the people, saboteurs, subversives, plotters, mutineers & traitors.
We are now headed for a repeat in our turbulent history. A hard border is a 1921 partitoned border. We also have in the North-the recent amended electoral boundaries, not once-but twice to suit Unionism, which has effectively reintroduced Gerrymandering. #Brexit = #UnitedIreland
The Govt is now acknowledging and publishing the consequences of a #nodeal #Brexit (see below) only because Theresa May wants to blackmail her backbenchers by saying “my deal or no deal”.  But those are NOT the only options and MPs shouldn’t fall for it.
Oh, so that’s why you’re pushing for #Brexit? You want to go down in history as someone responsible for the new worst man-made catastrophe to befall the English people? Weird ambition but okay 
Leavers have taken to insisting we'll be ok after #brexit because we survived 2 World wars. We didn't all survive. My father's older brother a very early casualty. He was only 20 years old, right at the start of adult life. Peace is worth the effort. 
Stopping #Brexit is not the end of our fight - the next step will be to hold those responsible for their continued lies and those responsible for enabling those lies by giving them a platform, accountable for the damage they've helped to create. #LongHaulFight #PeoplesVoteMarch

#MARRSHOW #Brexit If the Govt wants the whole UK to stay in #CustomsUnion until an alternative solution is found to the Irish border problem, then obviously it can’t end until such an alternative is agreed by BOTH sides.  That makes it unacceptable to Tory right wing.
Labour’s plan on #Brexit?There isn’t one.Their sole goal is to bring down the GovtThis won’t deliver the will of the peopleIt will force submission to dangerous militant Socialists incapable of basic governance or care for anyone outside of the London Labour bubble #Marr
Going over a cliff remains preferable to rational decision-making. UK has reduced itself to a ranting lalaland. Never in our history have we made such a disastrous error of judgement as #Brexit. There will be a terrible price to pay for years to come 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "There are probably 39 Tory MPs who are more tough-minded on this issue than I am. "Those 39 will not turn, I will not turn and there are growing numbers beyond that who are determined that we should deliver on the #Brexit that we promised." 
The question #Marr should be asking Emily Thornberry is how Labour plans to deliver "the exact same benefits" of our current EU membership any better than the Tories have done.They can't - any #Brexit will be deeply damaging.Which is why we need a #PeoplesVote.#Brexit
This is a significant intervention from DD. His position has always been, change the policy, not the PM. Getting May out and him becoming an interim leader may be the only way to deliver #Brexit and FTACabinet mutiny threatens to kill PM’s Brexit
In the Brexit chaos the people's referendum that has to happen is #indyref2 -- it is the promises/lies of 2014 that have been changed most by #Brexit.
.@sianberry on @MarrShow makes it clear a #PeoplesVote is the only way through this #Brexit mess
Sarah Vine tells #Marr that the EU is "determined to make us suffer".As @SianBerry points out, this is nonsense. #Brexit is a completely self-inflicted injury and Brexiters need to own it rather than shifting blame. We need a #PeoplesVote.
Who have been in power the last 8yrs? Who have had a majority every step of the #Brexit way?@CONservatives. They are the problem & a real threat to our country. A @JeremyCorbyn-led @UKLabour Government is the solution. #Marr Join us:
#TheresaMay’s #Brexit plans could fall apart this week: 
Ted Heath told Parliament in 1971 that joining EEC does not entail "an erosion of essential national sovereignty". If #Brexit "cannot be delivered", Heath plainly lied: we are in a political union from which there is no escape, which is "essential national sovereignty" nullified. 
#Brexit  Looking as if brexiteers have now backed May & her govt into a corner, either they comprise big time or they are replaced Replaced would be favourite - May cannot be trusted - her actions over 2 yrs prove that#NoDeal & save £39 BN of taxpayers £
OK, fair point, Tommy. So can you explain a benefit of #Brexit that YOU will receive that balances out Emma closing her business and people losing jobs? Just one tangible benefit will do.(If you come up with one, we'll make you PM, as even Brexiter MPs say there aren't any.) 
The mask slips, if you hadn't already seen behind it. This is #Brexit.Small companies should be governed by “absolutely no regulation whatsoever – no minimum wage, no maternity or paternity rights, no unfair dismissal rights, no pension rights."
Whether #Brexit is good, bad or indifferent for the UK, the worst thing is the certainty that Mogg, Johnson and David Davis care not 1 single iota for the UK public. Theyre not working for them. Theyre acting in the interests of the 1%, who see a financial killing #crimesyndicate
This is how difficult remain MPs in Parliament make it. They move from standing on a manifesto to deliver #Brexit to ensure that they are personally re elected to announcing that #Brexit cannot be delivered when it absolutely can and must. There was a Great UK before the EU! 
This week's @thesundaytimes cartoon  #Brexit 
Someone should point out “survival” came at a terrible price Over 1 million British people died in both wars                          Rationing in WW2 lasted 14 yrs Their Empire was destroyedOh & they didn’t win WW2. The US & the USSR did that. #brexit 
The uncomfortable truth is that #Brexit cannot be delivered. It’s time we all faced the reality and were honest with the British people. We owe them a huge apology for a referendum with an option that was undefined & undeliverable. 
#Brexit  Labour today a shambles. Doing everything to stop Brexit. Couldn’t organise a piss up in a brewery them Labour 4 clowns . Led by Jeremy Corbyn who voted 17 times against Terror Laws. Hates the EU all his life likes it today IDIOT. Hates people doing well earning money. 
The ERG have been aiming for a no-deal all along. A desperate pariah UK would be forced to become a tax-haven style economy to attract & retain business. Welfare & health, safety and environmental regulations would be slashed. The NHS would go.#Brexit
A government that is preparing for a no-deal #Brexit is preparing to inflict massive suffering on the British people for the benefit of a tiny tax & regulation-hating elite. It is a government that has violated the basic contract between state & people.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
By far the most alarming waste in the NHS is the number of staff at all levels who leave it because the job is so unremitting, unsupported & stressful. The more who leave, the harder it gets for those who stay. We are heavily reliant on overseas staff & #Brexit is not helping 
David Davis has issued a dramatic call to cabinet ministers to stage a mutiny against Theresa May to kill her #Brexit plan 
Tory MPs now in open revolt over #Brexit & #UniversalCreditFinally it'll soon be all over for Theresa May.Which nasty posh idiot will they pick to replace her? #Marr #ToryRevolt 
"Believe in the UK!" cries the UK while deliberately, needlessly and incompetently making the UK poorer, weaker, more isolated, less welcoming and less safe."Just get on with it!" cry the Brexiters in their zeal to do the above.Fuck off, say I.#Brexit #BrexitShambles
I don't understand why #Leavers are so against the EU. The EU has agreed many employment and other rights that the people of the UK enjoy. The UK didn't chose secure these rights before it joined the EU and the Tories want to remove them after #Brexit.Remaining makes sense.
Just as May finally gets a #Brexit plan together that is acceptable to the EU, Davis urges cabinet mutiny.Whose interest is he acting in?
21 times @theresa_may promised she would take us out of the single market and the customs union. Right now, she’s looking like the biggest liar on the planet. #Brexit 
Theresa May v Boris Johnson- a #Brexit film set in Derry .... The editing in this is spectacular. 
It might seem like open revolt, but @Conservatives will surely appreciate they are a far stronger taking #Brexit by the horns, instead of drifting along to an embarrassing Commons defeat under Theresa May's guidance.Get her out & get on with Brexit.

You were lied to. #ScareTheEnglishIn4Words #Brexit 
"Turkey to join EU""EU threatens British cuppa"Vote Leave actually said these things in Facebook ads to scare the English.Both completely untrue.#ScareTheEnglishIn4Words #Brexit #PeoplesVote
#Corbyn has not uttered one word on #Brexit Crisis  in last 7 days#Corbyn has not uttered one word on the scandalous  lack of Police Activity in the #Frauderendum Remind me again why people are clinging onto incompetent #Labour?
I’ve spoken to a handful of companies (12)  who engaged early with Brexitproofing. They’re truly facing towards Europe now, turned away from natural dependence on Britain, and thriving. It’ll be bloody tough but #Brexit could be the making of many 
PM says no to permanent EU customs union membership. Well, there's a relief. #Brexit means leaving the customs union and the single market - in March 2019. End of story. 
Dear God, this is like dealing with children. No, it isn’t. Take some responsibility for your own actions. For once #brexit 
I’m sure @gareth_snell @RuthSmeeth and @CarolineFlintMP would never dream of backing the #Tories and harming both #Britain and the #Labour party. The claims made about them backing Theresa May on #brexit are, no doubt, incorrect 
Dear @BBC, what a treat it would be if you were to give at least the same coverage to the march in London on 20th October. It's a mass rally against the far right #Brexitand for a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain. How about it?
BREAKING NEWS: 63 #Brexit-supporting MPs in the #Conservative Party have issued a letter of warning to Theresa May, describing her Chequers plan as unacceptable and something which would make "Leave voters lose faith in democracy".
u #Remoaner numpties have no idea of the damage u would cause to our country by denying working people their vote for #Brexitur self serving denial is truly of nauseating proportions 
Sunday Times reporting Mundell & Davidson threatening to resign if NI treated differently for #Brexit fearing that Scotland would demand same. In other words they actually want their UK party to impose massive job losses & economic damage on the country they are elected to serve
Well I've been in a bar and challenged three brexitersy(i was on my own) to give me their #Brexit benefits,all i heard was stop the Polish, i said why? One said, well they're foreign, i had to walk away before i smashed his fucking face in, #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote, i was angry.
The worst prime minister in Living memory, reeling from the worst domestic crisis since WW2 (#brexit) ... and still Labour cannot capitalise on this Tory mess. Has voting Labour ever been so pointless?! 
"Cabinet mutiny threatens to kill PM's Brexit" - please God I hope so. Being stuck in the Customs Union until we have the EU's permission to leave would be a gross betrayal of Brexit. #tomorrowspaperstoday #Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
#Brexit : @ShippersUnbound reports that Scottish Secretary @DavidMundellDCT & @RuthDavidsonMSP will resign if Northern Ireland faces new controls that separate it from GB - as it could fuel case for #Indyref2
The choice will not be 'No Deal Vs May's Deal'. Any MP who says so is dancing to the tune of No10 press team.Once May's deal is defeated, parliament takes control.#Labour MPs will then have the chance to vote for a #PeoplesVote. #Brexit is not inevitable 
You do realise that your tweet is riddled with lies: 1. @theSNP has already accepted the result of 2104 4 years ago. 2. Scotland voted 62% Remain in 2016. 3. @theSNP are not calling for a #Brexit re-run. There fixed your lies for you!

Labour MPs reveal they are ready to rescue Theresa May's #Brexit deal in Commons vote.The UK is effectively being run by a Tory-Labour coalition. 
Graham Norton on the #latelate talking #brexit. 
And who will be blamed? The Tories!! Wake up Conservative MPs and smell the coffee. If you don't check with the British People then Tories will be punished by voters. It's utterly deluded to think the British people will thank or appreciate Tories for #Brexit 
The genius of Graham Norton here is that he made the "British" proud of themselves and the Irish and rest of world mock ... Tragic actually!! #Brexit 
This is an excellent video featuring many Leave voters that have become  #RemainerNow. As the facts become clearer, people are changing their minds on #Brexit. And that is one of the many reasons why we should have a #PeoplesVote. Let’s see if the country really wants this.
Leaving EU with nothing! #Brexit#ScareTheEnglishIn4Words
Once again experts for the British car industry are warning about the damage #Brexit poses to jobs and the wider supply chain.With a 20 per cent fall in sales last month the Tory Brexit mess is punishing the car industry.

Health secretary Matt Hancock received £32k from the chairman of the IEA think tank which critics say is trying to “abolish the NHS”. The IEA is based at #55TuftonSt along with a bunch of other #Brexit backing and climate science denying think tanks.
Boris is constantly accused of not believing in anything but who has fought harder for the kind of #Brexit sketched out by @Vote_Leave? No one.

Sir - A few days ago I received an email from Theresa May!She asked for money to help her election campaign & said she's delivering #BrexitI have NO intention of assisting her to be re-elected.Not only has she betrayed my trust in her, but now she is also lying to me!-Letters

Britain's richest young entrepreneur can't wait for #Brexit. Alex Lovén, who has a net worth of £55 million, thinks the EU is close to collapse and "it's better to be the first people out than the last people out’. He has just been named in the U.K. Tech 100. Congrats Alex 
We know a happy nation is looking forward to the great opportunities #Brexit offers for a global Britain. Think of the opportunities to bond with your family and friends as you forage for food and learn to hunt and fish. 
Hey, @johnharris1969 - this is exactly what we've been doing in towns all #Cornwall for many months.We listen to everyone respectfully and very few - Leavers included - have anything good to say about the way #Brexit is turning out.#PeoplesVote
If science loses, everybody loses. Read our #NoDeal #Brexit fact sheet 
To produce as many cars as it does, Nissan Sunderland needs to receive and fit 5million parts each day. Of these parts, 85% are imported, mainly from EU. The plant holds only enough JIT parts for half a day’s production.A No-deal #Brexit threatens 37K jobs in total.
Dear Mrs May @theresa_may, Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, watch this young Portuguese woman, Daniella who gives so much to this country & our NHS. You respect a vote achieved by cheating & breaking the law. Where's your respect for her & so many like her already affected by #Brexit? 
Even the scum are reporting a million manual workers could have their jobs or wages cut in No-Deal #Brexit
WATCH: “I said I was hungry enough to eat my foot, so I’m going to eat my foot.” @GrahNort explains the realities of #Brexit. A #PeoplesVote would stop us from eating our feet.
A periodic reminder. Britain is in control of its destiny. If we want a temporary Irish backstop, we can accept membership of the single market, customs union and VAT area.Completely compatible with #Brexit
There is nothing remotely Conservative about #Brexit.This Saturday gives us a chance to send a message loud and clear to the government: we demand a #PeoplesVote on the final deal. Join us!
George Osborne - I certainly don't think there's some sort of #brexit bonus.. which you get some people talking about.. Philip Hammond. All International/domestic observers of the economy say the country will be worse off as a result of #Brexit.#peoplesvote #FBPE #C4News

As @BorisJohnson points out, the idea that politicians can fudge their way through #Brexit with the intention of fixing it down the road is a total fantasy -  they have to get it right the first time.  #StandUp4Brexit @DCBMEP @BrexitStewart @andreajenkyns
Confused by DUP tactics on #Brexit? Look at DUP in NI. Unionism is losing its historic majority here, yet DUP antagonises the growing Catholic/Irish community rather than courting it. Despite strategic need for compromise, some in DUP double down, to oppose GFA. Unionism suffers.
Has #brexit enabled/empowered "fuqwits"?.
The @SouthBucks4EU team were out in Beaconsfield today talking to locals about #Brexit, the need for a #PeoplesVote and advertising the #PeoplesVoteMarch. Great that our local MP Dominic Grieve also joined us to make the @conservative4pv case.#brexitometer@AtStalls#FinalSay
In case you missed it, here is my argument for #Brexit and against the phoney #PeoplesVote. There is no greater threat to our freedom than the unaccountable career politician.
I am very often stunned by the naivety of remainers who genuinely think the EU is a transparent entity. The bits you are supposed to see are transparent - but that is the confidence trick in play. It is and always will be a next of corporate lobbying and corruption. #Brexit
I hope every MP will get this message loud & clear. Your job depends on you doing your job, i.e. protect the national interest. #Brexit is Russia's foreign policy. That should tell you all you need to know about it, but #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw should convince you if it doesn't.
Central to #Brexit was the idea that UK must free itself from a problematic, bickering, divided, ailing, slow structure. Well, compare the EU’s unity, agility, professionalism and, actually, grace in the face of extreme provocation, to the utter shitshower that’s been our gov’t.
Lord Heseltine - What does #brexit mean?.. I don't know what it means.. except that Britain is leaving the top table of #EU politics.. it's our #singlemarket.. it's our homebase.. it is where our power over centuries has lied & we are not going to be there!#peoplesvote #FBPE
Seize a rare opportunity : the chance to reconsider with the benefit of hindsight! @GaryLineker makes a powerful point in favour of a #PeoplesVote on #brexit : 
New mega-poll says majority of Brits want to stay in EU  Good enough for me. The people have spoken, let's get #Brexit cancelled @theresa_may#StopBrexitSaveBritain
⁦@trace462⁩ is rushed off her feet on today’s #Leeds for Europe street stall! The #Brexitometer is an object of fascination as always & certainly gets people interested in #Brexit. 
Wrong Sarah. The MPs who won't command respect are those who pretended to be leave so they could "switch" at the last minute and then spent 2 years insulting voters whilst simultaneously talking the country down and undermining the greatest democratic mandate in history.#Brexit 
The crowds were small, the #BrexitBreaksBritain presence was LOUD. It was just me, but to be honest, I ruined his grand entrance. Look out for videos soon. #brexit 
It’s not a powerful argument. It’s a lazy & shallow argument that totally misses the point. #Brexit is not about trade. It’s about unaccountable power & who makes our laws. We had the People's Vote. If you didn’t know what you were voting for, you should have paid more attention. 
Another great leafleting session in Woolwich, with hundreds of people approaching us to talk about the campaign for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal.Many of them said they would also be marching with us next week at the #PeoplesVoteMarch.Info / RSVP: 
This week’s @AlexSalmondShow examines how the subtle shifts in policy have left House of Commons arithmetic on the Chequers compromise & finds @Theresa_May's #Brexit plan seems to be getting a better reception in Brussels than it is at home.  WATCH NOW: 
The more I look at the dishonest betrayal of #Brexit and the manifesto @sarahwollaston begged her constituents to vote for her in on, the more I and hundreds of others are convinced the people of Totnes should have a chance to de-select her and hold a #localpeoplesvote #BlueWave
"Andrea Leadsom ‘ready to quit’ over Theresa May's #Brexit plans."She, and any other Cabinet members who have leadership ambitions, need to resign over #Chequers.Otherwise their leadership ambitions will be brown bread.70% of Tory members voted for #Brexit

Rumour is that May and her gang want a no deal #brexit and that they intend to get their friends at @BBCNews and the right wing press to ensure the EU gets blamed for "punishing" plucky UK. Parliament must stop them.
The UK is being held to ransom by the hard right #DUP & its ten MPs.They don't even represent a majority of Northern Irish voters:36.0% of N Ireland voters in 2017 UK election;that's a mere 292,316 voters (0.9% of all UK voters). #Brexit #BrexitShambles

Financial ‘journalist’? Complaining about #Brexit, while ignoring the wholesale capture of UK regulators by big finance? Q: Are you a journalist, or a glorified corporate PR? 
1. We now know from the government's own no deal technical notices that most, if not all, of the no deal warnings have a basis in fact. The fact that Theresa May is not attempting to spin them tells it's own story... She knows no deal is not an option. #Brexit thread
I have seen many reports from people exasperated at the blasé attitude of friends or colleagues who are utterly apathetic about #brexit. Well if that's the case they won't mind when we have a #peoplesvote and overturn it then. We can presume they'll be accordingly unmoved...#FBPE
I have been that #GripeWater smuggler. Buy it in bulk & your popularity will soar immensely. Another reason to fear #Brexit  
The UK's first performance as a fully go-it-alone 19th century-type Sovereign State are the #brexit negotiations. Plan A is to become an EU vassal state applying the law without the decision-making. Plan B is to destroy 40 years of foreign relations and see what happens.

Theresa May’s catastrophic handling of #Brexit has been marked by U-turns and broken promises, writes Charles Moore.
Everytime the government releases the #Brexit impact papers #Leavers leap to defend their position by claiming it's all #ProjectFear. Apparently the report of the M26 being prepared as an emergency car park is untrue too, it's just scaremongering.#Brexit ostriches

I think I misunderstood what 'Vote Leaves' meant..............  #Brexitdisaster #Brexit 
Latest optimistic promise from #brexit ministers : 
‘I feel the hand of history on my shoulders, and the hand of Peter Robinson in my pocket.’Perhaps as she negotiates with the DUP on #Brexit, @theresa_may should remember this from Gordon Brown’s ‘My Life, Out Times’:
Above all the Tories may be planning to do away with democracy as  I cannot see how a government pursuing a #Brexit policy it knows will ruin millions of its own people can possibly hope to remain in power if it had to face the any kind of free and fair election.
#Brexit has led to a government with no respect for democratic norms giving itself power unprecedented in peace time it  is a policy which Theresa May knows will be extremely damaging to the point of civil unrest. A Perfect excuse for declaring a state of emergency
So after two years of aimless #Brexit manoeuvring, this is where we are today: the UK will likely stay in the customs union and single market for the foreseeable future; have no say on policy; and pay more into the EU budget after Brexit than before. Well done, Leavers. Chapeau.
Time to #endthechaos and let the people decide - Which? MD Alex Neill said a no-deal #Brexit could mean “a bonfire of consumer rights and protections... would massively weaken people’s rights to take action when purchase faulty/dangerous products
A sincere thank you to @GaryLineker for again showing leadership where others have failed, or haven’t bothered. #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Time to #endthechaos and let the people decide - Northern Ireland forced to take drastic measures to stop the lights going out. No Deal #Brexit would scupper the all-island electricity market shared by Northern Ireland and the Republic

Going ahead with #Brexit means either:- also leaving the #singlemarket & #CustomsUnion, taking a huge economic hit- or staying in them, but having to follow the same rules as everyone else, without having a say on them anymore So, do you prefer:
I do hate this picture, very disingenuous. For the sake of balance:Voted to #Remain: 16,141,241Did not vote to Remain: 48,858,759 #Brexit #UK
Why are people acting surprised by this? Had we voted Remain on 23rd June 2016 we were always eventually going to:- Lose the rebate - Adopt the €- Join Schengen The only version of Remain was always "Hard Remain". This was why we HAD to vote leave.#StandUp4Brexit #Brexit

But she still opposes another #ScotRef knowing this is where #Brexit is taking us.....! @kezdugdale you need to have a serious word with yourself
If #Brexit is cancelled it will be a victory for millions of ordinary people against the machinations of elites like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Aaron Banks. The sheer front of these people in trying to pretend it is liberal elites fighting Brexit is unbelievable.#PeoplesVote
Now the EU's finance chief DEMANDS Theresa May make MORE concessions before there is a #Brexit deal No Deal becomes a much attractive prospect with each passing day, especially given the eternal VASSALAGE that the EU are currently offering
The Gov have really lost it.  They're pretending that if there is a no-deal #Brexit, they'll run around, replicating the trade deals they've just walked away from. More proof that @theresa_may triggered Art 50 without a plan, putting the Tories first, country last#StopBrexit

Since these #peoplesvote lot and FBPE types insist we need another vote on #Brexit because of new information perhaps they could comment on this?We would be made to pay through the nose for remaining now. Tell that to the luvvies marching on #PeoplesVoteMarch@peoplesvote_uk
Significant.   The gulf between what is needed to conclude even the poor type of #Brexit deal being discussed and what a politically hamstrung  Prime Minister can deliver is as wide as ever no matter the spin from the Chancellor and Downing St. 
Chancellor pontificates about a #Brexit  “deal dividend” hoping to bamboozle and bribe Tory MPs and , through them, their constituents.   Reality is that #Brexit is already costing hundreds of million pounds and will go on doing so, in any deal short of full membership.
Doesn't Morley & Outwood MP @andreajenkyns feel any responsibility whatsoever to the roughly 50% of her voters who did not vote to Leave and who will suffer the consequences of her reckless approach to #Brexit? Not to mention the many who did vote Leave but now regret it. 
TM finally forced to confront the reality of #Brexit as her cabinet, party, and DUP threaten her daily. This is a mess that needs a #PeoplesVote to sort it

Theresa May is toast.We only wait now to see if the toaster was set at no.3 or no.5.No chance she survives all this, not now the con has been laid out for all to see.A mistake was made, accepting the word of a Remainer, but as with all things anti-#Brexit it was another trick.

"A #Brexit deal may be in reach between London and Brussels, but from Larne the waters look far trickier to navigate"  
The EU #Brexit backstop proposals for Northern Ireland effectively amount to a land grab of Northern Ireland annexing it from rest of the UK. It is a change in the constitutional position as Northern Ireland would be governed by different rules.#NoDeal is better than a bad deal.
I'm a #Brexit moderate who voted #Remain, but since we're going to #Leave we must make it work for us. I can't therefore see that either parliament or I would vote for Britain to be locked into a permanent open-ended customs union arrangement!
A seminal speech on #Brexit by the expert diplomat ousted by Theresa May’s Downing Street because he spoke truth to power.  Worth reading every word ...... 
Still nothing on Jeremy Corbyn's twitter feed (or anywhere else for that matter) about the #Brexit negotiations. Nothing to contribute as Britain goes to hell in a handcart. The Cheshire cat's disappearance was marked by a smile.  We don't even get that.#r4today

In Gibraltar with a delegation to meet with @GibraltarGov  industry and civic society on #brexit in the real world. Safe to say there’s a few implications. 
Mr Johnson, you are a charlatan  using #brexit for political gain. Your words here mean nothing. They are just bluster. The truth is you went for Leave because Cameron was Remain and you just wanted to oppose him to aid your leadership plans. If he'd been Leave you'd be Remain. 
Nomura sees 5 key risks in the markets you need to know: 1) #China slowdown vs US outperformance in and among trade wars. 2) #Italy budget w/a potential “vicious circle” of higher yields, lower growth, worse deficits. 3) #EM underperformance 4) #Brexit talks 5) End of global #QE.

There is no greater threat to our freedom than the unaccountable career politician. #Brexit is not about a trade deal. It’s much more important than that.
Is this opinion based on his dodgy dossier? Did he call for a peoples vote before he took us to war in Iraq? Didn’t he say the will of Parliament was enough? No mothers will lose their sons or children their fathers as a result of #Brexit #Weaponsofmassdesructionfearmonger
“It’s come to a pretty pass when [an MP] finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding [MPs].”The days of consultation are over. Get used to it. #Brexit 
Oh @Keir_Starmer #corbyn’s #labour Party is also very much at the wheel of this #brexit car. Why on earth do you help deliver this catastrophe? History won’t be kind.

In a programme of many moments, this was the one for me. When a brave woman tried to tell @RossThomson_MP about the effects of #Brexit on her life and was resoundingly dissed. #BBCQT #ideology
The DUP thrive & survive on division & sectarianism. They want an economy dependent on the public purse, so they do not encourage private enterprise. A return to violence would be a dream come true for the DUP. Why? To make sure Dublin can’t afford NoI.  #FTDUP #BREXIT #qt
This is "Humpty Dumpty" politics, says Val McDermid.. In response to Tory MP Ross Thompson's support for a Canada deal. . #bbcqt #Brexit 
Kezia would rather hitch her wagon to the broken #Brexit (which she doesn't want)  Union outside the E.U  rather than live in an independent Scotland inside the E.U (which she supports) She's on the wrong side of history I fear and very confused #bbcqt#Scotref
David Dimbleby has sadly completely failed to pick up on the most astute question of the night, which is the long-term implications of Tory voters prioritising #Brexit over the Union. Would have been interesting to hear the panel's views. #bbcqt
#brexit .. @eastantrimmp .. so Sammy says there ‘is no text’ reference @theresa_may and a Brexit solution.. Sammy told us there was no SF/DUP Agreement document back in February. @poots2edwin  boasted  about his input to document:“I did a lot of it so I'd expect it to be good."
The convenient passage of goods across borders is not of itself sufficient reason to remain in a political union. #Brexit
Goodnight London! Incredibly interesting meetings together wirh @Gernot_Bluemel with Austrian entrepreneurs, scientists and Jeremy Hunt, @LordCallanan and @hilarybennmp on #Brexit. Tomorrow Ireland and @BorderIrish on the program #EU2018AT
COMMENT OF THE DAY: We’re not so much through the looking glass here, as having smashed it into pieces, stomped on it and started blaming the looking glass for cutting our feet. #Brexit 
Utterly shocking the system is now rigged against anyone wishing to stop #Brexit.A Non-Binding Ref treated as Mandatory26.5% treated as 100%Illegalities ignored by Police & PoliticiansA #PeoplesVote deniedOur Democracy is under attack from those who are meant to defend it.
That's why @JunckerEU @MichelBarnier and @guyverhofstadt have taken the position they have. They know @theresa_may @DavidDavisMP @DominicRaab are part of an entirely corrupt @Conservatives engaged in a corrupt #Brexit project because it's the Will of the Tories not of the people.
I fear one of the lasting consequences of the squandering of the #Brexit reset opportunity will be the mass contagion of this sentiment  
If #Ireland gets blown into England from #StormCallum, #Brexit will be awkward as hell.
Everyone ok? Everyone staying calm? #Brexit
No Labour MP would vote in parliament to support any other policy that would:1) Make their constituents poorer2) Increase unemployment 3) Damage the NHS4) Hit the poorest & youngest hardest5) Prop up a Tory govt Any voting for the Withdrawal Act would do all five. #Brexit
Theresa May's £50,000 immigration salary threshold isn't about skills - many highly-skilled workers are paid less. It's to ensure that the rich are not impacted by the new restrictions.#Brexit is all about making the rich richer and more privileged. #PeoplesVote
Now nobody is saying there’s a direct link, but......#brexit @BorderIrish
For an account called BBC Reality Check I would expect them to know that the 1975 referendum was on STAYING IN the EEC and NOT about joining it. We joined in 1973 after an Act of Parliament. Epic fail!@BBCRealityCheck #brexit 
This is genuinely, jaw droppingly shocking.Police not investigating Leave campaign law breaking because of "political sensitivity"What has #Brexit done to this country? 
At least with #Brexit we can now choose whether we live in a straight or bendy banana republic
After #brexit, there was a 450% increase in anti-Muslim hate crime in the UK, documented by @TellMamaUK

Brexit was never about shutting ourselves off from Europe. Brexit was the realisation that the EU was shutting Europe out from the rest of the World. A World where 85% and 90% future growth can be found (which is why we MUST leave the protectionist CU)#brexit #StandUp4Brexit
It’s started! #Brexitchaos and #BrexitShambles Phase One :  even before #brexit actually happens! 
I think we can now say with certainty that no #Brexit deal May brings from Brussels commands a majority on her side of the house.Any controls / backstop in Irish Sea - DUP opposes. There are 10 DUP MPs.1/9 
I think one of the most astonishing things about #brexit is to think that there are people out there who thought that @BorisJohnson @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @michaelgove and the banker funded Leave campaign ever had their best interests at heart! They don't give a damn about the people.

British hopes for a sweeping post-#Brexit trade deal with the U.S. are nothing more than a pipe dream, says senior U.K. official said  via @bpolitics
Very clear why David Lidington is smirking. He doesn't believe a word he is saying.#Brexit and the Referendum was only ever about the Tory party 
We were told #Brexit was about 'taking back control of our laws'.Clearly it isn't about applying them.@metpoliceuk have apparently halted investigations into Leave campaign law-breaking because of 'political sensitivities'Case never been stronger for a #PeoplesVote#FBPE
Our democracy was hi-jacked, our voters data was stolen & they were subject to psycho-profiling, illegal spending by global elites was rife, Russia interfered, Vote Leave broke the law - what is it that the police and the politicians don't understand? #Brexit

Trouble ahead indeed IF, I repeat IF, there is no firm date for leaving the Customs Union.We must be able to be global and make trade deals, control our borders, and not be bound by European Courts after #Brexit.

I fear this is going to be #brexit breaking news for some folk.Currently every container that ships ex Belfast Port, upon entry it's stopped to be weighed, seal number checked & referenced against container number. CCTV records all entry & exit. 
It’s difficult to see how the Conservatives can continue as one party, as gulf between pro-Remain Tories & the ERG is so large.Ironic that Cameron’s decision to hold the #Brexit referendum to heal internal divisions could be the cause of them splitting.
Some in The City believe the City is too big to fail,  and too big to conquer. Also 36% of this #Bloomberg audience thought no deal #brexit would be better than a bad deal - horrifying or is it that many will make a shed load of money shorting sterling?

Transcript of the #Brexit as a Revolution lecture @TrinCollCam by Sir Mark Ivan Rogers, former UK Permanent Representative to the #EU, is now available: 
Dithering, half-hearted Government, led by Theresa the Appeaser, has done its best to scupper #BrexitWe need some honest, realistic & committed politicians, with a leader who is prepared to implement the decision of the electorate without further delay & LEAVE the EU for ever.

Today I met with Chancellor @PhilipHammondUK. We discussed many critical economic issues including #Brexit. 
I assume Mr. Speaker is going to haul Mrs. May back to the dispatch box to tell the public why she misled Parliament on the subject of Education funding, this deception is spreading like wildfire under her administration, whether its #Brexit/#NHS/welfare etc #PMQS #GTTO
Delighted to get a round of applause at #europematters roundtable for my plea for #EU to listen to voices of nations & regions such as Scotland & #Catalonia. So important for @theSNP voice to be heard  in #Brussels #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #Brexit #FBPE
This reminds me, during Indyref in 2014 I said to @gavinesler on Islay that We would be out of #EU with a No to Scottish independence vote and our best protection was independence for Scotland to Protect Scotch Whisky industry and tourism.  #ScotRef #Brexit 
...and here, support for free movement in the Spring of 2018. Average of #EU28 has gone up from 79% to 82%. Lowest support rates have gone up from #Britain's 63% to #Italy's 70%. Support in the UK has gone up by almost 10%. If you ask me, this has a lot to to do with #Brexit. End 
The person "contemplating this nonsense" is @theresa_may, who is determined to deliver a #Brexit in name only, #BRINO.Every Tory & Labour MP have a choice!Stop the Prime Minister from betraying the promise, they made to their constituents, or face the wrath of #UK voters!
Support for a #Brexit deal based on membership of the #EEA has increased, according to new research conducted with @policyatkings and @Cambridge_Uni.
Did the uk have to ask the Eu for permission to have a referendum? No, because the EU is a union of equals.If Scotland therefore has to ask permission to have a referendum therefore self evident the UK is Not a union of equals#brexit #Indyref2

The DUP is flexing its muscles. Finally. Now is the time. Brexiteers play their winning card. So will it be Canada +++ & technology Mrs May, or a deserted Britain left to the soon-starving jackals of Corbyn & McDonnell? #csm #Brexit #DUP
The only sure fire way to do that is to put May & the Tories in such an uncomfortable position that they have to revoke #Article50 & halt #Brexit Don't see any real commitment from anyone on either side of the house to do that at the moment.MPs are failing to serve the UK.
Just did radio interview with @bbc5live this morning about #Brexit the importance of NI remaining in the EU, importance of the Good Friday Agreement and making the point that the DUP do NOT speak for us in Northern Ireland! We must protect our jobs, opportunities and future!

UK have £80,000,000,000 a yr trade deficit with EU.Why should we allow that to continue for a day longer?With WTO tariffs,the UK would be £8,000,000,000 a yr BETTER offUK have all the cards on #BrexitPM is not playing any of them cos she is a #REMOANER and wants to keep us IN
#Brexit has never been - and will never be - in the UK's national interest. What's worse, @theresa_may knows this. And that makes her a traitor. Time to #StopBrexit.
99% of my tax money goes to Westminster. As an EU member, the U.K won 97% of the votes in the EU Council. Only 13% of UK legislation derives from the EU which we play a major role in shaping. I do not want to be governed by a #Brexit elitist who has such a poor grasp of reality. 
#Brexit Wish we had Donald Trump over hear a man with balls of steel gets things done. He would get a good deal on Brexit for us. We’ve got Theresa Maybe PM with no backbone. Loves waving white flag to EU. And Jeremy Corbyn  hates EU all his life likes it now HYPOCRITE. 
I think you're acting out of genuine concern for your Constituents, which is laudable, but I'd encourage you to think again abt how you best serve their interests. Look at Tory #Brexit so far. They plan abolition of rights/standards. You know it'll be a clusterf*ck. Is it 'best'?
Tories promise up to 50yrs more austerity if #Brexit goes ahead. The harder the Brexit, the longer the period of austerity, & let's make no mistake; May's Brexit is a VERY #HardBrexit. It means biz relocations, job losses & lower GDP growth. How does that help your Constituents?
Theresa May's Chequers Deal is too closely aligned to EU trade policy. It's deliberate effect will be to render external trade for the UK impractical. It is economic slavery, political duplicity.Your vote, our democracy ... was always a myth.@Conservatives @UKLabour #Brexit 
I also quit my Lab membership. I gave them my vote in 2017. They’ll never get my vote again if they stand alongside Tory spivs to deliver #Brexit in any shape or form.
Paint a picture of a dire future with No Deal. Suggest there will be riots if we Remain. Twist Labour MP's arms until they support a terrible, compromising, #Brexit deal. This is Theresa May's strategy.Don't fall for it. We need a #PeoplesVote
The cold hard reality of global trade. Yet more evidence of why we need the British people’s #informedconsent before we go ahead with #Brexit

Theresa May + Chequers = Treason. Retweet if you agree. #Brexit 
The word 'mess' doesn't come close to describing the current status of #Brexit - even clusterf*ck seems somewhat inadequate for this utter bourach. What a time to be alive.*pours drink*Oh aye, and a wee reminder that Scotland still has an escape route...we should use it. 
Boris Johnson says Theresa May’s ‘breakthrough deal’ will make UK a ‘permanent EU colony’.Here‘s a map of nations that were also made permanent colonies of the UK. If people could Retweet this on to Boris that would be greatly appreciated #Brexit #PeoplesVote #C4News
As Ken says, there is no majority for various iterations of #brexit in the HOC.The UK is the same, there are so many versions of #brexit those who want to #remain far outweigh any version, particularly as so many leave voters become #remainernow
When @UKLabour call for cross-party talks on #Brexit, as @Alison_McGovern says @theresa_may rejected, that is the pot calling the kettle black.@jeremycorbyn has refused to work with @vincecable, @CarolineLucas, @IanBlackfordMP and @LSRPlaid. Image speaks for itself. #Newsnight
#Newsnight I’m afraid @nicholaswatt is just wrong to say that the alternative to a Theresa May #brexit deal is a no-deal Brexit. There are two other options: - renegotiate (a different deal)- reconsider Brexit (with a new referendum)
Theresa May's plan to keep the UK in a customs union seems close to being agreed The DUP are understandably furious at her backstop betrayal of N Ireland#Brexiteers will never forgive herThe PM is not only destroying the #Brexit dream, she is shattering our country's future 
Theresa May will ask Cabinet to agree a #Brexit deal that keeps UK in EU customs union. That’s remain not Leave the EU.Her #Chequers blueprint for the Article 50 Withdrawal Agreement is the opposite of everything she said in her Lancaster House speech.
The only way #brexit happens is through an unholy Tory-Labour coalition.If it does we will neither forgive nor forget!

The political climate after the referendum was not that of a democracy, it was that of a country taken over by the ideology of populist dictatorship. Free speech against #Brexit was largely silenced, not by violence but by politicians and media.Take back democracy - #PeoplesVote

This is true for all areas of biomedical research in the UK. You can either end free movement or have world-leading research, but you can't have both. #Brexit 
It is very clear that a majority of Britons now oppose #Brexit. In what possible way could it be democratic to force through such a massive change against the will of the majority? The damage that would do to our democracy could well be irreparable. There must be a #PeoplesVote.
Ok, so how the helll do us mere mortals stop it???? What can the Brexiteers MPs do??This is our country! @theresa_may is acting like a deranged dictator... #brexit #Chequers #backstop #DUP
The DUP threat to vote down the budget, if they don't get what they want. Again proves that the game is up for May.A fully functioning democracy doesn't work, if a party that represents just 00.5% of the UK, can dictate terms of #Brexit#GeneralElectionNow@paulmasonnews #Pmqs

No. #Brexit is 100% the responsibility of the British Government. This Government chose to #Leave - The EU have set out the choices available. There are literally 100's of legal agreements both with the #EU27 & globally that cannot be broken for the sake of UK demands. #finalsay

This #AgricultureBill does not prepare the industry for #Brexit & does not protect our farming industry. And with the risk of food shortages I think the gov better think again, & have a #PeoplesVote on the deal
Consequence of breach of DUP ‘nuclear’ red line on #Brexit has been: abandon confidence and supply arrangement with @theresa_may even if that ends up installing @jeremycorbyn in Downing Street
Senior DUP sources fear No 10 may agree to some form of regulatory checks between Northern Ireland and Great Britain to secure a #Brexit deal. DUP source: If PM doesn’t take our concerns on board, we will take the view she is not the leader to take us through to a safe Brexit
Breaking: I understand the DUP will vote against the 29 October Budget if @Theresa_May breaches their #Brexit red lines at next week’s EU summit. Losing a budget vote has traditionally been seen as a confidence issue

That #Brexit dividend in full: “A team of civil emergency workers are being recruited on salaries of up to £50,000 a year to help the country cope with any fallout from Brexit.” 
This is the truth.  The 6th richest pish is pish.  The Torys know it, they always knew it. The Torys are stashing cash overseas as a private safety net and the EU we’re planning to interfere with that in March 2019. That’s why #Brexit is a thing. 
And 88% of Britain's Leavers also feel that a second independence referendum in Scotland that resulted in Scotland leaving the UK would be "worth it to take back control" #Brexit 
Many #Leavers wanted #Brexit so the UK could control the numbers of EU citizens coming to the UK. In other words so it could say NO to applicants.By doing so, they have deprived 65million Brits of the right to study, work or retire in the EU, as they too can now say NO.
A supermajority of young voters want to stay in the #EU. They have to live with the consequences of #Brexit the longest.
83% of Britain's Leavers feel that "the unravelling of the peace process in Northern Ireland" would be "worth it to take back control"#Brexit

"PAYING FOR THE EU HONEYPOT" - If you're pro-#Brexit, you HAVE to read this article on the £9.5 BILLION that Theresa has agreed to fund for EU pensions : 
A new version of the “continental partnership” idea that suggests a way between EU of “clubs” and EU of “concentric circles”. It’s where we are anyway, but as #Brexit shows, the fear of chaotic fracture (and the arrival of Macron’s ego) make an orderly re-ordering impossible. 
This is the map of the #geography of #EU discontent, considering the votes for parties moderately opposed to EU integration. The conditions that brought about #Brexit are present in many countries. Restoring hope is more urgent than ever.#EURegionsWeek

This is a slippery answer. You need to own up to #BBC's part in creating this #Brexit disaster. The electorate are poorly informed about the #EU. Please re-visit the Reithian doctrine of the BBC's purpose, namely to inform, educate and entertain. That's why we pay you! #BBCbias
#Brexit just got weird again...The DUP’s Brexit agenda has reached a bizarre new low with the party’s MEP Diane Dodds today seemingly ruling out any checks on lasagne, Sinn Féin MLA Máirtín Ó Muilleoir has said.
Chequers deal rejected by EU, ERG, Tory members, DUP, SNP, Labour & @LibDems Compromise fudge will not pass through Parliament. #PeoplesVote only way to break the deadlock. If leavers think #Brexit is the will of the people why are they so scared?
On #brexit: “when the history books are written... the verdict will be damning: never has so much been lost by so many to satisfy so few” 
Sturgeon : 838 days since the #Brexit referendum happened.  Just 171 days until exit.  And yet no one has any idea what the UK’s future relationship with the EU will be. That is a disgraceful failure of leadership. 
Great news for those who want to go to the march. Free buses, find out where your nearest one. And if you are going please represent those that can't make it this time. A name tag on your coat, just to show how many other people want to stop #Brexit . #MarchForMe
Hilary Clinton calls Putin out on Brexit . Not the U.K. PM May , not the U.K. FS J Hunt , not the U.K. govt , not the U.K. opposition leader Corbyn. God I can’t wait till we #StopBrexit and see this cabal in the dock. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVoteMarch #Brexit 
No, of course they're not.But it's bizarre and inexcusable that the *only* MEPs invited onto Question Time are anti-EU MEPs from UKIP (33 times) and the Conservatives (twice).No wonder so many people have formed a skewed impression of how the EU actually works.#bbcqt #Brexit 
BREAKING: At #SNP18 resolution on seperating #citizensrights, ring-fencing them, from #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement to protect EU citizens in the UK from potential no deal passed by @theSNPThanks @SNPClacksEast & @AlynSmith.Over to Westminster to deliver.
The British people already had their say and they voted LEAVE. Retweet if you believe London deserves a real Mayor who actually gives a damn about British citizens and what they voted for #Brexit. 
DUP leader Foster issues Brussels #Brexit warning 
Another passionate speech from @AlynSmith on protecting EU citizens rights "You're here, you're one of us" #Brexit #SNP18
#Brexit is built on hate, lies, cheating, crime & foreign interference from Russia & US big money. It pretends to be popular, but it is the tool of a tax haven craving wealthy elite. We will stop your crooked Brexit. We will drain the stinking Brexit swamp.#StopBrexit
Just restrained myself from heckling, but disagree with David Blunkett #UKCW2018 - #Brexit is an IF not a WHEN. @peoplesvote_uk
One of scandals of #Brexit is refusal by May & Corbyn to acknowledge issue of Russian interference. UK’s under attack, yet Corbyn won’t demand & May won’t order an investigation, due to their own political interests. We live in dangerous times.
With Brexit negotiations entering their final stretch and just 5 months until Brexit day. If there was a second referendum. What would be your vote now? #Brexit #Remain #Leave
I'm so serious about how horrific Brexit will be, that I know I have to do all I can to try and end this charade! I've taken our #BollockstoBrexit message to the streets of London, and I will not rest until I have done everything possible to stop #Brexit! 
Dutch King Willem-Alexander regrets #Brexit turbulence 
"Dancing on the #Brexit Cliff Edge" - my attempt to make sense of all the noise around the Brexit negotiations, Northern Ireland, Westminster politics and the mid-term scenarios is now online:
People still backing #Brexit are actually supporting a Russian offensive on U.K.& Europe.Why are the press, political establishment &public so reluctant to call out what Russians have been doing in USA and UK?
'Arlene Foster has insisted Northern Ireland can't be treated differently from the rest of the UK.'Except when it comes to equal marriage and abortion, she failed to add.#Brexit #bbcnews
I'm looking to speak to people in Northern Ireland who now regret voting for #Brexit. Please get in touch if you can help out. Thank you #journorequests
“I would be amazed if there were not more resignations in two circumstances…” @SteveBakerHW tells me, when I asked about a ‘softening of the Chequers plan’ #Brexit 
#Brexit: It is estimated that if non-EU rules applied to EU players, around 25% of current footballers in the Premier League would not be granted work permits once the United Kingdom leaves the EU 
Why shouldScotland & Northern Ireland have political rights denied to Wales and the English regions? Once #brexit is kicked into the dustbin of history, we should curb Westminster's excessive powers by giving Wales & the English regions the powers currently granted to Scotland.
I was asking people about a law (Reg 575) at the #Wooferendum where you made aware of this in 2016 #brexit ref by the Leave/Remain campaign? @albawhitewolf@wooferendum#PeoplesVote
How about we tell the PM @10DowningStreet and her @number10press what we think about #Brexit ??I'll kick things off with . . . . .@campbellclaret
“In the British system anything is possible given the political will. The current level of interest in a further referendum on #Brexit makes it vital that serious consideration is given to all possible scenarios” – Unit Director Prof. Meg Russell @UKandEU pic.twitter.com/7ZET44xRpf
The replies to this tweet are pretty vicious from the #FBPE lot.Reminder to them: there are 171 days until #Brexit without any opportunity now to hold a second referendum, or to overturn the result! Just rejoice at that news! 
Any sightings of our #BollocksToBrexit message on #TowerBridge road?! Send us in your pictures! #London #Brexit 
Hi @Jo_Coburn. As you have @SteveBakerHW on #politicslive could you ask him what he meant in this briefing issued by him just before the referendum in which he explicitly refers to staying in the Single Market or the Customs Union as perfectly reasonable #Brexit outcomes? Thanks. 
The #Dutch view of #Brexit. Post exit #UK will have a hill to climb to regain trust & influence especially amongst those it was close to as a member state.
More unsurprising #Brexit news on #workersrights. Institute for Public Policy Research warns that proposed non-regression clauses to ensure there will be no roll-back of rights will not be a strong enough protection for workers. #ukemplaw #equality
WATCH: Chisi is marching for a People's Vote because she wants to protect Erasmus after #Brexit.  Make sure you join us at our #PeoplesVoteMarch on October 20th to demand a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit: 
Perhaps if #jeremycorbyn had campaigned wholeheaterdy against #brexit and provided some opposition on #brexit to this government, we would not be in this #brexitshambles !
"Government figures could be preparing for #UK to rejoin #EU - former #Brexit minister" Course they are, they never wanted to Leave in the first place as they are suffering from low ambitions and Stockholm Syndrome 
Who is @DUPleader Arlene Foster or the DUP to represent the views of NI in it's entirety? They only represent approx. 30% of the NI voting population. Not to mention that they maintain that those of us in NI MUST have different laws on abortion/LGBT rights etc to GB.  #Brexit 
We’re at trade shows in Jan & Feb where I’m paying for a stand. I’m selling goods which I’m designing and costing now which will be deliverable into stores next September. How do I cost my goods? How can I promise delivery. What an absolute utter shambles #brexit is.. Fuming.
DUP are- so far- holding the line superbly. There can be no compromise. No special status, no regulatory or customs checks, no border- of any sort- in the Irish Sea. Unionism entirely united on this. #Brexit
It's a good job that the DUP @duponline have got a backboneArlene Foster should be put in charge of all #Brexit negotiations@theresa_may has just adopted a position of supine surrender to every ridiculous demand fron the dictatorial EUPM has not  negotiated she has capitulated
Car sales fell by over 20% in September -- another example of how #Brexit is a dangerous threat to jobs and industry in Britain.The only solution is to #StopBrexit
So @DUPleader has posed a challenge to each side in the #Brexit talks.: the concept of your backstop is flawed, not just its execution:the alternative you're rumoured to be working on of light-touch checks GB>NI won't wash either
Thanks @PeterMurrell & @theSNP team for the stunning backdrop for my #Brexit speech at #SNP18 this morning
Continuing discussions with Northern Irish political leaders today: @DUPleader, @DianeDoddsMEP & @RobinSwannUUP, @JNicholsonMEP. Working hard to explain and de-dramatise the backstop #Brexit 
I will not rest until I have done everything I possibly can to stop #Brexit, and I would urge everyone, especially businesses, who have the slightest concern about the road we are about to travel down to say #BollocksToBrexit!!
Help Me Spread 'Bollocks To #Brexit' Message Across the Capital & Beyond - It's Definitely Not a Done Deal!There are 22 digital sites across London, all screaming #BollocksToBrexit - See if you can spot any, and help me spread the message!
"Having stoked the flames of nationalism, the Brexiteers are now faced with a choice: Brexit or Devolution?" Shocking surveys shows collapse in belief in key concepts of the Union.   @ailsa_henderson @RWynJones @gordonguthrie @PeterKGeoghegan #Brexit
Only @Feorlean would quote Shelley at @theSNP conference “Ye are many, they are few” as he contrasts the talent & diversity of the #Yes movement with the Scottish Tories #brexit #indy #SNP18
We've taken our 'Bollocks to #Brexit message to the streets of London - here's where you'll find it, tweet us in your pictures! 
The mafia state that mounted a nerve-agent attack in Salisbury also poisoned the political process during the #Brexit referendum. It met repeatedly with leading Leave campaigners, lent support to their campaign & sought to reward them with lucrative "business" deals.#PeoplesVote
Earlier this morning @RTERadio1 featured a segment on our complaint to the European Ombudsman re. rights in NI after #Brexit: . We are concerned that previous assurances are being watered down.
Theresa May has been warned 'at least' 40 Tory MPs won't back deal based on her Chequers plan #Brexit
Incompetent former 1st minister of minority party representing a minority of people in NI oversteps their mandate #Brexit 
EU citizens! More consequences of the far-right #Brexit. Thanks to racist leave voters with no education, who have no degree and cannot think critically, many hard non-working foreigners will not be getting free UK money. Shocking. No cheese for you.
Insect-filled chocolates, rat hair noodles, and maggoty orange juice - this is the reality of a #Brexit trade deal with Trump. It's clear we need a #PeoplesVote to give the public control over any #Brexit deal: 
We take no position on #Brexit or on whether a further referendum should be held, but our new report today seeks to inform debate about the practicalities, and guide sensible and responsible decision-making #PeoplesVote @UKandEU  pic.twitter.com/e0LIXDS1lX
Yet again I'm hearing that @NicolaSturgeon is 'dithering' over the question of independence...& yet again I have to remind people that Nicola said that she'd make up her mind once we know the #Brexit deal!? @SkyNews
.@BBCNews .@BBCPolitics  Do your job and ensures every one know this! Might make up a bit for your Pig's  Ear coverage of #brexit 
People take the micky out of Americans for voting for Trump. Ha, the UK voted for #Brexit, so who are the stupidest?
Every time you see Celebrities are backing a #losersvoteIt increases the amount of people who support #brexit.These people really love marching and should  join the armed services.Now we have Celebrities(full list supplied) paying for coaches for the Marchers.Hope it rains. 
How come MPs voted to take the #Brexit route when the vast majority think it is a bad idea and will damage the country. I thought they were supposed to debate the advisory referendum result and then do the right thing for everyone, not just those that shout the loudest.
Steve Baker is one tory i despise in a long line, ffs he knows full well a no deal #Brexit will hurt his constituents/country and our economy, so why do they want such an extreme divorce? It's obvious he's a vulture capitalist like his ERG pals, you've been warned #PeoplesVote
Nothing to see here. Just the Irish Revenue telling the Irish Finance committee that there would be so few checks between Northern Ireland & the Republic it wouldn't even warrant Trade Facilitation Posts away from the border (<2% = <200 freight vehicles per day) #Brexit 
I love this. Trying to build a bridge on 1.5m tonnes of dumped munitions that aren't mapped in any way somehow seems the perfect #brexit metaphor. HT @anthonyleahy
You see a comment like this & it brings it home once again. On what planet do people think it's a good idea to limit people's lives and take away their rights? As I'm saying this I still, even now, find it unfathomable..until you remember that #Brexit is about Neo feudalism.#FBPE
During my 73 years, I've seen some rotten moves by Government but NEVER anything as bad as what is happening now and I cannot believe that no one is stopping it. Destroying Democracy and plotting against a proper #Brexit. It's shocking, immoral, traitorous and insane! 
I fail to see what is surprising about true U.K. patriots rising up against the likes of you, the Govt and the Tory party, when your official line is to support #Brexit.You need to understand that what you’re doing is damaging your country for years for everyone.#peoplesvote

"If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy"DDWell we have changed our mind. Now it is time for a #PeoplesVote#Brexit#FBPE
A campaign built on outright lies subsequently found to have cheated, and we are told to "respect" the result or risk breaking democracy. These are strange and troubling times. #FBPE #PeoplesVote #Brexit
ALL the parties in Parliament want to keep us IN the EU.The 17.4m need to tell their MPs that they will NOT allow the biggest democratic vote in the history of our great country to be overturned.Treachorous MPs will be voted OUT.We want the #Brexit we voted for on 23/6/16.
If #Brexit ends up dead, the same fate will befall the @Conservatives party. I have no doubt that you know that, but I suspect many of your parliamentary colleagues remain blind to it. There is still time for those in govt to #ChuckChequers and opt for Canada+++

There's @nealerichmond making statements on behalf of Ireland and setting the news agenda in Scotland. #Brexit

If you dance on stage in the face of the national crisis that is Brexit then you get what you deserve. She looked ridiculous it was hugely embarrassing and utterly inappropriate. She made the UK look ridiculous. As does #Brexit.

This is big. We are officially #RemainerNow. What does business (small & large), the LGBTQI+ community, scientists, British Medical Association, young people & countless others all have in common? They all believe #Brexit will have devastating consequences.

Wealthy Brexiters pay £50k each to attend a Tory Leaders Group dinner to gain access to May and assorted ministers and get their views across personally.Meanwhile the entire British public won't even get a vote on the final deal  #Brexit
Retweet if you want #Brexit NOW. There is a Gap between the democratic will and what the establishment gives us. 
Exactly why Rees-Mogg wants no-deal #Brexit.He’ll make a mint. Ask him how much.As £ plummets, non-Sterling assets rise in value in £ Sterling.Rees-Mogg & his investors have $8.4bn worth!A 30% fall in £ increases the Sterling value of their wealth 43% almost overnight! 
After #Brexit has been kicked into the dustbin reserved for delusional national projects, there has to be a thorough going inquiry into how the @BBC has become the mouthpiece for the far-right, and why it has abandoned its role of informing the public. #PeoplesVote #FBPE
#Brexit is being sold out I think.TM has a plan, DUP away to meet Barnier & Olly Robbins is there to see his sellout complete.BRINO will satisfy enough MPs to pass HoC.Never any intention of bowing to voters.They're ready for the next lesson, we'll deliver at General Election
Brexiters - if you all knew what you were voting for, and you all got what you wanted, and #Brexit is going to be such a success, why the FUCK are you all whining like toddlers laden down with a shitty nappy? Just admit it, you lost too.....#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
UK citizens are 6 months away from having their rights as EU citizens stolen from them on the back of an advisory referendum procured by liars.Never mind rioting if the result is reversed, I'm surprised people aren't up in arms over the #Brexit crime currently being committed
A dutch risk assessment of #brexit, for the UK. It's a year old, but still very relevant.
This is truly extraordinary--how lightly these people wear the possible implications of their disregard for the condition of peace in NI #Brexit 
Theresa May could need Labour votes to get a #Brexit deal past MPs. But not backing her doesn’t mean chaos. There is a third way: a #PeoplesVote.

Alastair Campbell - We have to fight for a #PeoplesVote with the option to remain. The #brexit that is on offer is not what was promised & there is no deal on offer that will not damage the country... so people should be out there campaigning for a #PeoplesVote.@campbellclaret
Not content with grabbing the UK's financial services after #Brexit, the President of France invited the heads of Renault Nissan, Vauxhall and Jaguar Land Rover, among others, to a private dinner at the Elysée Palace!
I’m with John Cleese on #Brexit, too - this tweet of his articulates why I campaigned for Leave. @JunckerEU made it abundantly clear to David Cameron that there was no prospect of the reforms we needed to stay in the EU ever happening
I’m gradually starting to get that Leavers & even many remainers don’t get how serious #brexit is.Its descended into a fun knock about partisan game for many but in actual fact for the 1st time since the war everyone’s life could change dramatically In just a few months.

This is what #Labour leadership on #Brexit looks like.Thank you @SadiqKhan A #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain in the EU? #YesweKhan
Anyone seeking to understand Ireland’s position on the #brexit negotiations would do well to watch this interview by Tánaiste & Foreign Minister @simoncoveney.
Robert Peston says BBC failed to deliver impartial and balanced journalism in its coverage of the referendum. It comes after analysis of Question Time guests show  there has never been a pro-EU MEP on the programme  #Brexit #Media
Don't 'cha love all the folks who predict violence "if #Brexit doesn't happen."Right.And then what?   
Well said, Jeremy.If we do get a #PeoplesVote & reject #Brexit, the challenge will be to resolve the issues that caused it, and not pander to the prejudices that underlie it.
This is appalling - Tory Brextremist Bernard Jenkin saying of the Scots "we let them vote in our referendum". As with the attitude towards Ireland it shows #Brexit to be thick with a toxic & mix of rabid English nationalism & imperialist arrogance.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
My first trip to Britain! Summer '76I have been coming to the UK for 42 years; i speak, write, work, dream and love in EnglishI know all episodes of Dad's Army by heartI like vinegar on my chipsYet with #Brexit all of my work/love/life planning (in the UK) is fucked. pic.twitter.com/PA2dNMe0QY
Boom! Cuts through the #brexit crap like a samurai. Scotland is gonna leave. If #brexit happens then they're on a sinking ship with the captain still steering thinking it's gonna make a difference.  Time to leave methinks. #indyref2  I don't want people to suffer
Brexit is 172 days away. #brexit
This dog's dinner #Brexit isn't what anyone ordered. The only way we can clear up this mess is a #PeoplesVote. Join our #PeoplesVoteMarch for the Future on October 20th to demand a #PeoplesVote: 
Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FTPA) means PM cannot ram any #Brexit "deal" through parliament as John Major rammed through Maastricht in 1993. 
Very interesting German take on #Brexit Blaming Merkel & condemning the #EU negotiators
If #Brexit is such a great idea, how come no other government is following suit?
This weekend, the SNP and Plaid Cymru joined those calling for #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal, already endorsed as an option by #Labour and supported by the LibDems, the Greens and an increasing number of Tory MPs. Beginning to look likely?

#Brexit has created hatred on a scale i would never have believed, i see all the hate trolls on twitter, i see it on the streets, Theresa May is now asking @UKLabour voters to support her, support your hostility towards the sick, the #NHS etc, fuck off Mrs. May #ChangeIsComing
One of the weirdest argument in the entire #Brexit debate is the demand that people should “believe in Brexit”. Approve of it, love it,hate it, support it, fight it, all fine. But why is this a question of belief? It’s not a cult,is it? Is it??
1/10. Our favourite heart-warming of photos marching against #Brexit at the #Wooferendum march yesterday. Thanks to all the pooches (& their owners) who made it such an incredible day! Thanks also to our incredible team of organisers, helpers & stewards who made it possible.
If you concede that the EU referendum is not definitive,you also have to concede that any future vote in support of Scottish independence would not be definitiveBy backing a #PeoplesVote you are giving the game away.That is why I think it is very foolish #snp18 #Brexit #indyref2
Business anxiety over #Brexit is at highest since the 2016 referendum, a @Deloitte study has found.No one voted for hiring to be reined in. We need a #PeoplesVote
Arrived at EU Commission in #Brussels along with @annmcgregor from @NIChamber to discuss #Brexit & NI with Taskforce 50NI needs a deal! 
There is one single barrier to a #PeoplesVote; one single barrier to stopping #Brexit. Just one.The Leader of the Opposition.@jeremycorbyn - if you lead the Opposition, and finally oppose Theresa May and her #nastyparty, you WILL win the next election.
Jeremy Hunt you do not speak for me. I am angry with the UK govt ,the U.K. opposition , the U.K. HoC ,the U.K. HoL allowing a ref bought on Russian interference & electoral fraud to deny me of my rights and privileges as an EU citizen. #PeoplesVoteMarch #Brexit #StopBrexit
1) Get ready for a big #Brexit week this week - in Brussels and U.K.
BREAKING: #Brexit deal '90 percent' done says Irish leader in HUGE boost to May.Considering that Theresa May took control of the final stages of the negotiations, I have a feeling of dread.#GetHerOut #MayMustGo
Reports that Hospitality VAT rate heading back to 13.5%. If true, terrible news for sector. As one publican said at the weekend, #KeepVAT9 supported training, job retention and wages. New rate will change his business model. All this with added #Brexit menace @Paschald #Budget19
Freedom of Information request forces govt to reveal the road chaos that a no-deal #brexit would cause: 
According to @IrishTimes it looks like it’s R.I.P. for @KeepVat9 .It beggars belief that @Paschald and @campaignforleo would be preparing the country for #brexit and knife the one industry that is thriving on the proper rate of 9% VAT @IHFcomms @Irishtourismind
Dear Leavers. The truth is out, there is nowhere to hide now, whatever you thought you were voting for is exposed for an undeliverable lie. By continuing to support #Brexit, all you are doing is giving disgusting morons like those trolling poor Tanja a sense of legitimacy. Enough 
This gov is taking away the opportunity for people to go and work in Europe. They are threatening people's livings. If that option is removed what happens to wages here..they go down. #brexit is about making people work longer for less money without any rights #itsnotforus
It's estimated that the UK will take 30 years to recover from #Brexit. #Climatechange experts are predicting we'll be reach full blown environmental crisis in 20. Stop breaking apart and start pulling together humans, you only get one chance at this.
On #bbcgms @NicolaSturgeon confirms that @theSNP MPs support for a 2nd #EU referendum across the UK will be unconditional but we will make the case for Scotland’s position to be protected in the event of us being outvoted again  @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit #SNP18
An important announcement for #EU citizens made by @FionaHyslop at #SNP18 yesterday #Brexit @The3Million

A great piece from @Kevin_Maguire on #Brexit and why staying put is the best deal on offer for working people! 
On @GMB @NicolaSturgeon emphasises that #Brexit has highlighted the democratic deficit for Scotland in the U.K & the need for equality within unions - contrasting EU with UK. For @theSNP the debate about #Brexit & #indy is rooted in democracy #SNP18
It is dangerous for #Brexiteers to agree to the UK staying in the customs union until 2022 (when the next general election is due)If the government falls before 2022 and is replaced by Labour who keep us in the CU permanently, the Tories would be blamed for bodging #Brexit 
A No-Deal #Brexit (WTO schedules) may not be considered the preferred outcome but it might get things moving in a more accepted direction. 
Significant and welcomed development from @theSNP in supporting a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal - the same weekend as @Plaid_Cymru.Time @UKLabour & @Conservatives leadership see sense and back it too. #NotMyBrexit
When dogs and politics mix, it's impossible to ignore the campaign  #Brexit#Wooferendum
Government whips can rally as many Labour MPs as it likes. It won't change the fact that the deeply unpopular and unworkable Chequers is unacceptable to the EU.Canada+ is perfectly acceptable to the EU and infinitely more popular with the British people #StandUp4Brexit #Brexit 
The term déjà vu is French and means, literally, "already seen."Is it me who can’t recall or is it just an illusion, but I swear the British public democratically voted #Brexit back in 2016AD.Maybe @SadiqKhan, the #MAGA victory never happened too!
The only way to guarantee austerity will end and #Brexit will be delivered is by returning a #Corbyn led #Labour Government.@UKLabour members who argue Labour should ignore the explicit instructions of the 65% of constituencies which voted leave are #campaigningforthetories.
"I was one of the many that voted Leave. In hindsight, do I believe I made the right decision? Probably not. Do I feel I was misinformed? Most definitely. Was I aware of the long-term implications for my business? Most definitely not."#Brexit #PeoplesVote
Another weekend fighting #Brexit. When I think of the amount of time and energy I have spent, I can’t help but think what a wasted two years of Govt focus, time and money to achieve something which will make our country worse off. The stupidity of Brexit is the hardest to take
Donald Tusk warns that Putin is aggressively trying to cause chaos & division in Europe, with “very clear traces of Russia’s engagement in the #Brexit referendum campaign”.#PeoplesVote
I urge readers to join us at the March in London on 20th October. Nobody voted to prepare for this shit, nobody. The reality is #Brexit is not in the best interests of our country. #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain
1) It's still Hard #Brexit - threadCouple of things to point out as we head to "Canada ++++"A) it suits the EU as a fallback butB) as far as the UK is concerned, its still damaging, draining, hardest of hard Brexits & nothing to be celebratedHere's what we've forgotten
Theresa May has expended all her capital trying to unite the Tories over #Brexit. She has nothing left to force them to act like a party of the whole nation. Which is why her new, supposedly centrist position amounts to no more than words  
TORY #Brexiteers today stepped up warnings to Theresa May not to seek a deal with Brussels that shackles Britain to the EUEx-#Brexit Minister David Jones added: "We must not be dancing to the tune of the EU"
EU corruption runs deep and wide, when #brexit is completed it will begin dismantling even faster. This is the reason for the terror in many EU capitals. 
EU's corporate tax harmonisation plan is a bigger threat to Ireland than #Brexit. The State could lose €4bn in taxes if it is adoptedAnd yet Varadkar thinks the EU is the bee's knees via @IrishTimesBiz
European media have gone crazy for the "wooferendum", pets marching against #Brexit. Examples:  &
@bbcquestiontime #BBCQT Femi Oluwole is one of the most important democratic spokespersons atm. If you're talking #Brexit he should be on the programme. @Femi_Sorry RT
When we fight #Brexit & #TrumpPutin, most of all we fight:1. apathy2. professional liesWhen we lose, we lose our fight for more:1. democracy2. equality3. freedom4. personal safety5. justice6. human rights7. sustainabilityWe'll never give up! #StopBrexit
'.. the Scottish National party would seek a guarantee that Scotland would not be forced to accept the terms of any Brexit deal if the country once again voted to remain in contrast to the rest of the UK.'#BrExit #EURef2 #IndyRef2
BREAKING.  @DavidDavisMP gives the lowdown on how @Theresa_May lied about the Canada+++ deal.  We can easily switch to it, says Davis, but will May do that?  @borisjohnson #borisjohnson #boris johnson   #Brexit @StandUp4Brexit
Very promising position from @NicolaSturgeon on a #PeoplesVote. @TheSNP's MPs would “undoubtedly” support a People’s Vote on #Brexit in Parliament, she told #BBC ahead of party conference. Read this from @KirstyS_Hughes @SCER_eu
What did you do to #stopbrexit? Come on #marchforthefuture on 20 Oct 18 in #London & kill #Brexit. @chesterforeu have #Chester & #Nantwich  pick up points + poss lifts to them. Students /can't afford it? Talk to us at chester.remain@gmail.com book here  
It's time for a #Wooferendum because #Brexit is barking mad! And after 2 YEARS of waiting... It's starting to smell pretty bad!  It's time for a @wooferendum  #StopBrexit #FinalSay
#wooferendum! Hundreds of dogs and people march in opposition to #Brexit  Even the Mail love the dogs.. 
Never let Brexiters claim that #Brexit is patriotic. It is not. Brexit has Russian and American hands all over it. It damages our alliances and our economy, divides our society & threatens the Union, and it serves Putin and tax-hating globalist kleptocrats.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Remainers don't love the EU. They're neo-Blairites clinging on to the past#Brexit 
I'm sick and tired of hearing that if we don't #Brexit there will be violence from leave supporters. 1. This is simply intimidation, pure and simple. 2. If that's the way it's going to be, bring it on. I'll meet you with the same, a thousand fold.
They pull the we hate the English card all the time.. They carry on like this. England has Become a very nasty place... #Brexit 
Hey kids, if you think voting doesn't matter, call a 20-something in the UK and ask how they feel NOW about not voting in the #Brexit referendum. They grew up imagining opportunities in a United States of Europe. Now they're stuck on a rainy island listening to Morrissey all day. 
Is #Brexit worth losing our car making industry for? 
If #Brexit is the will of the people, why are so many against it?
MPs should not imagine they can drive through #Brexit against the will of the majority with impunity. The Remain majority is growing and in due course there will be an irresistible public demand to bring the Brexit liars, crooks, charlatans & cowards to justice. #PeoplesVote
Actor @PeterEgan6 being interviewed about #Brexit and a #PeoplesVote in Parliament Square by Spanish TV @wooferendum #Wooferendum

David Davis"Since #Brexit talks began, I could see the EU trying to steer us into conceding everything the British people voted to get rid of"No. 10 has played right into their hands, and we have ended up with the Chequers compromise" 
It's about time that Tory #Brexiteers put their foot down with our Prime MinisterMrs May needs to be left in no doubt that if #Brexit is betrayed, there will be consequences
Data from the @UN shows more #UK citizens live and work in #Canada than #France, #Germany & #Spain combined.Another reason why #CANZUK is the best option after #Brexit.#cdnpoli #auspol #nzpol #ukpolitics
The #Wooferendum because #brexit is dogs piss 
Even dogs are against #Brexit! Surely we should at least paws the process, and ask if we've been sold a pup #Wooferendum #WooferendumMarch
And this is something that a country voluntarily, and without pressure from their partners brings upon itself? Truly, we live in the world of the mad #brexit 
This makes #Brexit a new ball game.The name of the game is to get our PM to accept Canada+++, clearly the best option for Britain by far.We are no longer fighting the EU. We are now fighting Theresa May. 
#Wooferendum attracts hundreds of pups and their owners. Must admit this is the most adorable protest I’ve ever covered. #brexit 
Many people that voted leave & are #RemainerNow, is in light of information that they weren't aware of at #EURef. The fact that so many were unaware of #brexit implications is down to misleading politicians but also media failing. I agree with @Peston 
Theresa May's #Brexit was never about an Irish border but all about maintaining full EU regulatory alignment under the European Courts with the opportunity to negotiate a customs union pact not undermining the Single Market, withholding Brexit benefits in hope of bouncing back in
I see Macron has taken the bull by the horns and invited representatives of UK car manufacturers over to France to sell the benefits of building their cars in France, wholly within the Single Market and Customs Union, post #Brexit.Bye bye UK car manufacturing
Fuck the EUFuck peace Fuck the GFAFuck ScotlandFuck WalesFuck the NHSFuck business Fuck jobsFuck workers rights Fuck democracyFuck changing your mindFuck the poorFuck the low skilled  Fuck FoM#Brexit Fuck the many Fuck it all
#marrI am sick of hearing that if we don't #Brexit then there will be violence from leavers. This is intimidation and nothing more.I couldn't care less. I will meet any violence towards me with an equal an opposing force. #PeoplesVote#FBPE
172 days until Exit.Do you think that any of the men in this picture of the evacuation at Dunkirk, imagined that their children's children would follow orders from the very people who were forcing them to flee?Think about it.#Brexit #BrexitMeansExit
We have more than 30 "Pee Stations” along the route of the #Wooferendum march in London today each with a photo of your favourite Brexiteers. Setting off from Waterloo Place (by Piccadilly) & march to Parliament Sq. Let's stop #Brexit together...doggy style. pic.twitter.com/Sa7Qio6oZ3
With Scotland and Wales Free, and Ireland reunited, England would be Free to be a #Brexit England and wouldn’t have to subsidise anyone ever again.....now wouldn’t that be an achievement for the English!Would you go for that?   Deal?
The cost of EU membership of €105.20 per person per year is less than the combined cost of travel health insurance (not currently necessary due to EHIC card) and roaming charges (currently none in the EU) for a 2-week holiday to Ibiza..That's #Brexit in perspective! 
Incredible support for a #PeoplesVote in #Cheltenham this morning. People are furious about #Brexit. We’ll be there in our hundreds of thousands on 20.10.18. No longer will people be ignored! 
Poll: Half of Scots would vote for Scottish independence after #Brexit #indyref2
Maria came to Edinburgh on @EUErasmusPlus and fell in love with the city. Over the coming months we’ll launch an advice and support service for EU citizens like Maria who are worried about the impact of #Brexit on their lives in Scotland: 
The Times is now reporting that Theresa May inner circle has identified a fall back plan if UK doesn't get the #Brexit deal it wants & that is to ramp up attacks on the French.Literally nowhere else to with Brexit but angry base nationalist sentiment.Beyond grim. 
In a Democracy, we deserve to get what we vote for, right? This isn't the case. Remember when Leave said we'd have immediate trade deals? Remember the £350M? Being promised something & not getting it delivered is undemocratic. We were lied to.#SayNoToNoSay on #Brexit
It is of course correct that Gordon Brewer presses @IanBlackfordMP on #Brexit and #Independence on @Sun_Pol_Scot, but Brewer's sneering hectoring interrupting of every answer Ian gives is a complete disservice to the debate.#SNP18
Nicola Sturgeon has more professionalism and integrity in her little finger than Dancing Queen PM or any others at Westminster and was honest about shifting #Brexit and #indyref2 dynamics + about challenges such as education. So glad we have her and #SNP. #marr
Without my #PetPassport I wouldn’t be able to do my job when Dad travels. #Brexit put this & my health at risk b/c of vets leaving the U.K., likely restrictions & changes to animal medicine & food imports, with much higher prices too. Join me for the @wooferendum today! 
There will be prizes for the best placards / banners / posters / rosettes at today's #Wooferendum march! Let's get creative!Let's Mage history!Let's stop #Brexit 
Theresa May has failed to negotiate a #Brexit position with her own party – let alone agree a deal with the EU.Giving people a fresh say - a public vote with the  option to stay in the EU - is now the right approach for our city and country.
Pretty clear from music industry, #Brexit will be damaging for their sector and services sector more generally (80% of the UK economy). Nobody voted for this and Vote Leave certainly haven't taken responsibility - but we all can, by demanding a #PeoplesVote on the deal
Music is  British success story. We are world leaders & this government is prepared to throw it all away. Unless stopped the UK will be culturally and economically much poorer - ridiculous self-harm #Brexit @BobGeldofFans @Labour4EU @labour4europe
Rees-Mogg"It appears Downing Street is in a state of panicIt is the job of government to avoid panic, not create itAfter #Brexit there is no need for shortages so we should remain calm and ensure life carries on as normal, not precipitate a crisis" 
The British people voted for #Brexit but their globalist government is trying to block the will of the people!To learn more,Watch @thebestcloser’s fascinating interview with Anne Marie Waters, leader of   The For Britain Movement  #CloserNation 
The government now calls No Deal a "Car Crash #Brexit"A desperate attempt to scare Brits into accepting the #ChequersPlan or something even worseFar better short-term disruption than long-term damage that would be inflicted on our economy by Chequers

My colleague (at @UCLChemistry) has attacked the government as “totally chaotic” as he stands to lose his leadership of major European projects after #Brexit 
Let's be very clear, there is now a massive proportion of the British population who are not being offered any representation by political parties in the UK today.@Conservatives offer only the softest of #Brexit, @UKLabour now want to reverse it ... Who represents the 17.4m ?
#Brexit is Tory-owned, Tory-inspired, to fend off a Tory Civil War within  To blame anyone outside of  demonstrates a failure to grasp reality#Brexit is now used to deflect/hide #Austerity and the damaged being done to 
"WE OWE THEM NICHTS - Why is Theresa giving the EU £40bn for nothing?" Great #Brexit summary of how the EU has no right to UK cash: 
Please make sure you clock this. UK loses its free trade deals with Japan and Canada on #Brexit and needs EU agreement to make new deals. British ppl are being badly misled abt prospects for free trade after leaving EU. Time to fess up before its too late 
Dunc voted leave and is a #RemainerNow I have shared before. He is annoyed that everything he was led to believe #brexit backing politicians has proved false, and with listening to the excellent @mrjamesob he has changed his mind.Thanks for being open on this @bigD7788, 
How will #Brexit affect the life of your average constituent?How will Brexit improve the life of your average constituent?These are the questions that you, Andrew #marr, need to ask every MP who appears on your show.All MPs should be asking themselves these questions too.

There is no will of the people. It's a false concept, used by tyrants through history to cement their power and deligitimise political opposition.#Brexit 
What will people do when they realise that stemming the flow of migrants makes no positive difference to their lives?What will they do when they lose their jobs?When food costs go up?When holidays and cars become prohibitively expensive?Who will they blame?#Brexit
Such a shame you put the nail in the coffin of international collaborative science. #brexit
I've had hundreds of replies from Leavers over the last 24 hours, mostly abusive ranting, and not a single cogent argument for #Brexit between them. All they can do is try to deny the people a democratic #PeoplesVote.#StopBrexit
Our economy is 2.5% smaller thanks to the dogs' breakfast that is #brexit   costing £500,000,000 a week - EVERY WEEK - we cannot afford this?Leave all the rhetoric on democracy aside for a moment: we are in free-fall and watching a reasonably functioning economy tank: for what?
I hate to point it out to you guys but what you are going through with both POTUS and SCOTUS mirrors what we are going throught on this side of the Pond with #Brexit. Why is it that so many of your and our politicians have lost their backbone for standing up for what is right?
It never ceases to amaze me when some people on the left describe the EU is an outward looking, democratic and liberal organisation. It's none of those things; it's protectionist, antidemocratic and authoritarian.Thank God we're leaving!#Brexit

Jacob Rees-Mogg - "On future migration, we need to focus on high-skilled, not low-skilled, labour."Having mass no-skilled labour migration hits the less well-off in society most because it hits their wages the most and stops them going up." #Brexit 
.@Telegraph cartoon#Banksy #sothebys #TheresaMay #ChequersPlan #Brexit 
So after #Brexit UK can do a trade deal with the US, or with China, not both? Another wake-up call for Brexiteers who thought the special relationship would mean special favour: 
David here voted leave, but he changed his mind a long time ago. He feels he was lied to and feels #brexit will hit those least able to protect themselves the hardest. David is a #remainernow Respect  for speaking up @david_harman_uk, not easy but so many feel like you!
Wonder why this is a problem only for the UK? Maybe because there are different views in Britain on #Brexit and #ScottishIndependence.
These scenes are partly your fault Anna but nothing in comparison to what will be if #Brexit is betrayed. 
Don't be fooled, the only deal on the table whilst Theresa May is PM is Chequers and Chequers will be rammed through parliament as the Tory brexiteers are spineless.#Brexit
Another #Yorkshire MP,  @RachelReevesMP , says it’s time to re-consider #Brexit, now that it’s clear that it won’t match what was promised and instead represents a threat to jobs and prosperity that we can ill afford

Enjoyed listening to @Anna_Soubry passionately calling for a @peoplesvote_uk in #Sunderland today. Great crowd turned out to demand a final say on #Brexit. A demand that’s growing all over the UK. The stakes are too high for the North East, and all of us, and time is running out. 
Any violence against peaceful protests is contemptible. The EDL are contemptible. But your constant attempts to overturn the biggest democratic mandate in history will turbo charge awful groups like the EDL. You have no idea the damage you could unleash. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
If you value our #NHS then you should be fucking opposing #Brexit, because the tories will allow the Americans to asset strip it, but the brexiteers don't care, its all about control innit #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
#Brexit is a disgraceful act of vandalism against the people of this country. Messrs Dyson and Martin are part of this vandalistic cult, I cannot condemn this peaceful act of protest.

Braving the rain in Chippenham to listen to people’s concerns about #Brexit Took the #brexitometer to gauge reactions and unsurprisingly there was strong support for a #PeoplesVote
Dear @peoplesvote_uk supporters. Really helpful if groups supporting #peoplesvote could make it clear they support #OptionToRemain - (if they do) - I for one have better things to do than support a vote that is just between #Brexit options. @acgrayling
NOBODY is beating down any doors to do a deal with us after #Brexit. Those who've spoken to us have stated they want FOM for their citizens -  INCREASING immigration from non-EU countries. Trade and migration go hand in hand - something Brexiters will have to accept eventually.
Never seen anything like it a bunch of thugs assault @peoplesvote_uk in #Sunderland bringing shame on a great city and its people and our country. We will not give in to the #Brexit 
Sir John Major, former Tory Prime Minister said, "If you look at any possible deal we’re going to get and compare it to what people were promised with #Brexit, there will be a gaping gap." Share this 2-minute video. #FinalSay #PeoplesVote

Democracy is not just about votes, as Brexiters pretend. It is also about the right to oppose, which Brexiters usually deny, and the need for the electorate to be well-informed, which Brexiters don't want because they know it will lead to a Remain majority.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
Chequers prevents any movement on free ports in the North. An estimate by the consulting firm Mace suggests that ‘supercharged’ Free Ports could create up to 150,000 new high-quality jobs and bring £9bn a year to the Northern economy. #northernpowerhouse #brexit
The Government’s plan for #Brexit will make it harder to bring international drug gangs to justice. By losing the European Arrest Warrant and information sharing arrangements, these criminals will be much harder to catch. #ExitFromBrexit

Of course the #Government can reach some kind of a #Brexit deal with the EU within weeks. BUT- it won’t be a good one for Britain - it won’t get public support - it won’t get through UK Parliament

Kajagoogoo is getting a little shirty over his anti-Brexit sign.I'd be very interested to hear HOW his business is being destroyed by #Brexit.  It's time some meat was put on the bones of the bollox he spouts.
The sell-out Express claims the Tory rank-and-file are supporting May's #Brexit betrayal [yet the vast majority of ConHome members oppose it)The Express implies that public support the #ChequersPlan - when in fact only 9% of the public support it

Completely deluded for Tory whips to think any self-respecting @UKLabour MP will vote to destroy the jobs & livelihoods of their constituents by backing a blind, botched or no deal #Brexit

"Would You Trust This Man with Britain's Youth?" - New EU law on Thursday, once again unreported by BBC.  A must-read article from the #Brexit Facts4EU team: 
Tucked away in the Business section. It’s shameful that when business speaks truth to #Brexit power it doesn’t make the front page “Boxmaker shelves £50m plant over Brexit” #BrexitReality #brave @peoplesvote_uk
It's not in the interests of Irish to upset the 17.4m Brits who voted #BrexitSecond biggest receiver of Irish exports is the UKIf the 17.4m start boycotting  Irish products, cos the Irish Gov is trying to stop #Brexit the Irish economy would harmed badly
'Remainers' are always on about money when it comes to #Brexit. How about sovereignty? I want the right to eat Pie & Mash when I want, even at breakfast. To keep our buses red & taxis black. To insult the French & Germans when I want without the EU interfering. Vive la Brexit! 
Hurrah for #Brexit! “It has everything to do with our business,” says @PimlicoPlumbers. “If there is Brexit, we won’t have a business.” Which can only mean one thing: Brexit means our loos will never block again and our sinks will always flow smoothly. How utterly marvellous!
The calibre of pro #Brexit trolls is really sub optimal. Very weak, easy to spot, no sport at all.They are struggling to believe their own make-believe drivel.We are winning.Night night 
Whatever groans, moans, growls, howls we are compelled to commit to twitter can we please not lose track of the core fact:There is no form of #Brexit that can make Britain better than staying in the EU.A #PeoplesVote is imperative to #StopBrexit For the sake of our country.
That’s the case. The government lie about everything. Like saying we have our best days ahead after #brexit.
If you see a  in someone's profile it means they are a fascist. If you challenge them, they are quite likely to claim that it means they've been shadow-banned by Twitter. But if you check the time lines it's nearly always full of far-right stuff. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE

The sight of the odious Isabel Oakeshott getting applauded like her pal Jacob Rees-Mogg last week tells me we really are going to hell in a handcart, these people won't suffer the impact of #Brexit yet they get lauded like fucking royalty, god help us #bbcqt
The funny bit of this clip is "Canada + + + - whatever ( *" and the serious bit is @campaignforleo saying the #Brexit transition/implementation period might be too short to finalise the UK/EU future relationship. (Thanks to Darran for the clip.) 
#bbcqt invite @IsabelOakeshott & still don't ask her abt her key role in the #Brexit scandal with @Arron_banks. Makes a farce of @bbcquestiontime & any notion of public decency when she won't answer questions abt @LeaveEUOfficial & the involvement of Russian authorities.
The government may not be breaking constitutional laws, but in its treatment of #Brexit it has been violating some of key political norms which underpin our democracy. An article on how the violation of such norms can kill democracy:
#BBCqt   The Dancing Queen is preparing to dance on the grave of British Manufacturing Car Makers and Airbus just two.Is #Brexit worth it? 
Valuable lecture by @fotoole on British & Irish identity in post-#Brexit era: charted rise of English nationalism, data on which was ignored until it erupted in Brexit, yet still unaddressed today. But this island's progress in accommodating multiple identities must be protected. 
The UK has no formal Constitution to protect us from governments abusing their legislative powers. We depend on them either exercising self-restraint or being restrained by Parliament or fear of electoral defeat. In the case of #Brexit that arrangement has failed.#PeoplesVote

So after two years it's finally been revealed that the Tories #Brexit strategy is to insult the EU whenever possible in a bid to win the votes of the pond life who think Tommy "Yaxley-Lennon" Robinson is a political prisoner. What a time to be alive.

Well done, Tom.Time for Labour to stop trotting out the line about "respecting the result" of the #Brexit referendum?We know this result was obtained by wholesale breaches of electoral & data-protection laws & it looks more than likely that some of this money came from Putin. 
Could you please impress on your leader that he should start every PMQs with "Have you opened an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 EU Referendum yet?" with the follow up question "Why not? Is the govt implicated?"#GRU #JeremyCorbyn #Brexit #FBPE #PeoplesVote
All this, and the US indicting 12 Russians today for hacking and we’re to believe that the #brexit referendum wouldn’t have been a target? Can we be sure the result of the referendum result - ignoring the known illegal activity and lies - is safe?  
Putin wants #Brexit. It represents a huge victory for his hybrid war against the EU and democracy. And the government is handing it to him on a plate. I would call them traitors.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
So where the hell is labour in pushing for investigation into the interference and illegality of #Brexit. You can’t pick and choose. We only have one official opposition party and they are letting our country down. On every level. 
#TheresaMay and her ministers have callous contempt for #British citizens in EU affected by her #Brexit plans:  
Why don't we just check if ppl still happy with #Brexit now they know what's involved. Surely that's the responsible thing to do. If majority still want to then it's an informed decision 
#RemainerNow @bigd7788 makes a good point here. It's often difficult for leave voters who have changed their minds on #brexit to speak out due to abuse they get from both sides.Being a #RemainerNow is brave & they should be welcomed, most leave voters did so in good faith.
How about this: Travel Agents Thomas Cook have put #Brexit in the same category as war, terrorism and nuclear disaster, meaning NO REFUNDS. #BrexitShamblesSee Section A, Clause 21:

Now that we've got a fifth FBI indictment on Putin's cyber operations, detailing dozens of GRU/IRA operatives attacking Olympics, US political parties, US population - what are the chances Putin DIDN'T intervene in the #Brexit vote?
This might be a good time to put this up ... we need more people to get involved in the struggle to save our country from the scourge of #Brexit. The #Brexit juggernaut won't magically stop itself. 
The Brexiters' arguments against a #PeoplesVote become ever more pathetic. There's only one reason they oppose it, and that's because they know a better informed public would vote to remain in the EU. They are #RunningScared of democracy.@Andrew_Adonis#brexit

From the very beginning, the EU offer has been a Canada+++ deal. Much further-reaching on trade, internal security and foreign policy cooperation. This is a true measure of respect. And this offer remains in place. #brexit
A lot of talk about @theSNP & FM trying to push #IndyRef2 on the back burner. Given the current cliff edge of #Brexit I find this a bit disconcerting! Is it a political double bluff? Are they waiting for that cataclysmic moment? Or are they about to miss the Indy boat? Opinions?

Sorry @johnmcdonnellMP, if you really want to hurt Putin you must work to stop #Brexit which hands Putin a huge strategic victory in his hybrid war against the EU and democracy. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Have arrived in Brussels for an afternoon of meetings on #Brexit. The negotiations are entering a critical phase, and time is running out. But I believe that an agreement is possible, with the right political will and focus on all sides. First meeting with @eucopresident

What will not be forgotten or forgiven is the arrogance of NE Labour MPs doing all they can to stop what the huge majority of their constituents voted for on #Brexit. As Theresa May said yesterday, they are working to deliver a politicians’ vote rather than a people’s vote. 
First Jaguar Landrover now Nissan when will the Govt start giving businesses the certainty they need on #brexit and ensure that such a vital British industry succeeds. 
The Common Agricultural Policy required us to buy France’s more expensive food.Costs went up & every family of 4 lost £20 a week.Our EU membership contributions are our payments for being damaged!EU money was siphoned off particularly to the powerful German economy#Brexit #EU
Nigel Farage - “There is no reform. The EU would rather die in battle than reform."Because reform would be not accepting that we had to have a new flag, a new anthem, a new army, a new European state because that has been there intention all along." #Brexit 
Steven Woolfe MEP - "You forced a referendum in France, you forced a referendum again in Holland, and you made the Irish vote again."You (the EU) don’t allow democracy when you don’t like it, isn’t that like those who are overridingly powerful telling us what to do?" #Brexit 
Electoral rigging, dark ads, foreign money - the law breaking around the #Brexit referendum is staggering. Leavers, are you content with this because you won by a small margin? Remainers, would you be content with this had you won?If the answer is “yes” have a long think 
EU citizens are our friends, family and colleagues -- but many are understandably concerned about #Brexit and the impact it will have on their lives. 
Devolution can help solve the Brexit conundrum, but unionism needs to be pragmatic and see this not as a challenge to sovereignty but as an extension of the differentiation we already have within the UK and an economic opportunity for NI.#Brexit #NI #BridgesNotBorders

It’s telling that those at #CPC18 who argued that Brexit is “the will of the people” are the very ones who are most opposed to allowing the people to have a say on whether they still agree, now that #Brexit is turning out to be very different from what was promised !
Dear @theresa_may Did you know that #DancingQueen, the song you danced your way on the stage at the @Conservatives party conference (#CPC18), was co-written by a guy who called #Brexit a "disaster"? Just sayin'.Yours sincerely@Gruene_Europa
'Not ONE mention of Chequers' - IDS claims May’s #Brexit plan has seen THIS crucial 'shift' HOWEVER, a cynic might say that it was because the day before Mrs May was booed at conference for mentioning her #ChequersPlan and she has not changed her mind
I was too young to vote in the 1974 referendum so, before we have a #PeoplesVote I demand that we have a rerun of that particular referendum. I'm sure a number of voters may have changed their minds after that one too. #Brexit #GetUsOut

We need another vote just to check majority of British ppl do want #Brexit once they have better idea of what's involved. Unless politicians check the Will of the Ppl, then how do they know they're doing what the majority want? If it is, then we leave knowingly. 
Not having a referendum is also too dangerous. When Leave lies are discovered, #Brexit damage will be blamed on politicians and Parliament. That is huge threat to democracy. We have a duty to check if majority of British ppl want to Leave or not. That's democracy 
Becauseof the EU Gina! You know that organisation that you are so desperate for us to stay in come what may.#brexit #tampontax
“Oh yeah.. Robert @Peston & @jonsnowC4? Yeah, they always uphold impartial, unbiased journalism in UK. They never let their virtue signalling, admiration of Leftism or hatred of #Brexit distort their reporting. They’re always fair. They never rant”....said no sane person. Ever

Theresa May and her govt can say whatever they like but until such time as they come up with a #Brexit plan that meets with the approval of the EU i.e. conforms with the EU rules that Britain significantly wrote, the plans will not be advancing from the drawing board.#newsnight
And this on the same day a drug trial firm announces it won't now start trials in the UK due to uncertainty from #Brexit. To all the people who voted for Brexit, this is your dividend. Time to wake up & realise Brexit is all risk for no benefits. #Remain
Anybody still defending #brexit has lost all objectivity and credibility at this point so it's a bit rich criticising somebody trying to stop this country crashing out of the EU. I recommend getting your priorities straight Alastair. My guess is you'll be unaffected regardless.
Remember, they told us #Brexit would SAVE money, that would all go to the #NHS. In fact, it’s costing us a fortune:
Nadine. Think. The EU have been consistent from day 1. Honest fair transparent. What is happening is the realisation Brexit can’t deliver anything it promised. No one is forcing us into no deal. The choice now is #brexit or #remain. And I know which is winning. #peoplesvote

This shop campaigned for #Brexit. The entire village appeared to have voted to Leave in 2016. The shop refused to take pro-EU leaflets at Easter & I received filthy looks from the customers when I tried to deliver them. This is a truly radical change.One Theresa May should note.
Looks like many Tory ministers are reconsidering their position on #brexit and are coming round to a #PeoplesVote.Let's ensure we all keep writing to MPs to encourage them to out #CountryOverParty but especially if you are #RemainerNow#StopBrexit

Theresa May delivered the speech of a Blairite not the speech of a conservative. It was a celebration of political correctness aimed squarely at London metropolitan voters.  #Brexit

5/ When Theresa May was Home Secretary she suppressed 9 reports proving that immigration had little effect on jobs and wages. This shows that while posing as a Remainer, May was pursuing a xenophobic pro-#Brexit agenda while Home Secretary.#LeaveLies

New report: #Brexit would hit #Cornwall hardest due to high proportion of EU exports in the most vulnerable sectors: food & live animals (90% of which exported to the EU), and material manufactures (69%).A hammer blow to an aready poor area.#PeoplesVote
1/ The government's immigration propaganda is based on the fallacy that there is a fixed pool of jobs. The reality is far more complex. An increase in labour supply often boosts spending, tax revenues and profits & therefore investment, so creating more jobs.#CPC18 #Brexit #FBPE
#Brexit would hit #Cornwall harder than any other region in the UK, a new report confirms. No wonder more people here than anywhere else have changed their minds on leaving the EU. Lets grant them a #PeoplesVote

Like many, @AndreaJenkyns wasn't swayed by #TheresaMay and contrasts her underwhelming speech with the "bold vision for #Brexit that the whole country could get behind" offered by @BorisJohnson. The #Tories need to change course. Be a part of that change: 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "Remainers have always thought that anybody who doesn’t agree with them is stupid. And they thought the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the EU are stupid."It’s a desperately condescending and arrogant approach." #Brexit 
Priti Patel - "The great proponents of a second referendum are the likes of Tony Blair, Lord Mandelson, the very individuals that denied the public a referendum at the time of the infamous Lisbon Treaty." #Brexit 
Nigel Farage - "I want to show Leave voters they have not been abandoned to the constant daily negative dire that we get from the BBC and elsewhere that #Brexit is a complete disaster and the whole thing must be overturned."

Hello from a British citizen who used to live & work in Norway & travelled throughout the rest of Europe for work & pleasure. I want other people now & in the future to have the same opportunities for learning, working, & living I had. #Brexit is pointless self-harm. #EUfamily.
Having been called a loser hundreds of times by leavers I'd like to say this. If #Brexit was such a wonderful fucking idea would we not all be winners?
Just be aware even if it goes ahead neither the Tories nor a complicit Labour Leadership can ever take #Remain votes for granted.We will neither forgive nor forget this #Brexit betrayal.You've awakened a quiet element of the electorate & forged a new alliance.Cometh the Leader

WATCH: Vince is marching for a #PeoplesVote on October because he does not think the promises of the leave campaign for #Brexit can be fulfilled. Join our #PeoplesVoteMarch on October 20th to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal: 
1. It is not conspiratorial to say that both Johnson and Rees-Mogg are front men for a very narrow set of interests. they are relying entirely on the IEA think tank set for ideas - which sees #Brexit only in terms of how their financial backers can advance their interests.
Lord Heseltine - The only way to resolve the #brexit issue is 2 put democracy to work with a #PeoplesVote.. what you then find is "every year a serious number of elderly people die who are #Brexiteers & their place is taken by a group of younger people who are pro-#EU"#CPC18
The PM is genuine in her desire to unite the country, but with only weeks left to negotiate, it’s becoming clear that it will be impossible to deliver a #Brexit deal the comes anywhere near matching all the promises made. That’s why we need a #PeoplesVote #cpc18
Dear Prime Minister,The country does not want or support your altered vision of #Brexit. Please listen to your party and the electorate.#ChuckChequers#CPC18
Lord Heseltine - The country is divided from top to bottom.. it's a tragedy & it's called #brexit & there's no upside.. the fact of the matter is we are stepping down from 1 of the cornerstones of UK power & it will diminish the UK's status in the world#peoplesvote #FBPE #CPC18
Theresa May on #Brexit: "Britain isn't afraid to leave with #NoDeal if we have to".How do you know? Have you asked them, @theresa_may?Without a @peoplesvote_uk on final deal we are about to go over a cliff edge, and most vulnerable in society will be hit hardest & fastest.

The new Conservative/Labour tenet that fraud doesn’t invalidate a contract, will be very surprising to lawyers everywhere.Tell me, again. Indeed, explain it in legal terms. Exactly why is the Referendum result allowed to stand, having been obtained by nefarious means?#brexit
The only interesting thing in the speech was that she didn't use the word Chequers. She set out parameters but did not name specifics. She at least has room to develop her offer. Still, though, her only exit from the corner she's painted herself into is the EEA.#CPC18 #Brexit
EU must look at Tory party & wonder whether UK is a country operating in 2018 or 1818. Why aren't more senior government figures now supporting #peoplesvote to avoid car crash #Brexit ?

It's #Brexit poker time. @theresa_may #CPC18"If we stick together and *hold our nerve* we can get a good deal for Britain". Let's see. Always a problem bluffing when you have a track-record of folding; and guys across the table don't believe you have the cards.
UK now well and truly up shit creek without a paddle and still stuffing itself with cake. And EU has had enough: We won't compromise our principles to rescue the Tory party from #Brexit, Guy Verhofstadt warns Theresa May 
Interesting PM not mentioning “Chequers” by name - using different language emphasising it’s a free trade deal #Brexit #CPC18
Britain "isn't afraid" to leave the EU with no deal, Theresa May says, adding that "resilience and ingenuity" of people will see UK through Live:  #cpc18 #Brexit

The NHS is on its knees, Theresa May.On its knees.Without the EU citizens who work in the NHS it is likely to collapse.Without proper funding it will collapse.With a No Deal #Brexit it will almost certainly collapse.And that will be catastrophic for almost all of us.
There is NO such thing as EU money!EU has NO money of it's own!#EU budget money is from nation state contributions which UK taxpayers contribute about £10 Billion.#Brexit will allow UK to cut out the Brussels middleman & pay subsidies direct to UK farmers, science & businesses

The sad part for Theresa May, having contained her lunatic fringe, is that all she has to do is go for a measured, intelligent #Brexit along the lines of Norway and she will be remembered as a PM who did her duty. Instead she'll go down as a failure who ruined the country.

Absolutely spot on @pollytoynbee. So good to read a clear & powerful articulation of what I’ve been banging on about for over 2 years! An #EEA-based #Brexit is a strong compromise & only form of Brexit with a hope of re-uniting our deeply divided country.

I'm calling on @theresa_may to listen to Carlos Tavares and PSA on the #Brexit threat to the car industry. I also expect her, as any British govt should, in her #CPC18 speech tomorrow, to condemn any company that wants to enjoy the British market, but is now threatening to leave.
Do not be fooled. Conservative governments can only flourish in times of crisis. They rely on fear to implement ideological austerity In 2010 it was the Global economic recession In 2019 it will be a no deal #Brexit Get them out before it's too late #GetTheToriesOut

The only thing #Brexit has delivered is a country split down the middle, with friends, neighbours, work colleagues and families all set against one another.The architects of this division should never be forgiven for their crimes against an entire population.
What astonishes me most about #brexit is that despite English as the de facto lingua franca of the EU, despite social media and countless European think tanks publishing in English, the UK debate on Europe manages to be completely detached from the rest of the EU

The UK government should not forget that they joined the EU freely and that it was the UK’s decision to leave. If in the future this decision should be revised, the EU should not close the door. Watch @MollyMEP & @ph_lamberts on #Brexit 
This from @davidallengreen last year - and the year before that - as true now as it was then:"A hard #Brexit is actually the soft option for the [UK] government." 
Nigel Farage - "Don’t forget what an important marketplace we are – your exporters call us treasure island."How many motorcars, wine and Belgian chocolate do you sell us? We go for a simple free trade deal." #Brexit 
Boris Johnson does not believe in #Brexit. He believes in nothing. For him the referendum was an irresistible publicity opportunity. He is a dogwhistle politician. He doesn't care about the Brexit outcome and has zero grasp of the issues. He is a fraud.
I'm not interested in Boris Johnson, he's a man who does just what one would expect of a high-functioning psychopath, he lies, cheats & changes his opinions to suit his ambition without the slightest sign of being morally troubled. It's dull, predictable & boring.#CPC18 #Brexit

I find myself disagreeing with remainers more these days on the causes of #brexit. It wasn’t principally about economy, trade or even immigration.Brexit is a psychological-cultural phenomenon predicated on nostalgia & a historical exceptionalism narrative that got out of hand.

Inevitably @MichelBarnier has a slideshow for every #Brexit occasion. In this case:1) on migration/mobility 2) on the UK proposal for a Temporary Customs Arrangement
#Brexit #CPC The National Farmers Union warns of “catastrophic” consequences:

Dear @thatginamiller using your own logic we cannot know ALL the facts until a few years after we have left. If you want to campaign to rejoin then that's fine. But you cannot have a 2nd referendum until the 1st one has been enacted. So let's get on with leaving the EU #Brexit 
Amid this background senior members of the cabinet are now reaching a settled view about Merkel: she is highly unlikely to come riding to the rescue over #BrexitIs that the same Merkel who was shown the #ChequersPlan before most Cabinet Ministers?

#Brexit in a nutshell.Nothing to do with sovereignty, or law making, or money. It was only ever about keeping foreigners out, even if that means food rotting in the fields.Now you know why there's a new Minister for Food Supplies.
This is highly disturbing from DUP leader  (but perhaps not surprising). A failure to see Good Friday Agreement encompasses totality of relations within and between these islands, and needs to be used as framework for post-#Brexit context. 
May is determined to reverse #Brexit. She is betraying what we voted for - the freedom to do trade deals worldwide - simply because the EU won't cooperate over NI. The tail is wagging the dog.
Many Leavers at a very strange place right now:1 they insist no deal is what they always wanted & what they voted forWhile also...2 ....bitterly denouncing the EU for no deal & its consequences#brexit is like one big psychosis machine spewing out inanity & stupidity.
#Brexit Have a great Tuesday everyone out there today. Let’s have a day without Brexit bashing & Donald bashing. It’s same thing everyday from same bores all the time. Donald Trump doing great job in . And we’re leaving the EU. Shut up  give it bloody rest today.   
Enthusiastic scenes on the #ToryConference18 fringe yesterday as @conservative4pv  held a packed-out event. Passionate, authentic @Conservatives from across the country were queuing out the door. No wonder the #Brexit leadership look rattled. #PeoplesVote

Why not just drop #Brexit and admit to making a rather large mistake?? 
#TheresaMay confirms that Brits will do the crap jobs after #Brexit but the good ones can be filled by #Immigration.  
1. So if reports are correct it looks like Mrs May is going to go with a customs union as her next move along with those rules necessary to keep the trucks rolling. No doubt this is going to upset the #Brexit Taliban. (thread)
Get us out of the EU, @theresa_may.This is not negotiable, your only task is to deliver #Brexit.Keep listening to Hammond/Robbins & you're heading for electoral suicide.We'll never forgive this capitulation, it's un-British & it's not in the interests of the UK.So why do it?
The @Conservatives civil war over Europe & the far left neostalinist takeover of @UKLabour, has led to the two main political parties in the UK endorsing #BrexitWe just don't know what disastrous type yet.Just say no!Support the @LibDems Call for a #PeoplesVote & a #FinalSay
Philip Hammond claims the UK will enforce a hard border in Ireland if there is no #Brexit deal This Remoaner is a disgrace & should have been sacked a long time ago. He is behaving like the EU shill we always knew him to be The DUP will be furious
David Davis was entrusted with getting the UK a #Brexit deal.He said it would be easy.He did (apparently) minimal work, failed & resigned.Now he seems to be favouring a No Deal.Did he do no work because he didn't want a deal?If so party should withdraw the whip.#newsnight

 Delighted to join @OwenPaterson at the @fishingforleave fringe this afternoon. #Brexit means taking back control of our waters and rejuvenating our coastal communities. The SNP would betray our fishermen and drag them back into the hated CFP. 
The Alliance Party has given the growing momentum around a People's Vote a voice in Northern Ireland, after successfully securing support for the idea across both Belfast and Newry, Mourne and Down Councils. @KateNicholl #Brexit #PeoplesVote
EU have rejected May’s conference pitch that Brussels must move first to break the deadlock over negotiations as #Juncker said British people were only “finding out now” about the scale of the problems caused by #Brexit.Oops, that won't go down well....
Absolute pleasure to address a packed @conservative4pv fringe this afternoon - standing room only. I’m embarrassed that the Party banned this event from the handbook. It’s patriotic and democratic to seek the #informedconsent of the people on #Brexit #cpc18
#Brexit is about many things but perhaps most importantly it’s about our place in the world. Our vision for where we want to go, who we want to be. The sad thing is, our international friends think we’ve lost the plot. We must give people a #FinalSay before we proceed.
At #Brexit Question Time in Swindon. We've just heard first-hand from someone who was told to 'go home' on the 24th June 2016. She's  contributed to our economy for 32 years and was told 'Good riddance'. Utterly heartbreaking
Nice to hear @Anna_Soubry making the #Remainiacs case of: "We little people must vote again & again & again until we get it right (according to her at least) on #BBCRadio5 she never misses a chance to open her front hole whilst simultaneously talking out of her back hole. #Brexit
Chiswick almost unanimous in opposing #Brexit Building up to the #PeoplesVote in London on 20th October.
On the same day Tories said Scotland couldn’t decide on its future another senior Tory said: “An organisation that has to threaten its members to stop them leaving is not a club but a protection racket.” Oh the irony! #Brexit #Scotland #indyref2

The Tory party conference, with Hammond going on about a #Brexit dividend and Hunt comparing the EU to the Soviet Union, makes me feel like I'm going mad. It goes way past simple disagreement. I literally feel like I occupy another reality to these people. I'm not alone am I?
Toyota joins JLR & BMW in likely post #Brexit jobs cull. Though dismissed as project fear, this is the harsh reality of Brexit. No wonder Ruth Davidson says she'd vote remain in a people's vote. #PeoplesVote is the only answer.

Just done a search of Twitter for any #Leavers / #Brexiters expounding the benefits of #Brexit and come up with zilch.So that confirms it, even the ardent #Leavers have no benefits. Nothing, niets, rien, nada, nichts, semmi, niente, nic, nowt.

#Brexit being bad for the UK isn't an OPINION, it's a FACT accepted by the government and detailed in their own publicised research. #Brexit being good for the UK IS an opinion, with zero evidence to back it. Opinions don't trump facts - it's that simple. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay

Neither @theresa_may nor @jeremycorbyn understands. This isn’t like anything else. There’s no debating this; no revising; no tweaking.This isn’t ordinary politics. It’s #Brexit. And it’s so illegal, repulsive, and destructive that we will NEVER allow it. Never. Ever.#remain
Consumer confidence stumbles as uncertainty over #Brexit casts doubt over future business activity. Clear need for a #PeoplesVote:

Remarkable stat from @NicolaSturgeon this am. Based on proposed future UK immigration policy, 75% of EU nationals currently living & working in Scotland would have been ineligible to come in the first place. Immigration is crucial to tourism, food & drink sector growth. #Brexit

The insanity of #Brexit grows with each passing day. Had it not happened deficit cld've been cleared.There can be no good outcome given the irreversible damage but at least it can be mitigated if we get a #PeoplesVote for a #FinalSay with a #Remain option
Excellent report. On page 62 it notes the government has yet to identify the trade opportunities from #brexit. So the government repeatedly says we can seize the huge opportunities of #brexit but does not know what they actually are. #Conservatives2018 #CPC18 #brexitreality
The rules of capitalist totalitarianism are hugely detrimental to most people.  I feel sorry for the many who will have to pay the price for the sins of the few.  These people are callous and fanatical. These people are seeking to rule over the country. #brexit is about that
“A dramatic legal bid to win the UK Parliament a right to revoke Article 50 ... is likely to succeed - raising the prospect of #Brexit being halted.” Good collaboration by Scottish Labour, SNP & Greens @andywightman⁩. Scotland voted 62% against Brexit.
On my way to the Alternative #Brexit Conference where Ill give a speech at the @bowgroup on how to #Brexit and Making Conservative Party Conservative Again & join the @TheBlueWaveUK to do it. Tonight I speak at @tfa4freedom chuck chequers event
Many people who voted leave did so as (a) a protest against austerity and (b) to fund the NHS.It's now clear that #brexit has prolonged austerity and is costing the UK economy £500m a week.If this is not what you voted for, join us as a #RemainerNow
It's a verifiable fact David; we do in fact send £billions to the EU and only get about half of that back. Think how much good that money could do back home! It could pay for so mant police officers that even you couldn't miss them!#Brexit #cpc18
Clear tactic of Tories is now to demonise EU and blame them for a disastrous #Brexit. Scoundrels and Xenophobes excusing their own incompetence.

For those who voted leave: this government is sabotaging the #Brexit negotiations. Deliberately.  Then they will blame the EU when you are starving. They will say you voted for this and the EU is punishing you. Wake up! Time to demand a #PeoplesVote
Ex-#Brexit Minister Baker"Chequers appears to have been founded on very bad advice – we need to start listening to people who understand trade policy'"We need to provide a solution on the Irish border to unlock a free-trade deal with the EU
Grateful to @davidmartinmep @C_Stihler_MEP @AlynSmith @andywightman @joannacherry for writing about #Brexit bid at European Court to enable UK Parliament to revoke Article 50 if it chooses. Expert opinion by @tobiaslock on their chances makes compelling reading in today’s paper.
The #Brexit mantra tirelessly repeated at #Conservatives2018 Conference (“end ECJ jurisdiction,take control of our borders, end free movement,stop ‘vast’ payments to the EU,leave CustomsUnion&singlemarket”) is in reality bogus on each one of those points:
Did you know GTA V was built in Britain? We have a thriving video gaming industry that brings in billions. 35% people who work in this area are European. #Brexit will be a disaster and @Games4EU are looking to change that.
Do you believe in #Brexit, Mr Hammond? @PiersMorgan pressed and pressed and Chancellor dodged and dodged. If he doesn’t believe in this Govt’s central project he should make way for someone who does
This  Shame on you @Jeremy_Hunt #Brexit 
A new world order is emerging, and it will be centered around the Pacific, not the Atlantic. Europe has to manage this historic transition and cannot afford to disintegrate into squabbling nation states (cough, Brexit) #Germany #Brexit #EU #Europe
Some #brextremists think that #Brexit will weaken the ties in Europe. In fact it will only serve to make them stronger as trade that used to be with the UK will now happen between EU members. They don't need us, in fact right now they need us like a hole in the head. #PeoplesVote
Finally! You're getting it. #Brexit is a Trojan Horse for the biggest neo-con project of all time. The #DisasterCapitalism the Cons plan to unleash will make Thatcherism look like a picnic. The #NHS will not survive.We don't have to do this. #PeoplesVote could stop the madness.

Why the EU is obsessed with the Tory Party conference. My #Brexit thoughts: 
If the BBC are correct that the Chancellor doesn't mention #Brexit in his key note speech at the Tory conference today, this would be a real shocker.The UK is about to face the biggest economic shock in decades and the Tories are trying to pretend it isn't happening.
Expropriating the rights of the British people to live, work and trade freely in 27 neighboring countries is the only #Soviet thing about #Brexit and the #EU that occurs to me. #CPC18 @MichelBarnier
The #UK after #Brexit must be like other non EU nations. Countries like Australia, India, USA, Canada, Brazil etc are not ruled by #EUcourts, don't pay #EUfees, don't accept #freemovement, don't have #openfishingwaters & neither should the UK. We need a clean break from the #EU!
I do believe the @BBCNews website has got stuck- they have had the same vomit inducing headline of @theresa_may ‘believing in brexit’ for almost 24 hours. Talk about ‘doubleplus ungood’ Journalistic speak.. #Brexit #BrexitShambles #CPC18 #bbcbias
EU boss #Juncker takes another dig at #English - this time at the #UN. He's says English is losing it's importance in europe. It isn't. HE IS. THE EU is. The most successful nations in europe are not in EU & soon the #UK will join them. #Brexit now. 
Less than 6 months until #Brexit day & the biggest risk to Brexit now is that we are forced into a #baddeal that #remainers & the #EU have been colluding towards. We don't need a #transitiondeal, we shouldn't pay a #brexitbill & we must quit in full on the 29th of March 2019!

The #EU & #remainers like #TheresaMay are colluding to stop a #realBrexit from happening. They don’t want the #UK to #leave & are using a deal to trap us under EU control so we are not really a #Free Nation. We must stop them for overturning #Brexit. We must have a clean break 
Nah. Revoke article 50, spend about ten years working out what #Brexit was supposed to be for - because clearly nobody has a clue - then, if you ever get back into power, call another #EUref. Meanwhile #JC4PM. You know it makes sense.

So when's May calling this snap election? Because I for one am well and truly tired of this clusterfuck we call #Brexit. 
Eccellent review that makes sense of the #Brexit debate  - within the limits of the intrinsic dysfunctionality of such debate. Read @SMerler @Bruegel_org 
Will the #Tory conference beat last year's as the best comedy in town? A good start with the app that gave out ministers' private phone numbers, #Johnson's bridge to #Ireland, the #Brexit festival and Jeremy #Hunt fighting our best friends on the beaches. 
I never thought leopards would eat my son’s face. #Brexit #Trump
BREXIT: May opens door to dumping Chequers plan for a soft #Brexit - as Tories defend her from Boris onslaught 
The messaging behind the #Brexit referendum campaign and subsequent planning has been characterised by bad English. It should act as a warning for companies everywhere. 
Brexit is 4318 hours away. #brexit

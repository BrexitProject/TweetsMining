No to nationalism. I voted Remain. Tories were split on Brexit. They are not nationalist just because they don't want to break up the UK.

Looking forward to supporting @mattwarman in neighbouring constituency over next few weeks-only a vote for Conservatives will deliver Brexit  
Why not take a leaf out of UKIP`s book and resolve #brexit issues with punch-ups?

Alliance press officer coming back into the office after issuing that 'strong' statement about the Brexit pact  
"The Brexit win was a victory of the rich, by the rich, for the rich."  
It's underway, BREXIT is going to be appalling ! BBC News - Blue Riband biscuit production to be moved to Poland  
Brexit is expected to have a clear – and negative – impact on Ireland’s balance of payments  
From EU's perspective, matters nothing if it is May or Corbyn/Starmer in government. Their intention is Brexit will be what they serve us. 
Ironic that Blue Riband Is going to Poland because of Brexit as the only people I've known to buy them are in a key Brexiteer demographic 
Excellent account from @davidallengreen of how the EU's #Brexit negotiating stance crystallised quickly and openly:  
Future of #EU,Brexit,WB,Turkey,#OSCE and a range of other topics discussed w/@sebastiankurz in Vienna.Agreed 2 meet twice a year from now on 
Bizarre Brexiters are upset/angry when companies relocate/make redundancies b/c of Brexit effect on profits. What did they think wd happen?! 
Excellent analysis of how #EU preparation for #Brexit negotiations has been so much more effective than UK's - and done w full transparency.  
From @davidallengreen’s Brexit by timetable.  Please note, EU is diplomacy, not politics 
#Brexit'ers:'We're fed up with the Polish coming over here (contributing to economy)'OK, we'll move jobs to Poland 
Theresa May now simply making stuff up... "people around the country are telling me to get on with Brexit and make a success of it"  
Brexit economy: living standards are falling as the snap election looms  That is precisely why an election is looming 
EU-27 has already set the tone for #brexit talks. There's little room for manoeuvre for UK argues @davidallengreen . See his great thread! 
Nicola Sturgeon is pulling your leg. Of course a vote for the SNP is a vote for another referendum, says @alexmassie 
"Brexit by timetable" By me, at @FT Part 1: the early evolution of the EU’s position: Part 2 tomorrow. 
Keep in mind I'm stupid but this thread suggests Brexit terms up to EU not UK. More reason to vote Labour for NHS & schools, imo.  
FAIL: Labour Minister displays 'I'm In' EU Remain sticker. Hardly committed to Brexit then...  
Dear Tim Farron, have a LONG, HARD look at YOURSELF before you go slating Labour over their own bad Brexit policy. You're an anti-democrat! 
Good, sober thread. Brexit is a process and the EU is dictating that process. That's pretty much all there is to it.  
This thread: "Negotiating" Brexit is nonsense; you can't negotiate if you have nothing the other side wants. You take what you're given.  
MPs say free movement of EU students post-Brexit.  Only if they pay same fees as non-EU students though

Brexit economy: 'living standards are already falling as rising prices outpace meagre pay growth'  
7. AJP Taylor once wrote of "war by timetable".  From the EU's perspective, this is going to be "Brexit by timetable" and on EU's terms. 
.@stephen_dorrell is right: Parliament must reflect different views towards negotiations. This election, we must elect anti-hard Brexit MPs  
UK's main opposition party vows to scrap Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan if elected in June

Apparently Brexit means Brexit. But nobody quite knows what that is. There's hard Brexit, soft Brexit, semi Brexit and premature Brexit. 
 As usual the BBC manages to turn a good news story into one of Brexit impending doom. (To be revised upwards later).

Absolutely first rate analysis, yet again, by @IanDunt. Here he is on the elusive beast known as "Labour's Brexit":  
How's Brexit going so far? Here's a checklist of where Britain and the EU stand just now  
One of the reasons Britain voted for Brexit was to defend ourselves against European extremism says @timothy_stanley 
Scotland rejected #Brexit, but we're suffering the consequences anyway. Remember that on May 4th and June 8th. #VoteSNP 
A Labour Brexit will approach the negotiating table with the needs of the many at the forefront -not the interests of the privileged few.  
Let's all do our bit! "Labour has a real Brexit alternative. Now let's get the message to voters" says @OwenJones84 
Hard brexit. This is just the start. The Tories won't step in, a Labour government would.  
‘Home to vote’ could be even bigger for 8th amendment referendum  
The unofficial coalition! Kier Starmer & Labour cuddle up close to May & the Tories over Brexit again! 
Shame. Thoughtful MP and particularly so on Brexit.  
Civilized nations discuss referendum like it was done in #Brexit, #SayOrLeaveUk; uncivilized ones kill citizens agitating for it. 
Labour MPs have been sent this general election script. Essentially, talk about schools and hospitals, not Brexit or war.  
Here @Keir_Starmer is what a real Socialist @MartinSchulz says about freedom of movement:#Brexit #Remain #GE2017 #GE17 #GeneralElection 
Brexit an open/closed society issue. UK political parties historically left/right split instead. That’s what ties esp. Labour in knot. #GE17 
Brexit our defence against extreme nationalism. Terrific stuff from @timothy_stanley

By saying they'll only govern with the Tories, the Lib Dems are a party of hard Brexit @aaronbastani 
"But as long as there's no second referendum, all this is fine."  
Thereby losing votes of Labour Remain supporters! May as well stand on joint ticket with the Tories at this point: no opposition to Brexit. 
Labour won't give people a vote on the final #Brexit deal. Contempt for democracy. Red Tories. #Remain #GE2017 #GE17 
Tory campaigner called. Explained I am @LibDems and will not vote for any party supporting Brexit. He said "that's what they are all saying"

.@Keir_Starmer just categorically ruled out Labour going for 2nd Brexit referendum in any circs, even if we crash out of EU with no deal 
Labour's message must be clear, sharp & repeated regularly: no blank cheque for a reckless Tory Brexit. @OwenJones84  
Keir Starmer on Brexit: 'We will work with parliament, and will legislate to ensure there is a meaningful vote at the end!'  
In constituencies where Labour has the chance to win voting for other parties is writing a blank cheque to Tories on brexit. #ge2017 
Labour have learnt nothing since the Referendum say UKIP Leader @paulnuttallukip and @GerardBattenMEP  
The Tories want to use Brexit as an opportunity to tear up our rights. Labour won't let that happen. Our rights are safe in a Labour Brexit.  
Steven Agnew confirms the Greens out of anti-Brexit pact due to SDLP's choice of Alasdair McDonnell in South Belfast 
Keir Starmer on Brexit: ‘We don’t agree with the Prime minister, and that no deal, is the worst possible deal!’  
Taoiseach must listen to border communities on Brexit – @GerryAdamsSF  
A coalition of chaos led by Labour would cause grave uncertainty for the UK as we go through our Brexit negotiations 
Lab, LD & SNP support a 2nd referendum & would risk our future if Jeremy Corbyn entered DS propped up by the LD & SNP (1/2) 
Labour are on their 7th plan for Brexit. Theresa May set out a clear plan for Brexit & can provide strong & stable leadership #chaos 
LABOUR BREXIT CHAOS- Talk of fantasy 'reformed single market'- MP will campaign for mass migration 
This is Open Britain target list of 20 "hard Brexit MP" key seats that angered and led to resignation of Tory MPs: Soubry, Morgan, Grieve  
What's clear from EU parliament is that we have been sold a pup by #brexit press and UKGOV. Minimum 3 or more years for exit after 2019. 
Labour has a real Brexit alternative. Now it must get the message to voters | Owen Jones  
NOTE to #bbcdpPeter Mandelson does NOT speak for Labour on #Brexit (or anything else)Keir Starmer is the OFFICIAL spokesperson on #Brexit 
Does Labour's Brexit Strategy make you more or less likely to vote Labour at the general election on 8 June? 
This Sunday @Peston sits down live with PM @theresa_may. We'll be discussing the election, Brexit & her plan for Britain. 10am @ITV

Rising prices, sluggish wage growth, employment uncertainty. Guardian Brexit analysis 
Keir Starmer on Labour Brexit: 'Jobs and the economy are Labour's priority throughout. We will seek tariff free access with the EU.'  
So @IanDunt has tried to work out Labour policy on Brexit: Starmer's honourable patch-up job in a party without leadership or settled view.  
Brexit economy: living standards are falling as the snap election looms  
Just finished this. 6k words setting out step-by-step how the EU's Brexit position developed. Should be up at @FT today or tomorrow. 
Media (which made inept UKIP powerful) spent year blaming Corbyn for Brexit yet now attacking sensible Labour Brexit plan as 'anti Brexit' 
"COMING TOGETHER" is like some king mass hypnotic mantra. is TM starting some kind of cult?! hard brexit or high treason? 
Barry Gardiner lays out Labour principles for negotiating Brexit - jobs, economic growth, workplace rights and environmental protectiions.  
Barry Gardiner sets out Labour's position on Brexit explaining why they would allow EU citizens living here to stay in the UK #PeoplesBrexit 
Here's *full* script for LabMPs for #GE17. Does mention Corbyn + Brexit  (tho no specifics). But final bit is core doorstep 'talking points'  
Keir Starmer on Labour Brexit: 'Jobs, the economy, retaining the benefits of the single market and customs unions are the priority.'  
What is the Labour position on Brexit today? Genuinely baffled. 
Good Brexit read. Starmer has knowledge without power, May has power without strategy, Corbyn has no knowledge, power, strategy or interest  
Ask every candidate in every constituency if they'll back a public vote on the #Brexit deal with an option to #Remain. Take back control! 
Great if Labour have stopped dancing to Tories extreme & reckless #Brexit tune. But Greens would go much further:  
As a long-time Tory member, I have quit the party over Brexit. Others are doing the same. Brexit is bigger than mere partisan tribalism. 
When you're opposition leader & should be shutting down parliament bc government stole referendum but the money &benefits are just too good.  
Which means out of the single market. There isn't really much difference between Labour and government's Brexit position  
What's the one question you want me to ask @Keir_Starmer about Labour and Brexit at lunchtime?

We won’t be campaigning during the election period, but we'll work with whoever gets elected after June the 8th to make Brexit a success. 
Brexit - whether Leaver or Remainer - would opt for Labour unless they had to  
Right I've done that thing again where I try to figure out Labour's Brexit policy  
Corbyn's success w/Labour members built on not being 'Tory lite' yet that's essentially what Labour's Brexit offer is (as far as I can tell) 
Theresa May, who was anti-Brexit and who stated that she wouldn't call a general election asks the British public to put their trust in her.

It says a lot about the scar tissue from Brexit and Trump that the most likely outcome occurring is being met with a relief rally 
#Obama supported Britain staying in the EU. We got #Brexit.Obama supported #Hillary. We got #Trump.Obama supports #Macron. 
I dispute 1: Labour authorised May to trigger A50 after it was clear that would mean Hard Brexit. That amounts to voting for it, in my book. 
Theresa May's election gamble could give her enough clout to see off the Brexit hardliners in her party  
U.K is better after #Brexit vote , #France can do the same #Frexit #JeVote #JeVoteMarine #Presidentielle2017

During this time of crisis, if you are on the left or in the middle to not support Labour is a vote for #TheresaMay's hard brexit. #GE2017 
The @LibDems will offer British voters a second referendum on #Brexit in their manifesto for June’s election 
This interview about Trump, Brexit and Twilight of the Elites is, I think, also broadly applicable to France.  
5) Remember this is season of disruption. Logic does not explain Brexit/Trump. Those who want to "blow up" system will never vote Macron. 
EU will veto Brexit deal if citizens’ rights are not protected  
Did you vote for Brexit Shambles?  
Let’s have a leader like Macron in the UK who can unite the country and take us back into the EU. #Brexit  
European Union demands Britain pay Brexit bill in euros not pounds  
A hasty election before Britain sees the hard truth of Brexit  
I fear Theresa May has other plans for a very soft Brexit  
I don't think enough emphasis has yet been put on the specific damage #Brexit does to Scotland. 
Ruth Davidson's aim is to avoid talking about Brexit. We won't let her. It's what this election is about. #VoteSNP #GE17 
Dude, even the UK government Brexit white paper said "We didn't lose sovereignty but we might have felt like losing it". 
It's not EU immigrants, it's Chinese imports that have hit jobs & wages & have driven support for #Brexit #GE2017 
I prefer this formulation to simply saying Libdems oppose Hard Brexit. The second sentence is crucial.  
When you're so desperate for Frexit to shore up Brexit that you're kind of relaxed about fascism  
#Brexit - a movement led by spivs and chancers and backed by a handful of tax-shy billionaire press barons. 
Dear international friends: it seems France is going to break the insanity cycle. We won't be the third act of the Brexit/Trump tragedy. 
More evidence of the country "coming together" behind #Brexit ... 
I think tonight we'll see exactly the opposite of Trump/Brexit market recovery: markets down -> upside. Tonight: first up -> then downside  
Agree with Blair on this: a Hard Brexit is now the common enemy   
On May 4th, vote Labour for a local champion - not a cheerleader for a divisive second independence referendum. #council17

After Brexit thousands of workers will be getting 365 days holiday a year.

‘We'll cope on our OWN TWO FEET’ UK to THRIVE after Brexit as EU suffers, motor boss says  
This is why @LibDems are offering a referendum on the Deal v Remain. Seems improbable we will get a better deal than EU membership.  
Is now a good time to remind everyone Russia interfered in the UK's last General Election and Brexit? 
We have people in Scotland that think Greedy Tories keep Scotland to subsidise it and will give them even more after Brexit  
Could be worse, J. You could be accused of being a 'Remoaner' every time you point something out about Brexit.  
The Tory upsurge in Scotland is a confused mix of Brexit pipe-dream & Brit nationalism directed against the pro-EU, pro-independence SNP. 
If the Tories halt HS2 because of Brexit they are simultaneously betraying the North & proving that they are no longer the party of business 
Hard Brexit/Soft Brexit, all Brexits are awful & anyone who wants what's best for the UK has a duty to oppose it, Labour are weak as water. 
May's scared of effects of Brexit, of economic trends, of debate, & of prosecutions for election offences. The GE is an act of desperation.

German elections will return pro EU gov. Eurozone growth set to outstrip U.K. By end of year U.K. Brexit leadership will be isolated 
Why you should avoid comparisons to the 2016 US presidential race or Brexit with France's runoff between centrist Macron & far-right Le Pen  
Saving democracy, restoring real sovereignty. Important post-Brexit event. Tickets here. Do RT  
Brexit, Trump & Le Pen winning? Could it be that open borders & a rampant invasion from foreign cultures isn't all its cracked up to be? 
Brexit, Trump, Le Pen WinningLeftists losing It's almost like importing a death cult of barbarism isn't very popular in civilized society. 
"hijacked by...a small group...with very strong ideology"Blair unwittingly describes perfectly his own anti-Brexit, anti-democracy cabal  
I think Westmonster and Arron Banks are going to find themselves disappointed and embarrassed by the real result.#Brexit #GE2017 
Not if Corbyn supports Brexit. I'm a lifelong Labour voter but he destroyed my faith. I joined the LibDems. 
'Brexit mostly funded by five of UK's richest businessmen'  
I agree with Vince! @CarolineLucas helped @sarahjolney1 win Richmond & she's anti-Brexit. @LibDems should help her hold her own seat. 
GOOD! Trump, Brexit, and now Le Pen would would be the most beautiful story to tell to my kids -- including details of the Left's hysteria. 
Tories refuse to deny reports that high-speed rail to Manchester could be axed... to pay for Brexit 
Labour's @ChukaUmunna dismisses Blair's call for an 'anti-Brexit alliance' involving voting Tory or Lib Dem  
As in Brexit, Trump, Austria Pres and NL elex, education is the strongest predictor of vote. Grads vs school leavers, everywhere.  
I see Blair is still causing Brexit trouble. You would think the 400 British soldiers killed because of him would keep his mouth shut 
Labour needs a Brexit strategy, not just ideology, says @Porritt   
Breaking: it's #LePen v #Macron in France's May 7 runoff. Before investors panick, remember mkt reax to #brexit & #Trump. #Frenchelections 
This brexit treachery and fighting is proving too much. Government should walk away from the EU now and let us get on with our lives. 
Brexit will never again be as popular as it has been this last year.  
Likely under a Macron presidency in France:- #Brexit-bound UK faced w/ united EU- Russian influence at bay- Improved eurozone performance 
He will be tough on Brexit. But time will be spent much more on putting and keeping a government together + trying to keep Assembly onside  
Macron expected to be at least as tough on Brexit as Hollande & Shultz would be tougher than Merkel  
#Brexit comes from the same stable as Le Pen, Wilders and Trump. They offer nothing but hatred and division. 
EU leader: UK would be welcomed back if voters overturn Brexit  
Michel Barnier, the chief EU Brexit negotiator, states that as a patriot and a European: "I will put my trust in @EmmanuelMacron." #Macron 
After Brexit and Trump I'm scared to go to bed in case when I wake up it turns out Le Pen got 51%. 
Barnier already celebrating: this will impact Brexit talks... when PM met Trump Macron said Britain becoming "vassal state" of US  
.@ChukaUmunna disagrees with Blair that securing the right kind of Brexit trumps party loyalty  
I started on Twitter just after the UK referendum and for the first time most on my t/l are happy. Me too. #macron 
Christ, it's Groundhog Day.For the 3rd time since Brexit, exit polls (and Twitter) were a flagrant lie favoring the establishment Left.  
Globalists beware, we the people are taking back our countries EVERYWHERE! Trump, Brexit, now Frexit in France with Marine Le Pen win! #maga 
Macron is best news for Europe/EU. A welcome change of philosophy for Europe.It's also a clear reminder Brexit has just become Harder 
Exclusive photo of the party leader who is delivering a Hard Brexit for the UK. A Chance to Change your country. Vote @libdems on June 8. 
#Frexit is dead. Funeral on 7 May. #Macron is pro-EU, close with Germany, anti-Brexit. Tough deal for UK ahead #frenchelection 
Marine Le Pen clearly didn't get a boost from being a Trump clone. Same with Geert Wilders. Trump & Brexit repelling Europeans from populism 
As @LibDems been saying for a long time & with partic force since Brexit & Trump votes; actual Liberals in pole position #LibDemFightback 
If Macron wins the second round  of the French election, it means the U.K will face a tough negotiator over Brexit. No favors for UK#france 
TEAM LE PEN: 'Election will be referendum for or against globalisation.'  
Chuka: “Tony Blair is wrong to suggest in any way that voters should look elsewhere and form some anti-Brexit Alliance. No ifs, no buts". 
The battle over Brexit was fought last summer. The battle to define what form it should take is far from over  
France faces its own EU referendum as Marine Le Pen and Europhile Emmanuel Macron split the first-round vote  
A third, 32%, of GE2015 CON voters now say it was wrong for the UK to vote for Brexit - YouGov 
1. BREXIT 2.MAGA3.Le PenNext is GERMANY   
Marine Le Pen: she had Trump, she had Putin, she had Brexit, terror and her exit poll score is only a few points above her father in 2002. 
In our Brexit negotiations, we must secure tariff free access to the single market.  
So many voters saying Corbyn's Brexit stance means they can't vote Labour. I'm one of them. Labour lost millions of Remainers. 
Macron's smallest lead against Le Pen is more than 20 points, well beyond Brexit, Trump, or UK 2015 GE. Not impossible, but HIGHLY unlikely  
One of several reasons to be sceptical of parallels between Brexit and Trump  
Whatever common ground we may have with LibDems & some Tories on Brexit I can't forgive what they've done to my area  
Seven people arrested for allegedly insulting Erdogan during a protest of the referendum:  
Can almost physically touch disappointment in Anglosphere commentariat that France has not joined Brexit-Trump axis by voting MLP top 
European Union demands Britain pay Brexit bill in euros not pounds  
Tony Blair is wrong to suggest in any way that voters should look elsewhere and form some anti-Brexit Alliance >  
After years of terrorist attacks, unemployment, after Brexit, Trump, powerful message of optimism and hope sent by France. #frenchelection 
Similar to Dutch election. It seems Brexit/Trump shocked centrist voters into turning out to protect European freedom, peace & prosperity  
Yeah, not buying the 'I voted Remain but now we have to get on with Brexit' bollocks, I didn't vote Tory in 15, I don't support them now. 
TB:For sake of clarity, I’m voting Labour, not telling people how to vote, saying they shld make informed decision on Brexit before voting

May called election to get it out of the way before enough people wake up to how catastrophic Brexit is going to be.  
Sunday papers stuffed full of opinion polls. What a resilient industry, given their abject failure to predict either last election or Brexit 
Mrs May knows 2020 would be awful - Brexit damage clear to see = Remainers angry. UK still in transition = Brexiteers not happy either #GE17 
Post #Brexit, Britons deal with the toxic consequences of junking EU environmental legislation #GreatRepealBill 
Brexit, Trump, Wikileaks, Putin. What connects them? Step forward, Nigel Farage 
Trump/Brexit/Le Pen all based on return to a past in which govts by & for white people had global power to make white people's lives easy. 
And nationally, won't rule out ANOTHER Coalition with the Tories - so how can they claim a vote for them on 8th June is anti-Brexit!  
No coalition with the Conservatives, no coalition with Labour. The more Lib Dem MPs, the stronger the opposition to a hard Brexit.  
Media said #brexit would destroy the Tories...  
Why we mush reclaim #StGeorgesDay as the Patron saint of multiculturalism and diversity in a post Brexit Britain  
This is where London's bankers plan to move after Brexit  
Brexit is going to be very expensive- even the Tories can't magic money out of thin air, and we will all pay for it  
If France votes for a fascist party, even a 'cleaned up' one, we're all screwed. Come on France, don't do a Trump/Brexit. Turn the tide. 
These are the important dates to watch during the Brexit process (including the election)

So when pollsters ring, most are saying "I'd like hard brexit, private healthcare & larger class sizes please"? Who the fuck are these ppl?! 
Good, why on earth would they want to collaborate with the main architects of a Brexit UK?  
I'm not happy that Corbyn is pro Brexit either but he's more likely to spend money on schools & NHS than May. It's that simple FFS. 
I think that's what a lot of people will be doing. We're negotiating with serious politicians on Brexit. We can't leave that to Corbyn Imo.

4) Retail sales now in sharp reverse, biggest fall for 7 years. Signs of a future Brexit-caused recession are all there.

Throwing my hat into the ring to win Clacton back for the Conservatives. Time to make Brexit work. Time to make Britain great again! 
Why did Theresa May call an election and what does it mean for Brexit? Here's a quick guide  
Labour needs to understand that the key purpose of the opposition is not to back the government on Brexit all the time.  
When May romps home with a huge majority, just remember, it's an indictment of Corbyn not an endorsement of Brexit.

May says GE is needed 'to let the people decide' on #Brexit. But her whole thesis since 23/6 has been that the Ref itself was 'a decision'. 
Labour have already propped up the Tories by voting with them towards Brexit. They let me down. Nobody is speaking for me. 
The basic problem with Tory Brexiteers is that #Brexit is their end point rather than the beginning. No vision, no plan, no clue. 
Whatever happens, we will keep fighting #Brexit until the future of the UK in the EU is assured. That will happen: stay with the endeavour.

It is PM Theresa May who will negotiate on behalf of Brexit Britain with the EU. On Thursday 8th June 2017 it's crucial we all back her.. 
Totally agree. We need clear position now: why not offer referendum on final deal with option to stay.

Question seems to always come back to whether #GA06 is referendum on Trump. Hard to see it otherwise after he waded deep into race today. 
But even if Ossoff falls just short, with 48%-49%, he's likely to win the runoff. Dems, aided by DJT, made race a referendum on Trump, no?  
Disagree with you there. @ossoff has been highly articulate on policy. Media just ignored him cuz it's irrelevant to "referendum" narrative.

Simple choice:Conservative: Brexit & UnionLabour: Refugees & protestsLib Dems: EUSNP: Division & Austerity MaxGreen: SNP+windfarms 
i'll vote for any party offering a sensible brexit and no indyref2 policy as part of a govt of national unity. 
Key questions on immigration and free movement for all parties in the campaign.  1.  Would you accept free movement continuing after Brexit? 
My email from Jeremy Corbyn fails to mention Brexit.  Like reviewing Jaws and overlooking the shark. #GE17 
Prediction: May will try to make this election campaign predominantly about Brexit. That'll suit Farron just fine. 
It’s not just Trump: With Brexit and France votes, Russia is cultivating the global right.  
The Tory right are fanatically backing #Brexit. That should tell every Labour supporter that it should be fiercely opposed.#GeneralElection 
Told the Leader of the House that we on our benches will always protect the people of Scotland from their hard Brexit & austerity obsession 
Member of the European delegation who observed the Turkish referendum photographed with a PKK flag  
She wants to hit while they're down. But will it become a referendum on Brexit?  
The Tories: damaging our alliances, weakening our influence, helping Putin through #Brexit, breaking up the UK are not the party of security 
Will the GE in Scotland be a proxy indyref referendum, or a proxy EU referendum? Christ knows. 
Theresa May's ideological power grab will hold up Brexit. It's almost like she planned it  
There's also a return to moderate projection theory: May doing this to banish headbangers and secure soft Brexit. Don't buy that either. 
Brexit & Trump were scary lessons in what can happen if you sit on your hands & leave it to someone else to vote. #election 
Pity political activists in Northern Ireland. 3 elections and a referendum in 13 months. :( 
Lack of common sense or love of autocrats? Trump congratulates Erdogan on winning referendum that will tighten his autocratic grip on Turkey 
Anyone yet modelled impact if people vote by Brexit preference > party? Oxford 70% Remain, Tory MP has majority 9,582 over remainer LibDem. 
Lib Dems hope to gain dozens of seats with anti-Brexit campaign 
Pleased to learn that the Prime Minister has called for a decisive vote in June on the future path for the Uk post Brexit. Strong leadership 
Theresa May's ideological power grab will destroy Brexit negotiations. It's almost like she planned it that way  
Theresa May calls for snap UK election for June 8, citing divisions in Westminster over Brexit  via @POLITICOEurope 
Brilliant work by @emeyersson who scrutinizes referendum vote among Kurdish Southeastern region 
#Tories call an election in the name of #Brexit, sign of disunity in #Tory party.  This needs to be about our broken public services! 
Lib Dems hope to gain dozens of seats with anti-Brexit campaign  
Food for thought for #UKIP'ers tempted to back #Tories.If you do, & they backslide on Brexit as we all know they will. It'll be your fault. 
this isn't JUST about brexit (they failed us there) - the #tories are a nasty party with nasty policies do NOT vote for them #toriesout 
This a choice between austerity, hard Brexit Tories and Corbyn’s Labour committed to transforming Britain  
News: Senior admin official says Trump offered "simple congrats" to Erdogan on referendum victory; did not raise any concerns (@JDiamond1) 
Trump called Erdogan to congratulate him on winning a referendum that will cement his autocratic rule over Turkey  
#Catalonia's VP @junqueras: if referendum is prevented from taking place, independence will be declared unilaterally  
Turkey referendum: EU urges Ankara to probe illegal vote claims  
Tories squeeze living standards, erode NHS & push UK to hard Brexit; I'll be seeking re-election as Nottingham East's Labour MP #VoteLabour 
Returning a majority of pro-indy MPs is a statement of intent that Scotland has a mandate to hold a referendum. #GE17 
Bring it on, folks. May has put the Tory party before her country one final time. Support the #LibDemFightback and let's ditch #Brexit 
The student vote better get mobilised. The current government plans - and #Brexit in particular - are desperately bad for students and unis. 
If this snap election is about giving May a mandate to carry out #Brexit as she sees fit, it equally applies to a mandate for #ScotRef. 
Another impressive Lib Dem candidate confirms she's standing in June. Interesting seat where Brexit could cause a Lib Dem gain.  
Some comfort: after her landslide, May will be less kindly disposed to her Rees-Mogg/Jenkins/Bone/Dorries lunatic fringe and soften Brexit. 
i did this for brexit ill do it now RETWEET WHEN DONE FOR BIG COVERAGE who u gonna vote for doing 3 day poll 
Voters in Georgia head to polls in race seen as a referendum on Trump  
Big question: Does the PM want a mandate for Hard Brexit against Remainers, or Parliamentary latitude for a softer Brexit against Leavers? 
So drink a shot every time you hear "Hard Brexit", and then down the beer when you hear "Soft Exit". Continue as necessary.  
The two themes - leadership and making a success of Brexit - have been fundamental to my campaign for the last five months. 
The Prime Minister stressed this morning that this General Election will be about leadership and making a success of Brexit. 
Labours Brexit voters and seats need voices in Parliament. I will seek a Labour nomination for #GeneralElection17 to represent them. 
Unbelievable-Trump congratulated Erdogan on referendum that cements his autocratic rule & erodes Turkey’s democracy  
Commentators saying Mrs May wants bigger majority to neutralise anti-EU MPs before heading towards so-called "soft Brexit".  
Yes @theresa_may miscalculated She thinks its about #brexit but it's about #Tories destroying our society #NHS #schools #Fire #Police #jc4pm 
Can't believe a word Theresa May says. She campaigned for Remain, now wants a hard Brexit. Was adamant that next election would be in 2020. 
It's going to take more than Brexit means Brexit on an election manifesto now Mrs May @theresa_may

All those 17 year-old denied their EU citzenship rights by a referendum they couldn't vote in can now vote to get it overturned. Register! 
It will almost be amusing watching our Scottish Tories trying to justify GE in June while opposing Referendum in 2018/19 total hypocrisy 
Theresa May said it'd be early for Scotland to make an informed choice on Brexit by Sping 2019. But now says the UK can in June 2017  #GE17 
Brexit is part of her day job and this will mean she can get on with her day job.  Your job is running Scotland .... when will you start ? 
Singlemost interesting thing snap election does is lock in a Tory majority before Leavers can get furious that Brexit isn't going their way 
LISTEN to @jkirchick: It’s not just Trump: With Brexit and France votes, Russia is cultivating the global right.  
I suspect they are preparing for an election that could give @NicolaSturgeon a mandate for post-Brexit Scottish independence 
Remember #ToriesOut will only happen if young people get up and vote. Learn from Brexit.... 
Less than 1 month after starting Brexit talks, UK PM May calls for a snap election. I'll be outside parliament w/ special 1 hour show. 8pCET 
Young people: You were stitched by the Brexit vote & your freedom stolen. PLEASE make sure you REGISTER to vote and VOTE. You have power 
'Brexit election' my arse. Deflection election more like, away from NHS cuts, policing cuts, social care cuts, and education cuts.

Turkish opposition CHP submits formal request to annul constitutional referendum results, @AP.  
Most interesting bit of my interview with @theresa_may is how she thinks Tory 2015 election mandate no longer applies post Brexit vote 
The NHS is fucked. Housing is fucked. Brexit is fucked. Yet people still want to vote conservative. That's fucked. 
Trump, unlike Europe, congratulates Erdogan on his referendum win in Turkey  
I'm making sure ALL my Year 13 students who are eligible, register to vote!  It's their futures at stake! #GeneralElection #NHS #Brexit  
I guess Theresa May saw the kind of authoritarian power Erdogan got in his referendum and thought: “I’ll have me some of that”. #Election 
.@mrjamesob asks: Is “the country is coming together” the new “Brexit means Brexit?”  
I'm a member of the Labour Party and I don't want 'a Brexit that works for all'. I want my party to oppose the disaster of leaving the EU.

May/Farron compromised on Brexit, Corbyn isn’t. He’s free to use Lab’s policy strength  
Deutsche Bank, one of the biggest sterling bears in recent years, says it’s changing its view. 2017 election a “game-changer” on Brexit  
Nick Clegg and Vince Cable will both stand in the general election as Lib Dems plot Brexit fightback 
Vote for Corbyn= vote for brexit. Vote tactically to remain in EU. Probably lib Dems.  
Theresa May who went from saying Brexit will be disaster, to pushing aggressively for hard Brexit. Would you trust her?  
Initially #BREXIT was ; today she says it's  Initially an Election was  and now an Election is . Obv this lady does plenty of turning..  
#BREAKING Germany hopes British election will bring 'clarity' to Brexit talks 
Needs to convince public opposition parties really trying to block Brexit but has little evidence for it, esp after amendment-less A50 bill. 
British PM May calls for early election to strengthen Brexit hand  
This election is not about #brexit we already had that. Make it about NHS,social care,destruction of public  services,poverty,housing crisis 
So... what of the Great Repeal Bill? Abandoned?Are we to be asked, again, to vote for a formless, directionless #brexit?Don't do it! 
Minister says manifesto will inc Brexit plan so under Salisbury convention + will add what they describe as 'moral pressure' (if they win)

The Treasury's scaremongering has been well and truly debunked as Britain gets on with Brexit.   
Absurd for people to claim Corbyn can't win a general election, they forget he supported the winning side in the referendum. 
really good overview of the Turkish referendum that Trump has congratulated Erdogan for:  
Unless Labour come out firmly against a ‘hard’ Brexit (and for the Single Market/FOM) they’ll definitely lose places like Cambridge.

Agreed. My MP is the excellent @rushanaraali, a Labour Remainer who voted against the Brexit bill. I'll be voting to re-elect her.  
As the EP Brexit negotiator, I will work with a new government for the best common future possible.    
Choice is between (1) hard Tory Brexit and years of right wing govt from London, or (2) an independent, fair, social democratic Scotland. 
Given that the truth was like a cork bobbing in the Pacific in the EU referendum campaign, brace yourself for a tsunami of lies until 8 June 
Retweet IF YOU WANT NIGEL FARAGE TO COME BACK AS UKIP LEADER. He is the right person to lead for the election & we need him for Brexit  
Georgia voters will deliver an early referendum, & here's why Trump & his party are worried   
I would like to see UKIP not fight any tory seats but certainly go for the rest. I support UKIP but not at the price of screwing up BREXIT 
In mid of referendum controversy & CHP decision to go to Constitutional Court, Chief Justice of CC shows up at Erdogan Palace.Reassuring.  
It is my constituency. Never voted snp b4 voted no in indyref. But govt Brexit approach spells disaster and a cynical and opportunistic GE. 
Note 'we have agreed' - who is 'we'?Opposition parties should not allow an election: May is losing the Brexit argument already.  
Only way I can see to stop #Brexit in its tracks is to vote #LibDem in #GeneralElection. Jeremy Corbyn again saying he supports it. 
Georgia voters will deliver an early referendum—Here's why Trump and his party are worried  
Mrs May will have to face the possibility that Remainers will regard the election as the second round of the referendum #generalelection 
You can still be a Labour voter, and vote #libdems.  This isn't about party politics, it's about stopping brexit. 
So two thirds (66%) is needed in parliament to approve an election, but a 52%-48% referendum determines the future of the country? Uh hu ... 
The difference between US (congratulatory) and EU (see below) reactions to the Turkish referendum could not be starker.  
Sorry. Trump's response to Turkey referendum isn't uniquely bad. See Obama on election of man responsible for Egypt's worst mass killing pic.twitter.com/zdZ5KDXHhW 
If you didn't vote in the Brexit referendum now you've got a chance to not vote in a general election, and fuck it all up again. 
FARRON: i don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the blimmin frogs gay. also, bloody brexit!LIBERALS: this is leadership 
After #EURef that saw divisive language & a post-Brexit spike in hate crime, politicians must pledge not to stir up fear & prejudice #GE2017

Diane Abbott says May has called the election because she's "panicked", as she's not going to get the things "she's promised" over Brexit.

We've seen Major, Heseltine & Ken Clarke stand up against #Brexit. They are real Tories, the present bunch are UKIP#GeneralElection2017 
Snap #GeneralElection reason simple -Tories are arrogant & Brexit going to cost UK £50bn.May wants a win before, not after, she bankrupts us 
To avoid a hard destructive Brexit & complete collapse of the NHS, no one with a conscience can vote @Conservatives in #GeneralElection 
Can we have a progressive anti-#Brexit alliance with open primaries for candidate selection? #GE17 @TheGreenParty @LibDems @LME @Labour4EU 
#GE2017 will be a choice between Theresa May's extreme #brexit and Corbyn's safe and sensible brexit. 
The pound just hit $1.27  
Tories and PM statement today was #Brexit no going back. That's music to all good Ukippers and what better than to give her that mandate 
"I believe we should remain in the EU...but now I support Brexit. I believe we shouldn't have a GE until 2020...but now I think we should"  
Angus Robertson just said calling a general election is putting party ahead of country.What was SNP wanting to call a referendum then? 
Like the EU referendum this #GeneralElection was called by #TheresaMay not for the good of Britain but the good of the Tory Party. 
He. Believes. He. Can. Win.Let that sink in.Then look for the mention of Brexit in his statement.No?Gosh.  
05- election 10- election '11- referendum (ooh 1st in yrs )'14- referendum (oh )'15- election! '16- REFERENDUM '17- ELECTION!  
We need an election now to secure the strong, stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit & beyond.  
#GeneralElection is the last opportunity to reverse Brexit before England sinks into a crappy irrelevance dragging the UK with it  
May will surely accept that as Tory success legitimises her Brexit position, SNP success legitimises case for 2nd Scot Indy referendum. 
30,960 people in South Belfast voted to remain in the EU, 69.5% of the total vote, let's send a message to the Tories no hard #brexit #GE17 
Theresa May to fight an election she said she wouldn't have on a referendum result that she campaigned against. #GE17 
Yes, the UK election will obviously be used by Remoaners to try and cancel Brexit. They will fail miserably. 
11 million people didn't vote at all in the Brexit ref. Don't let that happen this time. Make sure you have your voice listened to & VOTE 
Here is a question to those thinking opposing Brexit would result in business as usual in the EU's treatment of the UKAre you on crack? 
#LibDems gaining members at 1000 per hour after #GeneralElection called. This will become a #Brexit protest election! 
You would need a heart of stone not to laugh at IRA godfather #GerryAdams saying #GE17 is a chance to vote against #Brexit. Lol - denialism! 
#BrexitThe world is watching. Wake up to the dangerous far-right nationalist global shift happening. It must be stopped. Stay in the EU!

Post #GE17 nothing can stop a full and permanent #Brexit. The #SNP and their soulmates in #SinnFein will have to suck it up. Game over. 
Theresa gets serious with snap election that will finish off lib/labour cronies with Brexit mandate. Tim Farron calls his mummy  
Why Theresa May's panicked: Brexit will be a nightmare and living  standards will be squeezed by prices rising faster than wages 
This general election will be known as the Brexit general election. A Conservative win will give Gov't a CLEAR mandate for a CLEAN BREXIT! 
Well done Prince William for speaking up about the risk to our mental health from another 8 weeks of incessant #Brexit arguments. 
But I thought 142% of the British people oppose Brexit, AC? Surely an election is a good way to find out?  
Really thrilled to announce that my new project #brexpats on Britons resident in EU post-Brexit is one of these 25 projects @SociologyGold 
Am I right in thinking she voted against at Brexit too ?  
10 months post-EUref, still no Brexit plan. No costs assessment of where PM plans will lead us. Instead, as Art50 tick tocks ,a #GE called. 
Me in June after there has been 2 general elections, 2 labour leadership contests, and a referendum in the space of 2 years  
I mean, that's clearly not true if she's calling for an early election and plastering her face and Brexit all over it.  
Turkey should investigate referendum vote 'irregularities', says EU commission  
Make no mistake this General Election is as much about England keeping Scotland's resources for Brexit bargaining than anything else. 
DO I VOTE TORIE OR CONSERVATIVE FOR BREXIT (via the mental Brexit Facebook group as per)  
Nothing on the single most important issue facing the country. This is the Brexit election. Millions of us oppose it.  
.@UKLabour are finally going to have to state their position on Brexit and immigration after months of fudging it. Could be fireworks! #GE17

Don't vote for an election David. It's a desperate trick by May because she is losing the #Brexit fight - &under Corbyn it would be suicide.  
Plaid only good choice for Remain voters. Labour have no clear stance on Brexit, Lib Dems have proven inability to keep Tories in check.

No to the Tories, no to #Brexit. Give us our country back.

'The country is coming together but Westminster is not' really is a remarkable statement. #Brexit vote was 52/48.... 
General election is a final chance to save the UK from Brexit. Pro-EU politicians and electorate must stand together in a new EU alliance.  
Theresa May's statement "We will regain control of our money" did we join the Euro, and nobody told me? #brexit

Will media hold Tory feet to fire on wages, housing, deficit, services? No - because they will be transfixed by latest shiney thing: Brexit. 
Any election or referendum outcomes not in line with the media establishment= Meddling by Russia  
The #GeneralElection is a vote on Brexit.If you want to stay in the EU, don't vote for a party that supports Brexit.Brexit can be stopped. 
If you want to stop brexit please vote lib dem, however you normally vote, this is your chance. Some things are more important. 
Clueless Corbyn's election statement makes no mention of Brexit or immigration. Out of touch!  
Gonna be really interesting to see what happens when Theresa May and the rest of her Brexit hoax will lose the elections. 
Decision not only ruthless, reckless & selfish, also highly disruptive: how can civil service prepare Brexit during strict election purdah?

British people's LAST CHANCE to stop #Brexit. All pro-European parties should unite and stand up for Europe! @timfarron 
Theresa May clarifies how divisions at Westminster stand in the way of a clean BREXIT. Strong speech, worth reading.  
Snap GE in effect means we get a 2nd referendum, a 2nd chance! Don't waste it, get out and vote. Let's make a real difference & remain in EU  
Glenn Campbell - "Will you seek a mandate for a second referendum"?Nicola Sturgeon - "I HAVE a mandate" 
I make no apology for saying I want to see strongest possible anti-Brexit campaign run this GE,& manifestos which spell out cold,hard facts. 
As Jeremy Corbyn welcomes the PM's election decision, this is how the polls have changed since the EU referendum  
Uniting behind Brexit a bit hard if you think it’s shit  
Labour needs to recognise it made mistake and give electorate a chance to oppose the #Brexit disaster. Libdems in Coalition sunk NHS, FFS. 
Four #Brexit lies brazenly repeated by @theresa_may in her speech announcing Theresa May today. See thread. 
Errh 'Now not the time for independence referendum, we should be putting all our energies into getting a good deal with EU' #GeneralElection

Just donated to @LibDems because they are the only anti-#Brexit party: will support any Labour or Tory who joins anti-Brexit fight. 
More this election is about housing, pay, services, not Brexit, better Labour will do. Which is y other parties will talk about little else 
This isn't the time for #indieref2 said Theresa May. But somehow there's time for a general election while she's meant to negotiate Brexit 
For a better Brexit, for proper funding of our NHS and for the best education system I'll be campaigning for a @UKLabour government. 
Since the referendum we have limped from one decision to the next with no direction, to be successful we need a change of government #GE17 
In my dreams Jeremy Corbyn resigns today, @SadiqKhan becomes leader, campaigns on platform to reverse Brexit and is elected Prime Minister. 
Politicians telling us the general election "is not about brexit".Guess what?The voters decide what its about. 
Labour will I think be the only Party who won't Campaign almost exclusively on Brexit. Huge opportunity - many voters are fed up of Brexit 
Regardless of what happens in the next few years, Brexit is going to make one hell of a musical one day. Our version of Hamilton. 
64%of 18-24 year olds voted in the Referendum. 90% of over 65 year olds voted . Register vote #GeneralElection 
So May gets to fight this election on the non-specific hope of what Brexit could deliver, rather than the measurable reality of what it did. 
Brexit Sec. David Davis on @theJeremyVine show followed by John Farnham's You're the Voice. Surely World Shut Your Mouth more appropriate? 
This #GeneralElection has to be a referendum on the NHS. #ToriesOut 
It's my fault. Last time I was in Britain a referendum gave us Brexit. Then I went to the US & Trump happened. Now I come home and… #sorry 
Democrats are trying to turn a congressional election in Georgia into a referendum on President Trump. (More: ) pic.twitter.com/yXVGIp60On 
Labour sources: Tony Blair is likely to campaign hard for whoever opposes #brexit 
Trump Is Making the GOP Heinously Unpopular Again#Brexit #ThingsOnlyWomenWritersHear #TaxDay #morningjoe 
Looking forward to being offered a choice between a hard Brexit, a soft Brexit and a no Brexit. 
Obvious why May is going for #GeneralElection now - before gory details about Brexit are revealed to public. Opposition MUST counter this 
On June 8th, we have a chance to reject #Brexit & resurrect public services. Young people need to register now. Labour MUST reject #Brexit 
If you want to avoid a disastrous Hard Brexit, this is your chance! #GeneralElection  
Brexit matters more than anything else at the mo.  It will have to be LibDem  
The pound has risen against both the dollar and the Euro on news that Mrs May is seeking a new mandate to implement Brexit. 
UK calls for snap election in June. Great chance to revisit that Brexit decision...*searches for anti-Brexit party*Never mind then. 
French Presidential election, UK #GeneralElection, French legislative elections, German elections, Brexit negotiations. I'm tired already.  
Election has nothing to do with stability, but a play for power & control that will diminish our ability to hold to Brexit plan to account. 
Trump calls Erdogan congratulates him over Turkish referendum  
The PM called an election to get a Hard Brexit mandate. The SNP & Lib Dems know that's what the election is about. I hope Labour does too. 
#Reward offered - peaceful #CitizensArrest ex #BritishPM #WarCriminal #TonyBlair #WarCrimes #Iraq#BREXIT #Election 
Labour has to ditch Corbyn and unite with the Lib Dems NOW to fight #Brexit. 
Ireland, Denmark and the Netherlands are keen for the Brexit talks to move on to trade as quickly as possible  
Theresa May's second referendum on Brexit is less democratic and will give her less of a mandate.  
Dear Nigel,Break is OVER.Got bigger fish to catch.UK goes for snap election.#Brexit must be guarded!All Brexiteers.#GeneralElection 
It is beyond parody that @jeremycorbyn avoids mentioning #BREXIT in his response to the PM.  
This election about providing Stability & Certainty as @Number10gov rightly says. Chance to back a Brexit Government & to kick out opponents 
May wants a mandate for Brexit etc. But election likely to give @NicolaSturgeon one too for next referendum. 
There is a clear choice at #ge17. A destructive Tory gov intent on a hard Brexit vs a Lab gov that will work for the many, not the few (2/2) 
What are the odds Trump wd've hugged Erdogan for stealing Turkey's referendum w/out Trump Tower Istanbul? Our Emoluments suit follows the $ 
aye call a general election before people realise the full extent of brexit n how much the tories have truly fucked us over 
Cameron calls a referendum and resigns. May triggers Article 50 then calls an election. Conservatives are the party of cowards. 
Trump congratulates Erdogan on referendum win despite concerns over fairness   
Make sure you are registered. Send a stronger message back to those who are in favour of Brexit. Another chance to make your vote count.  
Reckless Brexit offers nothing to the people of the North who voted to Remain in the EU last June & will do so again 
Mate, he supports Brexit  
The Fixed Term Parliament Act was introduced precisely to prevent governments exploiting temporary blips in popularity.#Brexit #Remain 
Govt pushing for a hard brexit that people did not vote for, we need a clear vision for the country that has been voted for by the people 
How long until Nigel Farage announces that he's standing in this general election to defend his Brexit? 
In the unlikely event the winning party had  'no brexit' or '2nd referendum' in its manifesto that'd likely overturn the referendum.  
I've said since the day after the referendum that May should call for a GE cause she'd walk it. I think that's what's going to happen. 
Labour won't stop Brexit.Labour won't stand up for Wales.Labour can't win this.This time, a vote for Labour is a vote wasted.Vote Plaid. 
Admission today @Number10gov can't deliver #Brexit with 52%!Do #vote on June 8th. Vote for Europe 
Dear @jeremycorbyn Promise to stop Brexit, and you will win. Sincerely,Everyone 
"Now is the time" to say no to the Tory of a catastrophic "no deal" cliff edge Brexit strop. #GeneralElection2017 
Remember how we, the 56% majority, felt in wake of #Brexit ref & concerns since? Good, now get out & register to vote Much is at stake #GE17 
Anyone with a brain knows that, Matt. A hard Brexit and deeper cuts are Tory party policy. It is, therefore, moving the UK to the right. 
They know a "no deal" Brexit strop is on the cards, so they're going to get themselves reelected before the economic ruination kicks in.  
"A lower risk of a very disruptive Brexit" - analysts react to UK's snap election announcement  
No mention of Brexit in a statement responding to an election which has been called to better implement a hard Brexit *sighs*  
I was wrong to calculate May would put country before party over Brexit plan. Her "me" election will deliver short term gain she will regret 
The Brexit bill passed in the Commons by 498 votes to 114. The government already has a gigantic political mandate for it. 
#GE17 won't distract from standing up for the people of Dundee against hard Tory Brexit & even more right wing austerity agenda #VoteSNP 
This is a chance to stop brexit and #fightback register to vote and make a difference. Join a Pro EU party TODAY. 
The Erdogan effect: #Turkey package holiday prices keep falling following referendum. 1 week ALL inclusive now for 399€.  
Ruth Davidson says her party will fight this election on opposing a "divisive plan for a second referendum".  
Yep. He can say he's all hugs and butterflies but at the end of the day he's taking a good hard brexit right up him.  
It was Hitchcock, who directed Brexit: first an earthquake and the tension rises. 
I look forward to being part of a clear majority delivering #Brexit. Every vote for the @Conservatives will make our country stronger. 
Well, there's an announcement to drag me back. PM May says country is "coming together" over Brexit. Where is the evidence for that exactly? 
For Scotland, this is a single-issue election: should there be a second independence referendum?  by @alexmassie 
Once again a Tory PM puts party before country w/ snap election on May's hard Brexit stance @EalingLabour will fight hard on this & on NHS! 
THERESA MAY: “The choice is simple; vote for an imaginary perfect Brexit now or deal with the reality of a failed Brexit in 2020. Simples.” 
In case you are wondering why Theresa May talked so much about Brexit #Election2017 
June. Impossible to mobilise students/young people, who also happen to be some of biggest opponents to Brexit and Conservative values... 
I’m voting for whichever Party campaigns to stop Brexit. And that’s that. 
Time for #progressivealliance to beat Brexit. We did it in #richmondpark. Now it must be repeated across England 
Fighting Brexit tooth, nail and butt-plug is the most important issue to me. You may have different concerns. Great. Vote for them. 
I'm launching campaign as Ealing Central & Acton Lib Dem parliamentary candidate. Electing Lib Dem MPs is only way to stop May's hard Brexit  
May says she wants #GeneralElection because 'division in Westminster will risk our ability to make Brexit a success' 
Looking forward to General Election on June 8th. Will be out campaigning for every vote for a stronger UK and to make a success of Brexit. 
A snap election will give Theresa May the ultimate mandate to deliver #Brexit, writes @asabenn #premium 
RT if you agree #GeneralElection #JuneElection - I'll be voting for any party that will stop #Brexit #EU4ME 
People wait in line in front of Turkish electoral board HQ in Ankara to appeal widespread referendum irregularities. 
No matter what you think of May, Tories, Brexit, what's worse than PM Corbyn and his friends from Hamas who wrap suicide belts around kids. 
So Theresa May is going to call a general election. Let's turn it into a referendum on Brexit! Get organised. 
Difficult to see how May can resist second independence referendum if Scottish voters give SNP a mandate. #whatpricetheunion? 
You just can't say you need a mandate for Brexit when you've ALREADY PASSED ARTICLE 50 BY A HUGE MAJORITY. 
As long as Corbyn backs Brexit & as long as Labour backs Corbyn, the Lib Dems are the only force than can stop Britain committing Brexicide. 
She was Remain, now Brexit. She said no snap election, now calls an election. I guess that's why she's called Theresa May, not Theresa Will. 
If you're aged 18-30 REGISTER TO VOTE NOW!! Make your voice heard & help prevent a massive Tory majority crashing the UK into a hard Brexit!  
This #GeneralElection is about Brexit, just Brexit. So if you don't want Brexit vote #LibDem #SNP #Green #Plaid or #SinnFein 
Jeremy Corbyn has only a remote chance of winning. And that's by playing an anti-Brexit hand. But he won't. 
I'm sorry, did Theresa May say there was more unity behind Brexit in the country than in parliament? Is she high? 
Why would you vote for this moron? Lies lies lies. Stop Brexit today. Don't vote conservative #GeneralElection 
It's going to be very interesting campaign.  All those clips of May arguing against Brexit. And promising there would not be an early #GE17 
With young people coming out to vote against Brexit, Tories can be defeated #GeneralElection 
There are so many more important things this country has to focus on rather than a cheap vanity project like Brexit. 
Voters in Georgia head to polls in race seen as a referendum on Trump  
"Reopen the divisions of the referendum." When did they ever heal? 
GE as scheduled in 2020 wld have allowed vote in knowledge of actual Brexit deal. This is voting blind - to give May a blank Brexit cheque 
For decades, the EU dangled the possibility of membership for Turkey. The referendum is likely to end such talk.  
A snap #GeneralElection election to legitimize a Tory #Brexit. If you value our #NHS and reject increased #foodbankuse GET OUT AND vote! 
#GE2017 is a chance to flag the need for a Brexit for Defence that keeps us out of EU defence and procurement union.  
Completely cynical by Tories. extreme Brexit plans are a shambles and are playing for time.Only @Plaid_Cymru will protect Wales #CymruAmByth 
Also, as the Tories were a SMOKING, BELCHING LIE FACTORY leading up to Brexit vote, shame on you if you believe their promises now. 
I think although a UKIP voter , I will vote for May we can't afford to weaken the vote for a Proper Brexit 
PM seeks mandate for hardest form of Brexit possibe. Lib Dems will fight her all the way. #snapelection 
If May had any form of real opposition, she wouldn't be calling a General Election. Corbyn has handed her this, and Brexit, on a plate. 
am a bit stupid when it comes to politics. can anyone tell me if this election could potentially reverse the catastrophic Brexit decision? 
Let's use #GE17 as an opportunity to make the case for an independent Scotland different from the right-wing isolationist hard Tory Brexit 
To ensure Brexit and address the key issues facing UK like immigration, I don't see any alternative other than to vote Conservative. 
Given the chance to fight for Labour values - on Brexit or anything else - I'll do it. 
What does the General Election mean for Brexit? Theresa May calls snap vote:  #Brexit #May #politicalclass #EU 
Yep, you guessed it right.. Tim Farron crawls out of the woodwork calling for #Brexit sabotage.WIPE the LibDems! 
May actually said we will be able to "control our own money" after Brexit.She said that. Her strategy is #dogwhistling to thick people 
Nicola Sturgeon: 'General Election move designed to force through hard Brexit' 
Thinking of five more years of hard-brexit Tories #generalelection #despair 
Y'know.  If someone was to come out now, within the next 48 hours, on a firm stance of overturning Brexit.  They'd probably get my vote. 
I’m pro gay marriage & pro choice; but you have to VOTE and vote smart. Otherwise people like Trump win over people like Hillary. Or BREXIT. 
Hard Brexit or Corbyn - your marvellous election choice 
Snap election plans push sterling above its 200-day moving average for the first time since the Brexit vote  
Don't make ur decision based on Brexit. There's the NHS, Education, Welfare. All public services that the tories are slowly dismantling. 
Media role in this election is crucial, it is not just about Brexit,but the failings of Govt on NHS,Welfare,Education,Prison Service etc,etc 
Come on, give me someone to vote for. Be Anti-Brexit. Tell me your plan for the NHS, for education, for the climate, and for housing. 
Make no mistake, this is a second referendum, for or against hard nationalist imperial nostalgia Brexit. Vote accordingly. 
May has won all the key votes on Brexit in Westminster, yet wants a "mandate" because she's losing in Brussels. #clusterf2ckmageddon2 
Speaking of the UKIP voters, I'm currently giving odds of 1,000,000-1 that tories will announce their Brexit immigration plans before June 8 
Let's not have the same argument we did about #Brexit and blame the older people for ruining our future. Register to vote! #GeneralElection 
Somebody could have told Mrs May that running for Prime Minister entails taking responsibility for Brexit. 
If you are under 25 & were saddened by Brexit, please, PLEASE register to vote. Only then will you be taken seriously as a demographic. 
This election is a fight for the future of Britain after Brexit - and Conservative failure on economy, incomes, health, schools and housing 
EU says Brexit plans unchanged by British election call: AFP 
Scotland's First Minister says Conservatives "see a chance to move the UK to the right, force through a hard Brexit and impose deeper cuts" 
If Labour Party promised a SECOND VOTE on EU deal in government, would you VOTE for Labour on 8th Jun 2017? #poll #brexit #article50 #GE2017 
Ha!NI is in chaosSNP want IndyRef 2Brexit is a shamblesTM had a bright ideaLet's have a GE - that'll distract them all !!#PMcantcope 
Interesting that by focusing so much on Europe, the PM has effectively turned this into another EU referendum 
May's tone & content directed at hard #Brexit  voters across (mostly) England.  Her Tory party now almost indistinguishable from UKIP 
Quite how this will "unite Westminster" is beyond me #GE2017 #brexit 
JUST IN: Scotland's Sturgeon says May's Conservatives seeking to 'force through a hard Brexit and impose deeper cuts' with election  
This might be the most fluid general election in recent history.Party loyalty secondary to what position on Brexit will sway voters. 
So the Scots can't have a referendum because it is too disruptive for Brexit - but we can have a #GeneralElection? 
Cynical - GE chosen at worst possible moment for the young who will be hit by #brexit  when away at University + exams. Parents - help them 
The universe needs a referendum right now 
#brexitelection my early view: huge opp for Lib Dems to grab remainers. Tories must appeal to working class Brexit voters, labour irrelevant 
When will pre-election purdah begin and civil servants begin to down tools...? And what impact on preparations for Brexit negotiations? 
Winning a GE gives PM the mandate & authority she needs especially for Brexit negotiations. TM no Gordon Brown! She is brave & principled 
"We need a general election and we need one now" - Theresa May says an early election will help to ensure stability for #Brexit  
This election will be the SNP vs the Tories. Hard Brexit vs a vision of a prosperous fairer Scotland in the European mainstream. #VoteSNP 
EU27 position on Brexit is fixed. Bigger majority for Theresa May does not mean a better deal will be on offer. 
4 SNP #GE17 messages in Sturgeon's response:Against the Tories, against hard Brexit, against austerity, for Scotland.  
British people's LAST CHANCE to stop #Brexit. All pro-European parties should unite and stand up for Europe! 
RT Who are you voting for in the general election? #GeneralElection #TheresaMay #Brexit #DowningStreet RT ONCE VOTED!  
Let's do the same for Ireland. Tories have ignored our expressed democratic will & their Brexit crusade plunges all of Ireland into disaster  
Now is not the time for a referendum says May but we can have a general election. Double standards. Scotland will make its own judgement. 
My MP @CatherineWest1 defied the 3-line whip to vote against Brexit and called for Livingstone's expulsion. No political dilemmas for me. 
You'd know all about being politically brave wouldn't you. I thought it was paticularly brave how you ran away after calling the referendum. 
Theresa May says this snap General Election is a referendum on her Hard Brexit. If you oppose Hard Brexit this is your chance to stop it. 
Turkey expects apology from Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe for sending PKK supporter to observe constitutional referendum.  
Paul Nuttall: Back UKIP for Clean Brexit and proper border controls.  
General Election 2017Tories: hard BrexitLabour: soft BrexitLib Dems: no BrexitDaily Mail: Legs-it  
Labour's response. Interesting no mention of Brexit  
Yuck. Other OSCE observers also turn out to be PKK-YPG-HDP-friendly. Both US and EU were waiting for OSCE report to comment on referendum.  
The Tories are fully aware of the disastrous coming economic consequences of #Brexit in 2019/20, & are trying to get off the hook. #GE2017 
Ankara: Hundreds gathered in front of the Supreme Election Board to submit referendum cancelation petitions.  
Brave? Says the coward yielded to UKIP and Back bench MPs and then left when #Brexit hit the fan.  #generalelection 
Civil service contact texts: "DExEU will get their dream of no civil servants talking to non-civil servants about Brexit" (under purdah) 
PM May would likely score big win if June vote-but result would reflect Labour Party weakness more than widespread public support for Brexit 
Corbyn's statement doesn't mention Brexit.  Very brave... #GeneralElection 
The French presidential vote will matter way more for the outcome of the #Brexit negotiations than the #June8 general elections in the UK. 
What's so painful is that Labour's drama is now going to be converted into an election result that's interpreted as endorsement of Brexit 
Me: You know what? After Trump and Brexit, I really need a break from being elbow-deep in politics talk all the time.Theresa May: lol no 
Theresa May confirms Brexit is a disaster by calling for a general election 
Only way Corbyn has a chance? Turn around and say 'we get in, we overturn Brexit! We stay'. It's a shits trick but his only chance. #GE 
A short post from last summer (written just after the referendum) on how the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 works  
Why don't Labour mention Brexit? There is no way this is not all about Brexit.  
If Labour ditched Corbyn, opposed Brexit and formed pact with LDs and Greens, I honestly think they (or coalition) would walk this election 
#UKIP had my support for 16 years but on June general election I will be voting conservative and will be pushing for a hard #Brexit 
Early election before consequences of Brexit have kicked in and opposition is in disarray.  Theresa May will get a full mandate to rule. 
May calls for U.K. elections, which means either undoing #brexit or making it harder by shortening times. I wish the #UK all the best. 
Come out against Brexit or you're doomed 
I see you Theresa. Destroy Labour, grab the UKIP vote, potentially get a Scottish seat and secure power after Brexit. #GeneralElection 
This election is about #Brexit. Start talking about it. Come out against it. Otherwise you have no chance of even making a dent. 
"A second referendum in 18-24 months is bad and divisive.""We're having an election in a few weeks. Vote for me. Bye!"- Theresa May 
Of course this GE will be a proxy war for other campaigns - the Tories will be refighting Brexit, the SNP Indyref, and Labour 1983. 
Before everyone says they'll vote Lib Dem because of brexit can you please remember that Tim Farron is pro-life and thinks gay sex is sinful 
This is a very, very simple election in Scotland. Vote to kick the Tories out of Scotland for good. Vote for a second indy referendum. 
Ok it's very clear -if you voted to #Remain you now have your second referendum in a form of #GE to vote @LibDems & stop #Brexit 
I'm UKIP but will vote Tory for the first time ever to bolster Brexit. UKIP are not the challengers in my constituency. 
Lib Dems appeal for votes to deny 'disastrous hard Brexit' after PM calls for early General Election  
Any1 going brexit and beyond thurs?x  
Theresa May:2016 - "Remain"2017 -"Brexit"2017 - "No election"2017 - "Election."2017 - "As a Christian..."2018 - "I'm a Hindu" 
In which Corbyn says nothing about Brexit.  
May's election grab is as treacherous as turkey"s referendum for democracy in Britain.#labour 
#TheresaMay has called a #GeneralElection. We must reject her, reject #ToryBritain and reject #brexit. Save the #NHS #education #welfare 
Hopefully May's complacency and arrogance calling this election will snatch her wig like it did Cameron's with Brexit  #GeneralElection 
I predicted it. She would not want an election in 2020 after a distrust damaging Brexit.  That's why she has  gone early.  
I am voting Lib Dem- the only party that can stop this Brexit madness before it is too late 
BREXIT PART 2 - THE REFERENDUM STRIKES BACK. More racism, bolder bigots, bigger lies in the sequel literally no-one wanted. COMING SOON. 
"It would be unfair for Scots to have a 2nd indy referendum until Brexit terms are clear."*1 Month Later*"SNAP GENERAL ELECTION LOL!" 
2015 General Election2016 EU Referendum/change of PM2017 General Election#makeitstop 
I get saying "I'll never vote for X because they did Y" but at this stage I'd vote for the Borg if it'd help stop Brexit. 
May can't pretend this is about Brexit - it's about Labour's poor opinion poll ratings. She thinks it's her opportunity but it's Scotland's. 
Could it be that she wants to secure power now before the wider public wake up to the shambles of Brexit? 
My apolitical friends already texting me asking who to vote for to overturn Brexit. 
Forget what you've heard - this is all that matters now. A Better Britain, or a Bitter Brexit - you decide. #GeneralElection 
Lib Dems seem remarkably ready as Theresa May puts her plans to quit European Union to the vote. #Brexit Referendum Mark II here we go.  
#Millennials-Stop The #Tories. If you guys #vote- you'll own the dealThis is YOUR future.#Brexit #GeneralElection 
need to get Farage in the commons this year! Need to make sure Brexit is done properly! 
And if SNP do fall back in terms of seats at #GE2017, Tories will most likely claim support for a 2nd independence referendum is receding. 
This is the Brexit election. Conservatives think Labour is cornered. Labour U-turn on Brexit would change the game but seems inconceivable. 
If Theresa May wins she will claim personal mandate for grammar schools, hard Brexit & little Britain. She must be stopped. #GeneralElection 
We won't let Theresa May turn this into a Referendum on Brexit. This election will be aboutNHSChildcareRailHousing CrisisWagesSchools 
This is not as absurd as it may seem. An unambivalent death-or-glory "we'll stop Brexit happening campaign" could get LDs a *lot* of seats.  
If, as May says, the calling of a General Election is to create certainty over Brexit then what we have, in essence, is a second referendum. 
We need one anti-Brexit candidate in each seat. LibDems shd take lead - eg give Greens clear run in Brighton & Chukka Umunna in Streatham 
British PM Theresa May calls early election June 8 to win bigger mandate as she deals with complex Brexit from EU 
before you go voting lib dem on the basis of avoiding brexit, ask a student how much their promises are worth 
May is striking at a prime moment -- before Brexit goes south, while UKIP is weak, and while Corbynism is in recession. 
Theresa May wants the freedom to create a low tax, low welfare Tory #Brexit tax haven, and Corbyn is doing everything to help her.#Remain 
Never has it been more important for Labour to stand together & fight.This General Election is a mandate for a hard #Brexit #ToriesMustGo 
‘There is suspicion that up to 2.5mn Turkish votes were manipulated’ – Intl observer on referendum  
May's epic gamble. She could walk away with a bigger mandate. It's up to us to mobilise and stop her and #brexit - so everyone, let's do it! 
#GeneralElection called because TheresaMay running scared that Commons would ultimately reject her #brexit deal. Let's hope her gamble fails 
This isn't about a "mandate for Brexit", this is about having a big enough majority for their planned bonfire of your rights & protections 
So @theresa_may has admitted she (1) has no mandate for #Brexit "plan" (2) has realised it's WTF complicated & probably undeliverable 
In manifesto if SNP win majority of seats in Scotland, mandate for independence. No need for referendum. GE is the indyref. 
'I mean what I say & I say what I mean' #theresamay #elections #GeneralElection #brexit  
Theresa May wants to make this an election another Brexit vote. It's not, it's about a lot more, it's about decent schools, NHS and fair pay  
Theresa May announces snap general election on June 8th - 2nd EU Referendum:  #Brexit #EU #Generalelection 
PM essentially wanting a mandate to wreck UK economy. Determined to hard Brexit whatever deal emerges from negotiations. 
#TheresaMay effectively pressed #Brexit pause button. #EU will agree negotiating position on Friday week but no-one to talk to until June 9! 
“If you want to avoid a disastrous Hard Brexit. If you want to keep Britain in the Single Market... this is your chance." @timfarron 
Every young person in the UK who didn't go out and vote in the referendum needs to register immediately. Your future is literally at stake. 
I hope Sky News has room on screen for an election countdown clock AND a Brexit countdown clock. 
There's only one realistic aim for Remainers at the general election: a coalition government that will reverse Brexit or allow a 2nd ref. 
If you didn't vote in the referendum because "it won't matter" VOTE IN THIS ELECTION. AS YOU CAN SEE, YOUR VOTE DOES COUNT. 
david cameron: brexit- resignedtheresa may: brexit- called a general electionim sensing a pattern here 
June 8th is a simple referendum on Brexit and the Tories' destruction of the NHS. 
Instant Farron statement - vote libdem if you don't want a hard/any Brexit - vs 'not quite sure when Labour will respond'. 
Tories want the exln to be about Corbyn and May; LibDems want it to be about Brexit; Labour want it to be about ______? 
I will vote for a binbag full of lawn clippings if it has a coherent anti-brexit stance. 
So Ms May has called a British General Election. Sinn Féin is up 4 that! Another chance 2 vote against Brexit & 4 progress. 
"This General Election is not about Brexit" says Iain Duncan Smith  
You seen what they’re doing to this country? To the NHS, services, the poor, the disabled, schools, their crazy hard Brexit... 
If I have this right: May says Scotland can't vote on independence before Brexit details known ... but ok for UK to vote. HT @plegrain 
Only one thing can stop Brexit. Every Labour voter votes LibDem and some Tories stay at home. A scenario about as likely as, er, Trump. 
"United in Westminster" Chilling words. May running scared of being held to account on Brexit + trying to turn UK into elective dictatorship 
This is the same Theresa May who said it would be unfair for the Scots to vote until the Brexit terms were clear  
Left-Green-SNP coalition please against Conservatives, against austerity, against cuts to #NHS & all public services & against "hard brexit" 
Nicola Sturgeon will of course want to clarify Scotland's Brexit position.I assume her announcement is soon. 
If you're a young person that complained about "old people voting brexit" then get off your fucking arse and vote this time. 
#GE17 Time shut up Labour & Lib Dems trying to derail Brexit non stop every day, Corbyn & Farron could not organise a piss up in a brewery 
Theresa May might see a general election as referendum on Brexit. In Scotland it will be a treated as a referendum on independence 
May says Scots can't vote in #indyref2 before knowing what kind of #Brexit she delivers. But she wants UK to vote before Brexit mess exposed 
Wherever you live, however unlikely unseating your Brexit-supporting MP might be, vote against them & urge everyone you know to do likewise. 
I agree with @robdelaney -if you use NHS/want schools 2 have funding or dread Brexit...do not vote Tory! 
Reasonably timed Scottish independence referendum Snap election aimed to only benefit the Tories   
Also worth mentioning that those who can see all the details have called this election because they KNOW the Brexit shambles to come. 
Part of me thinks #TheresaMay wants to lose her majority so she can resign and get the hell out of this #Brexit mess...  
PLAN: all Brexit opponent MPs break away and form a 4th party and win election in a landslide. 
Theresa May calls for snap election amid #Brexit negotiations  
To recap, in the year after Brexit: the PM resigns, the Chancellor is sacked, the opposition implodes and fresh elections are called 
May has given us a chance to stand up to #Brexit. Candidates need to stand on a genuine pro-EU platform #GeneralElection 
2 weak leaders1 party backing hard brexit1 party in disarrayGeneral public very divided (not along party lines)FPTP: unfit for purpose. 
Making Brexit the election theme so people are distracted from the domestic policies that will crush health, education and raise poverty. 
Has Theresa May called snap election 2 clarify uncertainty over Brexit, Scotland or Ireland? No - she's cashing in on Labour weakness. Shame 
Lots of Scots will be asking why 'now is the time' for a general election, but not a Scottish independence referendum 
The aim must be a coalition government that will either reverse Brexit or ensure a 2nd referendum. 
Theresa May's Brexit election will be on the same day Orwell's 1984 was published (June 8) - Dystopiatastic 
May said “division in Westminster” was a risk to making "a success of Brexit,” in her surprise speech.  
- refuses snap election- initiates brexit so it's too late to go back- alright we're already sinking who wants to drive?  
So May calling election because other parties oppose her Brexit plans. 'There should be unity in Westminster' she says. Ludicrous suggestion 
You have one choice in this election: stop hard Brexit or rubber stamp Britain's future as a low wage tax haven for the rich. 
This is a repeat referendum on Europe.  Will be seen as that in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Looks like break up of Britain Brexit style. 
It's almost as if they want to get an election out of the way before the consequences of Brexit start to become apparent 
Cameron did Brexit as a gamble, lost. May was like "Yes I'll press on with that shit idea." Vote, get others to vote & don't vote Tory. 
So we have a general election on June 8th. Theresa May wants a mandate for a hard Brexit, a privatised NHS & more suffering. #ToriesOut 
GE June 8th. This is not about Brexit this is about our healthcare, education, jobs....Let's FINALLY get rid of the toxic tories#JC4PM 
For Theresa May to make this Election a Referendum on EU is an insult to NHS Patients, Insecure Workers & those struggling with Childcare 
So Scots can't have a referendum because we don't know the results of Brexit negotiations, but we can have a General Election. 
Polls on that are unquivocal: most Scots do not want another referendum. That is a tough starting point for SNP campaign. 
May didn't just call a snap election, she called a 2nd ref on BrexitUSE IT.Your MP for a term is less important than Brexit forever. 
"Now is not the Time" lol ..... any General Election definitely means game-on for an Independence Referendum #scotref #NowIsTheTime :))) 
It's a brexit election. Time to put aside party loyalty and vote #remain if you are a remainer! And that means Libdems! 
Corbyn will vote for an election which hands a massive majority to the Tories & hard #Brexit. Then he will resign - job done.#Remain 
Early election transforms Brexit talks. 1) Mandate 2) More transition options 3) More time for trade deal. Shifts pol judgement day to 2022 
Theresa May whose word is her bond wants a cut&run election after all.NHS,schools&Brexit talks in chaos & economy in trouble.What a surprise 
I'm now dreading the prospect of listening to the Lib Dems banging on about resisting Brexit for the next eight weeks. 
What Brexit opponents? If there were Brexit opponents we'd vote for them  
All you 17yr olds who were livid about brexit and not having a voice, you will be 18 now, time to take the Tories out. 
General Election 8 June. Thank you Theresa May for giving us a chance to show you that we are NOT behind you. #brexit  
This is the last thing Nicola Sturgeon needs. In Scotland, this election will become a referendum on whether or not to hold indyref2. 
Expect the dirtiest and most biased campaign ever from the RW press to protect their Brexit. 
So May effectively admits Brexit is going badly & will become unpopular so wants to win an election now to have 5 years more regardless. 
Having announced "Brexit means Brexit", PM May admits to having exhausted her political know-how, & calls for a snap general election. 2017.  
If you are anti-Brexit use your vote.  
Tories will clearly win but if there's a big swing to LibDems it'll send a clear message re Brexit. Every Remainer should vote #LibDems 
May says she's calling an election "with reluctance" but UK needs stability in Brexit talks  
May's reasoning is somewhat spurious given that she has not come close to defeat on any matter to do with Brexit 
Cameron: Let's have an EU referendum because we know they'll vote RemainMay: Let's have a snap election because we know they'll vote Tory 
Snap polls soon after a referendum - #Greece a trendsetter for European politics yet again 
May's reason for #GeneralElection is 'the opposition don't agree with me and I want to ram through extreme #Brexit' Terrifying... 
There we have it. Anyone in Labour, LDs, Green or anyone else who opposes Hard Brexit needs to fight now. Your money, your time, your brains 
This is quite smart from Theresa May.UKIP 'floaters' will flock to the Tories to ensure Brexit continues as is.Labour is dead. 
Surely the Lib-Dems’ biggest ever chance, no? A single-issue campaign, parroting anti-Brexit until they’re hoarse. Nothing else for it. 
If UKIP voters want the best #Brexit outcome they need to back #TheresaMay in #GeneralElection2017 
Vote anyone but tory. Vote for whoever is most likely to oust a #tory in your constituency. Vote against #Brexit Madness. | #GeneralElection 
So, Cameron bailed after giving the referendum, Farage bailed after winning it, and now May is bailing after triggering article 50?Sound. 
May calls for elections so when the Brexit debacle becomes obvious  to all, she can pass the blame to the electorate; "they voted for it" 
"Let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability." - Theresa May, introducing new uncertainty and instability with post #Brexit vote 
It's on, folks. May has put the TorybParty before her country one final time. Bring on the #LibDemFightback and let's ditch #Brexit 
If a snap election is the "only way to ensure stability", May must have an even gloomier view of the Brexit tumult to come than we suspected 
So i guess there's now only 16 months for Brexit negotiations ... 
The rumours were true.Lib Dems have got my vote being the only Anti Brexit party around. 
May translated: We've made a mess with #Brexit and we need the voters to clean up our mess. 
I think Theresa May wants to lose her majority so she can resign and get the hell out of the Brexit mess. 
Sorry Mrs May, it's #Brexit that is weakening UK, it's what you said would happen during the referendum. Short term memory? 
PM Theresa May: General election on 8 June guarantees "certainty and stability" to see UK through #BrexitReaction:  
Theresa May wants the General Election to be a referendum on Brexit. No. No. No. We had that referendum. This election will be for our NHS. 
This is all about the consolidation of Tory power in the face of weak Labour opposition in the midst of a Brexit shambles. 
Brave move by #May but she has always been determined & clear-sighted. She will blow anti-Brexit support out of the water. Has to be good. 
So Scotland ain't allowed an independence referendum because of the brexit timeline but the tories can call a general election? Sounddd 
It's an election on 8th June.Time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.#brexit#GeneralElection 
The Brexit Election ... cancel all sleep, holidays and time with family folks #snapgeneralelection #Brexit & keep an eye on @TheNewEuropean 
My daughter will have lived through two general elections, a Scottish independence referendum and an EU referendum before turning SIX! 
So, "now is not the time" for a Scottish independence referendum, but "now is the time" for a General Election? Fatuous. 
May goes for Brexit mandate to 'get the job done' & defeat the "political game playing" which will undermine EU negotiations 
Smart move. Destroy Labour as long as it is weak. Get a personal #Brexit mandate as long as the economy is strong.  
May calls election 8 June. Let's rid the country of this sleaze-pit government of the rich and stop hard Brexit. 
Lessons I learned from Greece #26: When the moment comes for populists to deliver, they call elections; when they hit a wall, a referendum 
This is a call to arms or all those who oppose the inevitability of #Brexit #GE2017 
Corbyn has one duty to this country, and that is to block Theresa May's General Election in Parliament. #Brexit #Remain 
May: we need an election to drive through the worst possible Brexit. It's what you wanted! Vote for us. 
Calling an election before consequences of Brexit become clear and before people are hit by welfare cuts, falling wages and inflation? 
One thing is for sure. Theresa May is not calling a #GeneralElection so she can negotiate a soft Brexit. Way-hay!  
This is now also the only chance Britain has to stop Brexit 
She can't even tell when it's 11:15. How can we trust her on Brexit. #generalelection 
Right choice by May. No way she could have negotiated Brexit with the current size of her majority. 
PM calls a a #snapgeneralelection for June 8th It is, in effect, a second EU referendum.  It's al about  #Brexit. 
PM blaming other parties for post Brexit division - e.g. labour voting against final deal etc - that why election needed 
"Now is not the time for the uncertainty of another referendum.""Now IS the time for the uncertainty of a General Election"No credibility. 
This is your choice people. If you want to stop Brexit you have to make Tim Farron prime minister. 
"We've delivered on mandate of referendum, government has the right plan" says PM announcing General Election 
every election / referendum I've took any interest in has resulted in me craving death the morning after. looking forward to this one 
"I'd like to announce a national referendum on the future of Arsene Wenger. It's the only way forward from here."  
Theory: a larger Tory majority would release Theresa May from the clutches of her fruit loops and help her deliver a 'better' Brexit. 
Surely now is not the time for a General Election: shouldn't we all instead be concentrating on getting the best Brexit deal for the UK? 
3/ Labour has to guarantee Scotland a) right to remain in Single Market b) second referendum 
1/ If Theresa May calls an election today, a progressive alliance can beat the Tory hard Brexit plan. Here's how...

I think Theresa May heard that someone's not behind Brexit, and we're all having to stay behind after class until that person owns up. 
Makes sense for Theresa to call an election now before the full horror of Brexit becomes apparent.

These figures will be a huge factor when Brexit talks begin:

I'm sorry Theresa - you pursue a hard, divisive Brexit & yet urge unity. You don't convince me. Not even sure you convince yourself.

"See Brexit for what it really is; a catfight in the conservative party that got out of hand" Pretty succinct description.  
A third country cannot have the same benefits as a member state. It is the time for reason over emotions. @JunckerEU #Article50 #Brexit  
Just about every action we're taking now - on Brexit, the environment, diplomatically - will be bitterly resented by future generations. 
Bearder, UK lib dem to EU Parl: "British ppl were lied to in Brexit campaign by nationalists; we will fight to give ppl right to revoke A50"

Juncker to EU parliament: "Very sadly, it is the UK's young people who will pay the heaviest price for Brexit"

I said years ago that the uglier Brexit becomes, the better Scottish independence sounds.How much uglier does Brexit have to be?#ScotRef

"very destructive, skewed, rushed and partisan" pro Brexit mp's.... You voted for this. You just realising now?   
EU debate on Brexit typical of this place we have to sit here and listen to our country being criticised without the chance to respond 
Two speeches into Brexit debate, this is painful. Brexiteers have thrown away all goodwill. Scotland can do better.  
Because of Brexit, our Prime Minister is now getting cosy with some of the most abusive regimes on earth. But still, yeah, blue passports. 
Bored of Brexit limbo, EU (non-UK) employees are asking their bosses to post them back home.

Freeing up the rich to exploit the poor – that’s what Trump and Brexit are about   | By @GeorgeMonbiot 
Don't fool yourself that Trump and Brexit came from 'the cries of the forgotten man'  
On the Seventh Day of Brexit, our PM finally admitted we could have no trade deal with our biggest export market before we leave the EU. 
On the Sixth Day of Brexit Spain accepted an independent Scotland could remain in the EU, rendering more likely the dissolution of the UK. 
On the Fifth Day of Brexit, and after sixty years of peace inside the EU, a former Tory Leader threatened to go to war with the Spanish. 
Gibraltar MUST become part of UK to stop EU using the Rock as a Brexit 'pawn', @Nigel_Farage says  
What do Ireland, NL, & Lux have that the UK has lost? International investment since #Brexit vote. Costs & consequences piling up:

If the UK thought it would be easy to get a trade agreement with India after Brexit, it's just been given a lesson.  
Leftist 'comedians' careers irreparably damagedYet another great consequence of our Glorious Brexit! 
Brexit enhances our (often meaningless) legal control. But our isolationism diminishes our (hugely important) actual control. 
The Brexit con trick, exposed. At staggering cost we get the illusion of control. Yet we still don't have the actuality.  
#Brexit is an elite power grab that will have us wishing we were part of any EU state.

No. Claire. You sad losers need to "wind your neck in".We will Brexit and it's time you came to accept reality even if it hurts.  
First the Tories implied they may not help stop terror in Europe, now they have threatened an EU country with war; Brexit's going well then

Trump well aware of Russian interference in Brexit, US and other elections, before during and after. Definitely not in the dark. 
Brexit could give Spain major bargaining power over Gibraltar  
In other mental #brexit news, the UK is to spend £500m getting its true blue passports back. I bought my green passport cover for a fiver. 
For the govt to even think of security as a bargaining chip shows the Tories to have put #Brexit above defence & security.#Traitories

Remember when #voteleave ridiculed arguments about Pax Europa.One week into #Brexit talks & Tories are talking war.#scotref #nowsthetime 
Brexit travel boom: Britons ditch Europe holidays as UK tourism soars.  
If Brexit willy-waving does lead to war with Spain, can we at least call it the 'War of Boris's Johnson'? 
Blue passports at half a billion quid. Talk of war with Gibraltar. Calls for the return of imperial measures. Wtf has Brexit unleashed?! 
It's time for Sturgeon to realise there's no stopping Brexit.The people have made themselves clear, so get on board or get out of the way!  
I'm an Englishman ..get me out of here. FFS Brexit is getting worse.Scotland and NI need to get out of this Tory deluded Little England asap 
The life style of Theresa May & her Tory cronies wont be affected by brexitWhile the tories want to privatise everything its us who suffer!

For the umpteen f**king time: Britain doesn’t need to Brexit to turn its passports blue. Croatia is in & has blue passports. 
My absolute loyalty goes to anyone opposing #Brexit - my beloved Labour Party membership card has gone in the bin. 
Nigel Farage got the referendum and won it by turning out working class and non voters that your lot wouldn't appeal to in a million years  
#brexit #Gibraltar #EU #bbcqt so  journalist who campaigned 2 leave EU based on lies, blames remain campaign for not mentioning consequences 
To clarify, we have absolutely no intention of going to war with Spain.It's the only country left who'll let us go there on our holidays. 
Here's the thing. We both know Brexit's bad. What I don't understand is what you get accepting it that you can't also get resisting it too. 
While it's in interest of Uber-Remainers to say toxic Mr Banks delivered #Brexit (hence nonsense like this), it was @Vote_leave wot won it 
In less than a week, Brexit has gone from bad to much much worse, from idiotic to stupendously idiotic. And with threats of war to boot. 
The British public don't need a new centre ground party to fight a Tory hard Brexit – they already have one @LibDems 
It's not Remainers' job to try & get the best worst Brexit deal: it's the idiots who duped the Electorate. You should be FIGHTING Brexit. 
And in the Premier League where only English goals counted in a post-Brexit world maybe. UKIP's dream  
This was the week when Brexit got real. Our video explains what happens next  
I'm telling you now. MILLIONS feel disenfranchised & would be delighted to vote for/support a party that opposed Brexit fully. Don't fear it 
Wednesday: How bad can Brexit be?Sunday: We're at war with Spain 
You haven't answered my question. Labour's stance of accepting Brexit is delivering a Hard Brexit. How will accepting it some more help? 
I don't believe war mongering was on the referendum ballot, was it? 
One silver lining about all this Trump & Brexit nonsense... we're all having a laugh, eh? 
Fantastic Brexit diplomacy. It took us, what, 3 days to threaten war? Bravo Michael Howard, you f*cking idiot. Please grow up. 
Spain hijacking Brexit to try to capture Gibraltar. Will they send the Armada next?

#Kurdistan will hold independence referendum in 2017, senior official tells #Rudaw  
Why stop at Gibraltar? If Theresa May really wants to show she backs Brexit she should start a war to retake Calais. 
I'm trying to police my tone but Brexit is the unmitigated fucking worst without a single redeeming feature. 
Does Gibraltar suggest the government's Brexit negotiations are falling between a rock and a hard place? 
I thought post-brexit Britain was going back to the 1950s. Now I hear we might go to war with Spain. Sounds more like the 1550s. 
"Upon learning he was an asylum-seeker, they chased him through the streets & beat him." Welcome to Brexit Britain

The Thick Tories Are Truly Complete Idiots  #brexitshambles  4 days into #brexit and they now want to go to war with Spain over Gibraltar  
I just created a petition to change the UK passport to Pink after Brexit. I need 5 other people to support it for to go live? 
Inflammatory comments like those by Michael Howard will not help Britain in Brexit negotiations @EmilyThornberry 
I agree. You work both for the 'best' Brexit and to stop Brexit. If you're running towards a cliff you don't only work out how best to fall. 
My @newsundayherald column on Brexit. Like shooting yourself in the head to lose weight. Still, blue passports eh?  
This is why fear is not a "project", but a rational response to #Brexit, by people who see we are governed by bellicose, vainglorious loons. 
2 navy frigates have been dispatched from Portsmouth as Barry Island call a referendum on independence from the Vale of Glamorgan.  
Here is Michael Howard, calling for war. This is on week 1 of 104 of negotiations. Week 1. Good luck to us all. #Brexit  
Didn't take Leave fans long to move from hard #Brexit to a threat of war against a fellow Nato member. Utterly bizarre.#Spain #Gibralatar 
The British public don't need a new centre ground party to fight a Tory hard Brexit – they already have one 
In truth, you can do both. While Brexit is happening, you seek the least damaging type. But also, if there is sustained evidence of public 
Taoiseach urged: ‘put on the green jersey’ and get Spanish-style veto for North in Brexit negotiations @GerryAdamsSF  
The idea that yards are 'second nature' to any Brit born after 1971 says SO MUCH about the Brexit mentality. It screams volumes.  
Benn/Miliband article spreads mistaken belief that you can either try to reverse Brexit or minimise damage.

#BREAKING: Kurdistan Regional Government to hold referendum on its future within #Iraq in 2017.

Great. It'll be like the Falklands but cheaper – we can send all our troops on easyJet. Can't believe I EVER opposed Brexit. It's HILARIOUS  
HALF A BILLION QUID ON BLUE PASSPORTS A WAR WITH SPAIN OVER GIBRALTAR YES THIS IS WHAT I VOTED FOR BREXIT MEANS BREXIT GET OVER IT 
Nicola Sturgeon may not seek Theresa May’s permission to hold an independence referendum.  
49% of Brits believe British Empire was a good thing, 19% thought it benign. This totally explains Brexit.  
So, no money for the NHS but £500 million available to pay for BLUE PASSPORTS?!! Absolutely bonkers. Brits ... You've. Been. Had. #Brexit 
One of the hallmarks of a fascist is the refusal to compromise. Remind me again how many comprises May has made over Brexit. 
#BREAKING: Leading Kurdish factions KDP/PUK agree to hold Kurdistan independence referendum this year.

The Observer leader is fast becoming the vanguard of anti-hard Brexit:  
Brexit, Stormont, his own past and life without Martin McGuinness - my full interview with @GerryAdamsSF for #Ridge. 
Wrong of Spain to exploit Brexit; wrong of the EU to let it do so at all. Wrong of Brexiters to reply by even indirectly mentioning war. 
Dear Brexiteers, Why do you seem to go on abt Britain & war all the time? #Brexit 
Theresa May 'would go to war' to defend the sovereignty of Gibraltar...after she has jeopardized it by Brexit 
Me: Ok maybe Brexit wont come at us too fastBrexit: Blue passportsMe: okBrexit: lbs & ounces!Me: UmBrexit: WAR WITH SPAINMe: wtf 
'Never in the field of human conflict has so much Brexit cluelessness been owed to so many by so few'.

Accepting Brexit has been Labour's strategy since June. How are its poll ratings? How has it managed to influence Brexit?  
Day 5 in the Big Brexit household and Michael Howard has threatened to go to war with Spain. 
@UKIP, @vote_leave, prop-Brexit voters. This is for you: read it carefully and the form an order queue to take responsibility  
#Brexit quitlings' arrogance is breathtakingThey rampage about like bulls in a china shop, making the UK look like a country of arseholes  
Sickens me when I recall Lord Digby Jones campaigning to #Leave on national TV "not a single job will be lost to #Brexit" #HoldThemToAccount 
Britons may be able to keep their EU citizenship after Brexit. This is how  
Not that Brexit is about old ppl wanting to go back to when they were young or anything  
Seriously stupid & insular of Tories to criticise FM going to US for Scotland Week. Especially in the face of Brexit - which is their mess! 
Strange... I didn't recall "and we will declare war on Spain" being on the side of the #Brexit bus.UKGov's negotiations already in crisis.  
Part of the tragedy of people still wanting #Brexit is that they're just enabling people like Banks, who are *only* out for themselves.  
British passports to return under Home Office £500-million post-#Brexit redesign -> #MAGA 
Gibraltar residents plan post-Brexit escape . . .  
Senior Tories raising the prospect of war in Europe. How does this kind of diplomacy help our Brexit negotiations? 
Blue passports WILL come back after Brexit as Home Office contract to make them is revealed  
Solid post-Brexit troll idea from @jurassic_snark_ - the UK should switch to Kelvin because it's the only British temperature measurement. 
Jersey could vote for independence from UK following Brexit  
."Brexit is a huge blow – for the UK, not the EU" 
Brexit is morphing from an economic debacle pivoted on lies and propaganda to a nightmare of Foreign Policy:  
A lot of talk today about going back to Imperial Measurements, but you're missing the bigger story #brexit  
UK 'committed' to Gibraltar in Brexit process, PM says  
Brexit.. War with Spain, what kind of person supports the Tories.. For God Sake.. 
GRAPHIC: European political-economic structure (before Brexit)  
Worth remembering that we still don't know the identity of people who gave £425 to @duponline 's Brexit campaign  
I think this point deserves more attention than it may be getting at the moment.As many of us have said, Brexit is a self-inflicted wound.  
Brexit: Trade and security go together, Fallon says  
5- KDP/ PUK coordinate w/ pol parties & other nations in Kurdistan to set timing and procedures for referendum in a close/ appropriate time 
Government Brexit plans leaked.  
3- KDP/PUK agreed that all efforts must be united for our referendum and an independent entity, through dialogue w/ Baghdad. 
Theresa May vows to get best Brexit deal for Gibraltar  
2- KDP/PUK agreed to form a highly level joint committee for referendum & visit all other parties to work together for Self determination. 
How to win friends and influence people..."Theresa May would go to war over Gibraltar" *slow clap*  #Brexit 
That Brexit plan, in full: 1. We're universally loved so they'll do what we ask. 2. Or, we'll withdraw security cooperation. 3. Or, war. 
Coming soon: exclusive @FT interview with @realDonaldTrump in the Oval Office, on Brexit, Europe, China, jobs (and Andrew Jackson)

Meeting between #Kurdistan Region's main parties has ended after three hours of talks on independence referendum, #Kirkuk and other issues. 
May trying to make Brexit look 'official'. It isn't. Never forget Brexit is NOT about you, it's about preserving Tory party power! #NoBrexit 
Now that Brexit is finally under way I feel like opening a shop selling fruit and veg in pounds and ounces just to rub it in. Is that wrong? 
£500m on blue passports? You could buy EVERYONE in the UK a blue passport cover from Amazon for £192m.... #brexit  
Looks like Brexit is going well then eh. But seriously what sort of language is that to be using#brexit  
ICYMI, watch our interview with Marine Le Pen on Brexit, Nato and why she sees herself as the 'anti-Merkel':  
I mean, do I speak Spanish? yesis the weather nicer there? yeshave they been refusing to confirm my legal status after a referendum? no 
Britain is four days into Brexit and its already threatening war against a fellow NATO member. It must be Russia's fault.

Pissed on Brexit juice, Britain starts throwing its puny weight around. Little big man syndrome  
Spain will not block Scotland joining the EU @Feorlean says "this isn’t news" and we have known this for some time. #bbcsp #brexit 
2016: "Saying #Brexit makes war more likely is Remainer Project Fear!"2017: "We'll go to war with Spain if we have to." #Gibraltar 
May picks the most destructive Brexit to keep Tory Unity and stirs up Tory Warmongers. So very predictable and so very unnecessary.  
#bbcsp @afneil When Spain joined EU, UK was able to impose its terms on them on #Gibraltar. #brexit now gifts Spain a chance to do reverse 
Arron Banks in @thesundaytimes. Prepare to hear a lot of this. No Brexit is going to be Brexity enough for these fundamentalists  
That £500m is more than Govt plans to cut from school budgets. I know where it should be spent. Brexit costs & consequences are spiralling.  
COMMENT: ‘Brexit isn’t a war’ says the paper presenting Brexit as a war.  
Of course Corbyn was pro Brexit, he just did't have the guts or leadership to say so. As per usual  
Brexit begins: Britain’s brutal encounter with the reality of losing preferential access to Britain's main market 
3. But in pursuing this model of Brexit, the choice to allow Spain to enforce hard border is surely our own Government's 
The @LibDems are doing a lot of 'hissy fitting' about Brexit. I wonder who started the referendum process? Ta Daaaaaaa......  
Jon Burnett analysed 100 post-Brexit racist attacks and found govt rhetoric used as racist abuse over and over again  
Not gonna lie, before Brexit I didn't even know the UK used to have blue passports 
How stupid of me not to understand that 96% of Gibraltar voting remain in EU actually means they want a hard Tory Brexit & leave the EU   
The Brexit idiots will be threatening to nuke Europe by the end of next week. These people should be sectioned for all our safety. 
I know Brexit folk are nostalgic, but I thought it was for the 1950s, not 1590s.  
Is everything a metaphor for Brexit  
This is on BBC4 tonight. I bloody hope we don't have a referendum on it.  
Brexit going swimmingly, I see  
What a brilliant start to Brexit negotiations. The subtle art of the diplomat. 
All of your post-Brexit motoring needs can now be met with one amazing car!(HT @abstex and @IAmNotWalliams) 
IT would appear that the most immediate effect of Brexit is the restoration of the old Imperial measure of stupidity.  
EU/Brexit divorce gets bogged down in huge argument about the CD collection..  
Spain drops the plan to impose a veto when Scotland joins the EU. Brexit Britain is left without allies or arguments. 
I misjudged UK war party. Thought they'd wait til 2nd year of Brexit negotiations. They couldn't wait *2 days* to threaten Europe's peace >  
Spain would not 'initially' block Scotland from joining the EU after Brexit  
We have message to young people. We know you've been let down by Brexit. But we have a vision for a positive future.  
How the first four days of Gibraltar Brexit negotiations have played out so far.  
Spain were never going to veto Scottish membership, but were happy to give that impression to help a friend. Brexit has left UK friendless.  
PHEW! I FEEL 100% BETTER ABOUT THE WHOLE THING NOW. #Brexit  
I'm calling on the PM to give a cast-iron guarantee to EU citizens living in London that they can stay after Brexit.

The EU's bizarre behaviour over Gibraltar raise fresh doubts over the likelihood of a Brexit deal. My take:  
BREXIT: May’s acknowledgement that immigration won’t be reduced until 2019 is going down well with Mail readers.

In my Observer/@ObsNewReview column today: I'm surprised the EU referendum result hasn't made more people happy.  
The question isn't whether anyone ought to accept Brexit. The actual question is whether Brexit's acceptable or not. 
I'd wager that @DMiliband doesn't agree with his brother on this. Moderate liberals from all 3 parties share similar views on Brexit.

Everyday is April Fools' Day in Brexit Britain...  
Hearing that Labour are neck and neck with the Tories in new poll out tonight. Brexit backlash? 
When even the German Embassy's April fool is trolling over Brexit...  
Why do people even bother with April Fool's in a world where Donald Trump is president of the US and Brexit happened? #aprilfoolsday 
well, I was right about electing President 'Gameshow Host' being a REALLY dumb idea.  Lets see how #brexit pans out...taking bets! 
We're always told not to give beggars money because they will only waste it on self-destructive habits.#Brexit #LeaveEU #EnterTheWorld 
Brexit reinforces Britain’s imperial amnesia- a national story is centred around the war rather than the empire  
For the day and era that's in it - who will the be the #aprilfools ??  #brexit #aprilfoolsday #Article50 #trump 
All Brexit plans are working seamlessly whilst uniting the whole country. #aprilthefirst 
Finally some good news! #Brexit  
Ok, Brexit is always going to be only one thing: total shit. But this is the funniest thing I've seen in a long time   
This is #Gibraltar Chief Minister @FabianPicardo informing Spain like a Boss that their flag will never fly on the rock! #Brexit #Article50 
Our Brexit strategy should be A) No more money; B) Call us when you want to talk terms on a trade deal.

Pleasure to have been on @SkyNews speaking to @skystephen about #Gibraltar and Brexit. Love my beautiful homeland!  
Brexit: Government 'to stand up' for Gibraltar's interests  
Why did people of Gibraltar vote 96% Remain? Because - like people of N. Ireland - they knew #Brexit would re-open old wounds. #r4today 
Alan Moore, at @TheFlorrie today, explains the patriotic sentiment underpinning #Brexit (and other things), there.  
If you're living outside UK and affected by #Brexit your voice needs to be heard in the UK now.  @mediawhizz 
Gibraltar will remain British.Scotland will remain part of the UK.There'll be £350m a week for the NHS.Brexit is a good idea.#aprilfools 
UK may as well withdraw from Eurovision because if will be nil points all round post brexit. 
"Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond has angered Brexit campaigners by telling the truth (via @cdml).  
Gibraltar will be 'even more British' after Brexit, says chief minister @FabianPicardo 
Imagine the people of Gibralter today. They voted 96% remain and now they face being a pawn in the big Brexit for England game. 
Then you should instantly withdraw any threat over Gibraltar, and stop wasting precious time over non negotiable issues. #Brexit

#Gibraltar was thrown under the bus by #brexitNotice how the blame is on Spain, NOT the gov and voters who were told this would happen 
My new #Brexit video for people still fuming at being outvoted by the lumpen knuckle-dragging troglodyte majority. 
#Gibraltar is *so* important to Mrs May that she completely forgot to include it in her #Article50 letter. Blame #Brexit not #EU27 
I was going to post an April Fools Joke then realised that after Wednesday's #brexit exit I can't compete .#FoolsDay #ukfools

Spain is an EU member whose interests are being protected by the EU. What is the big surprise?Blame #Brexit not #EU27. #Gibraltar 
Unlike most Brexit-related idiocy, this at least has the positive trait of directly hurting the people who supported it.  
Brexit will unite Britain and make the country stronger, richer, fairer, more tolerant and better respected around the world. April Fool!

Why musicians are making a song and a dance about Brexit  
Can we start calling this the move for a 3rd BREXIT referendum following the first in 1975 and the second in 2016?  
All true - but we just need 5-10% of leavers to realise that whoever's to blame the only sane way forward is to block brexit and remain

What a farce @abcnews24 use the failed liberal candidate and IPA's @GeorginaDowner to mislead ABC viewers on #brexit 
I was disappointed.Except UKIP being unequivocally for Brexit from its inception, predominant aim of other parties was to keep UK in the EU  
Total respect, Brexit is a national disgrace, and will be harmful to the UK and ppl ,and for what? How will ppl benefit. Brexit is ignorance  
Let me get this right. If prov had done this 4 yrs ago we'd have been spared referendum & gotten going 4 yrs ago?

Future of Gibraltar at stake in Brexit negotiations  
Takeaways From Theresa May's Brexit Letter  
Its rather sad & predictable that the EU are behaving as they are wrt BREXIT. Gibraltar, the Irish boarder etc. WTO rules looking good. 
The reason Teresa May took a back seat in the Brexit debate was she didn't want to defy the cabinet. She is & always has been a RW zealot. 
EU stands firm on Brexit plan; no trade deal before the divorce  
@theresa_may needs to remember that for all the talk of mutual trade deals etc, we are walking away from something, not towards it! #brexit 
Brexit has to happen, fine. But it didn't need to be done like this, and I hope it's a deserved hurdle in May's ignorant approach. 
Then I assume you'll stop pretending the EU does no wrong and condemn their plan to give Spain a veto over a Brexit deal on Gibraltar then

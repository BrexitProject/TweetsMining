If re-elected, can you trust your @theSNP MP to work with @conservatives to get the best #brexit for you? No? Well then... #GE17

Those of us who hate #Brexit will fight this election passionately, but this cynical move by May is wrong and MPs would be right to block it
"Let's make June the end of May" - you have to admit it's a great slogan #GeneralElection #Brexit 
Let May and her right wing cabal stew in the juices of their #Brexit failure: if they win an election now they will do very stupid things.

Voting #LibDems as a protest against #Labour hands power to the #Tories. Remember, without the limp dems there wouldn't have been #brexit
Following announcement of June #GeneralElection, here are some of the big issues on #brexit & NHS next gov will face 
The Tories are fully aware of the disastrous coming economic consequences of #Brexit in 2019/20, & are trying to get off the hook. #GE2017
Great leadership from PM. The country needs a strong majority in Parliament to deliver on #brexit 
Brave? Says the coward yielded to UKIP and Back bench MPs and then left when #Brexit hit the fan.  #generalelection
The French presidential vote will matter way more for the outcome of the #Brexit negotiations than the #June8 general elections in the UK.
If Tories put robust #Brexit in #GeneralElection manifesto & get good majority, that kills any more anti-democratic Brexit-blocking by HoL.
Ok it's very clear -if you voted to #Remain you now have your second referendum in a form of #GE to vote @LibDems & stop #Brexit
#TheresaMay has called a #GeneralElection. We must reject her, reject #ToryBritain and reject #brexit. Save the #NHS #education #welfare

May's epic gamble. She could walk away with a bigger mandate. It's up to us to mobilise and stop her and #brexit - so everyone, let's do it!
#GeneralElection called because TheresaMay running scared that Commons would ultimately reject her #brexit deal. Let's hope her gamble fails
So @theresa_may has admitted she (1) has no mandate for #Brexit "plan" (2) has realised it's WTF complicated & probably undeliverable

As we predicted, Theresa May is too weak as PM to deliver #Brexit without obtaining a mandate. General election has been called for 8th June
Just when you thought #Brexit couldn't get more complicated, UK is now holding an early general election  @sewellchan
Corbyn will vote for an election which hands a massive majority to the Tories & hard #Brexit. Then he will resign - job done.#Remain
General Election 8 June. Thank you Theresa May for giving us a chance to show you that we are NOT behind you. #brexit 
Pound fluctuates wildly as Theresa May seeks snap UK election on Jun8 to give her direct mandate to take country through #Brexit divorce. 
Theresa May has made it clear that the General Election is about #Brexit. All Remainers must ensure they vote for pro-EU candidates#Remain
May's reason for #GeneralElection is 'the opposition don't agree with me and I want to ram through extreme #Brexit' Terrifying...
If UKIP voters want the best #Brexit outcome they need to back #TheresaMay in #GeneralElection2017
And the reason why GE couldn't be called BEFORE #Article50 was triggered? Looks suspiciously like holding electorate to ransom over #Brexit.
PM is aiming for a GE on June 8thWill she set out a FULL #Brexit prospectus in her Manifesto ?IF so -how much of it will be deliverable ?
"Let us remove the risk of uncertainty and instability." - Theresa May, introducing new uncertainty and instability with post #Brexit vote

May translated: We've made a mess with #Brexit and we need the voters to clean up our mess.
Sorry Mrs May, it's #Brexit that is weakening UK, it's what you said would happen during the referendum. Short term memory?

Corbyn has one duty to this country, and that is to block Theresa May's General Election in Parliament. #Brexit #Remain
It's in our hands now, we have to be united to defeat this #Brexit government. No retreat to political tribalism! 8 June is crunch time!
Theresa May has called a General Election on 8 June. Her reason is the UK is divided over #Brexit. #GE2017

Early election before the hardship of #Brexit will be felt. Worst poss moment for Labour as well.
‘Since #Brexit referendum confidence remains high’ – PM Theresa May (LIVE) 
I'll vote for any party that promises to end the #Brexit lunacy.
Theresa May calling a General Election. Corbyn could block it in Parliament, but instead he will hand May a massive majority.#Brexit
I hope it is a general election announcement in the UK. a 5 year mandate for a strong pro #BREXIT Government would be incredibly bullish.
If there is a snap GE, the anti #Brexit opposition will have to get its act together and fast!

Absurd. There are no EU agencies residing in non-EU countries. #brexit #leavemeansgrief

Hey, #Brexit people!Remember how we kept saying #Brexit was a bad ideaand you said Project Fear?We were right.
Here's Sir Humphrey Appleby to skewer the naivity of your #EURemainer simpletons.#YesMinister #Brexit #BetterOutThanIn
Just realised what #Brexit  reminds me of. "THE BLACK KNIGHT ALWAYS TRIUMPHS""Your bloody arm's off""No it isn't!" 
This is #Brexit. People, particularly young people treated like units of Labour only. Exploit them for two years then kick them out. 
Dear @Telegraph, I'm afraid your propaganda has failed. Nice try though. We won't be silenced & we're not going away. #Brexit #propaganda
With Erdogan we see the continued erosion of democracy and freedom around the world. Now more than ever we need EU unity not #Brexit 
How others see us: an irish politician comparing UK #brexit position to Norwich's number 1 DJ.... 
A slim referendum victory is set to ruin the future for Turkey both economically and culturally. Reminds me of something else... #Brexit

It'll be our fault, won't it. When everything turns to shit like we said it would, they'll say it's OUR fault for having said it. #brexit
I think you have to remember that the support for #brexit was less before the age of austerity enabled by the Lib Dems support of Cameron. 
Sorry but if you enabled austerity you can't stop #brexit b/c that was one of the major conditions for a yes vote. 
Remarkable similarities between Turkish referendum result (51.3% to 48.7%) and our ref. Young people voted against dictatorship and #Brexit.
Reminder to Leavers, Churchill was a passionate advocate of a US of Europe & in the early 1960s supported the UK joining the EEC#Brexit 
Without a doubt if the Lib Dems had any chance of forming gov't they wouldn't reverse #brexit just look at what they did in a Tory coalition 
Another nail in May's #brexit coffin. Well, what did she expect!! 
Theresa May is negotiating #Brexit like a chess player trying to bluff that she has four queens, unaware that chess doesn't work that way.
"Barista visas" plan for post-#Brexit UK being brewed by @ukhomeoffice - @tamcohen explains

The first requirement for 'taking back control' is taking responsibility for your failures. That is absolutely not the #Brexit mentality.

#Brexit supporting, terror fear mongering gutter rag now decides border controls are 'hell'. Oh, the irony: 
Bob Stewart MP - Securing a good deal for the UK after #Brexit will be a “doddle compared with D-Day” 
You won: stop whining and deal with it. #Brexit 
Concept of an irony meter is common on twitter. But #Brexit suggests we now need a #delusion meter too. Or another one, as mine just broke.
Britain can no longer assure the rights of Britons living in the EU. #Brexit is not about 'taking back control' it is about losing control.
#Brexit Britain will not 'take back control' - without the Single Market it will be grovelling to multinationals to get them to invest.
#Brexit Delusion"Are you sure square wheels are better? I've seen no evidence""Evidence? Who needs evidence? Just BELIEVE, you fool!"

The good ship  #Brexit  is in fact, a burning raft and smart business are leaving. 
UK Treasury long-term #Brexit analysis  Verdict of big hit still basically right @ChrisGiles_ 
No-one can accept that Turkey's referendum licenses an Erdogan dictatorship. But if not, then the #Brexit ref does not license Brexit.
Headline: 'Narrow margin gives Erdogan wide powers.' Not acceptable: that's not democracy, it's theft. Think #Brexit likewise.

No, you eejits, the word you are struggling for is not "punishment", it is "consequence" #brexit @dailyexpressuk
Classic Leaver attitude - blame anyone else but themselves.Absolutely not the responsible stance required for taking back control.#Brexit 
Good to see #bbcnewsten referring to 51.36% as "winning by a whisker".  Sounds familiar. #Turkeyreferendum #brexit

"UK is unifying behind #Brexit! I took a load of mushrooms, spoke to God - a Brexiter! - and he said to jump off the cliff: we can fly!"

Given the horrors nationalism has inflicted on Europe it is utterly irresponsible for any politicians & media to seek to reawaken it#Brexit
The PM has waved the white flag on Britain's interests. She should protect our membership of the Single Market. Please retweet #Brexit 
Theresa May could start to rebuild unity by condemning the #Brexit press & politicians who have cynically whipped up nationalist hysteria
#Turkey referendum result now looks closer than #Brexit...
If you were only to read 500 words today, you could do a lot worse than reading these: #NHS @BigIssue #EU #Brexit
May, splitting the country and ending the U in UK, has the gall to say we're 'uniting behind #Brexit.' No! THE unity is with anti-Brexit.
This is your legacy @theresa_may. Racists emboldened by your own mad, divisive #brexit . Christian? 
It's time. In #Brexit talks, Ireland should include elimination or 'federalisation' of failed bond holder debts foisted onto Irish taxpayers
Poll in @Telegraph wrongly claims that majority of #UK population backs #Brexit. Please share @Jon_Danzig’s report: 
Wasn’t going to tweet today but Easter Message from @Theresa_May has made my blood boil. She has no idea how many are devastated by #Brexit
JP Morgan are the latest firm to announce that despite #Brexit scaremongering, they won’t be moving many jobs away from London.
67% voted stay in EU '75. PM called anti-marketeers to work together for Europe; but they fought it. And we'll fight #brexit lies for ever  
This is embarrasing - David Davis used to want Britain to stay in the Customs Union after #brexit 
"We're going to do something disastrous, whether you like it or not. Now, support me or you're an unchristian traitor!" #Brexit
I've never felt less British. UK won't survive if Britishness withers in Scotland & #Brexit is poisoning that shared sense of Britishness.
May is right, the country should unite & do what's best for all....which means no #Brexit

#Brexit is such an alarming demonstration of a nation self-destructing that European countries are suddenly realising how vital #EU is
An environmental disaster: The UK Government is 'preparing to scrap #EU’s green energy targets after #Brexit’. 
 Yes @theresa_may we are uniting-against your destructive #Brexit & all the hatred & fear that goes with it

Before #brexit I had hope that we could defend the Welfare State against the hedgefund Barbarians but now with Brexit approaching hope dims.
Next to war nothing could be as disastrous for British society as #brexit; it will not end well for anyone but especially the middle class. 
#Brexit is going from bad to worse faster than anyone thought possible: #Brussels prepares to remove EU agencies

Because having an Irish passport gives you the right to live and work in 26 countries on top of Ireland. Right Britons lost with #brexit.

Never forget Europe is a peace project #Brexit 
This is why fear is not a "project", but a rational response to #Brexit, by people who see we are governed by bellicose, vainglorious loons.
Here is Michael Howard, calling for war. This is on week 1 of 104 of negotiations. Week 1. Good luck to us all. #Brexit 
Nothing quite like a good war! While we are at it let's invade the whole of Spain. Free holidays and Rioja for all!!!! #brexit

#Brexit quitlings' arrogance is breathtakingThey rampage about like bulls in a china shop, making the UK look like a country of arseholes 
Strange... I didn't recall "and we will declare war on Spain" being on the side of the #Brexit bus.UKGov's negotiations already in crisis.

No, #brexiters, we are not willing #Brexit to fail. It's just obvious it will. Hence our anger. Thinking they are doing this 4 U is deluded

Good to hear Hezza is up for the fight against the @theresa_may hard Brexit few voted for. Brexit at any cost must be stopped at all cost 
Who'd have thought it?.....Hi-tech financial firms flee UK amid doubts over Brexit

Remember the days before Brexit when we looked forward, not backward to an England that only exists in the imaginations of the old. 
Of course, Twitter has always had trolls. But the quantity and rhetoric and abuse has definitely had its volume raised post Trump/Brexit.

Stoke has told dishonest fantasist Paul Nuttall to PISS OFF. BY a MUCH greater margin than the slight Brexit majority. Well done Stoke 
It is hugely significant that UKIP haven't made any kind of breakthrough after Brexit vote. Much of media will ignore that - don't let them 
Huge congratulations to @gareth_snell / to get this result in aftermath of Brexit vote is credit to him and everyone who campaigned in Stoke

Am mere cog in the liberal globalist conspiracy but will do all I can to oppose, denounce, impede, thwart, frustrate & reverse Brexit, yup.  
#daviddavis proves once again that #brexit is a con and the greatest folly every constructed by a government.

Storm Doris. DORIS. Why does everything that happens in Brexit Britain sound so lame. 
The Brexit minister just said it will take 'years and years' to deliver on Brexit immigration promises  
So #Brexit will not deliver what Davis & Co promised. Really essential to allow a second public vote to #StopBrexit  
Well done Aaron Banks. The truth finally dawns for you as Govt admits our economic need for EU migrants means #brexit is pointless  
It's amazing how many Corby supporters are living in denial. They REALLY don't get how furious remainers are at Corbyn's support of Brexit. 
Clearly, the 37%, of the British People who voted to #Leave #EU should pick up the €50bn tab for #Brexit not the rest of us #R4Today#Tories 
Brexit means Brexit except that the issue many Brexiteers voted for won't happen, but if they'd done their research they'd have known that.  
Brexit, in any form, is undeliverable. Even your red line on immigration. Let's not even mention the promised £350M/week for the NHS.  
Ah, Brexit: To quadruple our bureaucracy & go from 50+ EU free trade deals to 0... so we can be a free trade "leader" liberated of red tape.

Best Lords Brexit speech by @Dannythefink on Monday  
Brexit means restricted access to our biggest market, no better trade deals with the RoW & more economic migrants. So why are we doing this? 
Another grand Brexit promise eats humble pie - UK will stay open to E European low-skill immigrants says Davis. Why? Because we need them.  
Taking back control of the square root of sod all. Brexit is undeliverable in any form you voted for.  
These are the biggest questions about how Britain will trade after Brexit  
Those who oppose Brexit are not unpatriotic and don't lack faith in the UK. Suggestions to the contrary expose the lack of a pro-Brexit case 
Extraordinary thing about this story is it shows what Tory rebels could have done over hard Brexit if they wanted.  
Remember that bit in Brexit #WhitePaper about feeling like we're in control? Inevitable admission shows Leave campaign all smoke & mirrors. 
Brexit is to be delivered regardless of whether any supposed advantage will be achieved. Not what ppl voted for 
Bottom line here: government doesn't know what a sensible post-Brexit migration system looks like  
Britons upset about Brexit can come and work in France, says presidential favourite Emmanuel Macron  
Davis:Free movement of people to be restricted only when in “national interest”.Brexit is about illusory control.

Great article please RTand share on social media: Brexit is about the rich Rees-Moggs of Britain, not anyone else  
With Brexit we're not dealing with a clear democratic mandate but a flawed referendum where Brexit was not defined & the public was lied to. 
This by @stephenkb is really very funny on Blair's Brexit speech and William Hague's selective memory.  
All you need to know abt men trying to trash #Brexit vote-Blair,Clegg,Mandelson-is that they're losers who failed their country+their party 
Lord Mandelson is right: Leave supporters didn't vote Leave to become poorer under a hard, destructive #Brexit that this Govt are pursuing  
No, William Hague, there's nothing anti-democratic about opposing Brexit:  
May really cares about Brexit. Her career depends on it, and to her that's much more important than acting in the best interests of the UK.

I am against #brexit and will fight against it to the end but #BlairOnBrexit is really about chucking a grenade into Corbyn's Labour Party. 
The real question is does #tonyblair really think Britain will rise up against Brexit or does he just want Labour to revolt against Corbyn? 
Listening to Blair's counter-Brexit speech I can see why the pro-Brexiteers and the Brexit-fatalists want people not to hear him. 
Tony Blair says Brexit is not inevitable and calls for British people to "rise up"  
At least Blair knows how to oppose the Tory inspired Brexit. Remind me, how is Corbyn opposing hard Brexit - hint, he's acquiescencing to it  
No you don't, as you should be behind bars.   'I have a right to speak!' says #WarCriminal #Blair . #Brexit  
Politicians still talking about  "Brexit deals," as if choosing between electricity providers. There is no deal. The power has been cut off.

As Tony Blair enters Brexit debate, Labour figures say he should piss off and take his fancy election-winning ways with him. 
Cutting taxes and regulations will lead to higher living standards after Brexit, says @DanielJHannan 
Boris Johnson questioning the integrity of Blair over Brexit is an early contender for Hypocrite of 2017. Shame is absent in Johnston's DNA.

Former UK PM Tony Blair says voters backed Brexit without knowing the cost, and should have the chance to reconsider  
Blair's talk of Leavers changing their minds is fantasy – it's Remainers changing their minds and now want the government to deliver Brexit  
Blair has entered fray because #Article50 debate has shown #Labour have abdicated role of opposition and we heading for #Brexit on autopilot  
While Gov demands Brexit no matter the cost, so many Blair-haters refuse his contribution no matter the benefit. Absolutism over pragmatism. 
Our govt may be contributing to NATO, but through #Brexit it is acting as Putin's useful fool, undermining the EU & Western democracy#YesEU 
Tony Blair's position on Brexit makes a lot of sense – Jeremy Corbyn should have considered it himself

“The people voted without knowledge of the true terms of Brexit.”  
Lots of people will groan at the sight of Tony Blair but the bottom line is that he is spot on about #Brexit and should be given a hearing  
Something to put right in Blair's speech: there is no political legitimacy to #Brexit. Brexit is not an idea, but an emotion: based on lies.

One may ask how we can heal the wounds of #Brexit. I would reply that for the foreseeable future we cannot. #Remain 
Blair is correct on this. If MPs are going to rebel against Brexit, as they surely must, they need a cross-party "safe house" to escape to. 
We need good opposition to the way #Brexit is moving. Far too few people voted for sth like this, and without knowing. Absurd. #iloveeu

Good old Tony Blair. Exercising his right as the political elite to patronise people over Brexit. Vote's done Tone. Move on, we all have. 
Blair as a leading anti-Brexit voice. If only he'd ever held a senior government position where he could have reframed perceptions of the EU 
1/2 Man who ignored 1m people marching past his front door asking him not to kill innocent Iraqis says we must 'rise up' to stop Brexit. 
The mantle of patriotism is being abused for #Brexit at any cost, says Tony Blair

"Theresa May’s Government of hurtling towards “Brexit at any cost” regardless of the damage ... to British people"  
The only thing that could make Brexit sound like a good idea is Tony Blair saying it's a bad one.

bit like "don't blame 20% fall in Sterling that started at 2am on 24th June on Brexit. Sterling was overvalued".

Blair - whatever you think of him etc - good at framing an opponent's case. "The policy is now Brexit at any cost".   
The only people who can reverse Brexit are the people who voted for it. And they won't be changing their minds until it's happened. 
Interesting. Tony Blair's calling on people to 'rise up' against Brexit. This'll be same people that 'rose up' about his illegal war. Ironic 
'Don't blame X's decision to quit Britain on Brexit': all you'll read by Brexiter columnists for the next decade.

The whole Brexit con trick is a total lie from one end to the other. Put together by the hard right and swallowed whole by the #bananapeople 
So far May has presided over #NHS crisis, social care crisis, housing crisis, record debts, a country split down middle on #Brexit and this: pic.twitter.com/mag5lGF7vD 
Apparently #BRExit is being rushed. Strange. I thought we voted 8 months ago and we haven't even started the process yet. #BBCNews 
Brexit is happening. I dare the Lords to defy it. Government has the mandate. 
Only 33 MPs believed public should be given a say on what the Brexit deal should be. Majority of MPs didn't even think MPs should have say.  
The puppet Parliament of recent years, nodding through countless laws from Brussels, decided it must take responsibility again #brexit 
The @HouseofCommons voted 494 to 122 to notify the European Union of our intention to leave #article50bill #brexit 
Cameron lost the referendum, but it's the Labour Party under Corbyn who've failed utterly to set a progressive agenda on Brexit & FoM. 
He whips his MPs to support the hard Brexit Tory Govt to trigger Art 50 without winning a single amendment! #CorbynTheCapitulater 
FT's Brexit coverage is unmissable, loads of detail. This "Exodus" story reveals a case where fewer migrant workers=15% pay rise.  
Biggest mistake for a generation and the House of Commons cheers it on its way - no questions asked, no changes made #blankcheque #brexit 
Here's to the most dedicated 'politicians' in Britain. Cheers to @Nigel_Farage @Arron_banks and the 'Bad Boys of Brexit' Take a bow!

Fuck, what if WE'RE in the alternative universe...The one where Brexit happened & Trump won the election.Nightmare.How do we get back? 
The real fight starts now #brexit  
There is only one way to live your life and that is fighting for what you believe in. Fight the leave lies and to stay in the EU. #Brexit  
Amid Brexit chaos, worth reading what Lord Dubs told us about the government only taking 350 unaccompanied children.  
Brexit will make the #futureofbritain as bleak as my past for most. 
It's done!#Brexit  
Boris Johnson and other Brexit MPs have voted against the £350m a week for the NHS that they promised in the #EUref. Never believe a bus.

You've acquiescenced to Brexit. You've failed to oppose. You've made a mockery of the title 'Leader of the Opposition' - Resign. Resign now  
The most extreme Brexit possible. Stopping MPs from assessing the cost of Brexit. Stopping the UK taking child refugees#MayDoesntSpeakForMe

Brexit four times worse for UK economy than previously thought, say MIT economists. But what does MIT know compared to Farage-Gove-Mail-Tel? 
So Brexit is on its way, years of disruption, disunity, hatred and economic damage lay ahead. Well done David Cameron and his Tory cronies. 
He's play a big part in this . He's invested over £9 million to stop the Brexit  
The Commons was given a chance to influence Brexit and declined it. We will probably all pay for that mistake. Good for the rebels.  
Clearly Tories thought with historic Brexit vote, it was a good day to bury bad news. Shameful decision, Labour will press in Parliament

Abandonment of Dubs scheme, Brexit threat to Good Friday Agreement, rejection of £350m/week for NHS… What a shameful day for Britain. 
What is happening to MPs? 75% Remain, and yet no one is lifting one finger to oppose a damaging hard Brexit. Cowards.  
"They're ringing the bells in the Tory party, soon they'll be wringing their hands." @AlexSalmond on Brexit bill   
Don't be ridiculous! You just backed Tory Brexit. You should have opposed this at every stage. RESIGN! 
.@jeremycorbyn Too late. You just left the fight battered and bruised & handed the Tories a hard Brexit on a plate. 
Yep. Way too fucking late. The fight started just under 12 months back, Jeremy. The #Brexit game is up, sadly. 
Just want to go on record as saying that Labour's Brexit strategy has been awful and we have failed to meaningfully challenge the government 
Nigel Farage Delighted After UK Parliament Overwhelmingly Votes To Trigger Brexit | Zero Hedge  
Dear Remoaners, the Brexit bill passed through the Commons with no amendments. That's PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY in action - so don't whinge! 
Real fight starts now. Over next two years Labour will use every opportunity to ensure Brexit protects jobs, living standards & the economy. 
In today's #Brexit vote, the people that said "leave the EU to give £350m a week to the NHS" voted AGAINST an amendment guaranteeing it. 
#BREAKING - UK’s lower house of parliament gives PM May power to trigger Brexit

People voted for #Brexit believing the #NHS was going to get £350m a week after #Brexit, but the lying politicians rejected that amendment  
Congratulations to @theresa_may & @DavidDavisMP on shepherding the #article50bill through the Commons.You have our full support.#Brexit 
Under the Brexit bill just passed in the UK, EU nationals would not have an automatic right to remain in the UK  
I voted for Corbyn twice.  I agreed with him on many things.  I do not agree with him on Brexit.  This does not make me a Tory or traitor.

NO amendments, NO report stage & NO debate on 3rd reading of #article50bill. @AlexSalmond points out this hasn't happened since 1914 #Brexit  
Outrageous. Whatever position you take on Brexit this is morally wrong and illegal under international law.  
Just voted against #brexitbill. No more information after 5 days debate about what #brexit will look like. And no news for EU citizens in uk

#Article50 Bill passes 494 to 122 without a single amendment. Blueprint for an extreme Tory #brexit & Labour waved it through. Unbelievable 
They wouldn't even agree to protect the rights of EU citizens. Please spread the word and join me on March 25th. Let's be heard. #Brexit 
Proud to have voted tonight alongside 51 Labour colleagues not to trigger Article 50. Brexit will make our country poorer.

Alex Salmond points out Brexit Bill is the 1st to have no amendments & no debate at 3rd reading since the Defence of the Realm Act..in 1914 
SNP MPs voted to protect the rights of EU citizens living in the U.K. #Brexit 
Remember it was the Tories and the Labour front bench who blocked the people's right to have a vote on the terms of the Brexit deal. 
Jesus...even Clause 57 protecting EU citizens residency defeated..lets be clear this is not hard Brexit its extreme Brexit enabled by Corbyn 
Reaction: "EU nationals in the UK still left waiting to find out if they can stay here after Brexit."  
MPs vote by 332 to 290, defeating bid to guarantee EU citizens' rights in Brexit bill. 
Brexit explained! By the folk who opposed it, failed to see it coming or understand it and are clueless on what comes next.  
When people voted Brexit, they voted to ensure #350mForTheNHS. Tonight Tory Leave campaigners have shown their promise was a complete lie. 
17.4m place the @UKHouseofLords 'on notice'. Vote against the triggering of article 50 and you are voting for your own abolition.#Brexit 
This is spot on. Farage needed Gove & Johnson for Brexit. Trump needed GOP. "Wave of populism" is a lazy narrative.  
I'll be voting against Govt #Brexit plans today for many of the reasons set out in the Evening Standard today:  
I've just joined @LibDems the only true opposition to Brexit in the UK. #LibDems the party of tolerance, fairness and a UK I want to live in 
I am so utterly disgusted by how MPs, especially Labour, have completely failed to represent the large number of folk who don't want Brexit

What really fucking riles me, is these post Brexit super patriots, Who say FUCK ALL about the Tories fucking over their own people 
Amendment to the Brexit bill to ensure the NHS gets £350m a week after Brexit has been rejected. It was a key reason why people voted leave. 
Theresa may seems to misjudge how gutted European people & leaders are about #brexit. Scotland will be more than welcome #indyref2 faílte! 
Germany has larger market shares than U.K. in non-EU markets Brexit fans claim for which the UK needs to leave EU.  
Tory MPs just blocked a bid to reveal if Brexit will give the NHS £350m a week 
.@TheIFS on Brexit budget savings: "We could replace all EU funding that currently takes place in UK and still have about £8bn left over."  
It's official - Govt votes down #350mForTheNHS, lets down Leave voters & confirms Theresa May's Brexit deal won't help the health service  
No rights for EU citizens, no NHS £350m, no single market access. Government forcing through a hard Brexit - I'll be voting against tonight. 
Shameful decision from Gov today. While focus is on Brexit, Tories quietly abandon commitment to child refugees

This is Labour Conference's democratically-decided policy on #Brexit. Bears zero resemblance to the Party in Parliament's 'tactics' today.  
Hard Brexit means more tax cuts and Austerity, with a desperate US trade deal. Our NHS needs more options on table at the end of Article 50.

Lammy giving it some welly in his anti-Brexit speech. "Ridiculous. Madness. WTO rules are insane." 
It's not surprising @ScotParl voted against #Article50 as the SNP try to airbrush 1million Scottish Leave voters from history. #Brexit  
Great that MPs will get vote on Brexit deal, meaning a genuine choice between an awful deal and, if they don’t like it, pressing this button  
Opponents of Brexit should relax. There will not be any economic damage if we need to trade under WTO rules. #Relax 
Looks like Tory Claire Perry will rebel with Ken Clarke and @Anna_Soubry by voting for amendment 110 to get final Brexit vote

Here's what you need to know about the #Brexit #Article50 process - in under 200 words.  
Seems that "nasty", "racist", "Brexit-Britain" is still one of the most tolerant and inviting countries in Europe. #ProudToBeBritish 
Brexit is simple. EU needs a tariff free deal with us. Otherwise WTO terms are fine.That’s how we trade successfully with rest of the world

Excellent points from @timfarron What are the Brexit supporters afraid of? Let the people vote on the final deal or remain  
Labour voters would be happier if Jeremy Corbyn opposed Brexit, poll suggests  
I don't see how May gets to decide what happens if MPs reject her Brexit deal. If they do, surely she must resign. The new PM would decide. 
Supporting #Brexit is not patriotic, it is helping the Kremlin-led far-right onslaught on the EU & Western democracy. #Remain #YesEU 
To be clear a take it or leave it #Brexit vote without any option to negotiate again or consider alternatives is not a 'meaningful vote'

British lawmakers will get the chance to reject May’s Brexit deal before it's finalized  
.@ChristinaSNP gets the Tories telt: 'This Parliament will have a say. If they don't like it they don't deserve to be sitting here' #Brexit 
What is the fuss about this " major concession"? It's a vote on hard Brexit with a deal and hard Brexit without. No single market option. 
.@Anna_Soubry's reaction to John Redwood sums up how we all feel whenever he (and other #Brexit'ers) opens his mouth.

MPs will get a vote on a final Brexit deal in Feb 2019. If MPs reject the Brexit deal, UK reverts to WTO & GE is called for voters to decide 
The only real #brexit deal vote is a referendum by the people to decide if they can accept the true economic consequences of Leave. 
Just hame fae work & i'm still fizzin about last nights brexit debate, I effin detest those sleekit, slimy, arrogant, smug Tory Bastards 
Turns out the govt's 'major concession' on the final Brexit deal is anything but. Will still be a take it or leave it vote #article50bill 
If Labour thinks the final Brexit deal is bad for Britain, we'll vote against & trigger an election in Apr 2019 & let British People decide. 
The #Brexit concession from HMG is worse than Hobson's choice: accept the deal on offer or fall out on WTO terms - at cost of £45Bn in GDP! 
David Jones, Brexit Minister, is one of the least impressive MPs in Parliament-to watch this non-entity propelling us over the cliff is grim 
MPs currently probing what seems to be maj govt climbdown: #meaningfulvote at end of #Brexit. If so, this is effective opposition in action. 
If you're listening to this debate you can only conclude that this Tory hard Brexit shambles has only got 10 times worse. #article50bill 
"MPs to vote on final #Brexit deal"If 'will of the people' is so important, why don't WE have final say before UK goes over cliff edge?  
The sight of Clarke & Soubry sitting together, colluding with Labour, LibDems & SNP to either stop or seriously dilute Brexit, is nauseating 
Brexit minister David Jones says final Brexit deal means UK "will fall back on other arrangements" ie WTO. If he means it, we're screwed.

Tonight I spoke in the debate on the Article 50 Bill. The Tories must keep their promises & enshrine Scotland's voice in the Brexit process  
Pro-EU MPs, who used to nod Brussels laws through glibly, now want to debate every comma of the Article 50 Bill. Brexit is already working. 
Anyone having doubts about way Scotland viewed from W'minster shld read Mark Harper &John Redwood's #brexit speeches tonight #brexitshambles 
Cancer to be cured,Brexit a success,Get all your fake newsFrom the Daily Express.#poem 
.@michaelgove A gentle reminder that this was you the day after #EUref when *everyone* realised that you had no Brexit plan.  
May has again told MPs not to obstruct the 'will of the people'. I say, when you've got your #Brexit deal, test it, give the people a vote! 
37% of a gerrymandered electoral franchise is not the people or public @EmilyThornberry. Why do you persist with this stupid lie?#Brexit  
Brexit White paper promise: UK Parliament will have as much scrutiny of Brexit talks as Euro ParlCommons votes down amendment to ensure it  
Of course Farage admires Putin. Putin via Assad created this flood tide of human suffering that Farage used for publicity.#Remain #Brexit  
Clear from tonight's Brexit debate that Tory MPs have absolutely no wishes to accommodate views of Wales and Scotland 
The British people should get the final say on any Brexit deal in a referendum. Agree? Add your name:  #GiveUsOurSay 
Brexit put a lot of strain on my Dutch wife n kids. No one should be stressed out by this but you created misery for us all 
Leave MY wife and children alone with your fucking Brexit, you two-bit fascist moron.

No @theresa_may I am NOT behind you. I oppose any agenda built on deceit fear mongering & intolerance. Brexit is a monumentally bad idea.

If they got what they voted for, why are Trump and Brexit fans angrier than ever?  
MPs just voted down an amendment telling Govt to keep them *informed* of #Brexit negotiations. And this is you taking back power? #article50 
The UK government's lack of a credible plan for Brexit in their white paper, is an act wilful economic vandalism. #Brexit #Article50 
Scenes in Parliament as it dawns on opposition that amendments are being brushed aside as legislation being railroaded through. 
.@AlexSalmond puts it brilliantly. Tories are railroading parliamentary scrutiny on one of the biggest decision in 50 years. #Brexit  
Same old Tories who said Brexit meant parliament 'sovereign' show true colours in voting down parliamentary scrutiny of Government plans  
Hi @wsw_labour please back @LibDems amendment calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal  #GiveUsOurSay 
MPs have defeated Labour amdnt to Article 50 Bill to increase number of updates on Brexit negotiations/parliamentary scrutiny by 333 to 284 
First anti-Brexit "wrecking" amendment defeated by 333 votes to 284. 
Please help me grow my #westofengland Mayor campaign fund so I can defeat the well funded Brexit-Tory candidate  
FARAGE: Liberal establishment media losing their influence. Social media huge for Brexit campaign.

#Brexit: everything hinges on Amendment #NC99 giving Parliament full control on the Brexit terms. Share our report:  
58% of MDs say Brexit having negative effect. Perhaps brexiteers will copy Trump and say all polls are fake news!

So Trump is barred from UK parliament for his immigration policy after Brexit won for the same reasons... the government elite never learns. 
Guy inherits $2.5mm, blows it on bets on Brexit, Hillary, gambling. Down to last few bucks. Then he does this. Enjoy  
Funny how the people who said Brexit would increase Britain's isolation are cheering the idea of banning the US president from Parliament. 
What now on #Brexit? Divergence and unity in the main parties as events unfold: 
I spoke to many people during the referendum. Hardly anyone spoke about the single market etc-They deserve a vote on the actual #Brexit deal

Just spoke about impact of Brexit on HE. Our Uni's are losing students, staff, £ and their world-leading position is at risk. #Article50Bill 
Brexit is about switching one establishment for another one that's a lot shoutier, a lot more dictatorial and a lot worse for your finances. 
Convergence allocation proves Tories can't be trusted to support Scottish farming. Brexit must not be an excuse for Westminster power grab!  
Brexit vote was anti-establishment... But on #Article50Bill Govnt is simply saying "we know best, we're not telling you anything else". 
Why Theresa May and Netanyahu could be the most important diplomatic relationship for post-Brexit Britain  
"Brexit is good because women won't be able to afford to leave unhappy marriages" the hottest of takes @TeleComment 
Just spoke about financial services sector. Why won't Govnt publish a report on impact of Brexit on this sector? What are they scared of? 
Currently in the House of Commons Chamber as Govnt tries to cram all of the issues Brexit throws up into just a few hours. #Article50Bill 
NUTTALL TELLS WM: By-election is about Brexit and change. People feel left behind. That all of the focus is on London and not here. 
Brexit is great for marriages. My parents have never been more united in their belief that Britain is being destroyed by mendacious bellends 
Currently in chamber as we try to grapple with all the issues brexit creates at breakneck speed thanks to cursory 5 days govt given for it.. 
Apparently EU to blame for single mothers who all live off benefits and Brexit will encourage people to get married - is this a parody?  
.Let's be clear what this REALLY meansA hard border in Ireland means people WILL DIE because of Brexit 
We're all mocking that "Brexit is good for marriage" thing.But I do know quite a few people who've got married because of Brexit. 
Theresa May & the Tories are using #Brexit to create a hard-right Britain which they could never have done through normal elections.#Remain 
By Brexit thieves, do you mean the biggest majority who have ever voted in UK history? You're a revolting, privileged elitist. 
Children's hospital urges surgeon to get a lawyer - because of fears he'll be kicked out after Brexit  
President Donald Trump. President Marine Le Pen. Brexit. Time for the AU to be serious!! Visionary leaders needed in Africa NOW!!!

In any deal you should be able to reject it if it's not better than the current one. Why should #brexit be any different? #NC99 #remain

When those with power talk of the 'will of the people' what they really mean is their will, rubber-stamped by a referendum result.#Brexit 
Never mind #Trump #Brexit  & #MediaHype What about #Homeless & #FoodBanks in #Scotland ? 
Remainer Bercow is doing his bit as Mr Squeaker to try & sour UK-US relations, & thus hinder a post-Brexit UK-US trade deal.He needs to go. 
If you want to teach a 5 year old the meaning of "non sequitur", this is a good place to start. Quite the maddest thing I've read on Brexit.  
Someone's doing well out of #Brexit. Germany. And British companies are the losers.  
Theresa May seems to think 4 words on a voting slip grant her some of the kind of powers which cost Charles I his head.#Remain #Brexit 
This is a lie. May has no mandate for a form of Brexit almost nobody campaigned or voted for. Elected Dictatorship.  
Impact of Brexit makes it vital that unions campaign hard to protect jobs and workers' rights.  
It may be too much winning after brexit, Trump, and the Pats win - but how great would it be for the Republicans to pick up this seat.  
Why does Theresa May not want a real vote, whether in Parliament or a referendum, on the final #Brexit deal?Why does she fear democracy? 
As far as Brexiters saying that thanks to Brexit, marriage rates will recover, it is thanks to the EU my wife and I are married 
A referendum on the terms of Brexit at the conclusion of negotiations with the EU27  
Huge question hovering over #nfus2017. After #Brexit, will there be one UK-wide agri policy from Westminster or power devolved to Scotland? 
So Tories see #Brexit as a chance to grab powers back from Scots Parliament?  
15% of academic staff, 5% of students & 10% research students @cardiffuni are from #EU. Just raised their uncertain plight in #Brexit debate 
Theresa May's arguments for avoiding parliamentary scrutiny at end of Brexit process are bogus

British businesses say they're already suffering from Brexit, according to a new survey  
If Labour amendments fail on #Article50 this week, Corbyn must whip MPs to vote against Tory #Brexit. Totally agree.  
Hungary could start its OWN trade talks with Brexit Britain in EU rebuff  
The people @NicolaSturgeon forgot: The Scottish areas that voted FOR Brexit by up to 81 PER CENT

It's food for thought but #TheresaMay in her bid to destroy the Labour Party will also destroy Britain. #brexit 
This is key. We haven't even begun to scratch surface in public of the complexities of Brexit debate yet  
Just as Theresa May has attacked every legal & parliamentary attempt hold her in check on #Brexit. Birds of a feather.

Not a lot in it that hasn't already been published: my verdict on the Brexit White Paper @IndyVoices  
#whitepaper on #brexit : text of the document contradicts graph. Could this government organise a proverbial "piss up in a brewery"?  
In #Brexit debate Min. Davis confirms to trade freely with EU will need arbitrator to ensure UK/EU regs don't diverge.  How about the ECJ? 
Anyone for vastly worse versions of everything we already have in EU?But there'll be fewer people talking 'foreign', so hurrah!#Brexit  
The #EU plan on planting a forest of money trees to cover the shortfall in finances now the gravy train from #Britain is stopping#Brexit  
So #brexit was about getting back that which was never lost?If this were a missing child search they'd be arrested for wasting police time  
The fiddly process by which EU environmental, employment law etc could gradually disappear post-Brexit - unless folks keep their eyes peeled  
One very important thing was missing from the Brexit White Paper  
Could we try this with Brexit? Just tell them all we've left. They'll never check. They don't care about facts.

Brexit will FORCE the British government to entice small and medium-sized UK manufacturers and service providers to focus on NON-EU exports. 
We CAN achieve 5% UK economic growth by targetting red- & green-tape reductions and importantly 10% annual export growth. #Brexit 
So what was the point of the referendum again? Contradiction, inconsistency, muddle and untruth are the hallmarks of the May-#Brexit cabal!

The Bank of England is (slowly) getting real about Brexit. Ross Clark on its latest growth upgrade:  
No mention of the £350 million per week for the NHS in the Government's White Paper on Brexit. They must have put it on a bus instead.

Excerpts on the environment from today’s #BrexitWhitePaper. Lots of work ahead to maintain & improve environmental protection after #Brexit.  
1. So I finally read the Brexit #WhitePaper #BlankPaper. It was bold & ambitious in buying time & trying to reveal almost nothing at all.

That Brexit white paper somehow forgot to include stats re its claims about the dire effects of EU migration. So read this alongside it...  
Nuts that DUP totally content with whatever London decides on Brexit, despite white paper making clear they've no clu how to deliver NI aims 
According to the Brexit plan (p32 chart 7.1), people in the UK get 14 weeks annual holiday, if only it were true!  
The UK Government's #Brexit White Paper is remarkably lacking in detail. The Secretary of State's indifference is a real cause for concern.

Salmond is complaining about the Brexit White Paper.Let's review his White Paper one more time.  
Of the Prime Minister's 12 guiding principals for Brexit, not one concerns environmental protections. Nor is it one of the 4 policy debates.

The white paper on Brexit: a wish list disguised as a strategy  
Nice line in Brexit white paper. In the EU, we have trade arrangements or full deals with S.Korea, China and Mexico  
So that's why the Brexit civil servants are going to be paid £142,000!!  
Science has a section in Brexit White Paper. Repetitive British Exceptionalism, with claims flying in face of community experience.  
Brexit White Paper has no mention of NHS, nurses, doctors or hospitals. It's a joke.

Sick of hearing @DavidDavisMP telling us UK will be fairer after #Brexit. 48% don’t want it and 70% of young don’t either. How is that fair? 
To the people saying #Brexit was based on lies, get over the fact you lost. People saw what the EU was, grow up. #BrexitWhitePaper 
#Brexit white paper admits Parliament had remained sovereign throughout our membership of the EU. #BrexitWhitePaper #BrexitDebate #Article50 
Now read the entire #brexit white paper. It's simply a wish list based on aspirations. Even #brexiteers must be sorely disappointed 
Brexit is a marathon, not a sprint. This race has just begun and leave is simply millimetres in front right now. Remain will not give up

"We shouldn't be afraid to send the Govt back to the negotiations table if we get a bad #Brexit deal" - @chrislesliemp is right. Please RT:

How is the UK going to complete the complex task of Brexit in two years, when it cannot produce a half-decent White Paper after six months? 
This isn't a white paper, it's tory brexit crap! #Remain @ResistAusterity 
At least the contents page for the Brexit white paper is fairly honest  
Brexit White Paper: No detail, no data, no risk analysis, no financial impact assessment, no timing, no costs. Might as well be white paper. 
If you're looking for the only mention of human rights in the Brexit White Paper, it's on page 67 at the very end of the doc  
Imagine deliberately putting petrol into a diesel fuelled car. Brexit is the petrol. Britain is that car. 
Brexit is not the high point of democracy – it's the greatest fraud perpetrated in British politics  
 So basically every gloomy #Brexit forecast made by the #BankOfEngland was wrong. I missed the apology from #Carney 
This exposes one of the many lies in the Brexit campaign that duped the voters: to take our sovereignty back. We never lost it 'throughout'.  
At this point in time I really feel bad about making fun of the U.K. for Brexit. 
#Brexit #WhitePaper tells us little we didn't know. Workers still exposed over rights & jobs. Nothing about protecting NHS in trade deals. 
Drop of 7% in the number of EU students applying to UK universities. The price of #Brexit. This damages UK universities and British students 
All good points: on what should have been in the Brexit White Paper.  
Fuck - the official #Brexit White Paper says, clearly "parliament has always been sovereign" but "it hasn't always *felt* it". Fuck you. 
Anyone who backs Brexit simply cannot make the "you risk uncertainty" argument with Scottish independence. 
#Brexit White Paper P41 and UK Gov still sees Fisheries as bargaining chip. EU gets 683Ktonnes in UK waters but 111Ktonnes vice versa 
British MPs in House of Commons give overwhelming backing to #parliamentary bill, authorizing start of #Brexit talks  
Meanwhile in Brussels, @MichelBarnier has read the UK Government White Paper. #Brexit  
17.4million people voted for #Brexit. And 444 MPs voted in support of true democracy. We should applaud them all... 
Bank says economy will grow by 2% in 2017. Previously 1.4%. Spectacular re-forecast. Now predicting Brexit has little effect 2018 or 2019 
So Brexit White Paper says we're all entitled to 14 weeks holiday a year. Bold. We should hold them to it  
No, Brexit means Trump. Brexit means Murdoch. Brexit means intimidation of independent judges and MPs. Brexit means compulsory groupthink.  
The government forgot to mention anything about £350 million pounds for the NHS in their Brexit White Paper  
Because of #brexit tbh. Sheffield steel & alloys was doomed if we stayed in EU. I'm concentrating on growth now.

1 As expected, the Brexit white paper is basically content free. It's May's speech with a few stats and graphs. But here's a few points. 
Tory White Paper on Brexit can be summarised as: we'll get all the free ponies we want, but can't tell you how or from whom we get them. 
... or else - Brexit means we all get the same holidays as MPs now?

Brexit white paper published  
Looking forward to my 14 weeks of paid holiday, as set out in the government's #brexit white paper...  
To conclude: a few details have been fleshed out but nothing new - and nothing to tie Mrs May's negotiating hand. Brexit still means Brexit. 
14 weeks paid holiday in UK!    Fantastic :-)   Brexit great after all. Wait, hang on a minute, I work for myself...Doh!  
Right, I can't take any more of this Trump/Brexit bollocks. I'm going to watch a film about holocaust denial to cheer myself up 
Government outlines Brexit strategy in new white paper, in which May says it's time to 'get on with it'  
I've read the Brexit Plan. It's less detailed than the plan I recently wrote to deliver community engagement on a small heritage project. 
Not one mention of NHS in Government's Brexit White Paper (or the £350 million, obviously)  
I'm not saying the Brexit white paper was rushed out, but apparently we get 14 weeks annual holiday in the UK.

114 MPs voted against article 50 tonight. That's 114 two fingered salutes towards the British public #brexitbill #brexit

It won't be possible to repeat the scare tactics used on Scotland in 2014 #brexit  
Isn't that 2-1 to BrexitGina Miller sent off on sub bench with Corbyn scoring a home goal and Gary Lineker crying on pitch*as usual  
I think the strange concept of 'sore winners' that Trump and Brexit led to is a result of decisions made out of hurt rather than thought. 
It a) is impossible for Labour to block Brexit b) would be a terrible idea, and a huge boon for the right, if they did. 
#brexitbill 114 MPs tried to save UK. 498 MPs pushed us over the cliff. We won't forget. #2020Toriesout. Join Libdems/Green party/SNP 
this lot are trying to use Brexit to make you forget about the coalition (they'd do it again btw). Don't let them  
Many of those 47 Labour MPs helped cause #Brexit by failing to oppose austerity and pandering to UKIP's agenda of "controls on immigration". 
Choose numbers from thin air #NHSplastering the side of busesChoose #Brexit.Kudos @HannahB4LiviMP#Trainspotting2 
The 'winners' of Brexit and Trump both say one thing, echoing over the Atlantic - 'you lost, get over it' - as if politics can have an end. 
So called #nhs tourists costing us £200m/yr. Brexit is going to cost £50-£130bn. Why are we not discussing Rome burning 
D'you know the 2 things that upset me the most? The permanence of #brexit & the fact that WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ASKED IN THE 1ST PLACE! 
Must be very difficult for pro #Brexit SNP voters after party completely ignored their vote on Brexit. #brexitbill

Now the next phase in resisting #Brexit begins, strengthened by the contempt in which we hold those who voted for the Article 50 bill. 
So the Labour leadership went ahead and supported Brexit.  Good for the 47 rebels, including some who stayed in the Shadow Cabinet.

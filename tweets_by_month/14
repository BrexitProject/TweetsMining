Talk of 'hard' & 'soft' #Brexit is profoundly misleading. There is only bad Brexit, and it should be stopped.
Thank you! Tried unsuccessfully to stop Tory hard right #Brexit deregulation low tax more austerity & even more savage cuts 
Thank you Nigel!  Great meeting you as well.  We appreciate your bold leadership on #Brexit.  It inspires us daily to be our greater selves. 
Significant as this will probably be first year for UK out of EU - cuts intensify, no #Brexit dividend, no £350 million a week coming back

#Brexiter just explained #brexit economics to me. Fewer foreigners in UK = lower demand for food = lower prices for UK shoppers....

The delusion & shear folly that is #Brexit can only lead to its total and utter defeat once it begins to be played out. Brexit is lose lose.
The by elections show the irrelevance of #UKIP now the Tories under #May have embraced their #Brexit and anti immigrant shameful dogmas.
The European Commission intends to conduct #Brexit negotiations in Brussels, rather than alternating with London

Sarah Helm in the @guardian shows how much better the American press are holding #Trump to account than the British press are with #Brexit. 
May didn't want #Brexit to be discussed in the Commons or the House of Lords. Here she is showing her displeasure to the Lords. 
Please note that UK exporters happen to be human beings with families to support & mortgages to pay. The losses of #Brexit will destroy many 
You could have forced govt to accept amendments on #EU citizens' rights, but instead you carried on being a #Tory #Brexit cheerleader  
#Freemovement means its harder to find work & lower wages We must stand firm & not let our government & the #EU continue with this#Brexit

Just in case you were wondering, I still do not support May.Her claim that the entire country supports #Brexit is very strange. 
Brexit: drifting toward failure #Brexit 
The House of Lords "debate" on #Brexit is irrelevant.Brexit WILL happen, it IS unstoppable.
Hurrah for the Lords (even though unelected). Bully you for @theresa_may, especially as she's unelected.#brexit

NOW. #dispatches C4 #brexit How much more expensive is it to feed a family when 50% of food is imported. Why would anyone vote to be poorer?
This is another lemming,called Theresa. She voted Remain. She is leading 17.4M over the cliff edge because they voted #Brexit. Silly Theresa 
And then you threw it away by voting for Theresa May to have a completely free hand over #Brexit. 
And now the House of Lords (that no one voted for) determines whether the #article50bill (#Brexit) that people voted for should happen.
Oxford Uni. grew when English students were barred from Paris Uni. 850 years later they'll go back thanks to #BREXIT.

Ming Campbell in the #HouseofLords asking if post #Brexit there will B a round up & eviction of legal EUmigrants is being incredibly foolish
World leaders who have endorsed Trump:Putin.Mugabe.Kin Jong Un.Assad.Theresa May.#PrayForBritain #Brexit 
FYI, William Hague, the country is divided & will stay so. Brexit will not solve that; all #Brexit will do is make us extremely poor.
#Lords #brexitbill #brexitshambles Govt should practice what it preaches on allowing a re-think once the actual terms of #brexit are known 
#Brexit was not a blank cheque. Voting for departure not the same as voting for a destination. Parliament & the people should have final say
Never forget. This man created #Brexit chaos because of internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all of his mates. 
Peers began #Brexit discussions in the House of Lords this afternoon #MATTcartoons
For all the flak Labour gets, let's not forget who it was who went to the country courting catastrophe for a temporarily quiet life. #Brexit 
PM and Trump operating hand in hand literally leading the UK down a dangerous post #Brexit path which will make us poorer and less secure
May is a disaster for the country. Her hard #Brexit at any cost is simply absurd & Lords should hold her to account. Corbyn chickened.

#Brexit is delivering the one thing Liberals most fear...#RESULTS
@KateHoeyMP on BBC News - discussing the return of Mr Blair and his campaign to reverse #brexit
As most suspected, #brexit was all about asserting English nationalism. 
If we're serious about fighting #Brexit we have to vote for the #Remain candidate with the best chance of winning at every election from now
For Tony Blair to lecture the British people about truth is an affront to memory, decency and reason  #Brexit
People condemn Blair for Iraq, but they do not condemn Corbyn for his shameful silence on Assad & Putins' crimes in Syria.#Brexit
When a virtue signalling crisp salesman's #Brexit butt hurt is so bad he supports a war criminal who brought Islamic terrorism to the UK --> 
#Labour4Stoke because only Labour will look after working class interests during #Brexit. 
These two tweets really demonstrate the SNP's willingness to mislead Scots on #indyref2 / #brexit. #posttruth
Analysis of #Brexit on radio today. Foreign commentator suggested people had been voting for "an idealised England". Scotland voted remain.
I recently asked Permanent Secretary of UKGov #Brexit Dept if Scottish Ministers will be able to speak for our fishing industry. Answer: No.
Interesting to listen to BBC World Service today discussing UKGov plans to sell out Scotland's fishing industry in #Brexit negotiations.
Good evening Twitter. Any benefits of #Brexit discovered yet?
Yep, apparently if millions of us march in protest, the PM will stop #brexit just like the PM (at the time) stopped the plan to invade Iraq 
This time last year buffoon Boris Johnson said it would be a disaster to leave Europe. #c4news #brexit 
'Scotland "overlooked" in division of powers after #Brexit'. Responsibilities must come here after repatriation of powers, not Westminster 
.@ITVNews​ speaks to people in Sedgefield on their views of Tony #Blair​ and 'rising up' against #Brexit 
Blair fight against Theresa May’s Brexit plan - at last someone showing leadership & opposing #Brexit via @FT
People who pronounce #Brexit as #Breggsit are really annoying.Please go away @tonyblairoffice & @timfarron
I agree with every single word that Tony Blair said about #Brexit today. Great to see some leadership in opposition.
In opposing any further democratic decisions on #Brexit, Leavers show they have zero confidence in Brexit retaining majority support#YesEU
If they save us from Brexit I will never gripe about a non-elected House of Lords again! #Brexit 
We all know... if @tonyblairoffice lips are moving he's lying!#Brexit #Article50
I urge the #British people to rise up & turn off the TV next time #Blair comes on with his condescending campaign#borisjohnson #Brexit 
I am against #brexit and will fight against it to the end but #BlairOnBrexit is really about chucking a grenade into Corbyn's Labour Party.
No you don't, as you should be behind bars.   'I have a right to speak!' says #WarCriminal #Blair . #Brexit 
If Blair can help to stop #Brexit, then we should let him speak and listen. It does not mean we have to forgive him for Iraq fiasco 
DEMOCRACYWhere's it from? Where's it going? NEW EPISODE: #BREXIT#TRUMP
#Brexit#TonyBlair wants everyone to 'change their mind'.The following can't do that. Ever.Dead Iraqis, British troops & David Kelly.
A pity we can't peacefully split the UK into Remainia and Leaveland... we would soon have an immigration problem though..:)#Remain #Brexit
More trusted than #TonyBlair Robert MugabeGaddafiJudas IscariotRobert MaxwellAnyone with no conscience..even @campbellclaret#Brexit 
Watch Scotland's Europe Minister @alasdairallan interviewed on Norwegian TV about #Brexit... in Norwegian! 
Blair has entered fray because #Article50 debate has shown #Labour have abdicated role of opposition and we heading for #Brexit on autopilot 
Lots of people will groan at the sight of Tony Blair but the bottom line is that he is spot on about #Brexit and should be given a hearing 
Something to put right in Blair's speech: there is no political legitimacy to #Brexit. Brexit is not an idea, but an emotion: based on lies.
An excellent summary of the massive problems awaiting us with May's #brexit
Having lied his way through the #Brexit campaign, it's rather amusing to hear @BorisJohnson say people shouldn't trust @tonyblairoffice

Tony Blair today called for a continued fight against a hard, destructive #Brexit - join our campaign today: 
Boris On Blair "He is showing a contempt for the intelligence of the electorate" #brexit #BlairOnBrexit #tonybliar
We need good opposition to the way #Brexit is moving. Far too few people voted for sth like this, and without knowing. Absurd. #iloveeu
Even former Deputy Director of the Remain campaign refuses to endorse Blair's anti-democratic stance on #Brexit. 
The attempt to shut Tony Blair's #brexit speech down on every ground except content says so much about leave's position.
Audience member on BBCQT tells Tim Farron: 'We have to leave the single market to leave the European Union.' #RespectTheResult #Brexit 
A pictorial representation of Theresa May's #Brexit Strategy... 
Yep, & today Tony Blair suggested that if we rise up to protest against #brexit , the government will listen. 
If you accept #Blair as your #Brexit saviour, don’t ever lecture us about ethics again.

A shame Corbyn's catastrophic leadership failure over #Brexit meant that Tony Blair had to rise from the political grave but hats off to him 
Fantastic to see #Blair take centre stage in British politics and talking so much sense about #Brexit. If only he was still @UKLabour leader
The problem with simple "Yes/No" referendum is the unintended consequences of an uninformed vote...#Brexit #UKIPSpring
#Brexit is already an example of how populism & nationalism & cynical press & politicians can turn societies against themselves.#Remain
Whatever the outcome of #Brexit the cynical demonizing of the EU will result in a large part of the population feeling angry & cheated.
Blair, who took us into an illegal war on superficial knowledge, is now lecturing the British People on 'imperfect knowledge' #Brexit #Bliar
The deceitful demonizing of the EU has created a lasting poisonous & irresolvable division in our politics & society.#Brexit #Remain
This is not about #Brexit as as with everything he did #iraqwar it is all about the cynical reinvention and relevance of #@tonyblairoffice
Tony Blair says leaving the EU is “not inevitable” and calls for pro-EU Britons to “revolt” against #Brexit. 
Nigel Farage  “I don’t know if 2017 is the year we see dramatic government changes in Europe or not but ..." #Farage #EU #Brexit #Trump
Dear @tonyblairoffice You want people to rise against #brexit but when people rose against IRAQ WAR you ignored them!!! Bit rich isn't it ?
Tony Blair, getting busy for the remainers.Says it all really.#Brexit 
Tony #Blair blames Jeremy #Corbyn for #Brexit.Wrong again.It's Brits facing daily shitty reality that bought it!

There's a few words I'd just like to say for all of those Prime Ministers who signed away our rights over the years ...#Brexit #Article50
The only real #brexit deal vote is a referendum by the people to decide if they can accept the true economic consequences of Leave.
The #Brexit concession from HMG is worse than Hobson's choice: accept the deal on offer or fall out on WTO terms - at cost of £45Bn in GDP!
For any vote at end of #Brexit talks to be "meaningful" it can't be between a bad deal & WTO rules. Both would be disastrous #article50bill
MPs currently probing what seems to be maj govt climbdown: #meaningfulvote at end of #Brexit. If so, this is effective opposition in action.

Ken Clarke on #Brexit in @guardian: "I’ve never seen anything as mad or chaotic as this".On Govt's late publication of Brexit #WhitePaper:
Labour can talk about a rigged economy but not admitting #brexit was a vote rigged on lies means we are leading people down the garden path.
The only jobs that will come in abundance b/c of #brexit are corp lobbyists and experts on trade negotiations in an age of protectionism.

Sick of hearing @DavidDavisMP telling us UK will be fairer after #Brexit. 48% don’t want it and 70% of young don’t either. How is that fair?
To the people saying #Brexit was based on lies, get over the fact you lost. People saw what the EU was, grow up. #BrexitWhitePaper
What is the new #Brexit challenge - and what does it mean? 
#Brexit white paper admits Parliament had remained sovereign throughout our membership of the EU. #BrexitWhitePaper #BrexitDebate #Article50
Now read the entire #brexit white paper. It's simply a wish list based on aspirations. Even #brexiteers must be sorely disappointed

"We shouldn't be afraid to send the Govt back to the negotiations table if we get a bad #Brexit deal" - @chrislesliemp is right. Please RT:

Police probe election fraud allegation after Paul Nuttall denies he was pretending to live in Stoke#Ukip #Brexit
 So basically every gloomy #Brexit forecast made by the #BankOfEngland was wrong. I missed the apology from #Carney
#Brexit #WhitePaper tells us little we didn't know. Workers still exposed over rights & jobs. Nothing about protecting NHS in trade deals.
I welcome the #Brexit whitepaper. It does not change the fundamentals. The really important things were set out in the PM's recent speech.
Drop of 7% in the number of EU students applying to UK universities. The price of #Brexit. This damages UK universities and British students
Fuck - the official #Brexit White Paper says, clearly "parliament has always been sovereign" but "it hasn't always *felt* it". Fuck you.

Key paragraph on #environment in the #Brexit White Paper 
Not good start in #Brexit White Paper. The Prime Minister thinks she in PM of Britain not UK & unaware that UK is in turn a union of nations
Financial services? Jewel in the UK's crown? They get less than a page, and nothing concrete, in the #Brexit White Paper 
Part 8 sodding awful. Essentially says the Single Market has all the elements of trade the UK wants, but the UK wants to leave it. #brexit
Government admits Parliament *is* sovereign whilst we remain EU members. Remind me what we're taking back control of again? #Brexit

I'm furious! NONE of my suggested amendments were made to the Brexit White Paper before it was released! #brexit #brexitplan
David Davis publishes #Brexit White Paper
This is what the #brexit white paper says about science. It brought this cartoon irresistibly to mind. 
#brexit White Paper says "Parliament has remained sovereign throughout our membership of the EU." Davis doesn't believe his own arguments
I haven't really learned anything new about the Government's #Brexit plan from the White Paper yet and I'm on page 68 of 77
"What matters above all else are the terms that we get for this negotiation"; David Davis on the #Brexit White Paper

Oh look it's the party which voted w/the Tories last night for hard #Brexit Britain. 
One of many examples of the problems of the British tabloid press... #brexit 
So:Last night, MPs voted on the Government's approach to #brexit Today, the Government publish a white paper detailing their approach
Mark Carney must feel a tad embarrassed as he says that "the UK economy is doing quite nicely thanks"  Viva #Brexit
Could #Brexit still be halted in it's tracks?

Why didn't Corbyn insist on a white paper BEFORE the vote? You wouldn't buy a car without test driving it first!#Brexit @uklabour
Dems would do well to look hard at what happened to UK pre- and post-#Brexit: Labour lost huge & Corbyn's sundered the party. Don't do that.

Let's show Parliament & May what we think about #Brexit. Invite friends, family, colleagues, neighbours on 25 March. We need a million plus! 
May should have released the white paper prior to the MPs voting. Its like receiving an A for coursework that I haven't handed in. #brexit
A bit like the referendum itself, details of the #Brexit that MPs voted for last night isn't available until after.

114 MPs voted against #brexit and all the BBC can say is Labour is in complete turmoil with 47 MPs Voting against what about the other 67?
I worry about my family but also about the millions already having a miserable time who will now have an even more miserable time #Brexit
The Pound falls sharply overnight in the light of Westminster MPs Vote for #brexit , Yeah but, still we have got our country back innit 
The calibre of the people who made the evidence-free case for #Brexit - Gove, Farage, Boris - tells you something about #Brexit
Surely #Brexit story on @BBCr4today shouldn't be #Labour splits but why so many Conservatives voted against views of their constituents?
The only ones "taking back control" are the billionaire-owned corporations and the tyrant governments the UK is sucking up to. #Brexit
Did your MP vote for or against triggering Article 50 and the start of #Brexit process? Check here: 
Apart from exciting opportunities in the 'whoring ourselves to dictators' market can someone explain the benefits of #Brexit to me, please?

59 MPs in Scotland, just one of whom voted for #Brexit. Who does #scotnight invite on their show?!
The fight against #Brexit is far from over. Even if this cheat goes all the way and beyond, we'll still keep fighting: to rejoin the EU.
Legislation to make #Brexit happen has cleared its first hurdle in the House of Commons 
Just like Gallipoli could shorten the First World War... #brexit 
I used to work in the European Commission. Take it from me, #brexit will be an utter disaster. Scotland needs to stay in EU #indyref2
This shows how nervous the rational elements of government are about the country's preposterous #BREXIT mistake 
Too many people watching this #Brexit catastrophe with spectator fascination. You're in the bloody car! #BrexitBill

Not yet, BBC. Think straight and stop aping tabloid journalism. The anti-#Brexit fight is far from over.

#bbcnews #Newsnight #BBCNewsChannel #ITN #news @LauraKuensberg #brexit It's not all over! 
Roars of approval in parliament at the destruction of Britain. They'll be ok though. #brexit
Anyone saying there's no nasty, racist element to #Brexit should read replies to this. We are a nation of immigrants, and better for it.

Glad my German Jewish mother did not live to see this day. She died just after the Referendum, incredulous at the vote. #Art50Bill #Brexit
It always amazes me when people think that #Brexit is going to be an amicable divorce b/c the Daily Mail & Sun will see it isn't. #Article50
114 MPs voted against article 50 tonight. That's 114 two fingered salutes towards the British public #brexitbill #brexit
Today was 'Dunkirk' & a minor setback after a number of small victories.There is a long way 2 go & many #Brexit battles still to be fought! 
It won't be possible to repeat the scare tactics used on Scotland in 2014 #brexit 
Many of those 47 Labour MPs helped cause #Brexit by failing to oppose austerity and pandering to UKIP's agenda of "controls on immigration".
D'you know the 2 things that upset me the most? The permanence of #brexit & the fact that WE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ASKED IN THE 1ST PLACE!
Must be very difficult for pro #Brexit SNP voters after party completely ignored their vote on Brexit. #brexitbill
Au contraire. The UK people have already had their FINAL say on #Brexit 
Have we now passed the point of no return? @Nigel_Farage's comments might just surprise you! #Brexit #Article50 #FarageonLBC
Huge day as MPs vote to trigger #Article50 and formally bring #Brexit, particularly since overwhelming majority campaigned for #Remain.
The formal #Brexit process is one step closer. 
Thanks for voting against #Brexit: 47 Labour1 Tory50 SNP1 Green7 Liberal Democrats3 Independents2 Plaid Cymru3 SDLP
My WORRY is that #Brexit will be used as a VEHICLE to introduce policiesthat NOBODY voted for.#JustSaying
Have ye ever heard such bawlessness? #brexit 
Scotland's man n the cabinet Secy of State 4 Scotland David Mundell voted 4 #Brexit going against 56% of his constituents who voted 2 remain
Claims Tories *need* DUP votes, SDLP votes crucial, SF 'could be forced to take seats' all shown to be just nonsense.#Brexit: 498-114
I think Labour has to split. It's impossible to reconcile such differences on #Brexit: JC with the Tories. Real Labour with the 48%. 
What a gutless bunch of Labour & Tory MPs who backed Remain & now vote meakly for a hard #Brexit & a leap into the abyss #brexitbill
1 million Scots voted for #Brexit and Scotland is British  we voted as a U.K. not as a republican fantasy that doesn't even exist! 
Amendments in committee; the Lords; a Third Reading; there are opportunities yet. But the #Brexit nonsense should have been stopped tonight.
The #Brexit Xenophobic UK. Only Scotland's SNP MPs attend #WorldHijabDay debate
Had a wee speech today on #Brexit and how Commons has lost its mind again! -  as in Iraq and Poll Tax etc 
Now the next phase in resisting #Brexit begins, strengthened by the contempt in which we hold those who voted for the Article 50 bill.
Shame on them! Full list of 114 MPs who voted AGAINST Brexit bill in Article 50 Commons clash  #brexitbill #Brexit
Fine work today from Labour MEP @SebDance in the European ParliamentThough I'd have gone with "I'm NOT with Stupid""#NigelFarage #brexit 
For the wellbeing of my children and grandchildren i now support federal Ireland within the EU. #BREXIT is suicidal for UK but mostly for NI
#Brexit Bill is PASSED. No more artificial hurdles to enact Article 50. It's done & democracy pevails. Well done @Nigel_Farage
Big losers tonight from #Brexitbill: Labour & Corbyn. Absence of coherent UK opposition to Tory hard #Brexit apart from LibDems & SNP.
Imagine the outrage had Remain won by 52% and govt took it as Hard Remain, adopted the Euro and joined Schengen #brexit
#Article50 #Equality -#Brexit good for Britain #BiafraExit good for BiafraPls support #Referendum for #Biafra
The @UKParliament debate & vote on #Article50 #Brexit shows how different #Scotland is from #UK and that it deserves its place in #EU
Secretary of State for Scotland votes against the wishes of Scotland in contrast to every other Scottish PM!  #Representation #Brexit
I'm proud to be one of those who voted no to #Brexit 
British PM @theresa_may says #Brexit White Paper to be published Thursday detailing its strategy for leaving EU 
So 26% of the population get to remove the hard fought rights of the other 74%. Democracy died in the UK today #brexit
Labour have been depressingly shambolic. But now #brexit is inevitable, they've got to get their shit together to avert a train wreck
.@theresa_may leaves parliament after winning #Article50 vote. I could see she was smiling in the car #Brexit 
Remember the 114 MPs who voted against the bill when it comes to the next GE#brexit
So that's it - we're out, all bar the shouting. Permanent midnight falls across a very Disunited Kingdom #Brexit
Choose to take two minutes to watch @HannahB4LiviMP deliver a passionate and inspired anti #brexit speech. Awesome 
I and others will vote against Bill @UKHouseofLords @LabourLordsUK to block May's right wing #Brexit nightmare for Britain 
UK MPs reject attempt to throw out Article 50 legislation:  #Brexit 
Can we have a list of the enemies of Britain, the 400+ MPs who voted for #article50?#brexit
MPs back legislation to give UK PM Theresa May the power to begin #Brexit negotiations by 498 votes to 114. 
#Brexit: Scotland opposed, but Westminster is imposing it. Scotland’s voice must be heard. Pledge your support. 
Make no mistake, tonight is a body blow for the fight against a Tory extreme #Brexit. Such a shame to see so many Labour MPs vote with them. 
Congrats to the 114 MPs who voted to stop the hardest possible #Brexit tonight. We will remember you in the chaos which will follow.
The #article50bill has passed this stage.Ayes: 498Anti-democratic Europhile Naysayers: 114Wishing you all a very merry #Brexit
Just voted against Article 50 Bill, + will vote against attempt to curtail debate to THREE days. I will not support a reckless hard #Brexit
Just voted against #BrexitBill & triggering Article 50 - PM has no mandate for deeply damaging extreme #Brexit - it wasn't on ballot paper
My heart is breaking. MPs, who should be acting for the good of the country, troop obediently through the lobbies, destroying the UK.#Brexit
After 220 days since the #referendum we are inching towards the finishing line & getting Article 50 triggered so we can get on with #brexit
MPs vote against @theSNP attempt to block the #Brexit bill #brexitbill
All but one of Scotland's MPs oppose #Brexit but despite all their  #IndyRef promises Westminster still votes to drag Scotland out of the EU
People in the #Wakefield district voted for #Brexit by a resounding majority and she has chosen to ignore them. Vote her out in 2020! 
I don’t think it will be possible to forgive @UKLabour after this. #Brexit
Labour there, demonstrating why the SNP is now widely regarded as the official opposition. #LabStain #brexit
People told me pounding the street's delivering thousands of #Brexit leaflets was a waste of time.No. I believed in my fellow Britons 
Voting soon on #Brexit Bill. No sign of Tories caring about Scotland or her future. Truly awful people laughing about #business needs.
Brilliant Trainspotting inspired #Brexit speech by @HannahB4LiviMP. SNP MPs standing up for Scotland with a bit of flair. #Article50
WATCH: Labour MP @chrislesliemp on @bbc5live on why he can't let the Government pursue a hard #Brexit 
I think Labour has to face facts that if #TheresaMay can hire a Daily Mail hack as her spokesperson, she's not up for negotiating #brexit
Inspired by #Trainspotting2 - I wanted to highlight that Scotland did not choose #Brexit, it chose life, in the EU. 
This MP rewrote the #Trainspotting speech to make a ferocious attack on #Brexit

#Brexit: Best MEP ever holds up “He’s Lying” sign as Nigel Farage speaks 
Today in parliament I outlined why I cannot vote to give Theresa May a free hand in upcoming #Brexit negotiations 
From now on, if your idea of a #Brexit plan is “they need us more than we need them” you’ll be muted immediately. Can’t be bothered with it.
England lost 8 wickets for 8 runs in 19 balls. Even #Brexit wasn't that disastrous 
Can’t believe @UKLabour MPs are actually stating that #Brexit is a disaster for the UK but will for it anyway. Spineless sheep #brexitbill
If you’re so thick that you think #Brexit will have no border implications for Northern Ireland, there’s nothing I can do to help you.
May's #Brexit government is ignoring the wishes of young people in Britain and jeopardising their futures. They will pay a heavy price.
 Here is everything you need to know on the Scottish Government's #Brexit plan. #Article50 
Whoever the guy sitting next to Farage in the European Parliament is today, I want to shake his hand #farage #brexit

Well done @LouiseEllman for voting w your constituents on #Brexit. With 70%+ remainers, including me, it's the correct thing to do.

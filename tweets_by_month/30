In their warmup for #TrumpRussia, the Russians offered no-lose "investments" in diamond & gold mines to Aaron Banks & others who bankrolled #Brexit.ZERO "coincidence" that #Russia offered proceeds of the #Rosneft spinout to TeamTrump.
Too many cooks as they say. Or maybe some of them can start advising and preparing for a No-Deal. #Brexit

Being ideologically obsessed by #Brexit is an illness. Listen to Land Rover, Jaguar, Honda, Nissan, BMW, Airbus, Siemens, Lloyds, Morgan Stanley, CBI, BMA, Ireland etc and accept its a political project gone wrong. Get over it. 
It is hard to describe Peter Bone as anything but a traitor & a criminal. A no-deal would produce a devastating recession. The only people who would profit are disaster capitalists, Putin and rich Tories gaining from the UK becoming a #BrexitTaxHaven in order to survive.#Brexit 
I've now been here in Sicily for 6 days and I can't find anyone who thinks1. #Brexit is anything other than insane2. Italy should leave the EU3. Migrants should be banished or punished.And nor have I found anyone as rude as a British Brexiteer.
My pharmacist’s experiencing a delay in getting a regular medication I need from Sweden. I joked, I hope it’s not going to get worse after #Brexit . He thinks there’s going to be *big problems* - quotas, different pricing, and many other factors. What an absolute mess!
Danny Dyer spoke for millions when he said #Brexit is like a riddle no-one knows the answer to. N°10 is not amused. It can issue as many denials as it likes: May's govt doesn't know its #Brexit arse from its #Brexit elbow. It's why many #Leave voters are #RemainerNow #PeoplesVote
Revamped HMRC revamped customs system, set to be ready for "no deal" #Brexit. Quite - must be ready for "no deal". 
I voted Remain. I think #Brexit will be a disaster. But after having been called a "liar/troll/shill" by vitriolic #FBPE ranters for expressing my honest opinion, I can vouch for the truth of this 
One wonders *why* the U.K. is even declining talks…?#Brexit

For billionaire and ERG-Tory Brexiters alike, #Brexit is just a chess-like game, the object of which is to see who can amass the biggest pile of money. Ordinary people are the pawns. You. #StopBrexit
All of today’s #Brexit reaction (and non panic) was based on the idea that UK Govt can actually sort out a position and put this in their White Paper.Are we sure Cabinet can actually agree something?
If you’re in the Vale of Glamorgan & have had enough of the #Brexit disaster but want to meet with likeminded people then get in touch with @ValeforEurope & look for our video release of our day @ #PeoplesVoteMarch We’re growing in numbers quickly as people see #Brexit reality 
Does @jeremycorbyn understand anything? He manages to stay remarkably quiet on most topics, #Brexit and its effects in particular 
Given where are on #brexit the idea that these two have the time to be creating souvenirs, rather than saving jobs, sorting the border or resolving many of the issues we face as a country as a result of Brexit is a total and utter disgrace. 
This moment in our history will be looked upon as the exact time that the human race stopped evolving. I am convinced that we are getting dumber with every passing day. #Trump #Brexit

That's what we voted for. You explained #ProjectFear before we voted. We accepted itWe didn't vote for "the economy", which doesn't belong to us anywayWe voted to take our sovereignty backThere is only one #BrExit. Question is, are we going to get it with or without a war?

@labourlewis my son has already had the choice of losing his job - or going with his organisation to Belgium. His org. had to move out of the U.K. because of #Brexit. It had an office in Brighton but now he - and it - are in Brussels.
The obvious is finally dawning on the media- the government has lost control of #brexit & there's no disguising the fact 
Ian Dunt is a charlatan.  For him, like all the centrist melted twerps, #Brexit is just an opportunity to attack Corbyn.
'Banks's business partner and fellow #Brexit backer, James Mellon, took the Russians up on at least one of the deals offered to Banks. With the Russian diamond company Alrosa.'Tick-tock.... 
this, from @JohnnyPixels,  was (again) retweeted by @davidallengreen. UK Govt is in total denial. #Brexit 
The clock is ticking. We are in the 11th Hour.  The Tories need to step outside of their psycho-drama echo chamber and start seeing what’s going on around them. This is an embarrassment. #Brexit

I voted to remain.But with all the #FBPE bullshit, I would be tempted in a second referendum to vote Leave. Whoops, I forgot the #FBPE don't want a second referendum either. They want a 'Peoples Vote' which is err - what exactly?And #Brexit is all Corbyn's fault.#LibDums
Wtf. You couldn’t make this up.  It’s do as #conservatives say, not as they do - unless you can afford to relocate your business out of the U.K. to cushion the negative impact of #Brexit 
Exactly right. Walk and wait for others to follow our lead. The eu is outdated and falling apart. #brexit
Mike is spot on. @UKIP are morphing into a very nasty, reactionary bunch of populist racists. With #Brexit on its way, they are looking for a new crevice to slither into. 
The UK is not dependent on the EU for a living and the PM must assert that fully – or risk condemning us to the worst of all possible worlds.As well as preparing for no deal the Government should be stepping up trade deals with other countries. #Brexit 
A DEEP new Cabinet split has opened up over Theresa’s May new #Brexit compromises – as it also emerged an irate Michael Gove physically tore up the document containing her customs plan. 
George Osborne got his post-#Brexit forecasts spectacularly wrong. Now the Standard which has become an anti-#Brexit propaganda rag under his editorship is floundering. Another nail in Gideon's reputation.
Imagine, the entire future of the @Conservatives party now hangs in the #Brexit balance, determined by what happens in the next week or so. She can’t sell her Brexit bog roll to her cabinet. Odds on she can’t pull it off. It’s the end of May. @UKLabour
Manchester too. Set them all free & just let the little Englanders turn to cannibalism & feed off their own hatred. Build a wall round the leavers & take it down in about 10 yrs time. People who still believe in the #brexit fairies are starting to try my patience #PeoplesVote
There is, nor has there ever been, a 'long game'. The job losses, the poverty and deprivation caused by #Brexit? Just collateral damage in Corbyn's outdated ideological war on the EU. 
One thing that we know for sure about Brexit is that it will have a negative impact on all regions under every scenario  #Brexit
Hypocritical European Commission ignores and breaks its own rules, when it's convenient to do so:  #Brexit

One of the very few people who would benefit from a no-deal #Brexit would be Putin. Peter Bone was one of the Bruges group Tories who parroted the Kremlin line that the EU was to blame for Putin's aggression against Ukraine. One could reasonably question his loyalty!

Busy week in Brussels fighting for Ireland on #Brexit. 
Share this video - This #Brexit-supporting economist is spot on in saying that the EU is DOOMED in its "effort to abolish the nation state" and in predicting the bloc will not have "a particularly prosperous and calm future either".
The UK is running out of crumpets because of #Brexit. The shortages will only get worse. The Brexocalypse is upon them.

Worth remembering that internationalist #Edinburgh North and #Leith voted 78% to #Remain in 2016 - overwhelmingly against Jeremy Corbyn’s hard #Brexit position. @theSNP, @DeidreBrock and I are standing up for Scotland’s place in Europe - Labour aren’t.

If „Britain wants to play a major role in European security“, why doesn‘t it stay in the European Union? The only reason why we have to negotiate a Security deal is the Tory leadership failure in the UK by pushing forward the most stupid decision in a generation. #Brexit

Why is @UKLabour letting a minority of its supporters dominate #Brexit policy. We will win more support today if we campaign for #PeoplesVote. We will also win a GE. Our membership must be listened to.

I specialized in researching Euro #Fascists #neonazis & #AltRight personalities like Mensch who was such a low level laughing stock in #Brexit we had no reason to include her name in the book or acknowledgements. We appreciate her $27.00 contribution to Malcolm’s wallet. Enjoy ! 
WaPo finally reports on ties btwn “Bad Boys of #Brexit” & Trump.Aaron Banks (bankrolled #Brexit) was offered no-lose “investments” in #Russiangold mines by the #Russian ambassador to the UK, eerily similar to the Rosneft payout to Team Trump.
The UK's future should be bright after #Brexit.  We are leaving the #EU, remainers please note.
#bbcqt Siemens is a global company. HQ in Germany, present in the UK for 170+ years and heavily invested here with 15000 employees and supporting a further 57000 jobs indirectly. As for #Brexit I don't need anyone telling me what to say, this is my opinion
Johan Eliasch is a billionaire who has given millions to the Tory party.With a billion or two in the bank, it's really quite easy not to worry too much about the damage that #Brexit will cause to less fortunate people's jobs & incomes.#bbcqt
There are so many issues around #Brexit that anyone like @SuellaBraverman who tries to make out it’s simple are misleading the British Public. The Irish and Gibraltarian borders are massive issues. #bbcqt
BLOODY BRILLIANT!!!Should've put Me on there with him!!! #DannyDyer says it as it is #Brexit & #JoeBloggs
What is the morality of people who say that we must listen to war criminals, who took us to an illegal war that killed over 1 million people, broke the Middle East, made us all less safe and as we now learn turned a blind eye to torture just because of their views on #Brexit? 
Hi @CarolineLucas - do you really think #Brexit will threaten peace in Ireland? Do you really think the only thing stopping us mad paddys killing each other is a deal made by Bertie and Blair? Or are you just incredibly prejudiced and ignorant about Irish people? 
Why was @BBC silent when doctors (@BMA) called for people’s vote on the actual #brexit deal? @InFactsOrg
@jeremycorbyn explains @UKLabours #Brexit policy on Good Evening Britain's #LabourFest tonight.Leaving #EU SM, then forming another SM with #EU, Leaving #EU Customs Union, and then forming another CU with #EU. Clear as mudIn-out-in-out shake it all about. #HokeyCokeyBrexit
Whatever your thoughts are on Danny Dyer @MrDDyer, he certainly does come up with a very succinct and direct summary of our collective thoughts on #Brexit.Are they still looking for a new presenter for #bbcqt @bbcquestiontime?? 
Pound tanking again thanks to the government prevaricating over #Brexit. Are they trying to bankrupt the country as well as overseas UK pensioners on fixed incomes?It's like May's has the very opposite of the Midas touch, but no doubt her husband is making rich pickings from it.

England are fucked by Brussels again. Next step, leave the world cup, create alternative competition. Play against Tonga, Antarctica, Moon Base 4 and Somaliland. Still as goodScotland and NI forced to play in new competition against their will. Wales has no clue. #brexit

Aww look at @ChukaUmunna getting excited about 160,000 anti #Brexit signatures.Come back to us when you’ve got 17.4 million,but for now shut up & sit down fella.These actions just make the victory all the sweeter when on 29/03/19 Remain Part 2 will have officially failed

Troubling @FT analysis of how Britain’s paralysed politics & govt are failing our country on #Brexit. It’s no one’s fault but is one symptom of a massive failure of leadership - not just in politics but through all of society. We must break this destructive cycle #suspendA50
The UK does not need yet  more #Brexit delays, fudges, uncertainty, Remoaner subterfuge, interminable transition periods. We urgently need clear, strong leadership and more importantly a clear end-date to our 43 year sentence chain-ganged to the EU.
First you came for refugeesThen you came for immigrantsThen you came for EU citizens Then you came for UK citizens Then you came for judgesThen you came for lawmakers Then you came for businessmen  Next....If you’re not terrified you’re not paying attention.#Brexit 
Sobering to reflect that when #Brexit is discussed today at #EUCO Ireland’s concerns will be centre stage for #EU whereas for #UK Scotland won’t get a mention because for them we don’t matter #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
Math not your strong point Julia - the number is big but the % diff smallIs Govs duty to govern for the whole electorate. A small margin = very soft #brexit to accurately represent the mood of the whole nationIf Gov had taken this rational route maybe it could have been done

Two years on from the referendum, and approaching #NHS70: How will #Brexit affect health & health services in the UK? Three possible scenarios 
Nigel Farage - "Isn’t the truth of it that we are now leaving the EU. There is no reform in site. There is no deal to be done that would keep us in.“I think Tony Blair has lost the plot, personally." #Brexit 
.@TheBMA says #Brexit is bad for NHS and calls for #PeoplesVote You might have thought that was a news story... Not if you’re the BBC.
Ukrainian workers could replace EU nationals after #Brexit Gove suggests. Just as some of us forecast, the Tory Brextremists want to use Brexit not to cut immigration, but to bring in workers who can be exploited more easily than EU nationals. #StopBrexit
#Brexit promoter Lord Aschroft reommends Malta for "ambitious UK firms" that will need to be based in the EU post-Brexit.Funny, that.Malta has a big corruption & money-laundering problem.So does Belize.And Ashcroft knows plenty about it.

I’ve interviewed four heads of state today & all are very clear that migration is the priority for #EUsummit. If May wanted to speed up talks, why delay the critical white paper? #EU27 not left with much to work with at this summit re #Brexit 
UK PM @theresa_may tells @bbclaurak she's committed to "faster pace" of #Brexit talks
Hannan is being sort of honest. This is what we weren't told during the referendum. The Tory right see #Brexit as a Trojan horse to smuggle in massive tax cuts for business & the rich and to slash health, safety & environmental regulations & workplace rights. #StopBrexit #FBPE 
In response to the debate about the role of business groups in the #Brexit discussions, FSB is proud to be member-led and the voice of small businesses and the self-employed. Read our full position. 
Dear friends and #leavers. This of course is a lie to provide cover for the true purpose of #brexit to establish a capitalist fundamentalist authoritarian regime post a no deal exit.  Nothing to do with benefitting you or the country. He's a remorseless liar this one #30/03.
Blair hasn’t yet twigged: he's as popular as a rattlesnake in a lucky dip!'Tony Blair will never accept that British people voted to take back control.Enough delays already.The public just want politicians to get on with delivering a clean #Brexit'#EU
Is the EU punishing the UK? @BBCkatyaadler looks at whether it's in the EU's interest to stick the boot in on the UK in #Brexit negotiations 
Lord Stoddart - “We are not supplicants who can be pushed around and humiliated.“Once freed from the EU incubus, we will not only survive but thrive in the welcoming wider world.” #Brexit 
Today at #LeadersQuestions @PearseDoherty called on the Govt to ensure the rights of citizens in the North are not airbrushed from the #Brexit negotiations. If a special @EUCouncil meeting in September is needed so be it, the rights of citizens in the North must be protected.
If @theresa_may and her government are so confident that they can negotiate a good #Brexit deal for the country, then why not trust the people to have the final say? What is she afraid of? #PeoplesVote
They know that #Brexit is an absolute shambles, and they’ve got the money to avoid the damage. The rest of us need a #PeoplesVote.
Can't wait for post #brexit Britain.All the money you can spend, unicorns you can ride and dodos you can eat.Anyone who denies this is a traitor.
I managed to buy another 5 million shares in UKOG already today. @UKOGlistedonAIM  I’m slowly building my position in the play I feel has a lot of legs from here and has so much potential of the UK #Oil economy and UK jobs. This is going to be important with #Brexit

Great to see Britain’s doctors joining our nurses & midwives to warn of the damage to our #NHS from #Brexit & demand a #PeoplesVote on any deal.
The Tories have a serious dislike of the Rule of Law when it applies to government. Consider their furious responses to the Article 50 court case starting with Theresa May describing it as "trying to subvert" democracy. No wonder they hate the ECJ and ECHR.#StopBrexit #Brexit 
you couldn't make it up - leading Brexiteer calling on UK companies to set up inside the EU post #Brexit - even Brexiteers now admitting that UK will not get same market access to largest trading partner - time for a #peoplesvote @peoplesvote_uk
One by one the leading brexiteers are setting up based in EU to profit despite #brexit.What makes Lord Ashcroft a bit different to Rees-Mogg, Nigel Lawson & others is that he is even loudly advertising the fact. Unbelievable. 
The UK readership still rely on print for the news. @TheNewEuropean is  a great example of  one way that the nation responds to the  big questions of the day: start a paper.And the Big Question of our day & the one history will deem to have been: is #Brexit#ThursdayThoughts 
#Brexit #EuropeanCouncil “The failure of the UK to live up to its promise in the December joint report on a solution to the #Irish border remains the issue most likely to upend the talks”
“@PhilipHammondUK should immediately increase spending and staffing to prepare for “no deal”. The time for sincere cooperation with a partner that does not want to sincerely cooperate is over: we must toughen up” - Nick Timothy#Brexit
I thought #Brexit was going to make the U.K prosperous? Why on earth would anyone want to leave? Or did your lot just lie to everyone and know it’s going to be a disaster?
Tory Peer who funded #Brexit promotes offshore tax haven to UK businessesThe shame of this is staggeringly disgraceful.@conservatives are now brazenly profiteering.  Not even pretending any more
Hang on a minute. Weren't we told that UK companies wouldn't need to go anywhere after #Brexit? That the sunlit uplands were here, in Blighty, rather than in Malta? Funny how things have changed since 2016. The will of the people may have changed too. #PeoplesVote
Where are all the leave bots berating Ashcroft for talking the UK down?  Isn’t this the sort of thing that ‘traitors’ do according to them? Have you no faith in your country? Yet another brexit hypocrite disaster capitalist. #brexit #hypocrite
Wait! What!! @LordAshcroft is advocating a post #Brexit re-location of 'ambitious UK firms needing a presence in the European Union' to...... Malta.Absolutely nothing suspicious going on here then......  @carolecadwalla @peterjukes @Hayleeee1848 @mrjamesob @Byline_Media
One of the alleged benefits of #Brexit is, that once the UK leaves the EU, it will no longer be shackled and will be free to sign trade deals. So how come, whilst the UK is still in the EU, has it signed a deal to supply 50 million in beef to China.Asking for a friend Moggy
EXC So Spain got their paragraph on Gibraltar #brexit veto.... as we reported yesterday on the row here. 
Nick Timothy, the former May bag carrier is a vile/extremely dangerous prick, he is blaming the Irish for jeopardising the GFA, nothing to do with the zealots in his party desperately pushing a no deal #Brexit which will cause a hard border, another moronic tory idealogue.
Arron Banks' "charity" said it it had made more than £700,000 of donations.In fact it had made none.Misleading the public again? Seems to be a pattern here...#Brexit
So brilliant to see these placards held high at last Saturday's march - no #Conservative who cares about this country and its prosperity should be supporting the #Brexit the #Tories are currently dragging us all into. #stopbrexit #fbpe #PeoplesVote
The fact #Brexit isn’t a main agenda item at the EU Council summit starting today underlines the lamentable lack of progress that has been made.This is not the EU’s fault but a UK cabinet having its own summit next week to resolve its differences and to agree a position #shambles
#Brexit is bad for Britain’s #health, our doctors say. The @TheBMA calls for a #PeoplesVote #referendum on final deal
#eng attempting to lose against #BEL on the false premise that it will make winning easier in the future seems like a good analogue for current #brexit thinking
#AlexSalmondShow is now on air in the first of a 3 part series on Gibraltar as the territory comes to terms with #Brexit.Gibraltar voted 96% to remain in EU but Alex found Gibraltarians surprisingly optimistic about the economic prospects for The Rock 
This might seem obvious but why would companies seek to locate to Malta when #Brexit provides so many wonderful opportunities? 
This graph shows very clearly that the #leave vote was a very small blip in an otherwise clear will to stay in the EU. The lying, cheating, international interference racist undertones and total failure to make #Brexit work for anyone surely means a #PeoplesVote is now inevitable
Come up with a bad idea, ignore the warnings that it is a bad idea, handle that bad idea appallingly badly and then blame everyone else when it goes wrong - the world according to Nick Timothy #brexit

The British Medical Association is fully against #Brexit.I believe the majority of leave voters are good people that wanted to help the NHS. They now have a real chance to do just that by backing #PeoplesVote.
The BMA’s decision to back a final say on the deal shows the extent to which #Brexit threatens our health service.  With an alarming 87% drop in nurses/midwives joining the register from the EU, we're already seeing the disastrous impact of Brexit on our overstretched NHS #fbpe

Whether you voted leave or remain, Brexit is definitely a big deal. But Brexit is not a done deal, which is why more and more leave voters are coming out in support of a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal every day.Sign the petition at .

Today i want Mr. Corbyn to demand answers from Mrs. May on why tory ideology is more important on #Brexit than the people and prosperity of our country, she knows we'll be poorer, but doesn't care, its time she stood up to Rees-Mogg/Johnson/Gove/Fox and put us first #PMQS
Piers... we didn't. We were the worst-performing nation in the industrialised world and the sick man of Europe. It's why we joined, and why we tried to join three times before that. #Brexit 
Congratulations @GillianMSP - your practical experience in the College sector will stand you in good stead.  Look forward to talking #Brexit , HE & Research with you  
So, Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn isn't in Government, so he cannot do anything about #Brexit. Well then, he can't do fuck all about privatising trains or water can he? Sod all about poverty for that matter. Pardon the fuck me but, what CAN Mr Corbyn do then?

Only the people can save us now. The government has been compromised, as has our judiciary. The only solution is a #peoplesvote and a realization amongst us all that #brexit is a stepping stone for an authoritarian regime.   The people must understand what that means for them.

The drip, drip, drip of selective reporting, distortion and blatant #Brexit bias from Humphrys, Smith, O’Connell and Ahmed finally got to me this morning.Farewell #r4today - you are no longer worth listening to.
"The UK government is making such a mess of the negotiation." First Minister @NicolaSturgeon talked to DW about #Brexit and Scotland's future within the UK and EU. 
Actually it was written into law yesterday. Don't recall anyone asking you but thank you for the intervention; you are more helpful to the Brexit cause than anyone else. #Brexit 
German foreign office tells Brits in Germany that in the case of "no deal" #Brexit they wouldn't be asked to leave immediately. Immediately? Does the UK Govt understand that they play political games with real people's lives by dragging the negotiations & threatening no deal? 
EU calls for "realistic and workable" #Brexit proposals from UK. Widely-held EU view May gov still hasn't accepted consequences of leave. 
Britain’s most senior banking regulator has hit back at claims by European officials that banks based in London are not ready for a hard #Brexit, saying that this was “considerably wide of the mark”.

Don't forget to thank the CRC and the dark money that funded your involvement in the campaign#SpotlightNI #Brexit #DirtyMoney
Great journalism by #SpotlightNI. Jim Fitzpatrick follows the money and discovers extraordinary links between the biggest ever political donation in Northern Ireland (to the DUP) and an interesting cast of characters in Belfast, London, Scotland and Ukraine. #Brexit 
Brilliant journalism from the team at #SpotlightNI Richard Cook - the shadowy director behind the "Constitutional Research Council" which funded DUP/VoteLeave/AggregateIQ activity in the #brexit ref, was involved in worldwide fraud and dodgy contracts. Brexit is tainted...
DUP stated that £435,000 donation came from Constitutional Research Council. It is headed by a little known Scottish Conservative of modest means. It has no legal status, membership list, or public presence. No cause for concern then?  @BBCSpotlightNI #SpotlightNI #brexit
#Brexit Bill becomes law, allowing #UK to leave EU 
220K votes in GE 2017 got the DUP 10 seats in Parliament. 2.3 million votes got the LibDems 12 seats. The soul of Britain has been sold out to #Brexit for a number of votes that represents less than the population of Bournemouth.#PeoplesVote NOW!
When the head of Unipart plc publicly asks the UK Government ‘what’s happening’ regarding #Brexit you just know that the “Too many unanswered questions spiel” during Indyref 2014 was #JustforJocks & similar intense scrutiny of UK gov does.not.apply.  #TimeForChange #BeTheChange
The BBC should remind viewers that under the 'corporatist' economic model on the continent, big firms often have a close relationship with politicians.  #Brexit
Encouraging to hear that  @Keir_Starmer has told @UKLabour allies in the EU parliament today that a #PeoplesVote is a live option. Our job over the next 3 months is to make it clear that it is the only option for our party and our country. #Brexit is not inevitable. 
Despite all the Remoaning, all the dirty tricks, all the scheming & all the crying... the EU Withdrawal Bill has become law. We are leaving the European Union, as per the wishes of the British people. Another momentous milestone along the road to freedom. #Brexit 
The fact ⁦@The_TUC⁩ and the ⁦@CBItweets⁩ are releasing joint statements calling on Ministers to sort their act out on #Brexit is very significant & a massive wake up call

If you don't like Lab's policy on #Brexit,there's no need to worry.There will be another one along shortly. 
An absolutely laughable positionThe EU will allow the UK to join them at the negotiating table in any future trade deals... as what, an equal partner? Or spare wheel?Labour Brexiteers ie Labour supporters outside London. You’ve been betrayed! #Brexit 
Given the complexities and difficulties of negotiating #Brexit it should be much easier to oppose than to govern. Labour can't even manage that. Their many positions on Brexit have all been as laughable as each other. 
.@EmilyThornberry tonight confirmed that @uklabour would have us in the Customs Union after #Brexit & we would be tied to the #EU under for trade deals.When asked if she had party unity, her reply was who knows. #Labour don’t have a clue on #Brexit@Channel4News tonight
Twitter is full of 'experts' who know far better about the consequences of #Brexit than the CEOs of major industries who've a lifetime of experience in their sectors. It's a wonder these 'experts' aren't running these major industries, rather than working on their shopfloors.
According to #Leavers, UK job losses are not the result of the #BrexitShambles. They are either the fault of the EU, or the fault of #Remainers for not getting behind #Brexit.Wake up #Leavers, jobs lost will be entirely YOUR fault. Own it, don't try passing the buck.
No matter what your thoughts on #Brexit & EU citizens, children must never be victim of bullying because of their background. Researchers call for more training to help teachers, amid reports of growing racism in schools against Eastern European pupils

Have just had an enquiry from a “journalist” asking whether it’s true I’ve been employed by the CIA since 1995 as a secret agent for #Brexit. Honest answer is “no”. But coolest answer is obviously “Yes, that’s 100% true actually. Well done on getting such a top scoop. Fair play.”

I’m excited and pleased that the #EUWithdrawalBill received Royal Ascent from Her Majesty the Queen today, making it law. This is an important step forward towards delivering on the will of the British people and making #Brexit the great success it can be.
Great to meet with @moneillsf @mfearonsf @sinnfeinireland today with @CAJ to discuss why a Bill of Rights is more important than ever and how  rights protections at risk because of #Brexit can be defended. 
Owen Jones can be intensely irritating but here he talks complete sense. All the Remoaners calling for a second referendum assume the public want one, that they'd win and that Brexiteers would come back tail between legs. Wrong on all counts!#Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill #FBPE

Fantastic news. #Brexit is now happening. Despite the treachery of so many Labour MPs and other Remoaner MPs, the Europhile Lords, the out of touch political establishment, unelected troublecausers like Gina Miller, Soros and foreign meddlers (eg Obama).
Although fair to say this is not my will, never was, never will be. History will not look kindly on the Prime Minister for failing to listen to the rest of the people who do not want #Brexit and who does not want them to have a #PeoplesVote

German eurocrat tells the UK we should pay the EU £39bn even if there is no #Brexit deal [The Germans should stick to sorting out the migration & Eurozone messes that they helped to create, not idiotically telling us to pay billions for nothing in return]
When it comes to tactical tricks Dominic Grieve takes the biscuit. He tables amendments to thwart Brexit then votes against his own amendment. UUP don’t understand but applaud anyway because it’s a swipe at the DUP. Meantime @duponline will honour the will of the people. #brexit 
Robert Oulds - "BMW and Airbus were making all kinds of predictions during the referendum campaign, warning of doom, economic dire consequences. The reverse happened." #Brexit 
First Airbus, now BMW warn of factory closures if xBrexit takes UK out of the Customs Union and Single Market on which their supply chains depend...I wonder who Greg Hands and Philip Hammond have lined up next :) The heat is clearly on ahead of the Chequers #Brexit meeting. /1
I asked @GregClarkMP how he will safeguard 000s of #aerospace jobs in the northwest as his govt pursue a #Brexit outside of single market and customs union. He agreed with me that @Jeremy_Hunt is wrong on #Airbus. In a democratic country businesses have every right to speak out.
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "I think a vote of 17.4million people is more important than a march of about 100,000 people.“Bear in mind that this is not that big of a march. Two million people marched in relation to the Iraq War which was a much more important number." #Brexit 
Given precedent  of stopping  Swansea project & that #Brexit is clearly not value for money (on a much bigger scale), Brexit should be stopped forthwith.(link: )
Oh dear. @IsabelOakeshott seems to have shown herself as a liar again. #NigelFarage #Brexit 
Faisal Islam - Pessimism over the #brexit part of the EU summit as progress on NI is proving tricky. BMW, today, have made a further statement about how worried they are about border arrangements & how that might mean they can't make their products in the UK.#FBPE #StopBrexit
This is a tricky one:Do we believe car engineers, experts, trade bodies & business people who’ve consistently warned of the dangers of #Brexit on car supply chains........or that woman who was leader of UKIP for 4 & half weeks in 2016 & who’s never worked in the industry?
Sat in the pub (wetherspoons) with the GF and a guy sits down opposite with a Stop Brexit t-shirt. Come back from the bar and he is talking to the GF about #Brexit at which point he engages me in conversation.Destroyed all his points. Including about trump. Remainer silence.
This caught my eye in Catherine Bearder MEP's excellent article: I work in Brussels alongside the EU Brexit negotiators and I find it incredible how little the UK government understands | The Independent #Brexit 
Many Corbyn supporters are saying he can't do anything to oppose #Brexit. If that is the case let him resign and hand the Labour leadership to someone who can take the attack to a bitterly divided and shambolic minority Tory government. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Remember when Brexiteer Ultras like @DavidDavisMP were telling you the German Car Makers would demand Britain got a good deal from Brexit? How time flies eh. In the @FT #BMW are very clear: no frictionless border, no UK jobs. #BrexitShambles #Brexit 
The Swansea Bay tidal lagoon would have given a huge boost to Britain's renewables industry and created thousands of good jobs. Instead, we will be reliant on risky & hugely expensive nuclear technology bought in from France and Japan.So much for @michaelgove's "Green #Brexit". 
This Govt's #Brexit chaos is risking our industrial base - my speech earlier on #Airbus:
Poor Germany. They are used to throwing their economic muscle around the EU and the world via the EU and that doesn't work any more after #BrExit and Trump. Germany is in real trouble. Their export driven economy and migrant stuffed country is unsustainable.
Darren Jones - How much damage needs to be done to British industry before the threshold is met for a duff deal on #Brexit & will he at that stage  join me & others in calling for a #PeoplesVote? #FBPE #StopBrexit @darrenpjones
Personally, I think the debacle that is the Tories management of Brexit negotiations over the past two years has been far more agonising, with I fear worse to come. #Brexit 
A detailed risk assessment by aerospace manufacturer Airbus, which shows that thousands of jobs are at risk from a hard #Brexit, has been met by nothing more than “meaningless platitudes” from the government:
Of the Ministers and MPs who criticised Airbus, which of them has run a global blue chip company with a complex supply chain? #Brexit #FBPE
Farage mysteriously conceded on the #brexit vote. Hedge funds got data including from Farage's own polling firm, some of which would have been illegal to give the public. They knew Brexit had won. They shorted the pound & made blns.@CamSimpsonNews:

Hi @theJeremyVine it’s not only Boris Johnson running away from the Heathrow runway... deleted pages from Theresa Mays website are circulating twitter - she apposes the #HeathrowExpansion and here is a leaflet. She’s got form on going back on her word - just look at #Brexit  
Ok so my favourite thing in the world is when pigeons nonchalantly board trains & strut about. I was just enjoying that & a man got on & BOOTED THE PIGEON OFF. I hate this country. #brexit
good thing I only eat English fries. #brexit 
Yes why aren't the Brexiters trumpeting the news that billionaires are getting richer from #Brexit.... 
"Sack @BorisJohnson.""Why?""The rascal has only gone away on a Foreign Office trip""But he's Foreign Secretary.""Ah, but, we don't like him. We blame him for #Brexit."... 
Looks like @theresa_may has changed her mind on Heathrow expansion. Whether or not I agree with Heathrow issue, I respect her being able to do so, because in a democracy it’s ok to change your mind. Just like many leave voters have on #brexit who are #remainernow!#peoplesvote
"@theresa_may​ is totally hopeless" says @UKIP​'s leader @GerardBattenMEP​ as thousands marched on the 2nd anniversary of #Brexit vote.MORE:

Polling suggests support for a #referendum on the actual #brexit deal is growing steadily: 
 UK: After the unsuccessful #Brexit protests of EU supporters in #London, they drove home disappointed, but environmentally friendly with their tricycles.
How can UK negotiate a sensible agreement with #EU while Boris (f*** business) remains Foreign Sec and Liam Fox is Trade Sec? Both should be replaced by more sensible figures. Otherwise, both #Brexit and the UK economy are doomed.
Video here with @CamSimpsonNews: on U.K. polling firms sold hedge funds critical, advance information, on the day and in the days leading up to the #Brexit referendum, putting them in a position to earn fortunes by short selling the British pound.

It doesn't matter that everybody lied. It doesn't matter that bankers manipulated the market. It doesn't matter that personal data was plundered. It's the will of the people. #Brexit
I find this absolutely incredible.  Evil axis of pollsters, politicians and hedge funds have played people in the #brexit and #indyref votes.  All that stuff about Farage conceding then winning then resigning makes sense now.  These people should be in jail. Who's investigating?
#Brexit: taking the 'European Question' out of UK politics. Oh, wait. 
Shocking scoop reveals how hedge funds profited significantly from private polling during the EU referendum - with former broker Farage implicated  #Brexit

#Brexit has already slowed the UK economy by 2.1%, costing the government £440m in lost tax revenues - far more than the net cost of UK EU membership. So when they talk about a #BrexitDividend they are lying! #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote

16 funniest placards from the Brexit protest march  #Brexit #Brexitmarch
#Brexit night was one of the most profitable days in the history of hedge funds. Millions were made at the expense of millions. Tory Brexiteers want a hard Brexit because they will trouser more millions. Britain has been set up. Brexit is about £££ for the few, but none for you!

What's exasperating is that the Party I vote for(@UKLabour)  because I believe that it's a big enough tent to encompass needs/concerns of working people is making little analysis of #Brexit-whether they accept the result or not.They should be patrolling it keenly#BrexitBigShort
#BREXIT - there are now 659,000 more people in work in the #UK than there were at the time of the #EU referendum. The fact is that BREXIT is not the disaster that remainers predicted and, if the government gets a grip, it can be extremely good news. Let's make it work!
Rather than Corbyn fans shouting "@UKLabour supporters should get behind the leader!" how about the leader gets behind Labour voters? #Brexit 
This some #brexit story. What a scam and a scandal so much of it was and is: 
#WheresBorisJohnson?Johnson was fired as a Daily Telegraph journo. Why?He lied.Johnson was fired as a Tory shadow minister. Why?He lied.Johnson said he'd brave bulldozers to stop Heathrow expansion.He lied.When will Britain realise #Brexit is Johnson's BIGGEST lie yet?

@Anna_Soubry speaks for me. Gerrymandered advisory referendum was not intended to mandate #Brexit according to 2015 Referendum Bill. Brexit is unconstitutional. @theresa_may will give #Leavers what they want. British economy crushed & citizens facing decades of hardship & misery.

#Brexit has totally changed me. I used to think that I was kind of British, like everyone else. The referendum segregated me and made me an outsider. Now I wear my immigrant badge with pride. I may be a British citizen now, but I will never feel British again. It's no loss to me.

The only sane reason anybody would be pushing for a 'no deal' #Brexit is if they are holding financial positions against the UK economy. So as all of those tens upon tens of thousand people lose their jobs, they'll profit. Remind me, who are the traitors again?#PeoplesVoteMarch
Anti-#Brexit campaigner is confronted with reality by BBC host: Of 30 polls in the last 18 months, 24 of them were against another referendum, only 3 were for. "It doesn’t seem as though you have convinced the public that they want to go for this again"

6) This takes me on to the 2nd question for Corbynites.This week Airbus, BMW & Siemens all went public with the same "Jobs at risk from #Brexit" message the Japanese car makers gave last year.It's the same week parliament let us down so badly on "meaningful vote"
For heaven’s sake! How on earth are   &  “vassal states” when, unlike the  in , they can control their own fisheries, agriculture, justice & home affairs, sign their own FTAs & have full seat / direct vote at global standard-setting bodies?#EFTA #Brexit 
I think this is THE lamest excuse ever. Millions of people would say "hold on, these guys broke the law, lied and tricked people into voting #brexit. Let us have another chance now we know more about what's at stake." I thought we lived in a democracy? 
Owen, would you refuse to debate equal rights for the LGBT+ community because it might boost the radical right? How about immigration or multiculturalism? Trade union rights? You have made a career standing up for what you believe in. By opposing #Brexit, we are doing the same.

Precisely Karen. Leavers didn’t vilify people for voting to remain yet some of these extreme remainiacs seem to feel that they can do it to us. Well, they’re in for a battle because this #Brexit voter isn’t taking their nonsense.
Cancelling #Brexit is not about left or right - its about cheating the people of their democratic result in an EURef - Cheat the people of #Brexit and they will destroy the UK political parties - extremism will prevail as we witness across mainland EU - the latest being #Italy

Daniel Hannan MEP - "It’s wonderful to have people engaged in politics, it’s no small feat to get 100,000 people out on the streets but 17.4 million is a lot bigger than 100,000."More people voted Leave than have ever voted in British history." #Brexit 
Blair's strategy is obvious. 1) Mislead the British people to think the EU will reform free movement (Cameron tried that) 2) Hope for a second referendum that reverses #Brexit 3) Then re-open the floodgates. He still thinks #Brexiteers were born yesterday.
Nigel Farage - "This is business scaremongering. #Airbus is an intensely political company, it was set up that way."Where their argument falls to pieces is: aerospace internationally, under WTO, is a no-tariff regime." #Brexit 
Why the government can’t make up its mind on what kind of #Brexit it wants : 
Given “no substantial progress” in the #Brexit talks, especially on the Irish border, the EU is preparing for a no-deal Brexit. This would be bad for the other countries, but catastrophic for us.

Dear friends, you will note there are many trying to frame the March as an anti-Corbyn march. Whilst people have their view on Corbyn, the #PeoplesVote march was pro European pro EU against #brexit. That's why people marched.
Already big damage from prospect of #Brexit - and worse to come ⁦@ChrisGiles_⁩
1. When ppl state that #Brexit is the Will of the Ppl they are WRONG..it was the non-Binding opinion of only 26.5% of the Ppl (Cameron's promise ruled invalid by the Miller Case) 37% of voters & only 51.8% of those voting. These are the FACTS..something #Brexit backers ignore.
Could someone please remind @Jeremy_Hunt that we are not a nation at war and there is no government censorship, as much as I'm sure he, and the rest of May's cabinet of fools, wish to gag British businesses from disclosing the implications for jobs and investment of #Brexit.

This is precisely the sort of smearing of #Brexit voters that has made us stop listening to the remainiacs. Apparently, only remain voters were decent. Had there been less vilification of Leavers, for a choice we had every right to make, we MAY have been willing to listen.  
Some Corbyn supporters just don't get it. If Corbyn keeps on supporting #Brexit then there is almost zero hope of stopping it, if he opposes it then it could well be stopped. So of course Corbyn is the target of a lot of criticism. Is that so hard to understand!#StopBrexit #FBPE

Just what kind of country puts its economy at such risk that businesses have to issue dire warnings. Companies do not make these announcements lightly. Even suggesting that they will face a minor issue will harm them.Listen to them. They mean it.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
City boss:“I was very disappointed with the Lords – it seems to me they exceeded their authority.It’s clear to me they were trying to block Brexit, not trying to amend Brexit terms.We should just get on with it – business needs certainty.”#Brexit #EU
On way way to @solasfestival to talk about #Brexit and all the parts of these Islands which @GovUK is failing to consider as their self inflicted chaos deepens
"Would you really walk away over a no-deal #Brexit scenario?" asks @SophyRidgeSky. @LiamFox says their "European partners" would be "foolish" to think that the PM is "bluffing" #ridge
The irony is astounding. So much of the #Brexit debate has been privately educated M&S food-hallers calling the rest of us elitist for worrying about jobs. #PeoplesVoteMarch
This is cloud cuckoo land! It’s not like a business negotiation where walking away from deal means status quo. A #NoDeal #Brexit means an abrupt end to status quo, legal limbo,WTO tariffs,sudden end to all rights (eg air landing rights), huge job losses...
“Off you go Scotland prosper and do your thing! I didn’t support you in the last #Indyref, I didn’t want the breakup of the UK. It seems now however that has changed and you can’t be held back by #Brexit. You now have my support and blessing!” Graham Holland, Company MD, London

I though an Eton mess was a dessert until I saw #Brexit
Arron Banks ‘discussed digging dirt on journalists’These are the tactics of authoritarian politics and not what we expect in our democracy. We need the police to defend the rule of law and investigate the activity of the #Brexit bully boys
Lord Lilley: Let's train our OWN people!'Lack of emphasis on technical & vocational skills been a deep rooted problem in UK for 100 years but intensified in 1990s when Tony Blair deliberately opened up our borders to emigration from #EU countries'#Brexit
Where's Jeremy Corbyn? He's where the British electorate put him....in opposition to Theresa May & the @conservatives who conceived & engineered the #EUref. He can't stop a no deal or hard #brexit unless the electorate kick out the tories. Support @jeremycobyn, don't slag him off
Yesterday we marched in London for the #peoplesvote on the EU referendum. A few people turned up #PeoplesVoteMarch #Brexit 
What a stirring speech yesterday by @CarolineLucas at the #PeoplesVoteMarch She spoke with clarity, passion and honesty about the damage #brexit is doing to our beloved country. #remain
What I  about yesterday's #PeoplesVoteMarch * Meeting friendly strangers* Feeling SAFE in a crowd (I get anxious)* Not receiving ANY abuse for being part~German/Jewish/#EU citizen#Brexit means the opposite of all these; it MUST fail.  #fbpe #stopbrexit
A £20bn to £40bn hit to the economy Thanks #Brexit via @financialtimes
David C Bannerman MEP with some hard hitting facts that the EU chooses to, or conveniently forgets to acknowledge.#Brexit 
I still fail to understand WHY ANYONE in the UK (except for those getting money from the EU) would want to stay in the EU? Well?#Brexit is principally about the UK being master of its own destiny - what is wrong with that?
There must be some people that have carefully thought through the ramifications of #brexit but I've never met one yet. When asking what sort of benefit to expect the only answer I get is "you lost" and "get over it". That's all they have.
FT: The #Brexit vote two years ago has damaged the UK economy, as a weaker pound has squeezed household incomes and uncertainty has hit investment. On that, economists from all sides agree 
It's always funny to hear Brexiteers refer to the EU as them. They conveniently forget that the UK was/is a leading member of the EU institution.UK has only voted against EU laws 2% of the time since 1999.Voting record since 1999:No: 56Abstained: 70Yes: 2466#Brexit 
Staggering that as a remainer I couldn't and can't support the #PeoplesVoteMarch as its focus was the destruction of the current Labour Party and not the end of #Brexit

For real though. What use is @theresa_may to Great Britain? She clearly can't get #Brexit done which is the whole reason she has her job and she can't even guarantee freedom of speech in her country as the #TommyRobinson situation shows us. She is boldly ineffective and weak.
The US media appears to have finally shown up to cover the #Brexit - #Russia scandal & its uncanny similarities to the #TrumpRussia scandal. These are NOT two scandals, they are ONE LARGE, russia coordinated attack on the US and Europe.
We had a vote, they won, we lost, we must get on with it. Sorry Airbus employees, BMW workers, Siemens staff but, well, as BdePJ would say "fuck business". It's democracy see? You are acceptable collateral damage, you must accept it. Your jobs so that others may profit. #Brexit
UK gov’t: “We’re prepared to walk away with no deal.”Only the question is not “are you prepared TO do it?”, but “have you prepared FOR it?” To which the answer is a resounding “no”. Do you think the EU don’t know this? You’re bluffing with your cards facing out. Morons. #Brexit
I used to be a #Remainer but when I see the people involved with #PeoplesVoteMarch it seems full of the most devious backstabbers imaginable #Brexit has brought the nasties out of the woodwork, The establishment has done its work well. 
Off you go #Scotland prosper and do your thing! @NicolaSturgeon I didn’t support you in the last #Indyref I didn’t want the breakup of the UK. It seems now however that has changed and you cant be held back by #Brexit. You now have my support and blessing! #GoScotland #IndyRef2
The problem is #London is NOT the U.K. as a whole. The U.K. as a whole voted to leave and the sooner you realise that the better. We voted #Brexit and we want out of the #EU and ALL its institutions.
Just looked at the #Brexit protest. What a bunch of self-entitled twats thinking having a demo can overturn Brexit. Leavers worked for this achievement over 20 years. Perhaps they missed the Ally Pally Rally of the Referendum Party. We have equal numbers.
“.. #JacobReesMogg defends his firm setting up fund in #Ireland ahead of possible 'hard #Brexit'-@telegraph And a reminder from @HealingMB about the real deal:  #PeoplesVoteMarch
I was on the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. I can't see the day I'll own my first home, left alone have a second with an au pair. I like much of what Jeremy stands for but he had got it completely wrong about the #Brexit and the EU.
You imply that those who voted for #Brexit and do not support this action do not care.Your condescending approach to #Brexit and your underhand tactics to stop it are not fitting with the Conservative party values.Cc @BroxtoweCons
What those who sing "Where's Jeremy Corbyn?" want is not to destroy Corbyn, but to see him on the platform calling for a #PeoplesVote and an end to #Brexit. We want to be cheering Jeremy Corbyn, not condemning him. #PeoplesVoteMarch
Thank you to everyone who came along #PeoplesVoteMarch People of all ages, every background & from across the UK came together to demand a vote on the final #Brexit deal because they care about their future and in particular their children and grandchildren’s  future
One of these photos contains a crowd of 100k, one is of 50k and the other is clearly a desperate exaggeration #PeoplesVoteMarch #Brexit 
So to put this in perspective, the sum total of participation from Cardiff & Vale in #PeopleVoteMarch was about 30854,572 people in Wales voted for #BrexitThere was a 70% turnout in Cardiff, with 58% voting to leave the EUShould’ve saved yourselves the journey  
#Wales voted to leave.But they didn't vote for this. I'll put money on the  the fact that if #airbus had been put on the table, they wouldn't have voted for #Brexit .#PeoplesVoteMarch#Cymru
Excellent. As an Englishman I’m done caring about England and its #brexit madness. Time for Scotland to move on into the 21st century and leave the ignorant behind. And if England want to change, then stop voting for racist, anti-immigration parties and get a proper constitution.
Lets get this #peoplesvotemarch in perspective.#peoplesvote would have you believe that 100,000 is a massive number.400,000 marched in support of fox hunting of all things (which I am against)100,000 represents 0.5% of those who voted remain.Not so great is it? #Brexit 
#PeoplesMarch cannot wait for her majesty to sign off the withdrawal bill scrapping our membership of the EU on Tuesday. Tuesday's are usually a bit mundane not this Tuesday #Brexit
The largely remain voting #London has a population of about 9 million. On a sunny Saturday afternoon, #PeoplesMarch had to bring in folks from all over the UK to support their “cause” and scraped together about 100,000 to cry over #Brexit - voted for by 17.4 million. 
Gina Miller demands second #Brexit referendum. That would betray the pledge that the first referendum would be final and binding. Just like the Remoaners in the House of Lords, Miller is unelected, self-important, sneering and self-righteous. 
Had the best day today. So much fun at #PeoplesMarchVote meeting all you fabulous people @ali__samson @Ferretgrove @Sillyshib @GuitarMoog @EmporersNewC @dontbrexitfixit to name a few! Over half a million attended & I feel pretty happy this shit show can still be stopped. #Brexit
You really need to work on your basic geography Guy. The EU is not Europe.#ThankEUGoodbye #Brexit 
Just watched the evening news about the #PeoplesMarch today against #Brexit. These were the four selected interviewees. #Brexitmarch
Listened to 4 British academics talking about the subject of #Brexit All 4 had no idea why the British people voted for it. More proof that the elite in Britain is detached from the people completely. No understanding that the nation is fed up with corruption and incompetence.
#fbpe, #PeoplesVoteMarch I'm done with you. I voted remain, have lived & worked in Europe and am more anti-#Brexit than you can imagine. But you have been taken over by anti-#Corbyn cultists when the UK needs a @UKLabour Govt above all else. You've lost my support & that of 1000s
Last week, sadly I had to say goodbye to some friends who lost their jobs. This is entirely due to a market contaction which is entirely due to #BrexitOrdinary people who have done nothing to deserve this find themselves victims of political ideology. #FBPE #StopBrexit
As @Jon_Danzig writes, ‘#Brexit means we'll be poorer, with less sovereignty, fewer rights and protections, restricted trade, and diminished power after we’ve left... It's madness'. RT his report giving all the reasons why #PeoplesVoteMarch was vital. Link 
Your toxic rants, your Corbyn bashing agenda, has actually turned many Remainers off! They’re now standing side by side with @jeremycorbyn and supporting his vision for #Brexit so put that in your millionaire donors pipe, and smoke it  
No-one in politics can ignore such significant support for re-considering #Brexit from, among others, ”farmers, doctors, teachers, delivery drivers, students, fishermen and veterans- as well as former supporters of Brexit” #PeoplesMarch#PeoplesVote
On the #PeoplesMarchVote there is an irony: Remainers claim that Brexiteers didn’t understand what they were voting for in the referendum, yet happily claim the whole country could review and vote on an infinitesimally more complex #Brexit solution for a people’s vote
Brexit is 6699 hours away. #brexit
More police needed to contain half a dozen gammon who showed up than for 200,000 anti #Brexit protectors. 
Could somebody tell me why #Brexit is Corbyn’s fault and not The Tory Party’s?
Thanks to all of our fellow patriots joining the Pro-Brexit march in London today.#Brexit #London #UKFreedomMarch #GenerationIdentity #PeoplesVoteMarch
War veteran:When I was in army & somebody gave me orders, I was expected to carry them out.British people gave this Govt orders to Leave #EU, I expect them to carry that out.People trying to delay & or disrupt #Brexit are effectively committing mutiny!
On hearing her today at the #PeoplesVoteMarch more than ever convinced @CarolineLucas should lead a cross party coalition of the willing ...true democrats in Parl who believe that in a Democracy a #PeoplesVote is the only way to Confirm the Will of the Ppl & validate any #Brexit.
Obey Brussels, or else! Europhile-in-chief Emmanuel Macron vows to punish countries with fines if they refuse to take in their EU quota of migrants:  #Brexit
Sir Lockwood Smith - "You’ve got to be out of the customs union, out of the single market, none of this sort of new customs partnership business."The rest of the world won’t take you seriously and you’re a big player. The UK matters, fifth biggest economy in the world." #Brexit 
The EURef was DEEPLY divisive 52%/48%.The 48% are being ignored by May & her #Brexit teamScotland & NI voted overwhelmingly to *remain* - they're also being ignored.I believe the divisions may take decades to healWill a *Peoples Vote* heal the divisions ?I really DON'T know.
Nigel Evans MP - "I think part of the problem is some people are like Private Frazer, who think we’re all doomed. They think we’re on the Titanic and I think we’re on the Starship Enterprise." #Brexit

It was good to speak to @ShehabKhan of the @Independent earlier this month about why I left the @Conservatives & joined the @LibDems, the dangerous effects of the Tories shift to the right & how this coupled with #Brexit is devastating for our country. 
Today, 23rd June 2018, marks the second anniversary of historic vote to leave the EU. It also marks two years of utter failure on the part of the government to exhibit any leadership or set any #Brexit clarity, direction or objectives. The word incompetence comes to mind.
Thousands of people marched through central London to demand a vote on any final #Brexit deal 
It’s about resentment for your fellow BritonsResentment from the middle classes, the entitled, and the elitists. They can’t stand the thought that the common working class had the cheek to winThey’ll do anything to undermine us #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch
Full British #Brexit please Prime Minister. 
You don't see pro-brexit turn out's like the #PeoplesVoteMarch. That's because there's no cohesive #Leave movement, just splinter groups wanting different flavours of #Brexit, none of which have any tangible benefits. 
The answer to the Lib Dems chanting “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?”:About 32% ahead of you in the polls #Brexit
Generation Identity activists were among the crowds at the Belfast Brexit rally. Standing alongside Loyalists and Nationalists @CRobertsID delivered a compelling speech. Read it here: #Brexit #Brexitmarch #UKFreedomMarch #thepeoplesvote #GenerationIdentity
Whatever the eventual outcome of #Brexit there will be supporters & naysayers. But I feel being able to control our own borders & make our own laws is a worthy goal.The UK has the creativity to make an economic success eventually after short term pain.
Your party has turned the UK into a #Brexit basket case, your policies are literally killing people, you are now the most right wing government in UK history & you defy the democratically expressed will of the people of Scotland. What do you expect to be called?
“I’m David ‘Dummy’ LammyI said black & white smoke at the Vatican was ‘racist’I said there were no police on the streets with one standing behind meI said indepndence-restoring #Brexit is ‘madness’I’m almost as stupid & comical as Diane Abacus”#PeoplesVoteMarch #FBPE
Thanks so much to everyone who came out to make the #peoplesvotemarch such a brilliant day!  Real hope and inspiration in the air - we can do this.   Democracy didn’t die with the referendum 2 years ago - and people have a right to a say #Brexit 
Memelords voted for @realDonaldTrump Memelords helped @UKIP get 10,000 more members overnight when it had basically died.And memelords will make #BREXIT happen.Because the real reason we love memes is because they reveal the underlying truth that society won’t talk about.
Disgusting. I have as much a right to make my views on #Brexit heard as anyone else. Proud to be British. And not going to be told by anyone that my heritage means I can’t march for a #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk @FFSake_ 
When the @bbc accidentally mess up and televise footage from the pro #Brexit march in London today instead of the #stopbrexit and #PeoplesVoteMarch.You can literally hear the disappointment in her voice
Great to see so many protesting in London against the madness of #Brexit. Great also to see the saltire there #FBPE
LP members are *not* attacking the #PeoplesMarchVote , just those who are distracting from the real culprits behind #Brexit by wrongly attacking Corbyn. They need to focus their efforts appropriately and constructively.
Thank you ⁦@UKFM23June⁩ and all of you wonderful patriotic people! We WILL win and deliver our #Brexit. 
Which bit of "its a democracy" don't these commie losers get? The vote didn't go their way so they want another one. If that don't go our way, I'll want a third referendum #brexit 
Two years on and Great Britain is still in the European Union, 100.000 Brits march the streets of London to keep it that way. Brexit is the biggest con in living history.#Brexit #PeoplesMarchVote
I’m on @BBCRadio4 just after 5pm to talk about the #PeoplesMarch (this incredibly unprejudiced gathering of democracy-loving people) and why, two years on, #Brexit is still brilliant. Tune in. (Photo courtesy of @spikedonline who have been at the march.)
I'm young(ish), voted Remain, and fully standby #Corbyn's position on #Brexit. I don't need Baldric telling me I've been betrayed, ta.
Digby Jones finally loses the plot, he seems to think Airbus are in cahoots with #Remain to stop #Brexit. As a failed businessman @Digbylj needs to realise that real multinational businesses are run by professional business people, they don't play at it.
Huge turnout at the #PeoplesVote  march, which is not a surprise given that #Brexit is looking to be costly, damaging and nothing like what was promised by the #Leave campaign and Brexit ministers
You boo #Corbyn if you want to at the march of the well-heeled today. Me, I’m not for turning back. Least of all to please the most expensively shod marchers London has ever seen. Fuck Blair Campbell Robinson Lib-Dems et al. #Brexit
The @BBC have now deleted this @BBCWomansHour tweet which outs their blatant anti #Brexit bias.They obviously don’t want people to see it because it confirms what we already know.You know what to do Twitter.  
It's a real emotional day. Thinking back to 2 years ago I so clearly remember the shock and sadness I felt. Since then I've joined the fight against #brexit and our elected representatives have let me down time and time again. #PeoplesVoteMarch #BrexitIsPersonal
Aerial footage of the #PeoplesVoteMarch shows thousands joined the protest to demand a vote on the final #Brexit deal. Read more about today's march here: 
The absolute state of these #PeoplesVoteMarch folk.Proof right here that they are going bonkers. Absolutely stark raving bonkers.Imagine wanting to do thisEven worse, imagine actually doing it #Brexit#EUWithdrawalBill
It is not just Conservatives who voted #brexit You, like the Labour leader are dismissive of the Labour northern heartlands who voted to leave too. It is not a party thing wanting to take back control of Britain's future. 
Awkward Corbyn, despite playing a shameless, two faced game on #Brexit, is one of the most ardent EUrophobes. He could never carry out his programme of mass, forced, state ownership whilst we are in the EUI thought remainers were supposed to be bright? 
Scenes from the #PeoplesVoteMarch today. Over 100k people demanding a #FinalSay on the #Brexit deal. This isn’t over. #FinalSayForAll #FBPE

As Americans we need to support our friends across the pond and their fight for #BREXITJust as we dumped tea into the Boston Harbor, may they forever dump the EU.
With zero assessment of the impact of #Brexit on women, no demonstrated learning from how austerity and economic downturns hit women worse, and no meaningful Parliamentary vote on the final deal, a #PeoplesVote may be the only way women can have a meaningful say
Meanwhile, whilst the anti-Brexit loons take to the streets with their ‘No to Brexit’ placards (in 74 different languages), the Brexiteers are like....’whatever’...#Brexit - Leave & Thrive  
We've had a #PeoplesVote. It's called a referendum! A million more people voted to leave.  Would you be marching if you had won? I think not, Respect the result. #Brexit #BritainsFutureIsBright
Incredible scenes as so many people from across UK call for their say on a final #Brexit deal - because jobs, living standards, rights and our public services are at stake  #PeoplesVoteMarch
A huge privilege to be on #PeoplesVoteMarch with Welsh hill farmer David Hardwick - first time he’s ever been to London in his life, but he’s made the effort because he’s so worried about the harm #Brexit would cause.#ExitfromBrexit #PeoplesVote
For once even the BBC can't bury this news story. Hundreds of thousands from all corners of the UK are telling @theresa_may that the country isn't united behind #Brexit.BREXIT IS NOT THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE #PeoplesVoteMarch

Massive ant-Brexit march in London and massive pro-Scottish independence march at Bannockburn, both on same day, confirms that #Brexit has only succeeded in unleashing a political and constitutional crisis of mammoth magnitude. #AUOBBannockburn
Proud to join the 100,000+ people on the #PeoplesVoteMarch asking for a say on the final #Brexit deal. Time for Leaders to listen! 
Spot on...#PeoplesMarch #Brexit #STOPBrexitSaturday #StopBrexit #BrexitAnniversary
Two years ago the silent majority stood up to the elites and corporate globalist bullies, and defied them. Let’s celebrate this historic exercise in democracy, but remember the fight continues to ensure our voice is heard & we get a full #Brexit. Happy Independence Day! 
This quote from our greatest Briton of the 20th century has worn extremely well and if only he were our PM today he would have had the strength of character and leadership to achieve #Brexit and see off the retribution of the ideological Brussels elite. 
Massive turnout at #PeoplesVoteMarch in London. As in the US, Brits are facing the tragedy of a future shaped by a xenophobic minority who colluded with Russia #Brexit 
Those on today’s #PeoplesMarchVote are outnumbered by over 170:1 by those who actually voted to leave and by over 180:1 by those who tuned in to watch England v Tunisia and even by 6:1 by those who voted UKIP at the last General Election. Not a game changer, in short. #Brexit
BINGO#Russiainterfered in #Brexit using the same strategies (illicit financing, bots/trolls, ultra-nationalism) and some of the same players (#CambridgeAnalytica, Bannon, Mercer) as #TrumpRussia.This was NOT “coincidence.” It was a COORDINATED attack

If we all work together WE CAN rewrite this horrible story of #Brexit. There is still time to give people a #FinalSayForAll if we all work together for an #ExitFromBrexit. #PeoplesVoteMarchRT if you agree.
That moment when we exercised our democratic vote to leave the #EU.Those who voted remain who are, still losing their minds, should look at those who voted remain, but have since accepted the result.It is time to come together#IndependenceDay #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch
Half the country including me know #brexit will be resounding success once we have our freedom & our money back, the other half will be crying into their quinoa moaning that we can't be dictated to by unelected foreigners in Brussels anymore & will have to make our own decisions 
Today in history: the #Brexit vote took place today in 2016... 
23rd June 2016 - A political moment that swung the pendulum of western politics. RT if you agree. #IAmBritish  #Brexit 
We waited forty years to have a voice; two years ago today, we spoke and voted to leave. We decided Britain's future. Today let us raise our flag  with pride as we lead on to a bright and prosperous future as a free and independent nation. #EUReferendum #Brexit

The Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson wants a British Brexit, he's not interested in job's, investment, in fact he told EU officials 'Fuck Business', there you go, that in two words sums up the tory approach to #Brexit, one question, why hasn't this tub of lard been fired?
'Why I loathe Brussels: They steal our fish, squander our cash and treat our views with contempt'  #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch
#JeremyCorbyn rightly predicted the effect of #Brexit on  #Airbus
Very frustrated that I can’t now join this march. But it will be further proof, if any was needed, that the anger caused by #Brexit will not abate and the divisions it has exposed will not begin to be healed without a People’s Vote. 
The latest ITV poll says if there was a new #Brexit referendum people would vote 53% To 47% to remain in the EU. I support a second referendum - A PEOPLE's VOTE - on the terms of the final Brexit deal. I'm marching for that vote in London today. 12 noon in Pall Mall SW1. See you! 
I voted Remain (through gritted teeth). The barely concealed contempt for our democratic decision,  and the attempts to actively damage us, from the EU since, means I'd crawl through broken glass to vote Leave if there was another vote.  #brexit #HappyIndependenceDay
They rant about project fear, but the real project fear was the decade long attempt of the right-wing press to whip up fear and hate against the EU, immigrants and refugees. #StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch
EU collapse:- UK: #Brexit- Greece: bankrupt- Slovenia: populist win- Sweden: anti-migrant party 1st in poll- Poland: judicial reform, anti-migrant gov't- Italy, Austria, Hungary, Czech, Denmark: anti-migrant gov't- Spain: independence Catalonia & Basque, looming elections 
It’s #IndependenceDay. The anniversary of our #Brexit vote two years ago. Just as a reminder, the areas in red on this map voted to leave the failing EU. #HappyIndependenceDay
Was watching sky news interviews on #brexit a guy said he thought "Scotland was part of England".. Not the UK but of England.  Realised this guy isn't alone. It's how a lot of people think.      Scotland will never be seen as equals. #indyref2
Last 48 hours summarised: we care about helping business except for when any of them put their heads above the parapet to weigh in on how the UK should leave the EU (but if they're praising the Govt's chosen #Brexit path it's ok)
2 years ago UK growth was highest in EU, today it's the lowest. With more and more business threatening to move overseas today should be renamed We're All Paying For Stupid day.#Brexit 4 Dummies

Wherever you stand on #Brexit that is pretty tragic. 
BIAS: The UK state broadcaster headlines (promotes) an anti #Brexit march in advance to help swell the numbers. Compare that to freedom of speech and anti terror marches #ScrapTheLicenceFee

We just HAD to do this one... watch #LoveIsland's Hayley Hughes put her burning #Brexit questions to the BBC's Brussels reporter @adamfleming  
The @spikedonline article on #Brexit we published two years ago today, as voters went to the polls, had the headline: Why today is a great day for democracy.A very important read today, after two years of attacks on democracy from the political class: 
Why I loathe Brussels:"For me, referendum result was turning point I’d hoped for since 1979.The people had achieved what the politicians had failed to do.It’s a shame it took so long & so much damage was done before it came."#Brexit #EU via @MailOnline
Here we go! @BHGreens @CarolineLucas w/ @BHforEU and @peterkyle have just boarded the train. On the way to #PeoplesVoteMarch to send a message from Brighton and Hove: Give people control, give people a say on the #Brexit deal! 
On this anniversary of the #Brexit vote, my thanks go to Britain for her generosity. Not just £40bn but your aerospace and motor industries as well.  #ThankYou
.@Femi_Sorry - Who signs a deal without seeing it first... a #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal is the only democratic way forward. People were promised a better deal & if the Govt doesn't deliver a better deal it should be up to the people to decide.#FBPE #PeoplesVoteMarch
The Airbus "threat" taken apart.  They have neither the supply chain nor technology base to move. #emptythreat All part of the no change, #Remain strategy. #Brexit
Happy Independence Day. #Brexit 
On way to the @peoplesvote_uk march on #Westminster with brilliant  campaigners from #Cardiff and across South Wales - it’s time to speak up against this reckless #Brexit and give people a say on the deal @WalesForEurope @Open_Britain #PeoplesVoteMarch
Today marks 2 years since Scotland voted clearly and decisively to remain within the European Union and this would be the best option for Scotland’s future. Find out how @scotgov is committed to #ProtectingWhatMatters throughout the #Brexit negotiations: 
Post the Brexit vote of June 23rd 2016 we have had two years of this extenuated hissy fit from the emotionally unstable Remainers. The media promote it, May plays along with it, but WE said OUT and we will accept nothing less #Brexit 
The only bog roll we need at the moment is one to clear up the disgusting mess being made by Boris and his mates #Brexit 
Our Foreign Minister and head @foreignoffice has just responded to a question on #brexit from a foreign diplomatwith the words ... "Fuck business!"Is this a new @Conservatives govt policy ?Or, is he speaking on behalf of #ERG and #Legatum ? 
There is also a #FreedomMarch in favour of #Brexit in London today.@AMDWaters Leader of @ForBritainParty will speak at it.UK media will report on the #StopBrexit march but not the #ProBrexit march.Thee bias of the UK media is blatant.
EU officials: “more than 50% chance the U.K. leaves with no deal” Splendid. No deal is precisely the Brexit I voted for #Brexit
Why @BBCr4today are you ignoring the pro #Brexit march where I’m speaking and @GerardBattenMEP? No wonder listeners are leaving in their thousands
Awake to jingoistic mind-rotting bollocks from Johnson, Fox and Davis and intellectually vacuous discussions of #Brexit on #r4today . These are some of the most depressing times of my life.
Vince Cable - Public opinion is now moving.. people feel very strongly that #brexit is a mess. Whether you're for brexit or against it public opinion is now showing strongly that the public want a #PeoplesVote on the final deal.#StopBrexit #FBPE #peoplesvotemarch @vincecable
Can't wait for @mattzarb to explain to @mjrobbins that Airbus are talking about the consequences of a no deal #Brexit, something Corbyn opposes but which Tory "rebel" Dominic Grieve made possible by voting against his own amendment. But yeah, by all means, blame Corbynites. 
“There are only a few months to go until we leave the EU, & embark on a bright new future. One that sees us going out in the world, to forge relationships with old friends & new allies, banging the drum for British business & talent” @DavidDavisMP #Brexit
´Fuck business’ says the shameless @BorisJohnson who said #Brexit would deliver a huge economic boost. 
2 years ago the British people made the historic decision to leave the EU racket. I'd vote exactly the same way today; 3 or 4 times if i lived in Hackney.#Brexit#Leavethe4threich.
Never give upNever shut upNever sit downNever back down.Never walk awayNever turn your faceNever stop shoutingNever stop caring.Never let them winNeverEverLet them win.#stopbrexit #peoplesvotemarch #fbpe #brexit #Torylies #democracy #IamEuropean 
Ahoy #Brexit Journalists: this is a huge story. Ask Boris Johnson etc what no deal would mean for a British qualified French doctor in Lyon or a British qualified British architect in Spain. Or are they the lucky ones who are going to do all that fruit picking? @BritishInEurope
In the week that ⁦@JunckerEU⁩ visited Dublin and Theresa May defeated pro-EU Tory rebels, here’s my latest take on #Brexit, two years to the day since the referendum @RTENewsNow 
A #PeoplesVote is win win for Britain. If brexit supporters are right and we get a good deal, it will be accepted. If not, the peoole will reject it a bad one or no deal #brexit. Anyone against #PeoplesVote can only have their own agenda at heart. @peoplesvote_uk
The Lib Dems are now a laughing stock... pretending they just want a #peoplesvote when we know full well they want to overturn #BrexitWe had a vote on their manifesto a year ago & the people weren’t impressed!Turns out Lib Dems are neither liberal or democratic  
Yesterday we had warnings from serious experienced people about huge #Brexit damage.  Here is the considered “bog roll” response from a senior @GovUK Minister...Boris Johnson warns Theresa May not to deliver a ‘soft, yielding and infinitely long’...
Even though many disagree with me on the proper way to eat crumble (cold with cream) and pork pie (brown sauce), we all agree #Brexit is a fucking disaster and that is why we are marching today in London. For your future, for your kids, for our country. #StopBrexit
Dear @BBCNewsRemember I wrote to you in March as your app was broken? I trust you have had your best engineers on the case?Well FYI today would be a great day to test their hard work as there will be another huge #Brexit March for a #PeoplesVote - #StopBrexitSaturdayTaJon
Best wishes to all who are celebrating today! Let's hope we can all come together again and move forward as a country again now! #independenceday #brexit #EUref
What's the cost of #Brexit so far?New analysis by the CER – estimates that the UK economy is 2.1% smaller as a result of the vote to leave the EU. The knock-on hit to the public finances is now £23 billion per annum – or £440 million a week#FBPE
See you soon @Devon4EuropeFrom all over the UK, groups & also individuals are on their way to London for the #PeoplesVoteMarchIt's glorious weather, so join us at Pall Mall from 12 to march on Parliament & demand our voices be heard on #BrexitIt's OUR turn to make history! 
2 years ago 17.4 million people took part in a real #PeoplesVote . We marched to our polling stations and voted for change. For 2 years we've been called racist, ignorant and stupid and that we can't have change by all the powers that be. Decision made. Time to implement #Brexit 
I’ll be speaking later at the #PeoplesVoteMarch in London...come down! Pall Mall, London. 12. #PeoplesVote#Brexit 
Since 1973 we've been under the heel of the EU dictatorsTwo years ago today we voted to get our freedom back at last.It's taken far too long but we'll finally #Brexit on 29/3/19.If the Tories don't deliver the Brexit we voted for,then we will have to vote in a Gov that will.
It will be great to see everyone at the #PeoplesVote, bravely campaigning against democracy. Please join me next week when I'll be campaigning against Sadiq Khan's appointment, last week's lottery numbers, and the result of the Battle of Hastings. #Brexit
2 years ago today: a new dawn broke, did it not? #EURef #Brexit 
“People, particularly in London, tend to think #Brexit is making us more inward. It’s the reverse of that. “It gives us a fantastic market with one and a half billion English speakers around the world. It’s a great future.” #Commonwealth
The holes are starting to show in the country's economyTaking apart and remaking  the fabric  of 40 years ....in 2 years..#Brexit is madness. 
I agree it is time for do or die. Either Scotland accepts English #Brexit & thereafter total domination by England or we light the "Fiery Cross" & declare rebellion! 
Are you undecided whether to join tomorrow’s march in London for a #PeoplesVote?#brexit can be stopped, but only by MPs.MPs have to SEE how you feel. Demonstrating opposition is ESSENTIAL.No need to bring anything or dress up.Please, if you care, just come along. Pls RT 
The People were sold a fantasy #Brexit. Brexit will destory British Jobs. Now the reality is hitting home it is the patriotic duty of us all, if we voted Leave or Remain, to #StopBrexit
This is the kind of conspiracy theory about #FBPE coming from a noisy minority of Corbyn's supporters, reminding us it is not only rabid nationalism that is echoing the genocidal politics of the 20th century, it is also a resurgent politics of leader-worship. #Brexit #StopBrexit
For the first time BBC TV news, Sky and ITV have all led with a #Brexit story: Airbus, backed up with supply chain graphics etc and other backups, as BMW, Rolls-Royce, Range Rover, Unipart etc #Carmaggedon
Tomorrow I will be marching in the #PeoplesVoteMarch - the second time I have marched this year, the second time I have ever marched.The consequences of #Brexit are huge. We all deserve a #FinalSayOnTheDeal
I don't believe May & the Brexiter elite have any #Brexit negotiating strategy, not even a 'threaten to blow your foot off' strategy.  The Government's inability to agree amonsgt themselves, makes the case for a #PeoplesVote leading to an #Exitfrombrexit , even stronger.
The Airbus situation has now made UK Gov show its hand that the No Deal scenario is the bluff we always knew it was. #Brexit
I shit on your fucking #Brexit. I will put our future, our economy before your petty fucking party loyalty. There is no #BrexitDividend, there is no deal that will not severely fucking harm our business interests and the lives of those dependent on those businesses. #StopBrexit
Dacre & the right-wing press have not introduced fascism into the UK, but they have injected several key fascist ideas into our political culture. And if there were a grave economic crisis in the next few years, fascist politics would find fertile ground in which to grow.#Brexit
ITV News at Ten reported there is to be an anti #Brexit march in London tomorrow. No mention of any other marches. @itvnews total misrepresentation, completely untrustworthy, biased and useless.
Boris: 'We will have the freedom to bust out of the corsets of EU regulation and rules - to do things our way, to make the most of British leadership in the growth sectors of tomorrow. #Brexit is the chance to turbo charge those capabilities" 
BBC News's latest anti-Brexit report 'forgot' to mention that Airbus is part-owned by the governments of France, Germany and Spain - and gets EU funding.  #Brexit
#Airbus VP Katherine Bennett now retweeting Labour Kier's negative Remain propaganda. She was happy to support the PM Theresa May manifesto to deliver #Brexit when she was on the Conservatives Party Parliamentary candidates list & going for seat selections for last years election 
Should've listened to Corbyn - he warned about a Tory Brexit a long time ago. Given Tory majority of votes on #Brexit in Parliament & given that Tory MPs will not vote against Theresa May, it's all pretty much in Tory hands now. Labour doesn't have enough votes 2 stop it#Remain
Fell off my seat when I seen this  @theresa_may @arlene @bbceastenders #dot #nick #BrexitShambles #brexit #indyref2
As #Brexit negotiations start to look more precarious, major international businesses like Airbus and BMW are issuing serious warnings about their future UK investments and operations. But it is not clear that the UK government is listening.
Under the European model of crony capitalism, political and business elites are often as thick as thieves. Project Fear must be understood in this context.  #Brexit
Remember this?"There were cheers of jubilation as Vote Leave came out top in Flintshire"This is where they make Airbus wings.Hopefully the people of Flintshire can now understand how damaging #Brexit is and join us in London tomorrow!
Airbus has very close links to the French, German and Spanish governments, which are major shareholders in the firm. The EU and four of its member countries provided billions of dollars in subsidised financing to Airbus:  #Brexit
Couldn’t have said it better  #Brexit #LeaveEU
Now Unipart says that #Brexit is likely to kill our car manufacturing industry - don't let the Tories finish off the job Thatcher started!  
Every high street shop could close, every service provider shift to Dublin, every manufacturer move production away, and Brexiters would claim it’s nowt to do with #Brexit/it’s a conspiracy/it will be outweighed by magical benefits. It’s a religion. Belief can’t be reasoned with.
Ready for tomorrow ...#UKFreedomMarch#Brexit#ForBritain
Tell them to bugger off! We don't need reliable cars or planes. We can make our own unreliable crap like we used to. Who needs a job anyway? We have an excellent welfare system for all those who lose their jobs, and houses, and lively hood! GO #BREXIT!
#Brexit is struggling because it was an impossible promise of sunlit uplands sold on a compote of lies & deceit where anyone dissatisfied with their lot was told it was the fault of the EU.Micro-targeted advertising, courtesy of the now defunct #CA, helped convince the gullible.
BMW joins Airbus in #Brexit warningMr Robertson(BMW UK boss) said he needed to know what the government's preferred position was on customs & trade within months or his company - and the UK's - competitive position could be harmed.#FBPE
Just had a #Brexit round table meeting with my constituents asking them what they would like to see for the UK Post-#Brexit. One of them kindly put their views to camera. 
Remind me, which business sectors in the UK benefit from #Brexit?
John Major is absolutely right on #BrexitDifficult to comprehend how Conservative party of which Major, Heseltine & Patten were leading lights has changed to where many are dogma-driven, xenophobic populists.Frankly I'm surprised they're prepared to remain associated with it. 
Politicos going into meltdown over Airbus statement trying to repudiate it are quite revealing. Why so concerned if you're that confident in the current #Brexit course? Just ignore and move on
‘Not project fear, just dawning reality’. This stark warning from Airbus is proof positive of why an #EEA-based #Brexit has always been the only viable option. It is vital and urgent that both the govt + leadership of my own Party now hear this message. 
Latest from @jonathanchait: Britain Has a Russia Collusion Scandal Now. It Looks Exactly Like Trump’s.  #TrumpRussia #TrumpColluded #Brexit
Will #Brexit be an economic and political disaster? Yes says Airbus. No says @sammywilsonmp. Mind at rest.
I genuinely cannot deal with this level of stupid. #Brexit 
In the event of crashing out of the EU, adopt the Brexit Brace Position | This week's @theipaper cartoon...#Airbus #Brexit 
Someone should produce a dystopian movie about a #Brexit Britain in about 15 years time, populated by the poverty stricken old, ignorant drunks and fascist thugs working for tax-dodgers, money-launderers & crooks from around the world inhabiting fortified luxury estates.
In my mind I have personified #Brexit as an English bloke called Steve who has filed for divorce but refuses to open any letters from his solicitor and instead just watches three world cup matches a day followed by Love Island before passing out drunk on the sofa.
Airbus, 14,000 direct jobs, 110,000 supplier jobs and £ billions in taxes, all under threat from #Brexit.#Leavers your challenge for today. As you knew what you were voting for, defend your decision to the 124,000 people whose jobs could be lost. #ProjectReality
It is vital that we all unite against #Brexit for our future generations - my recent conversation with @SODEMAction.
Unilever, Barclays, J Land Rover and now Aerospace all moving jobs to EU due to #Brexit. This will hit our economy & harm British families. A scenario denied by Fox, Rees Mogg & Co. Brexit is now unfolding with chilling speed #FBPE
Farage is now claiming #Brexit being done badly is to blame for Airbus planning to relocate. Erm, I think he added too many words. Take away the 'being done badly' and it's spot on.
 to @EdPentlandsCLP @WatfordLabour and Chelsea & Fulham CLP.  On the eve of the #PeoplesVoteMarch - all three local parties have passed motions calling on @UKLabour to change policy and back a #PeoplesVote. You can be next. #Brexit is not inevitable.  
Good to catch up with the Taoiseach @campaignforleo after the British-Irish Council Summit in Guernsey - we even got to enjoy some sunshine as we discussed #Brexit and Scottish/Irish relations. 
Dutch @Douane preparing for #Brexit. I enjoyed meeting newly recruited customs officials and discussing with managers of Customs  and National Food Safety inspection operational solutions for the unfortunate consequences of Brexit. 
I've been out in #Clapham this afternoon telling people about @peoplesvote_uk and our big March tomorrow. Join the campaign to give the people a say on the final #Brexit deal: 
Tim Martin: We IMMEDIATELY save £10 Billion a year!“The Australian high-commissioner said no-one ever lost out from free trade.We [also] pay a lot of tariffs to EU which is collected on non-EU imports."#Brexit #Leave #EU
Seems Cambridge Analytica may have had Clinton emails a month before Wikileaks & the Trump campaign began exploiting them.And that May's government has not been over-helpful to the Mueller inquiry.Why?And what does it know about Russia & #Brexit?
The government have only now (2 years after #referendum !) acknowledged that #Brexit poses particular problems for #aviation and have just advertised for  a head aviation negotiator. You couldn’t make it up!
I would like to thank @Nigel_Farage personally, as well as Leave in general for all the lovely new #Airbus jobs it looks like we’ll be getting in the rEU.And people say there’s no such thing as a #Brexit dividend.
I caught up with Scottish FM @NicolaSturgeon and @fmwales Carwyn Jones after the formal summit here in Guernsey. Spoke about #Brexit & shared priorities. 
Interesting to see @Nigel_Farage preparing *the #Brexit was stabbed in the back legend*. The more that goes wrong - and there is a lot to come - the more he will blame the implementation of the idea not the fact that Brexit is fatally flawed. 
#Brexit is a fucking shambles ( contains swearing and mentions of people who like doing Nazi salutes) pic.twitter.com/tJ6oU3vc10
Nigel Farage: Scrap #EU "Common Fisheries Policy,Common Agricultural Policy,Working time directives-I could go on!We want to be our OWN countryWe want to govern our OWN countryWe want to be independent people!We don’t want Juncker governing us!#Brexit
Good to see others pointing out that we need more time on #Brexit. It‘s a no-brainer that if it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing well regardless of how long it takes - I said as much in my resignation statement @EveningStandard @George_Osborne 
Pragmatic #brexit wanted by MP who voted to give the government a no deal option?Nope, I can't square that one either 
Discussions on shared interests and continued cooperation, including concerns in light of #Brexit, between FM @NicolaSturgeon & Ireland’s Taoiseach @campaignforleo while at #BICGuernsey
Michael Portillo - "People are worried about immigration, they are worried about a change in values, they are worried about how they absorb these numbers of people. They are worried about public expenditure, they are worried about their jobs." #Brexit 
David Coburn MEP - "What you need to do is negotiate with us fairly – not the way that Mr Verhofstadt and his chum Barnier are behaving in a way that turns British people off and turns us into your enemies." #Brexit 
Leavers think Britain can import talented workers like a commodity. They are deluded. Talented workers choose where they live & work, and many will not choose a hostile Britain that treats them as barely tolerated intruders. Many already here will leave.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE

Today I've seen tweets saying TB, scurvy & other diseases have returned aplenty to UK. I've read that many big business's are leaving the UK through #Brexit shambles. I've seen UK trolls trouncing the ScotGov, and it's been horrible So my feelings are #DissolveTheUnion  ASAP 
Airbus is not alone in wanting to up sticks and leave Britain - this list reveals all  #Brexit #Airbus
UK: Two years after the Brexit vote, a majority of voters would vote to remain in the European Union, Survation poll says. #Brexit
As Great Britain is embroiled in conflict with the #EuropeanCommission about the exact terms for #Brexit, Poland is being threatened by Brussels with sanctions over its judicial reform.As a result, Poland and Great Britain are tightening relations between each other. 
Thank you Catherine De Bolle @Europol for a very informative visit. #Brexit means that we will have to put Europol-UK relations on a new footing, so we can continue protecting the security of citizens. 
Alastair Campbell - May is trying to deliver brexit by only paying attention to the 52% & the 48% can go & hang. Tens of thousands of people will be at the #PeoplesVote march & they don't think #brexit is a done deal & they want the #FinalSay on the deal.#FBPE @campbellclaret
With Blair, New Labour,  EU ruling banking classes, CBI,BBC,Sky News, the Times, Goldman Sachs ,JP Morgan, George Soros, the City,the rentiers,the blood-sucking parasites of Britain’s ruling establishment, & the House of Lords, against #Brexit I’m sure glad I’m on the other side

Airbus is working to create a #Brexit buffer but says that it could abandon the UK if there’s no solid trade deal.  Via @ReutersTV
Thanks to @daily_politics for arranging this blind date between me and @HayleyHughes_xx to talk about #Brexit and #Loveisland. Amazing!
As the emerging #brexit bears no resemblance to what was promised, it’s not surprising that more and more people want a say on the actual deal... 
I really hope those that voted #brexit have the courage to offer themselves up for redundancy first but I bet they won't.... This is what they voted for so should own it. #airbus
You wouldn't sign a bill without checking it first, so why should the #Brexit deal be any different? Join the #PeoplesVote march:

Europe’s biggest plane-maker could abandon the UK if #Brexit takes place without a trade deal.  Via @ReutersTV
Most sensible thing to do now is not abandon red lines but to abandon #Brexit which a clear majority now want. The most Democratic way to achieve it is to give the Ppl a #FinalSay with a #Remain option which a majority of the Ppl also want.Why do U deny the Ppl the choice?
It seems, even after all his time, we keep finding new victims of the madness that is #brexit We must and can stop it @peoplesvote_uk Come March in London tomorrow, make your voice heard. @OFOCBrexit @BritishInEurope @euromove

2 days ago @GeorgeFreemanMP voted to ensure parliament could not reject a “no deal” #brexit.Now he’s crying because companies like Airbus are (logically) planning/leaving UK assuming a no deal #brexit.It’s hard to overstate just how idiotically stupid our MPs are. 
A fascist headline. These are our fellow EU citizens who are here as of right. Paul Dacre deserves to be locked up in the darkest and dampest dungeon for the poison of fascist hate that he has injected into our society#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE

Context: Senior city figure last week, told me last week that big bis keeping quiet on #Brexit because issue so divisive they fear political consumer backlash if they speak up. So it’s very significant that #airbus has spoken to @thetimes
10,000 - UK manufactured parts 14,000 - UK people employed110,000 - UK supply chain jobs"Airbus has confirmed it is considering cutting thousands of jobs in the UK as it starts to “press the button on crisis actions” over concerns about #Brexit."
Paul Waugh: City finance firm Jefferies: “We have wondered why #Airbus is so vocal on #Brexit as by drawing attention to its potential exposure it has nothing to gain, not in share price terms. At least Airbus cares. We are grateful to Airbus for that.”
May must stop the infighting and address the real issues coming from a ‘hard Brexit’ in March 2019. ⁦@Airbus⁩ warning today of its impact on jobs and investment ... running headfirst over a cliff is a gross betrayal of responsibility! #Brexit

Diane Dodds on GMU on Brexit- "DUP are supporting NI and voting in the best interests of NI" what- by voting to support a hard Brexit and a hard border ? Nothing the DUP have done in regards to Brexit has been in the best interests of NI. Not one single thing #Brexit
This is why we are marching for a Peoples Vote tomorrow. The people of Britain are behind us. They want the final say on #Brexit. #peoplesvotemarch
Fantastic labour and trade union movement  rally last night demanding an exit from #Tory Brexit - give British people a vote on the final #Brexit deal! 
Airbus threatening to leave the Uk, strange it manages to construct all its Chinese bought aeroplanes in China by sending all EU manufactured components over to non EU China. It appears that the lack of frictionless EU/China SM rules isn't a problem when it suits? #Brexit

Yesterday, Saturday was the day after tomorrow, now tomorrow is today and tomorrow is Saturday 23rd June, the day I will join many thousands of deeply concerned, ordinary decent people to protest against the #BrexitShambles. #Brexit is bad for #Airbus, #StopBrexit keep Airbus.
‘I think a lot of people in the country are fed up about people who do not realise that the case for leaving has been, to be honest - kind of dismantled’ - Will DryWhat do you think? #Brexit 
“(Ireland) are seriously worried about the state of democracy in Europe. If we’re to learn anything about Brexit it’s that a lot of countries in Europe are saying we are unhappy with what is happening in the EU in our name”#ThankEUGoodbye #Brexit
Airbus have been warning about this for some time, giving evidence to Parliamentary Committees. Lost tax revenues, jobs, etc. All this could be avoided by maintaining regulatory alignment through EEA and customs union membership. #Brexit 
 the reality of disaster that is #brexit : thousands of aerospace job losses around the UK including Chester. For govt this is only about internal Tory politics. For everyone else it’s about real lives, real jobs, real threat to future prosperity.

Good to see @WelshGovernment and @scotgov work together to call on UK to commit to staying inside the Single Market and Customs Union. This is vital to help save jobs and prevent a cliff edge #Brexit 
They say Theresa May's plan for the UK's departure from the EU is not 'consistent with the national interest' #Brexit
#Airbus is making plans to leave the UK in the event of a 'no-deal' #Brexit 
Airbus generates £1.7billion in tax for Britain. That’s approaching a quarter of UKs net annnal contribution to the EU.Has a country ever died from self imposed idiocy before?#brexit - so much winning. 
Airbus warns no-deal #Brexit could see it leave UK Yet the PM still tries to convince us that there are no downsides to #Brexit#ProjectReality it will destroy jobs and industry. 
Tomorrow it’s time to put on a massive demonstration to show that those who understand that #brexit can only harm the UK, their own, and their children’s futures at the @peoplesvote_uk @StopBrexitMarch I will be there with some several #remainernow guys from 11am!See you there!
Can you IMAGINE the outrage if Spain said something similar "X amount of British migrants to stay in Spain after #Brexit including violent criminals"Can you imagine the responses on #BBCQT?
Four million EU nationals will get right to stay in the UK after #Brexit - and violent criminals could be among them 
All UK media morning news repeated every day:1, demonize #Trump in any way possible no matter what he does2, talk down #Brexit in any way possible, frighten the population into losing it's nerve3, continue the poor migrants narrative ignoring dangers of limitless numbers
#Brexit is our generations #polltax - but this time our entire way of life and the foundations of democracy are under assault. Time to #MarchForYourLife#PeoplesVote
This means @carolecadwalla owes a more few people a big fat "I toldya so" for this investigation proving her prescient #Brexit reporting to also be 100% correct.#TheResistance
If you're one of the 14,000+ UK workers employed by #Airbus, or one of the 100,000+ working in the company's UK supply chain......don't take this #Brexit stupidity lying down!Join the #PeoplesVoteMarch this Saturday and tell Theresa May what you think!
Two #brexit stories on the The Times front page:1. “Fruit picking is fun, job seekers told”.2. “Airbus prepares to relocate out of of UK”. Brexit future in a nutshell.Enjoy. 
There you have it, in black and white, on the front page of the Times. Literally tens of thousands of high quality engineering jobs at risk. Once gone, gone forever. But it's ok, cos they can pick fruit. Stop this madness now. #Brexit 
You know what - I challenge any local politician in Northern Ireland to meet me in a public forum, of their choice, to engage & debate on:“How will BREXIT maintain or improve the material & economic well being of Northern Ireland?”#BREXIT
So there you have it, post #Brexit Britain, we loose highly skilled jobs and get encouraged to go and pick fruit. Sleepwalking into a catastrophe
Airbus workers should not worry. Rees-Mogg has promised marginally cheaper lamb imports. #Brexit
Tmr’s @thetimes: “Airbus prepares to take flight” and pull investments from the UK in the event of a hard #Brexit. This is a company with the jobs we need - 14,000 direct & 110,000 jobs. Seriously alarming. What will it take for the establishments running Westminster to wake up! 
Brexit uncertainty now hits Hitachi’s plans.#Brexit own the consequences. 
None of this is about parliamentary procedure. Or internal party wranglings. It is about my constituents' jobs. And the actual money in people's pockets.@laboursinglemkt #Brexit 
Breaking: @Airbus will reconsider all its investments in the UK, and its long-term footprint in the country, in the event of a #Brexit ‘no deal’ • Remember, every single wing on #Airbus commercial aircraft is designed and manufactured in the UK.
And we’re all supposed to go along with this Government’s disastrous #Brexit strategy?! Constituents in manufacturing & service sectors who jobs are at risk will be unforgiving of any more MP fence-sitting ‘constructive ambiguity’ #Airbus #PeoplesVote
Clear support for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal - 48% for vs 25% against. Not surprising given continuing chaos and division in Westminster, no NHS ‘dividend’, less market access, and a £40bn divorce deal with payments till 2064 - not at all what was promised. 
Great Scott !It's that awful Tim *Wetherspoon* Martin on #bbcqt tonight !pronouncing on the so called #Brexit dividend !Give me strength !
Here we go again: more about cheating by #Leave campaign in #Brexit #Referendum and questions about whether current cabinet ministers broke the law...

I nearly threw the hat in today, to give up protesting #Brexit Then I thought, fuck it, I'll stop protesting when we remain or I die. Whichever one comes first.#FBPE
This from a professor of Politics likening Brexit to the Third Reich Ask first is he one of the Liberal Elite who might teach your son or Daughter at University one day.Talking about many dead before the fraud of #brexit Is exposed.The men in the white coats need to be called 
Immigration targets are irrelevant.If #Brexit happens and people voted due to immigration then they are going to get a nasty shock. Every trade deal will require a softening of the UK VISA system.That means more immigration and not less.#PeoplesVote
“When Britain stood alone in 1940 after defeat at Dunkirk, we were cut off & ridiculed. True leadership sometimes feels isolating. Yet we’ve never suffered for it. We’re resourceful & well connected; our brand is strong in the world” @PennyMordaunt #Brexit
Have you any idea how many people would vote for Labour if it dropped its insane support for #Brexit? We would have a Labour govt faster than you could blink.
Good old fashioned attempt to silence anyone who disagrees with your view & undermine them through adjusting the truth to justify your stance; had quite a lot of that from Putin of late.What is a fact is that Labour #Brexit policy is at variance with the maj of members & voters.
Big thnx @Nicva for presenting new case studies on #Brexit impact. Lively & frank discussion after but disappointing to hear SDLP suggest British Govt “soft Brexit” option superior to Special Status or The Backstop proposed by EU 27. Now is time to stand firm with EU & Dublin.

This is what I’ve always said! May told me we were safer in, richer in, stronger in, so I voted in. Now she doesn’t even acknowledge my existence as a Remainer and tells me #Brexit is a big bonanza for Britain and I should shut up.  
Thought @tomhfh got this one correct: the second referendum on #Brexit can go under whatever name the advocates want and it is fooling nobody; this is an attempt to frustrate a democratic decision. 
If they broke the rules, they cheated.In sport, cheaters are disqualified. The #Brexit vote is invalid.#StopBrexit
Leavers also take note . That our constitution allowed parliament to hand the executive their sovereignty, does not make it right . That it’s the ‘ peoples will’ ( Goebbels phrase ) does not make it right . The lights of democracy went dark over Hoc yesterday. #Brexit 
In similar way to Tories, it appears, as we hurtle towards destructive #Brexit , different elements of  Labour have less & less in common.In circumstances it'd be entirely understandable if Chuka Umunna & others decided to plough a different course.

If your worldview makes you hate JRM because he's a rich white man, but love Khan as he's a non-white Muslim, your worldview is wrong. Britain, it’s time to stop with the #diversity agenda, and to go for competence instead. #Brexit #equality #Khanage
Javid accuses EU of dragging its heels, but is not intelligent enough to realise the UK is one country with one set of requirements, but the EU are 27 countries with differing languages, administrations and requirements having #Brexit forced upon them. 
The language of genocide. The fascists must be fought root and branch. There is no place for them in a civilised and humane society. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
oh dear, Nigel Farage now going around claiming 'I never said we would be better off leaving'... maybe he doesnt remember a guy called Nigel Farage writing 'Britain Would Be Better Off Going It Alone' #brexit #trainwreck

There is NO WAY the UK government is going to be able to make a fair, clear and robust #settledstatus system.They are administratively incapable of it, especially in the time required.An urgent rethink to avoid 3 million people landing in legal limbo is needed NOW.#brexit

There is still time to join one of dozens of coaches organised from all over the UK to bring people along to the #peoplesvotemarch on June 23rd. This is a nationwide movement to demand a #peoplesvote on the #Brexit deal.

The EU missed a trick when they passed over Lord Sewell to write their constitution.Just think, if the EU had had a Sewell Convention they could have ignored the Brexit vote, over-ruled the UK's refusal of consent, stopped #Brexit, and grabbed a bunch of powers into the bargain!
Important day for Ireland and #BREXIT today with visit of @JunckerEU and @MichelBarnier to Dublin to show absolute solidarity with Ireland
If you're cheering on the removal of European products to be replaced with domestic ones, you don't get to use the 'Global Britain' moniker. Period. #Brexit negotiations don't change when protectionist instincts are acceptable #consistencyfail
More "sovereignty" and "Democracy"...Despite the fact that I pointed out that it actually says in the #Brexit White papers that "We never lost sovereignty" and our laws are made collaboratively with #EU partners. And all laws have to be passed by directly elected MEPs.
The Brexit we voted for will NOT be delivered. We voted to stop Freedom of Movement, stop paying the EU billions which should be spent domestically, leave the single market and stop EU involvement in our laws. STOP LYING TO THE BRITISH PEOPLE - WE ARE NOT FOOLS !! #brexit

I totally get tory MPs voting to make their constituents poorer, its in their ideology, (i despise them of course) but @UKLabour MPs voting with them on the #MeaningfulVote which could pave the way to a hard tory #Brexit making their voters poorer is fucking unforgivable #bbcnews
1) The people of #Scotland didn’t vote for it2) There cannot be a smooth and orderly #Brexit because all the alternatives cause economic & social damage & dislocation3) On the evidence to date the Tory @GovUk couldn’t even agree on how to deliver a pizza
Key pt on  Leave attacks @ottocrat : reveals their MO - limit free speech - besmirch  anyone who stands up- intimidate#brexit#fbpe
#Brexit sell-out Theresa May needs to wind her neck in. #Trump is doing what he was elected to do, which is more than can be said for her.
"THE EU'S WALL OF HYPOCRISY" - @realDonaldTrump is slammed by EU leaders while you're not told about EU's own back yard.  READ:  #Brexit 
#TheresaMay is today reverting to the mantra of “re-gaining control of our money, borders and laws” . In fact, #Brexit means LESS control over all of them: 
6) Corbyn happens to be the only major pro brexit leader leading a largely anti brexit membership.  His program & Brexit are also incompatible, therefore he's the most obvious figure for anti #brexit pressure & leverage.  That's it, there is no other reason for that pressureEnd/
When will @theresa_may learn that attacking @realDonaldTrump at every turn,is not a good tactic when we want a free trade deal with USA after #Brexit.PM should read the'Art of the Deal.' 
1) Corbyn supporters & #FBPE Simple acid test:If Corbyn was unambiguously anti #Brexit would #FBPE, #OFOC etc continue to "undermine" him? No, of course not, he'd have my full support for a start.These movements are not anti Corbyn, we simply believe Corbyn is pro Brexit
Its simple really. If you want the best result from Brexit, you will get behind Labour, who have maintained integrity around the leave vote while placing workers rights and human rights at the centre of their brexit strategy. They are your only hope for a fair outcome #brexit
If #Brexit is still the will of the majority of the people, why are #Leavers dead against a vote by the public on the final deal, now we are better informed, which includes an option to exit from #Brexit?It's been two years since the original vote. The mood has changed.
'As Mary Berry might have said: this display of concern from the British Government is a bit late and a bit rich'.  Our Chair Jane Golding's statement response to Sajid Javid on the blame-game over UK citizens' rights   @britishineurope #Brexit
All the #Brexit traitor Tory MPs should be immediately  deselected.In their place, Tories should select candidates who will actually vote for the Tory manifesto promises.What a novel idea. 
The only possible benefits of Brexit:1) The Pro EU #FBPE community that has formed in the UK & the fantastic individuals that have emerged as leading lights of the Remain campaign2) Other European countries will see #Brexit for the shitshow that it is & learn from our mistake 
The #PeoplesVote was on 23rd June 2016, in which 17,410,742 voted for #Brexit - the BIGGEST mandate in UK political history. As a #VoteLeave campaigner, I’d have respected a Remain victory. Why can’t #Remoaners?
So not a #brexit dividend then! Just increased borrowing to make it look like one! - Guess what folks! Scotland will get the opportunity to pay 10% of that borrowing and I doubt very much NHS Scotland will see any of that money, it being devolved!  #Scotref #Indyref2
A lot of cognitive dissonance among British pundits asking "how could US political culture deteriorate so rapidly?" whilst viewing #Brexit as just a procedural soap opera rather than a legitimisation of nativist delusions, prejudice and indifference to the suffering of others.
Labour and Tory “rebels” have settled into a comfy pattern: if Labour votes against gov’t, rebels behave. When they vote against gov’t, Labour is told to abstain. So, all can claim in the future “I tried to stop hard #Brexit” without actually doing it. No principles and no spine.
Just can’t understand how so many MPs still support #Brexit when they know it will be a disaster for the country and their own constituents. Any MP should always put country first and party second. Will they admit they were wrong when the UK is on it’s knees? #MeaningfulVote
When I twice discussed devolution  issues with Dominic Grieve he was only really interested in the sovereign rights of the UK Parliament.  That is what he has been fighting  for - not the rights of all those who will be impoverished by his party’s chaotic wrong headed #Brexit
The 4 Labour MPs who voted against the #EUWithrawalBill amendment were: Frank Field (Birkenhead), Kate Hoey (Vauxhall), John Mann (Bassetlaw) & Graham Stringer (Blackley and Broughton). Give each one of them a blue rosette! They've no concern for ordinary working people. #Brexit
Time to be an independent nation once again, take back controls of our laws, money and trade.#Brexit 
Dominic Grieve is a tory i nearly warmed to because of his sensible stance on #Brexit. He has now voted against his own #GrieveAmendment (you couldn't make it up), proving that old adage, when push comes to shove tories will always put party before country, #MeaningfulVote
Just give this video a quick watch and see how farcical the lords made the process of passing the #EUWithdrawalBill How many months did they waste? All for nothing because we are more or less as we started out.#Brexit
I am so sick and tired of what's happening in the name of #Brexit. Corrupt Tories make up their own rules and #Labour either support them or abstain. Only #SNP and #GreenParty offer hope for the future of Scotland. I'm off to the hills for a couple of days. #TheresAlwaystheHills
Thanks to @SNPCupar for organising such a good open meeting on #Brexit  tonight - packed house at Duffus Park Bowling Club and great questions . 
Shame on the following @Conservatives MPs who voted against the will of the British people today:Antoinette SandbachPhillip LeeSarah WollastonAnna SoubryKen ClarkeHeidi Allen#EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit
A lesson for ⁦@Douglas4Moray⁩ that if you want a witness to be helpful to your case it’s best not to approach them in an aggressive manner #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #Independence
So the tory rebels put party before country, they are now going to allow the most vile, inhumane PM in modern history to push through a hard #Brexit, they are fucking spineless cowards, just like the fucking spineless leader they supported, damn the bastards #MeaningfulVote.
Lol. And Yuri Vanitek?Hey, @stevenmnuchin1, weren’t you also on Trump’s finance committee right after #Brexit - joining just as untraceable donations from Facebook “users” soared? Oh yes. You were. 
Pleased to have a chance to discuss #Brexit in @ScotParl today with members of the #Bundestag Committee on Economic Affairs & Industry including chair Klaus Ernst
Ps) that all said, I haven't lost hope.  #PeoplesVote remains our best chance & I still have faith in the incompetence of David Davis, I still believe #Brexit will reverse as the pressure mounts...But what was Grieve thinking?
REMAINERS THIS IS NOT A DRILL!Government and most MPs have shown their complete disregard for those they claim to represent. They are willing to do ANYTHING to push #Brexit through. Be kind to each other, support each other and prepare for Saturday's march! #PeoplesVote 
The moment the Lords backed down and allowed the #EUWithrawalBill to pass.The #Brexit bill will now receive Royal Ascent and will become UK Law.20th June 2018 is a historic day folks 
A parliamentary vote on the final deal would have become a confidence vote in the Government and no matter how many Labour MPs want #Brexit they would vote against in such a scenario bcse they are politicians first - with our own rebels joining them, that could have been fatal. 
The EU withdrawal Bill passed with very little amendment and will receive Royal Assent tonight. Thank God. Bring on the Trade Bill so we can now talk about our great future and people can see what #Brexit will look like. 
So desperate and disgraceful has this Govt become in its handling of #Brexit that they treated my friend and colleague @NazShahBfd in this appalling way today. Despite this Naz voted on behalf of her constituents. /9
The PM at @Policy_Exchange - nobody has voted for anything more in our country than we voted for #Brexit. Nothing would harm our democracy more than failing to deliver it.
Rees-Mogg:You said EU insist on hard border because ‘rules are rules’But EU has not always obeyed the rules, has it?Maastricht Treaty forbids EU states to assume other member debts.But #EU provided Greece with bailout funds in 2009 debt crisis!#Brexit
#AndrewRosindell #MP - "I think that people are getting rather tired of  this. They want the Govt to get on with it. They want to get out of the #EU and get on with the job of building up our own global relations."  #BBC #SKY #LBC #BREXIT @ConHome #Tory #UK
With the way that #Brexit "negotiations" are progressing, I cannot help but think that our Prime Minister would lose in a game of Connect One against an amoeba, even though she had been given the first move.
Yesterday it was Donald Trump saying that immigrants "infest" the US.Today it's Trump fanboy & #Brexit conman Arron Banks describing the House of Lords as a "nest of rats".Fascists really love infestation metaphors. They're a great way to fuel hatred & dehumanise people. 
‘Theresa May defeats Tory rebels and wins #Brexit vote victory’ - there I fixed it. What’s it going to take for @SkyNews to stop their tedious ‘cup half empty’ coverage of the democratic decision 17.4 million of their viewers made about their own country??
Today's #Brexit vote surely dispels the myth that somehow @jeremycorbyn is responsible for the shambles the Tories are creating. Those attacking him, should do something useful for a change and focus their fire on May and her cohorts!
Hello Terry.I am a Tory member, most Tory voters and leave voters agree with Sarah.The vote today though was not about #Brexit but parliamentary sovereignty.60% of Tories back MPs putting country before party on Brexit.47% of Tories want a #PeoplesVote(Survation 13.03.2018)
We must have a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Otherwise we could sleepwalk into something which will be a disaster for our country. Join the march this Saturday. Out of small actions, big change can come.
Strange, nothing about this from @theSNP, nothing from @NicolaSturgeon, @PeterMurrell, @rosscolquhoun or the usual suspects :EU says Scotland has to follow the majority #Brexit decision as we are one UK : 
For those asking who on earth were the #Labour MPs who shamefully supported #TheresaMay and the #Tory government in their attempt to muzzle parliament on #Brexit , I gather they were : @KateHoeyMP@JohnMannMP@gstringermp@frankfieldteam
Once again the #FBPE brigade's poster boy Dominic Grieve capitulated and voted against a meaningful vote on the final #Brexit deal. And once again their whipping boy Jeremy Corbyn voted for it. At what point do they admit the Tories are the enemy, not Corbyn?
Good to hear Guy Verhofstadt confirm at Home Affairs Committee that his earlier statement about there being no great obstacle to indy Scotland joining EU was simply “fact”. #brexit
Can you get any more brexity than pro brexit MPs wildly celebrating winning a vote to deprive the House of Commons power over any #Brexit deal on a referendum they fought explicitly on the basis of returning control to the House of Commons?UKs decent into idiocy continues.
A meaningful vote would've allowed you and everyone else in parliament - voted there by the entire nation - to consider what the government comes back with and then decide if it is good enough for the British people overall. That is the job of an MP and you failed #Brexit
The UK contributed about £9 billion net a year to the EU. The #Brexit divorce bill is about £40 billion.There is no #Brexit dividend for the NHS. Even a pre-teen could understand that simple maths.Theresa May is a LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR LIAR
We had victory today but we should remember that 309 UK MPs voted against the Democratic will of the British people. That is totally unforgivable, there must be REMOVED at the next election. #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit 
The night I stayed up and watched #Brexit pass, then saw the immediate flood of regret from protest voters and ppl who were cavalier because they didn’t think it would happen, I knew we were in trouble. The parallels were uncanny. Boris Johnson even LOOKS like a British Trump.
"The compromise agreed today over a “meaningful vote” for MPs at the end of the #Brexit talks isn’t perfect. But it’s a good enough basis for winning a campaign to get a #PeoplesVote" writes @Hugodixon
The government have defeated #MeaningfulVote by 319 votes to 303 ensuring we can use no deal as a #Brexit negotiating positionThank you to the 4 labour MPs voted with the government @frankfieldteam @KateHoeyMP @JohnMannMP & Graham StringerNo surprises amongst the Tory rebels
So by 16 votes Tories get their way on #Brexit - not only because Dominic Grieve caved but also because Labour MPs voted with them. Guess they must hate the common market more than they dislike the Tories! The chaos continues.
So the hard Tory "take back control" Brexiteers have just voted to have no control, at all, about what #Brexit will be. They actually voted for the UK parliament to have no meaningful vote on #Brexit. This is Alice through the looking glass politics.
John Prescott says he has never seen anything as shameful as Tory MPs refuse to nod through sick Labour politicians  #Brexit #Politics
319 MPs are personally responsible for the UK going over the cliff edge of hard #Brexit on 29th March 2019.   What a horror, Our chance to #StopBrexit diminished horribly with 303 votes to save us & a majority of only 16 to kill the UK. #MeaningfulVote
I just voted to give Parliament a meaningful vote in the event of a no deal #Brexit. This feels like a big vote. Future generations will not forgive those who get this wrong.
#Broxtowe Good Afternoon 52.40% of you voted to LEAVE the #EU and #BrexitYour MP @Anna_Soubry is voting against the Government & her party to accept the Lords Amendment to the #EUWithdrawalBillNO respect for British democracy - NO respecting the EU referendum vote.
It’s a moral imperative to stop separating families. Also, must legislate/compromise on broader immigration. Failure to deal w/ complexities has led to instability in Europe, e.g. #Brexit; elections in Italy, Germany. See my remarks yesterday @EconClubNY.
Not so much a double weird twist as an answer. Hand pt’s power to the speaker then use pretext to change speaker to Brexit loyalist. Media’s already taken care of courtesy of cancellation of #Leveson2 We’re in the midst of an English hard right power grab. #Brexit
Well, well, so called ‘Tory #Brexit rebel’ Dominic Grieve has changed his mind AGAIN and will vote with the Government on the ‘meaningful vote. AGAIN.This is why I say never trust a Tory!#ToryBrexitShambles
#Brexit Peace in our time after Dominic Grieve and @NickyMorgan01 back the Govt. The Remoaners in the Lords have been put back in their place
If #Brexit is such a bloody good idea, then why the f... are so many people dead against it; and why is the PM trying every trick in the book to force it through parliament without proper scrutiny.Wake up #Leavers, you've been conned into supporting a hard right take over.
Looks like Dominic Grieve has let us all down. Still has nothing in writing so will be shafted - yet AGAIN#Brexit
Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, has backed the SNP Scottish Government’s compromise position on the customs union. It’s vital that Scotland maintains its place in the Single Market and Customs Union – to protect our economy, jobs and living standards. #Brexit #brexitshambles
People are NOT happy about #Brexit !! Join @SODEMAction outside @UKParliament
I do not believe the vital issue of whether parliament can set out an alternative way forward in the event of no #Brexit deal should be in the hands of the Speaker. It is not a guarantee. It is not a climbdown. It is not right. 
I have been told that Labour Whips are telling their MPs to vote for the Lords amendments as they want to bring down the Government. They are playing party politics which will harm our #Brexit negotiations, damage our country and our democracy. 17.4million people have spoken!
Apparently the Govt are so desperate to win today's vote that sick MPs will have to come into the division lobbies to vote, tearing up a long-standing convention.  #Brexit at any cost!
@bbclaurak can you please ask the PM, on the next interview, whether the government will be enforcing the EU Anti Tax Avoidance Directive after Brexit. I am amazed nobody in the media has cottoned on to the probable reason for the whole farce. #brexit #taxavoidance
‘Today is #Brexit’s moment of truth. @theresa_may must face down and defeat the Tory Remainer rebels central to the orchestrated plot to reverse the referendumAnd that IS Grieve & Soubry’s game no matter what they pretend’ #EUWithdrawalBill
The Written Ministerial Statement just placed in the Commons library. This is a very significant climb down by the Government and an important reassertion of Parliamentary sovereignty in the face of attempts to treat the Commons as some rubber stamping mechanism. #Brexit 
Could it really be that our country's #Brexit negotiators have absolutely no strategy for success other than threatening to leave with No Deal and just assuming the EU won't let us? Could that really be? The desperation today certainly suggests that
The time has come when it’sno longer acceptableto say you are“Scottish and British”#Brexit with its @Conservatives oppression through #PowerGrableaves you with one simple choiceAre you “Scottish”?Or “British”?
Sad to see @theresa_may at #pmqs repeating the lie about a #Brexit dividend paying for a boost in NHS funding AND pulling her punches about @realDonaldTrump horrendous policy of putting unaccompanied children in cages. Deceit and a failure to provide leadership!
Labour and particularly @johnmcdonnellMP & @Keir_Starmer should take note that former Vote Leave staffer @OliverNorgrove states here that quitting the Single Market could cost between 5-10% of our GDP - which would wreck Labour's plans. #StopBrexit #Brexit
It's back down (rebels) or bring down (Government). Either we accept the biggest vote in British democratic history (repeatedly endorsed by the elected Commons) or give in to the unelected Lords to stay in the antidemocratic EU. #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill
#PMQs so far dominated by two Brexiteers trading dodgy figures about a non existent #Brexit dividend both have promised and neither can deliver. #Corbyn #May #fantasyeconomics
The real hero’s today will be those Labour MPs who despite their personal preference, will honour the will of the people (their constituents) and vote down this blatant attempt to frustrate, delay, prevent #Brexit 
The Prime Minister now confirming there will be NO #Brexit dividend. This much we knew! Now how will the #Tories get that on the side of a bus. #voteSNP
Commons vote on Withdrawal Bill all about whether you trust the government or the commons to put the national interest first on #Brexit. My vote goes to the commons #FBPE
“Labour will vote against the deal won’t it?” @afneil to @Peter_Dowd “You have laid down four conditions, of which two are them are pretty much un-meetable?” #brexit #bbcdp
Never forget. This man asked people to vote on #Brexit. Without defining what Brexit meant. Without carrying out any projections of consequences. All in an (unsuccessful) attempt to settle an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted his mates and f***ed off. #MeaningfulVote
I asked @guyverhofstadt if he thought there could a future framework / political declaration and if it could be completed before transition. "I'm an optimist by nature. But I'm not so optimistic that you can do it in three months." #Brexit 
Today’s vote is about whether parliament has to “take it or leave it” when it comes to the Govt’s #Brexit deal, or if we can make proposals of our own. MPs must have a meaningful say on the most important issue facing our country, which is why I will backing the Grieve amendment. 
The UK is in a dark place when the British Prime Minister is so weak because of #Brexit that she is unable to condemn flagrant breaches of human rights by the US president.The Tories shame us all.
Before @CommonsEUexit @guyverhofstadt makes crystal clear to #DUP that #Brexit puts up a hard border IF UK leaves #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion not the #DUP red herring of fiscal differences because these exist between #EU member states without hard borders
Good old Viscount Hailsham, he really really doesn’t want to lose his EU CAP payments now that he can’t claim to clean his moat on expensesHis average earnings from the taxpayer, thanks to the EU, have been £4K per year just for owning land#Brexit will put an end to this 
Before @CommonsEUexit @guyverhofstadt confirms to me that the compromise put forward by @scotgov in #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope that whole UK remain in #Singlemarket & a #CustomsUnion would be acceptable to #EU & solve #NorthernIreland border problem #Brexit
#solarpower ~ symbolic of #Brexit Britain: Slowest growth of the world’s top 20 solar marketsLowest prospect for growth among European countriesWorst political outlook. The sun has set on this govt's green credentials. 
What happened to the UK?May's Tories are using a marginal result to leave the EU as an excuse to withdraw from non-EU conventions & dump human rights.Corbyn's Labour is spending all its time organising village fêtes to promote Tory #Brexit to the few.Someone get a grip. 
Interesting polling covering GB, NI & IRL. More evidence of layering of Leave/Remain differences upon existing polarisation within NI.This is why zero-sum (ie land v. sea #border) #brexit narratives (& poss. outcomes) pose direct risks to peace & the Agmt 
I wish the whole country could watch Guy Verhofstadt talking to Parliament's #Brexit Committee right now.  WATCH NOW:  He personifies the dysfunctional EU.
I'm told that Jeremy Corbyn is personally attempting to persuade Labour Brexiteers to vote against the govt on "meaningful vote" today. Last week five voted with govt. Could make all the difference. #Brexit
Hope .@UKLabour Led by @jeremycorbyn doesn’t support an amendment from an unelected House of Lords proposed by a Hereditary Peer trying to thwart the #Brexit referendum today. The referendum was the meaningful vote! Get on with it!
"I've said it once and I will say it again, there is no, THERE IS NO #BREXIT DIVIDEND... So have strength and fight on... Because it's not over until it's over! And we will fight for what we know to be right." #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #EUsupergirl #ThereIsNoBrexitDividend
Daily Briefing: - UK PM to face pro-EU rebels over #Brexit - Macron, Merkel agree on 'new chapter' for EU- Hungary set to criminalise aiding illegal immigrants with new bill
Disgrace!“If you were in any doubt over whether we should be leaving EU just take a look at the people we are negotiating with & just take a look at 5th column inside our own Parliament inside our media class who are trying to wreck it"#Brexit #Leave #EU
Today is a key day for #Brexit. The meaningful vote amendment is not acceptable - it would positively incentivise the EU to offer UK a bad deal, and turn constitutional common sense on its head. The Government negotiates, not 650 MPs. In truth, Trojan horse for cancelling Brexit.
Collusion with a foreign power is a terrible crime. Luckily, these UK patriots are meeting with us in Brussels to stop the far-right Russian take over of the UK via #Brexit. 
That’s why today’s vote in @HouseofCommons matters. Parliament can’t do its job - your MP can’t make sure the final #Brexit deal is in your interests - if it doesn’t have a say. But the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty is even more important than that...
The people’s “informed consent” to #Brexit wasn’t given in 2016 because there was no deal to vote on. So we simply couldn’t judge at that point what Brexit terms would be in our best interests and those of our country.... 
We asked Tory MP @BobBlackman #HowWillBrexitBenefitMe?Although polite his answers were from the Tory #Brexit Book of Myths.I've met many people in my 48 years of existence yet I've never heard a single person complain about the shackles of #Brussels#StopBrexit #SODEMaction
It’s Wednesday.And #Brexit is such a futile exercise. Unravelling 40+ years of progress, cooperation and integration. For no gain whatsoever.Simply daft.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote
Democracy is not a game Ms Jenkyns @andreajenkyns. MPs, you need to please support this amendment to give you a meaningful vote on the #Brexit deal. You have a duty to the country first above all else. Please do what is in the best interests for our country. 
Crunch time is approaching for @S_Hammond.  Will he join those Tories who believe in Parliament ‘taking back control’ and vote today to give Parliament a real say in the #Brexit negotiations.
.@DrPhillipLeeMP talking much sense @BBCr4today today’s #MeaningfulVote is about making sure Parliament plays it’s part in securing #Brexit future in best interests of our country
Yes, please let's have a *meaningless* vote on #Brexit, in which parliament exerts no influence over government. Democracy demands that we leave this trifling decision to opaquely-funded thinktanks, foreign billionaires and Number 10 policy wonks.
I don’t think the result of yesterday's EU27/UK negotiations on Northern Ireland got a mention in the UK media. "... serious divergences remain on the backstop for NI/IE. More work clearly needed ...", according to Michel Barnier. #Brexit #fbpe
Despite appearances to the contrary the brexiteers did have a plan for #brexit.They all made sure their own wealth would be protected against the implications of leaving the EU and identified ways to personally gain from it.As for a plan for the rest of country - who cares?
There is no guaranteed extra money - or ‘Brexit dividend’ - to pay for an NHS funding increase.Other costs associated with leaving are expected to more than offset the savings from ending our payments to the EU budget. #Brexit #nhs
If Jeremy Corbyn backs #Brexit, then he must seek a trade deal with President Trump and thus enable both American domestic and foreign policy.Qui cum canibus concumbunt cum pulicibus surgent.If you lie down with dogs....#MeaningfulVote
Few Leavers will like Brexit because most won’t get the #brexit they wanted. No Remainers will like Brexit because they don’t want to leave and think it will be disastrous. No one gets what they want and the U.K. is damaged. Why are we doing this again?
Until such fucking time as 100 fucking% of the electorate are 100 fucking% in favour of fucking #Brexit then fucking Brexit ain't the fucking will of the fucking people. Fucking Brexit is the fucking will of the fucking Brexeratti who will fucking benefit at our fucking expense.
And note: #Brexit is *still* ridiculous. And should be reversed.But doing so is not going to solve the UK’s problems - because they are deeper, graver, and more complex than most people realise. 
To anyone who thinks #Brexit is just an aberration, and can be fixed, or reversed, and the UK will return to “normal” - you need to think again.The UK has changed, irreversibly. The BBC has changed. Politics, parliament and government are deeply altered.What *is* normal now?
And it’s the same @EUCouncil or at least their #MEP’s who condemn @realDonaldTrump for building the US Mexico border wall.#EU double standards!#MAGA #BuildTheWall #Brexit

Productive meeting with @sajidjavid. Both the UK & the EU have a duty to mitigate the damage of #Brexit for citizens. 
Hey @carolecadwalla I've fixed your latest rambling, incoherent anti Brexit tweet. Makes much more sense now.#Brexit 
When lies come to dominate politics voters cannot separate truth & falsity, and reason & facts lose their power to persuade. So the lies of the #Brexit right are effectively immunising a large part of the electorate against the facts & reasons presented by Remainers. #StopBrexit
Always a pleasure to catch up with @DavidDavisMP. A friendly, but frank exchange of views on #Brexit progress ahead of #EUCO.
We have just published a joint statement with the UK outlining the progress that has been achieved in the #Brexit negotiations since March.Learn more →  #Article50
You can watch my #Brexit evidence sessions to @CommonsEUexit &  @CommonsHomeAffs live from 09:15 GMT & 14:30 GMT tomorrow. MEP's, who after all will have a meaningful vote on any Art.50 deal, have a duty to be transparent. 
Today marks a step forward in these negotiations - we have agreed a number of separation issues and the #UK has engaged on others. But we are not there yet: serious divergences remain on the backstop for NI/IE. More work clearly needed:  #Brexit
On Russian interference in #Brexit referendum, Govt. is shutting its eyes & putting hands over it’s ears & saying it’s ok we’ve not heard or seen any evidence that would suggest it!Cannot think of any other situation when a UK Govt. wasn’t interested in external interference. 
Just out: Joint statement EU/UK on state of play of withdrawal agreement negotiations #Brexit 
Nigel Farage - "What you are seeing here folks is a wilful deliberate attempt to subvert the referendum result. The biggest democratic exercise in the history of this country." #Brexit 
Prof. Alan Sked - "What the Lords are doing is just trying to stop #Brexit."Whenever they say they have got the best interests of the people at heart – they believe the best interest of the British people would be that if Brexit were reversed."

Oh believe us, we wouldn't miss this for the world.  We hope to livestream it, as he's the best #Brexit recruiting sergeant ever. 
Sometimes those of us fighting #Brexit can lose sight of the evil behind it. We have a duty not only to save our country from ruin but also to save our continent from the threat of fascism. Soon the parallels with the 1930s will be undeniable. We must speak out & #StopFascism.
These past few days have proven to be a dark time for #devolution but they say the darkest hour comes before the dawn. Maybe that new dawn will come when Scotland has full powers within its control, which really will be the early days of a better nation #PowerGrab #Brexit 
There is a running total showing more than 100,000 job losses. This is not a jobs first Brexit but a jobless #Brexit. #costofbrexit
Czech PM flatly rejects post #Brexit #EU budget.  Whole thing is coming apart at the seams.
I was very interested when I saw this little factoid about Rees-Moggs’s mate making a killing on #Brexit fluctuations on the day of the referendum. I dug out something I tweeted that day, almost two years ago. Please share. It would be good if this got some attention. 
The #SNP can't name a single power that the Scottish Parliament currently exercises but won't continue to do so after #Brexit. That's because there are none, their only plan is to create divisions between Scotland and Westminster as they try to push through #indyref2.
The Institute calls for free movement of scientists across Europe after #Brexit & has given recommendations to the UK Government @CommonsSTC about what a new #immigration system should look like. More here:  #TogetherScienceCan
Struck how Grieve referred to #Brexit as an "idea" - as in a mere thought, or just a proposal - and not a specific course of action which has already been decided on, by the largest vote for one specific course of action in British political history. 
Many of the parliamentarians supporting Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve’s amendment are absolutely clear about its purpose - to ensure MPs and peers have the power to obstruct #Brexit 
I understand that @MichelBarnier has said the #UK will be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant after #Brexit...Many thanks, Barnier - you've just made my day! The #EU Arrest Warrant is iniquitous, doesn't respect our legal traditions and we are #BetterOffOut.

I asked the Brexit Minister what ScotGov was doing to prepare for the 80+ new powers coming to Holyrood after #Brexit.  His answer: Who wrote your question for you?Patronising, pathetic and clueless.  The #SNP have no idea how to use the scores of new powers coming to Scotland.
So #EU is making a big fuss out of the UK being excluded from Europol post-#Brexit.  Europol annual budget is €116 million.  Devon and Cornwall Police annual budget is £257 million.
Hope so! ALL Tory MPs were elected on a manifesto to implement full Brexit. This tiresome back and forth has got to stop. Whatever you views on #Brexit it cannot be good to send our PM into negotiations unable to properly negotiate. #EUWithdrawalBill
Brilliant news if Britain is to be excluded from the European Arrest Warrant system, which extradites UK citizens to face deeply corrupt police and courts in southern and eastern Europe:  #Brexit
1. It's never been a partnership2. It's always been an imperium with Scotland an exploited asset-stripped colony3. Now May's declared vision is a post #brexit Greater English Reich within which Scotland, stripped of its identity will be wholly subsumed#DissolveTheUnion #SNP

From Barnier's crime speech- it sums up the govt's #Brexit problem. UK says let’s have bespoke arrangements which will benefit both of us (and satisfy our red lines). EU says you don’t understand: we are a legal and institutional order and we can’t. Then repeat ad nauseam.

It is your duty @andreajenkyns to act in the national interest. As the govt's own impact assessments show #Brexit in any form is economically negative, reinforced by virtually every credible economic body in the world, you should be concerned with the well being of the majority.

No, ‘taking back control’ was the entire premise of #Brexit, which over 17 million of your fellow country men & women voted for. The arrogance of dismissing our reasons & reframing them in your own opinion is appalling. The rudeness & condescending tone repeatedly shown is vile. 
One by one, every single #Brexit claim has been stripped away and found to be untrue or completely deluded. It is time for Parliament to take control and act in the interests of the entire U.K. #PeoplesVote

The Lords are soon going to regret all these out of touch moves to block #Brexit. There's no need for a #MeaningfulVote on the final deal as the British people have already given the government the instruction to deliver our exit from the EU! #EUWithdrawalBill #RespectTheResult
I’m not one for blue on blue, but @Anna_Soubry & Dominic Grieve are doing irreparable harm to our party by threatening to bring down the government in order to subvert the democratic will of the peopleHonour the manifesto!#Brexit #EUwithdrawalbill #BrexitLordsBetrayal
Cannot imagine a greater incentive for an #EU that wants to thwart #Brexit to delay & delay → No-Deal, than knowing a Remainer-dominated Parliament has the power to block #Brexit on No-Deal. Appalling. Democracy in crisis. 
#EUWonderWoman  #glitter #SoGlam  because the #EU is wayyy sexier than #Brexit  #StopBrexit #WeAreEurope
You have to love the hypocrisy of @UKLabour.Here is @JonAshworth claiming there is no #Brexit dividend to help fund the #NHSBut @jeremycorbyn is on record as saying there is. Hit RT now to share the sheer hypocrisy of #Labour.
Great thread from a very different kind of Conservative (a conservative one) from the populist authoritarian radicals who are promoting hard #Brexit regardless of the harm it will do. 
Want to put people before a Tory #Brexit? Join @TSSAunion, @Andrew_Adonis and guests at Congress House this Thursday, 21st June.
Lords vote 354-235 against the UK Govt position - a govt defeat by 119 votes & for 'Grieve 2' amendment giving the UK Parliament the power to prevent a 'No Deal' #Brexit. Back to Commons for Wednesday, Big Q: will Corbyn finally stand up to the Tory Brexit? #EUWithdrawalBill
Peers defeat May on #Brexit 'meaningful vote' with increased majorityPeers have voted for the new “meaningful vote” amendment by 354 votes to 235 - a majority of 119.Last time majority was 91Tories are a Minority Govt, don’t forget
BREAKING.... Yet ANOTHER Brexit defeat for May - the most tricky yet? /#EU #Brexit #meaningfulvote
#withdrawalbill Lords vote powerfully 354-235 to give Commons option of #meaningfulvote on the final deal on #Brexit negotiated by the government  - the same power, as several speakers said, that the European Parliament has. #democracy
Grieve 2, giving Parliament a meaningful vote in the event of a #Brexit no deal,  wins by a majority of 119 in the Lords.
#Brexit hokey cokey outside Westminster @SODEMAction  "you put your research funding in, you take #ErasmusPlus out, in, out, in, out, you shake it all about, do the #Brexithokeycokey and turn around..."  #BollockstoBrexit #EUsupergirl
The government and the right-wing media are shamelessly lying that there will be a #Brexit dividend. These right-wing lies are destroying our democracy. There can be no democracy when government and mass media so cynically & relentlessly try to dupe voters. #StopBrexit #FBPE
No long freight queues after #Brexit~94% of goods cleared in 5 seconds>96% cleared within 2 hoursOnly 3% of imports (all from outside the EU) are subject to documentary checks~95% of those checks cleared within 2-3 hours<1% of imports are subject to physical checks by HMRC
High drama as Tory peer Lord Robathan accuses Viscount Hailsham of wanting to "sabotage #Brexit".Hailsham is not remotely intimidated by these Daily Mail-style bullying tactics: "We are the High Court of Parliament. We are not party hacks."
Disappointed at the inaccurate way Govt is talking about the #Brexit dividend. If we’d stayed EU members Brussels would have sought an even bigger contribution from UK taxpayers. It would probably have meant billions more for the EU and less for the NHS.
“Grieve aims to deliver such a bad deal with the EU that we’ll decide not to leaveThe #EUWithdrawalBill amendment is a masterpiece of subterfuge & nearly succeeded in wrecking #Brexit altogether, which was undoubtedly its purpose all along” @mattwridley
This set of slides ended on Friday what was a busy week of the EU27 working party on #brexit. The slides deal with actions against crime and security cooperation in view of the framework for the future relationship EU-UK.
Lord Sewel, one of the authors of the devo settlement has said the #Brexit powers row is not a constitutional crisis 
A #brexit conundrum. UK paid £8.9bn net last year to EU. T May calls this "a vast amount". @SamCoatesTimes says taxes will rise by £11bn a year to pay for extra NHS spending. T May calls this "a bit more" from taxpayers. Since when was "a bit" £2.1bn MORE than "a vast amount"?
Baroness Wheatcroft is a total disgrace.She tells the plebs they didn't know what they were doing when they voted for #Brexit.The Tories made her an unelected Peer on £315 a day but now she is going to knife them and possibly bring down the Tory Gov. 
I voted Remain. The intransigence and intolerance of the #FBPE brigade are making me wish I hadn't. If their intention is to turn Corbyn-supporting Remainers into Brexiteers, they're doing a good job. If their intention is to stop #Brexit, they're making a right Horlicks of it.

The arrogance of these two will come homeski to roost #IsupportVinceCable there is something rotten in the state of #Brexit 
#ISupportVinceCableCos he's realised, from the significant evidence, that #Brexit was a big con & he's smart enough to know a political & legal scam when he sees one. 
There is no #Brexit dividend.However, there will be #Brexit bribes and #Brexit taxes. #Brexit bribes will be when the government relaxes austerity to pay for things. #Brexit taxes will be how the government will make the public pay for the #Brexit bribes.
I hope that extra money for the #NHS will be enough to pay for the dramatic increase in poverty-related illness that will occur after #Brexit
Given Lord Lawson's comments on Sky News today, this remains as relevant as ever. #Brexit 
"If we don't get a People Vote, then it is imperative that Parliament, as a proxy for the people, should have a say" says Baroness Wheatcroft #bbcdp #brexit 
'some' politicians, some. Many MPs recognise we cannot take away the meaning (and outcome) of the majority vote cast at the EU referendum. But without a clean break from the EU, #Brexit is meaningless.
The #EU, quite happy to inflict harm on its own residual m/states' aviation industries as collateral damage, as a price worth paying to try & stymie #Brexit.Perfect example of the reasons why we must leave this foul organisation.

There is no #Brexit dividend, @theresa_may and you know it.
"The #Brexit dividend does not exist, it's like the Loch Ness Monster...so this is a political stunt and nothing more in my opinion." - Ulster University's @deirdreheenan tells #BBCTalkback she's not impressed by the government's NHS funding claims.

Straight to the point - loving the @FT this morning @PickardJE  #ThereIsNoBrexitDividend #Brexit @Open_Britain @WalesForEurope
If we stayed in the EU we would benefit from the outcome of the trade deal that will come from these negotiations.If we #Brexit we won’t.We need to #ExitFromBrexit to maximise our opportunities for trade deals.#PeoplesVote
Walking through Barcelona this morning with a big smile on my face, listening to @mrjamesob on his @LBC radio show imitating aurally the potential sound of #Brexter politicians going #FullGoldfish . Humour aside - James is revealing #Brexit to be bogus and a complete con.
Could this be the reason she is taking the country to destruction via a hard #Brexit ? Couple this with the info @J_amesp and @carolecadwalla have been revealing for over a year and you get a sense of why.
Disappointing to see @suellaBraverman adopt the dishonest #Brexit fallacy that we pay £10bn dues to EU for 0 in return. What we get is worth £100bn & includes frictionless trade, 40+ essential govt agencies like EURATOM & schemes like Erasmus. Where will the £ for THAT come from? 
So the IFS says the OBR has said public finances £15bn worse becase of #Brexit vote. Neither of them know. They're just comparing pre-referendum forecasts (dodgy) with current forecasts (dodgy). 
Women of the UK, this is for you. If you want your children to have the same rights and freedom we had, we are going to have to fight for them. Be part of the UK Freedom March in London this Saturday ...#Brexit #FreeSpeech #FreeTommy
Good on @Anna_Soubry to call out her PMs lie about the #Brexit dividend. May has zero credibility.

Just out in #openaccess! My piece in @NPEjournal on the UK's post-#Brexit trade policy and the role of experts, emotion and spatial imaginaries (notably of the #Anglosphere). Read it here: 
'The decision taken by the Prime Minister was NOT backed up by due diligence: there were no impact assessments, no consultation. #Brexit in its current form would create executive rule – in effect, a dictatorship.'  #stopbrexit #EUWithdrawalBill #article50challenge #Parliament
We asked Sinn Fein's @moneillsf #HowWillBrexitBenefitMe?Her reply was short and to the point. The people of Ireland do not want #Brexit.Neither do we.#StopBrexitSaveBritain #SODEMaction

.@Jeremy_Hunt on @BBCr4today claiming unconvincingly that there will be a #Brexit dividend to pay for extra NHS cash. I am pressing the UK Stats Auth to clamp down on these bogus claims.
It's a big week for #Brexit. Key votes in parliament & 2 years since the referendum. @Remain_Labour is 6 months old and growing fast. The more resources we have, the better we can represent #Labour voters and members in calling for a #PeoplesVote.
While the magic money forest is being pruned without any notion of fiscal responsibility can I please push you to as a minimum fund schools as you had promised in your manifesto instead of the cuts we see across education, we need investment in skills #brexit @PhilipHammondUK

I was a supporter of Audit the Vote (by @DrJillStein and @putinRF) at @heatstreet before @20committee warned me off it, so I can be sympathetic to the desire to redo a vote that was unfairly targeted by Russia  #Brexit
The #PeoplesVote march on June 23 has to be really large to be effective, but it should also be noisy. Let's have 1000's chanting slogans or singing Ode to Joy not just little groups of a dozen or so. #StopBrexit #Brexit 
Previously, it was claimed that the money Arron Banks poured into #Brexit came from the sale of a business.Now the Sunday Times reports him saying this deal made no money.So where did the Brexit dosh come from?(H/T @ThatTimWalker)
Theresa May says extra #NHS funding will come from #Brexit *and* that 'Parliament cannot tie hands of Government'.1. We have no concrete deal. She made this claim up.2. That Parliament is sovereign is the most basic principle of constitutional law.This is embarrassing. 
“Parliament cannot tie the hands of the government in negotiations AND parliament cannot and should not  overturn the will of the British people which was to leave the EU” @theresa_may #Marr #Brexit 
#Leave won (they claim)#Remain lost#Remain are campaigning hard because #Brexit will damage jobs, the economy and people's lives.Why are #Leave still trying to sell #Brexit to the public. If it was going to be a huge success, just sit back and gloat.....unless............
I just saw the execrable Suella Fernandes of the ERG shamelessly lying that there is a #Brexit dividend. The Brexit economic slowdown has already cost the government budget more than the cost of the UK's net contribution to the EU, and the damage has barely begun.#StopBrexit
It’s a disgrace that @BBCNews gives any credibility whatsoever to the government lie that there is a #Brexit dividend, when the economy and public finances will be badly hit by Brexit. The @bbc is colluding in #FakeNews
So @johnmcdonnellMP why can't you say it as it really is, that the PM has blatantly and shamefully lied by claiming that there is a #Brexit dividend? It's so sad to see Labour's ability to oppose so hamstrung by its collusion with Tories on #Brexit. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
The pro-EU establishment in this country feels perfectly free to veto the instructions of the ­British ­people:  #Brexit
Less than week to go. Like many 1000s from all over the UK and Europe, I will be democratically and peacefully marching in London to protest at the disgraceful way the Government is treating its citizens over the #BrexitShambles. #Brexit is not inevitable but it is undeliverable.
More doubts about how the #Brexit #Referendum was won as Leave. EU faces new questions over contacts with #Russia
We’ve entered a new age . Open propaganda from PM using the state to disseminate it re Brexit ‘dividend’ . Stating the executive branch of the govt is not governed by HoC- a direct assault on our constitution. If you’re not terrified you’re not paying attention . #Brexit 
This is just nonsense.  If she believes it she is not capable of understanding simple arithmetic.  If she doesn’t she is deliberately lying about an impending disaster.  Perhaps it is a bit of both. #Brexit 
May announces #Brexit dividend And the experts say: rubbish-Tomorrow’s Guardian 
This picture sums up #Brexit.You cannot please everyone. If you set out to please all, you will please nobody, except for Soros, Miller, and the Grieve's, Morgan's and Soubry's of this world. Just please the majority  
Here's a piece I wrote about the #PowerGrab @theSNP #Brexit and my "Journey to Yes" as an Englishman living in Ayrshire.
If #Brexit has taught us anything, is that our Supreme Court has to be the highest court of the land, not the ECJ. Our democratically elected officials accountable to the people of Britain, never again can these most of basic principles be compromised EVER again.
There is no #Brexit dividend, only a massive Brexit cost! 
Fantastic piece by @DPJHodges. The Tory rebels had a worthy cause but they overreached & now it’s time to stop before they cause irreparable damage. Time to back the PM or risk getting a deal they’ll like even less than the one they’re protesting. #Brexit 
Imagine if the £10s of billions being wasted on #Brexit were being spent to improve public services, or on investment in infrastructure & education, or even on cutting our taxes. They slashed and cut because of austerity, but they'll squander any amount on Brexit.#StopBrexit
During the 45 years or so that I have been following UK politics, I have seen nothing remotely like the torrent of lies that are pouring from the #Brexit right. This is not ordinary political dishonesty, it is lying on a scale that threatens democracy as such.#FBPE #StopBrexit
There is NO #Brexit dividend It’s Fools GoldPerfectly illustrated by @BJennings90 
Dr. Sarah Wollaston: The idea of a brexit dividend was "tosh"Paul Johnson(IFS): The idea there's a #Brexit dividend is pure fiction.. even more importantly the Govt has already accepted the public finances will be weakened to the tune of £15bn per year as a result of #Brexit 
Would you like a badge, Theresa, my dear?  I'll hand deliver one, free of charge. Will look smashing pinned to your leopard print jacket, alongside those chains you've got round your neck, shackling you to your deluded #Brexit fantasy...  
Thanks to @HawickSNP @AbsoluteGinius & @CalumRKerr for hosting me with @PaulWheelhouse this afternoon for a great discussion on #Brexit & #IndyRef2 & last week’s events at #Westminster #SNPwalkout
Right now the vultures are circling over what used to be Great Britain. Post #brexit the country will be littered with the carcasses of businesses, gov departments, national assets, the NHS, and people.  And the vultures will feed voraciously... until there is nothing left #FBPE
Dominic Grieve says Tory rebels are prepared to 'collapse the government' to block a 'catastrophic' #Brexit deal 
Nigel Farage - "Salvini's popularity ratings are going through the roof. One thing is for certain, for my money, Merkel is the past, Salvini is the future." #Brexit 
A tariff-free trade agreement in goods & services between the UK and EU would be mutually beneficial. The UK should not pay the EU for such an agreement or accept free movement of people for work and welfare.If this cannot be agreed, NO DEAL IS BETTER THAN A BAD DEAL.#Brexit
The Office for Budget Responsibility confirms that the public finances will be weakened, not strengthened by #Brexit.  There is no ,and will be no, #Brexit dividend .  So this is a lie put out as propaganda by the Ptime Minister’s Office.... 
is this a legit use of official press offices @HeadUKCivServ - given the @OBR_UK view on the impact of #brexit on public finances... 
If we all do one thing, let us speak out, and continue to speak out amidst the lies & misinformation being peddled by this govt, clinging for dear life onto bribed power. #NHS #Brexit #BrexitDividend #marr

Powerful piece by @carolecadwalla in the @observer on how treason has been quietly accepted because implications are too big. #Brexit not just a mess but fundamentally illegitimate.
Fraid not. We are likely to see substantially less tax revenue by leaving the single market and any new deals will require a high level of development funding. Trade requires investment. There is no #Brexit dividend, you utter simpleton. 
Brexit-supporting MPs push May to make the £39 billion bill conditional to EU agreeing to a proper free-trade deal, enshrined in the Withdrawal Bill. Shouldn't this already have been added as a clause in the Withdrawal Bill?#Brexit 
Claims of a #Brexit dividend for the #NHS have been dismissed by an MP as 'tosh'
The full text of my speech, when I delivered the Sir Julian Priestley memorial lecture, is now available here, the first part a tribute to Julian and the second part about what he would have advised us to do now about #Brexit :
Fox News is owned by Rupert Murdoch who has spent years trying to destroy Britain's democracy.We don't need a fictional independence from the EU. We need independence from Murdoch!#StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
.@carolecadwalla has been exposing Russian interference in #Brexit since way before it was mainstream.Perhaps that's why Russia & LeaveEU coordinated attempts to discredit and threaten her.This is what opponents of democracy do. They're dangerous to a free & open society. 
For years the EU has been financing NGOs and media outlets with the purpose of redirecting their loyalties and their lobbying to Brussels. Its MO is to buy off civil society and to capture civil society institutions. That's your "foreign meddling" right there. #Brexit
It's almost like Russia conspired with #Brexit to destabilize the EU and also with @realDonaldTrump campaign because they knew he would destabilize not only the EU but the US. I wonder why?
.@theresa_may should be ashamed for repeating the lie about the #Brexit dividend. The IFS confirm there isn't going to be one. #FBPE
I have to imagine that this level of deception is in breach of the Ministerial Code.  May is in possession of the best advice from the civil service which says that #Brexit produces a large cash LOSS, not a “dividend”.  Most industries warned of major trade losses. @CBItweets ...
I was excited today about the gov’t promising more money for the NHS. Then I found out that most of it was coming from the “#Brexit Dividend”. So, they might as well be promising gold doubloons from Atlantis.Also, intrigued as to how £20bn extra a year divides to £600m a week. 
“I’ve been really consistent about this.”  Yes Dominic, consistently wrong and consistently anti-democratic.Original #Brexit content daily: 
Every MP in Ealing is a #Labour MP.  Every MP in Ealing is calling for a #PeoplesVote. #Brexit is not inevitable, with leadership from the across the Labour movement, we can change the direction of our country.

There is no Brexit dividend. Don’t be conned. Extra money will be from taxation and public borrowing. The #NHS needs more money, but let’s be honest where it comes from.  @Open_Britain #Brexit 
My daughter keeps asking me what will happen to me after #Brexit. Aftter nearly 2 years I still not have a proper answer, just vague promises. Brexit might split a lot of families. Will my daughter grow up without her father? The uncertainty is unbearable. #FathersDay
I’m no Tory, but Dominic Grieve deserves praise for continuing to put himself out there in the face of heavy handed attacks from the right wing gutter press. He is perfectly right to push for a #MeaningfulVote for Parliament on #Brexit 
When Jon Pienaar puts it to Tory Brexit Minister Suella Braverman (née Fernandes) that we now have one of the slowest growing economies (FACT) her reply is "I don't agree with that."That's the level our politics has sunk to. #5live #Brexit
I have been critical of the PM in recent months and frustrated at times by reports of the Brexit negotiations. But if ANYONE thinks that Jeremy Corbyn would do a better job just watch this. He wouldn't know the first thing about standing up for British interests. #Marr #Brexit 
Delighted to learn that the Queen acknowledged and supports President Trump decision to deport dangerous muslim refugees#Brexit#MBGA#MAGA
Huge factual error by Theresa May on #Marr saying that #Brexit  "is not about replacing trade with EU but will add to trade with EU" - this is fundamentally flawed - leaving Single Market & Customs Union will see HUGE hit to UK trade with EU & UK economy
Absolutely spot on from the PM. Parliament cannot tie the hands of the Government on negotiations and they cannot overturn the democratically expressed will of the British people. Well said @theresa_may #Marr #Brexit 
Exactly - there can be no “good” or “successful “ #Brexit and there is not and won’t be any #Brexit dividend.   Those are facts … 
Dear @theresa_may Health experts and health economists agree #Brexit will reduce the funds available to the NHS. To suggest otherwise is truly shameful. There is no Brexit Dividend. #Marr
Sorry @EmilyThornberry, it simply isn't true that no @UKLabour MPs want the chance to stop #Brexit. Dozens have already called for a #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain. The majority of members want it and we are determined to deliver it. #Marr
No spin on @skynews #sunrise this morning. We've made it very clear this will be coming from tax rises or increased borrowing and that the "Brexit dividend" is earmarked until beyond this settlement period #NHS #Brexit 
Top 5 things that don't exist:1. #BrexitDividend 2. Unicorns3. Tory conscience4. Theresa Mays honesty5. BBC impartialityYet The Sun/Daily Mail readers believe in all 5 of them. Depressing.#Marr #Brexit #NHS 
Every single #Brexit impact study says we will be worse off. Yet there is suddenly a #BrexitDividend. I can't  believe people actually fall for this rubbish. But they do. Repeatedly. #Marr  #NHS
#Brexit dividend for the NHS? Not in this current settlement it would seem. As @GuardianHeather points out, all the money we currently send to the EU is already earmarked until 2022/23. So #NHS funding will come from borrowing or tax rises
#TrumpRussia & #Brexit are the same scandal. NATO is under attack by #Russia and we’re screwed until we admit it. These are acts of war.
But we’re right in it WITH you Putin ran the SAME interference on our #Brexit vote and has hands all over our Conservatives too! Theresa Trump is an enabler.!You just wait to see the Brit Resistance in action when Agent Orange gets here! #DumpTrump
(8/16) Andy Wigmore of  sends George Cottrell's arrest/legal docs to RU diplo at RU embassy. Cottrell was on the Trump campaign trail w/Farage during 7/16.  #Brexit 
MP demands abolishment of Lords if peers betray voters on #Brexit."To defy the elected House once is a misfortune. To defy it twice, particularly when this is about implementing the result of a referendum, is an act of Insurrection. The Commons must act."
Finally figuring out that #Brexit as well as Trump-for-president were campaigns of Russia’s war against the West? I said they were, early in 2016 … and the anti-Ukraine referendum in the Netherlands, too. #PutinAtWar
Frank Field MP - #Brexit should begin a British renaissance that starts with the abolition of the House of Lords.

Don't you just love it when an MP elected on s Leave ticket disregards her electorates and her constituents of Nottingham and does everything in her power to betray #Brexit because apparently she knows better than you. 
The next time a corbyn supporter tells you they have the youth vote & that labour supporters have moved on from Brexit show them this. The GE17 ‘ youth surge ‘ was actually Remainers voting tactically . And does this look like moving on from brexit to you ? #brexit 
This. This. This.The EU failing helps only Putin. The EU has been made into a scapegoat for all that is wrong in our own country. I know things are crap for many people. We need to own that for ourselves and change it. To be better than #Brexit. 
Remember when @theSNP had over 50 MPs & the cheap media called #Scotland a one party state?Now England has a similar percentage of MPs from pro #brexit parties & the same hacks call it "the will of the people"
Is it wise to turn significant extra funding for NHS into a #Brexit story or desperate?
#NHS  will get #NHSDividend. .. "but admits  #taxes will also increase."-@telegraphAnd you ask me why I say that #Brexit is a scam? TMay  is doing this to head off #Labour.Like Cam created EU ref to head off #UKIP.#TheToriesGetPaidAndThePeopleGetPlayed

#quote ".. I cannot stand by the comments made by my right hon. Friend..who said that we have to ‘suck it up’. My constituents voted to leave the EU precisely because they were NOT going to suck it up + because they knew what they wanted, which is for us to LEAVE the EU." #BREXIT 
1. Not a single power grabbed yet it's a 'power grab'2. No plans to end devolution, the only party who oppose devolution are @theSNP who want independence at any cost3. Lots of new powers coming to Scotland with #Brexit4. but #SNP want to give powers straight back to Brussels
Members of Tony Blair's cabal who should have gone to prison for #Iraq and multiple other crimes not only got away with them but are now involved in blocking #Brexit You lot in Britain are either fools or scared to death of the neo-liberal mafia that protects these criminals.
Such a fantastic day at the market today - 100 new sign ups & clearer than ever that public opinion is swinging behind a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Looking forward to seeing lots of you next Saturday! @BimAfolami @grantshapps @OliverHealdUK @DavidGauke
This is how low #Brexit Britain can go. Briefing against the Republic of Ireland because they stand for their national interest & the EU 27. 
What we’re asking for is clear, and @OFOCBrexit & @FFSake_ were peaceful in our protest and our message;Stop  Backing  Brexit!!#FFS#Brexit#LabourLive
The EU as a political construction is in a state of terminal decay:  #Brexit
Want to help further our movement of young people and students tackle the biggest issue facing our generation?  get involved today   Call for a #PeoplesVote   and support the @peoplesvote_uk campaign #FFS#Brexit 
It's good , vital and important  that young people engage other young people re: #Brexit.This is not  about my future.It's  about theirs.#LabourLive@OFOCBrexit@Will_DryOFOCpic via @Andrew_Adonis
Was with a fantastic group of young Labour supporters today at #LabourLive who all understand that Labour should back a #peoplesvote on the final #Brexit deal.Shame about violence/aggression when we held the banner up in the crowd during Corbyn’s speech- but we remained peaceful! 
Are you listening @jeremycorbyn? Its not only your own party m'ship/MPs who want this.. The majority of UK want it too. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Poor @jeremycorbynHe arranges a communist love in and nobody wants to go.It turns into pure comedy on twitter.......and then those attending start protesting against his #Brexit policy.#LabourLive
After being in the EU with opt-outs, the govt now wants #Britain to be out with opt-ins.  So all that would change with #Brexit is that Britain leaves the institutions and loses its say in decisions that will affect it anyway!  
Proud to have peacefully protested at #LabourLive with @OFOCBrexit - young people want and deserve a #PeoplesVote and @jeremycorbyn should champion young voices on #Brexit!! 
The idea that the UK can leave the EU is nonsense. We can give up our membership and our major influence in the EU, but the economic superpower will still be next door, having a huge impact on our economy & domestic policies.So take back control #StopBrexit!#Brexit #FBPE
Two years ago today Jo Cox was murdered for opposing #BrexitThe aim was to terrorise and silence us...But we have not been silenced.You would be proud of us Jo.Rest in Peace.#StopBrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain #FBPE #PeoplesVote
I hadn't realised the power of my tweets.Unbeknownst to me, my tweets are apparently directly influencing the EU negotiations and causing them to fail.Fellow remainers. It's all our fault. #FBPE #brexit
It's nearly time! This coming Saturday (23 Jun) we're joining what's set to be a HUGE march for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. We're meeting at the station 11am. See you there! @peoplesvote_uk @euromove @CoHubNetwork @_Britain4Europe @Scientists4EU
The results are in! The first ever full-scale Brexitometer in #Leeds has delivered its verdict. And we are blown away by the results, which show that the overwhelming view of the people of West Yorkshire is that #Brexit will be bad for the economy, for the #NHS & for Britain.
Farage whining on ITV that #Brexit isn't turning out how he expected. Listen @Nigel_Farage, #Brexit was always going to be a pile of dog dirt. It's working out just as tens of millions of us expected it to. You wanted it, you own it.
Remember mad cow disease outbreak 20 years ago and the panic that it would cross into humans and thousands would go mad, but it never happened. Well millions voted for #Brexit a couple of years ago............just saying..
Statement of the obvious: "There is no Brexit dividend." If #Brexit happens, the costs will be enormous. 
**POLL**What do you think? #BrexitRT Poll after you vote for a larger sample.
#LabourLive Not many people there ....but  you do realise....#Corbyn wants to end Free Movement for UK Brits... you will lose all your rights as EU Citizens.We need a #PeoplesVote  and an exit from #Brexit Support the #LibDems!
Had a long chat this morning with a woman who had bought in Spain for her retirement, and is now caught in a ghastly #Brexit #Waspi pincer movement.  She asked about another #ScotRef - she’ll be changing her vote to Yes
After an amazing stay in #Vienna (capital 13) with Louise, Alex & , a random lunch stop at Europapark in Lassee, we arrived in Bratislava, our 14th capital. We are now HALF WAY around the ! Defo faster then #Brexit negotiations!#StopBrexitSaveBritain #Iameuropean
Corbyn, on the far left of the @UKLabour party, the saviour of the Tory far right #Brexit.That's right, go figure.I make no secret of my position on Brexit, no Mayfuscation, no Corbfuscation, I want it stopped, I want it dead.Clear?#StopBrexit
"Pragmatic Leaver"  really, Anna? So disappointed...  I can't support someone who is campaigning for a #SoftBrexit  No #Brexit is acceptable! 
RT this if you want a #FinalSayForAll on #Brexit. 
#Brexit is the biggest and most complex peacetime challenge Whitehall has ever faced. We argue that political divisions and a culture of extraordinary secrecy are making it even harder 
If we #Brexit, we have no say on EU rules & miss out on the “Brussels effect”: Multinationals complying with EUregulations to gain access to the #SingleMarket find it’s then easier to implement them globally.The EU sets international standards,rest follow
In no scenario would the British public accept a "no deal" #Brexit if it was put to them. The referendum would be irrelevant, they would vote decisively against it.Therefore if the Government cannot or will not negotiate an acceptable Brexit deal, Remain is the no deal option 
Tory media is spinning like mad that Christopher Chope simply hates private members bills & therefore votes against them all on principle. He doesn't.Ask him about his own #Brexit Bank Holiday Bill or his own 73 Bills.The man just hates women's rights! 
People are coming from all over the UK as well as as far away as Italy! #StopBrexit #FinalSay #PeoplesVote It's cross party and all about how you feel about #Brexit and the outrageous #BrexitShambles orchestrated by this incompetent and cynical government. See you there?
Excited to announce that our first guest is former @TheGreenParty leader & journalist @natalieben.We talked about #Green philosophy, radical change, basic income, and #Brexit. First episode - out soon!#podcast #greenpolitics #EUWithdrawalBill #PeoplesVote
It is rich of Soubry to talk about betrayal. Who was it whose constituency voted for #Brexit? Who was elected on a manifesto to leave the single market & customs union? Who promised to respect the referendum result? That's just three of her own betrayals
It’s Saturday.And #Brexit is looking more idiotic by the day.It should be called off now, enabling us to tackle the real issues facing our country. #StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote
Question to Michel Barnier and EU Commissioners: is it normal for you to lend your premises to people who are trying to undermine the position of the Government with which you are negotiating?  #Brexit
THREAD: 1. So who do I mean when I refer to the "Brexit Blob"? There's the usual suspects. Redwood, Rees-Mogg, Paterson and the other nonentity backbenchers, and then there;s the Tufton Street sock puppet think tanks and then the ayatollahs of #Brexit.
Enjoyed catching up with ⁦@DeccaJourno⁩ covering everything from moths & birds to #Brexit.  Oh, and I’m standing firm over my Heathrow bet :) 
Who is going to be the first UK politician to stand up and say:1) Voters were not given enough objective  information to choose between Remain/Leave2) EUref was manipulated3) We need a public inquiry4) We need a police investigation5) Until then postpone #Brexit?
John Redwood MP:'I'm against any tax rises to fund NHS.We currently pay EU £12 Billion a year.That's plenty of money: we don't need tax rises as well.We should Get On with Getting Out of #EU & spend the money at home, particularly on health.'#Brexit
Thinking of #JoCox today, and all who knew and loved her. The country is diminished by her loss. Let editors and politicians who cry "traitor" in the #Brexit debates reflect on the impact their words can have.
Read this thread - it gives a vitally important example of why #Brexit , no matter the good people who were initially persuaded by it, is a seriously bad and damaging retrograde step.  And then reflect this is only one example of many thousands... 
#PRICELESS... THERESA MAY SHUTDOWN ROYALLY IN PARLIAMENT WHEN ASKED IF TRUMP SHOULD NEGOTIATE #BREXIT... 
Remember, there was never any reason for a government 'to obey the will of the people' in the Referendum.The #Mail bullied a weak PM into using the slogan to try & intimidate REMAINER's. It failed, but #May continues to be intimidated by #Brexit extremist to lie to MP's 
Thanks to @SnpDalriada for hosting the public meeting on #Brexit in #Lochgilphead tonight - good questions and great turnout including  one person who only joined @theSNP on  Wednesday.....
Looking forward to visiting the beautiful borders on Sunday to talk #indy #Brexit & #SNPWalkOut & to catch up with @CalumRKerr & @AbsoluteGinius
Here's an idea. We need an organisation to campaign against leading Brexiter MPs in constituencies where there are strong Remain majorities. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
People are saying we can't stop May doing her #Brexit to us.She is one person.We are 65 million.I think we can stop her.We all know the referendum was a cheat, and not valid.May can be stopped.She has to be.We want to #RemainInTheEU.Who decides, us, or her?
Indeed. #christopherchope should have laid down a Bill to outlaw skirts & dresses & avoided all this hoo-haa, or brought back chastity belts, corsets & knickerbockers. Anyway at least we’re not talking about #brexit 
The last two big London protests got around 50k participants. We need far more for the #PeoplesVote march. So please publicise it at least once each day for the next 7 days.   Please RT.#Brexit #StopBrexit
How Scotland’s biggest selling paper is reporting on #Brexit today. Not sure what’s happening but feels like a perceptible shift in Scotland 
The strident and concerted attempt by the Remainer establishment to overthrow the democratic will of the people has been shocking and has revealed a rottenness at the heart of the way this country is run:  #Brexit
So  - how did you manage to fail to do so?  You have so little discipline over something as obvious as this, yet the rest of us are watching you inflict #brexit on us in a similarly chaotic manner! Disgrace  -the lot of you!
There's a 'severe lack of detail' on a scheme that would allow EU citizens to stay in the UK after #Brexit, Welsh Cabinet Secretary @MarkDrakeford and Scottish Cabinet Secretary @FionaHyslop warn in joint letter to UK Govt.
Why does he oppose offering the Ppl a #FinalSay when the EU27 get one, to Confirm if the Will is still to #Brexit or now to #StopBrexit & #Remain. This merely checks if the majority still want it or not...& if not what right do #Brexiters have to deny that majority Will?
Trump puts 25% tariff on Chinese goods.Well, we can safely say the idea of global free trading Britain is pretty much dead.#Brexit
Greatest mic drop in recent history. @jeremycorbyn asks if @theresa_may followed @BorisJohnson's advice to have @realDonaldTrump take over #Brexit negotiations.@potus #QAnon
One might almost think .@Nigel_Farage was trying to avoid any dialogue with the brilliant .@carolecadwalla Something to hide? #Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica#PeoplesVote #marr
It’s time we called People like Soubry, Grieve, Sandbach, Soros,Grayling,Major, Blair etc, exactly what they are.They are Hard Remainiac Traitors who care not for Democracy and the right of the people to decide on theirFuture.We must guard against these imbeciles.#brexit.
Here is Nigel, he voted leave (& campaigned for #brexit most of his life). He’s now realised #Brexit is not working out how he envisaged & says it may be better to #StopBrexit.@Nigel_Farage have you heard of the #remainernow movement? 
You are the #GRExit supporter. Aren't you?You were also against #BRExit. Aren't you? Give us a break, clown.... 
Paul Manafort - a greedy frontman for dictators & crooked oligarchs - is the first of Trump's team to be jailed but won't be the last.Meanwhile, the UK has only just scratched the surface of Russian involvement in #Brexit, which was a dry-run for the Trump campaign. 
BREAKING: We have announced the lineup of political speakers for the #PeoplesVoteMarch.June 23 is set to be the biggest demonstration on #Brexit yet. It's OUR turn to make history, so pledge to march with us at .More speakers will be announced soon.
Nigel Farage - "Looking at all these people – Campbell and Clegg’s spin doctors and Dominic Grieve – I wonder what is the collective noun for a group of Remainers trying to overturn #Brexit?"Well, I’m going to suggest ‘a disgrace.’" 
Nick Ferrari - "We should have just walked out. Just walk out. Boom. Gone. Employ Trump-like tactics."‘You walk in and you say ‘that’s it - take the deal or not’ and you walk off out of the room.” #Brexit 
Sir #ChristopherChope " .."@Conservatives politician. He is the Member of Parliament for Christchurch. A prominent #Brexit advocate, he has been supportive of Leave Means Leave, a Eurosceptic pressure "-@Wikipedia He's also a one-man exhibit  from: #NightAtTheMuseum#upskirting
Michael Portillo - "If people defy what the establishment wants to do, they have to be bullied, they have to be punished, they have to be threatened.“It’s part of the bullying culture of the European Union." #Brexit 
A three-hour SNP-led debate on the validity of the #Sewel Convention will commence Commons business on Monday... #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill #SNPwalkout
If #Brexit happens, and 5-15 years down the line a younger generation take the UK back into the EU, it will be under worse conditions. No opt-outs, and forced to adopt Schengen and the Euro.Why go through all the pain only to end up back in under worse conditions? #StopBrexit
At @NIChamber #presidentslunch @afneil tells audience #Brexit 1. No deal is an empty threat.2. There is no parliamentary majority for leaving CU.3. There won’t be deal by October.4 There will be an agricultural border down the Irish Sea.5. Free movement likely deal breaker. 
BREAKING: We have announced the lineup of political speakers for the #PeoplesVoteMarch.June 23 is set to be the biggest demonstration on #Brexit yet. It's OUR turn to make history, so pledge to march with us at .More speakers will be announced soon.
"Can you see what it is yet?" #Brexit betrayal by liberal elite that refuses to take 'No' for an answer. #democracy
Mainstream Economists were right all along wrt #brexit .  #FBPE Perhaps it will be good to listen to them in the future
"The European Union has made preparations for the possibility of #Brexit being postponed, as talks with the UK appear less and less likely to reach a productive conclusion in time."
"Top #EU chiefs stand up for Love Island Hayley as they confirm #Brexit could affect Britain’s trees."  Where does one begin? 
Theresa May, 4th June 1940...We shall isolate our island whatever the cost may be.We shall fight on the benches.We shall fight in the cabinet.We shall fight in the Lords.And if this island is decimated and starving then we shall blame remainers for talking #Brexit down.
Disgraceful that the Telegraph still speaks of a “Brexit dividend” when they know perfectly well that #Brexit is turning out to be a costly and economically damaging exercise. #FakeNews at its worst!
#IsabelOakeshott corners #Remoaner #DominicGrieve on his anti-#Brexit meddling. "You stood  on a manifesto which said we would leave the #EU, the #singlemarket, and the #customsunion!"  #BBC #SKY #LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress #Tory @Conservatives @theresa_may
Theresa May is not a besieged moderate. Her record at the home office & as PM, her gratuitous insults to Remainers and her invocations of the "Will of the People" demonising opponents as "enemies of the people" all point to her being an authoritarian nationalist.#Brexit #FBPE
Rumour is that the #EU27 may suggest that the UK put the exit date back because the country is running out of time to present a plan that can essentially protect its trading relationship with the bloc and also address the issue of the #IrishBorder.#WhosMindingTheStore ?#Brexit 
The Irish border is so critical in #Brexit because movement across it is a material, lived benefit of EU integration & the peace process. @BorderIrish @BelfastAgmt A 16 yr old in a Monaghan focus gp put it well: "Live here for a week & see how many times you cross the border."
Love  island is certainly more entertaining than EU #brexit preparedness notices, like the one on FLEGT. But both raise awareness! Fight against illegal logging is another dimension beyond @matt_dathan take on tree disease.
I am shut down in the EU Parliament again, twice in one week, during my speech about #Brexit. Arch enemy, an Irish MEP, chairs the session.  I told them they had DDD, Democracy Deficiency Disorder 
Promises made about #Brexit are being broken within hours even in Westminster, according to @Peston This reinforces the need for a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal, so join us on the #PeoplesVoteMarch on June 23 to make YOUR voice heard.Info here:
It’s time we leavers contacted those that are actively trying to thwart #brexit and bombard them with our Invective.We have had to listen to their objections for far to long.We should set out a campaign to re educate them on why we the voters decided to leave the EU..
#brexit  Dominic Grieve, Anna Soubry, Nicky Morgan, Ken Clarke, Chuka Umunna, Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair, Richard Branson. And worst 2 journalist in  Owen Jones & Kevin Maguire. Shut up  we voted we’re leaving EU. 
Dominic Grieve - The Daily Mail's level of debate around #brexit makes rational discussion impossible & it's deliberately designed to do it. When Dacre & the Daily Mail decide to raise the temperature he does it with the deliberate intention to stifle rational debate. #FBPE
The government that cannot deliver Universal Credit to those that need it, is the same government that says it will deliver the Brexit you voted for.What are the odds?They cannot deliver #Brexit in any form you voted for that will work for everyone.#StopBrexit
#Brexit dividend:= I save £500 by choosing not to pay for buildings insurance. House burns down.Great, now I can use my insurance premium dividend to buy a tent
It is 'just a bit of fun' Nonetheless it shows voting @LibDems can make a huge difference.#Brexit would be dead in water if there was an election result like this! 
A. C. Grayling - In the 2 years that have elapsed since the 1st referendum we have had some actual facts... the govt's best cause scenario after #Brexit shows our economy would take a huge hit. He is confident that a #PeoplesVote is now more likely to happen.#StopBrexit #FBPE
I see that now that #Brexit is no longer supported by the majority of the public, Mrs May is telling another whopper by claiming she has more money for the NHS, as a result of a fictional brexit dividend.May opens her mouth and invariably out fall lies.
“Vote Leave chief who created £350m NHS claim on bus admits leaving EU could be 'an error”#Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica
So we face another week of #brexit drama in Parliament, with the Lords given (by the Govt!) a key role. All the Govt’s negotiating energy is going on negotiating a deal with its own backbenchers. Meanwhile the EU sits and waits, bemused, and increasingly exasperated.
Had to re-tweet this again! It's an excellent analogy of why we should have a #peoplesvote on the final #Brexit deal once we know what Brexit will actually mean for the country. 
"EU’S €10bn SECRET REVEALED" Hot & exclusive from the #Brexit Facts4EU team. A must-read:  Is this really the EU that Remainer MPs want to be part of?
The voters of Lewisham East have just sent emphatically rejected #Brexit. ⁦@UKLabour⁩ & ⁦@Conservatives⁩ humiliated by a collapse in support in the week that they both let us down in parliament yet again. Time to listen to us! #StopBrexit
Events of recent days have proven that even @theresa_may's own party can't trust her to keep her word. Do you trust her with #Brexit? Do you trust her to save the Union? Do you trust her to protect the #GFA?Or do you think the UK deserves better? #MayOut #ToriesOut #StopBrexit
Lewisham East result:LAB: 50.2% (-17.7)LDEM: 24.6% (+20.2)CON: 14.4% (-8.6)GRN: 3.6% (+1.9)WEP: 2.3% (+2.3)UKIP: 1.7% (+0.0)Time to wake up @UKLabour & @Conservatives. People do not want this disastrous #Brexit. 
Some superb comments by Plaid Cymru leader @LeanneWood on the #Brexit #PowerGrab & how Scotland & Wales are being treated. And lets not forget the Northern Ireland mess. #bbcqt
Couldn't of put it better myself . The lady is right, Brexit will leave us all worse off.... What a bloody mess!! #Brexit #bbcqt
Well, well, well.@Anna_Soubry received £6,000 from pro EU More United Ltd 8th May 2017 according to the MPs Register Financial Interests. She is receiving money to defy #Brexit, the government and the will of the nation.#BBCQT #EUWithdrawalBill
I will never tire of sharing this.This is a series of clips of senior ministers before the election, stating that a leave vote would mean leaving the Single Market. Politicians are being disingenuous to imply otherwise.#BBCQT #Brexit
.@LeanneWood on #BBCQT saying there is no mandate for #Brexit.WRONGCan somebody point out to her that both the Labour and Conservative Manifesto said that we would leave the Single Market and Customs Union. Over 80% of the electorate voted for that.
Well you've got that wrong for a start @IsabelOakeshott - people actually DO trust Dominic Grieve, even non-Tories can see he's solely interested in saving us from an economic catastrophe under #Brexit #bbcqt
.@IsabelOakeshott calling out Dominic Grieve there on #BBCQTShe pointed out that only yesterday he was caught with a known group of people who have a Stop #Brexit agenda and he admitted it.... 
#bbcqt have @IsabelOakeshott daring to say to Dominic Grieve: "people dont trust you" on #Brexit. This from a proven liar. What next on @bbcquestiontime Ronnie Biggs on banks? He is dead. Fred Goodwin on business ethics. No wonder UK politics are in a mess.
Dominic Grieve on #BBCQT rambling on about how he held negotiations this week to water down #Brexit.One question. Who the heck does he think he is? He was elected on a Manifesto which stated we would leave the Customs Union and Single Market. 
People *did not know* what they were voting for.  This may be a difficult truth, but we don't help anyone or the UK by denying it.From what we've seen even the majority of MPs didn't know what they were voting for on #Brexit , never mind the public 
Brave move of Wetherspoons in phasing out EU beers. Post #Brexit we need to invest in our own industries & become a global economic powerhouse once more. Time to #BackBritishBrands
Dominic Grieve says Parliament is "entitled" to force the Government to do as it says on #Brexit... but that's not what he said during the Article 50 debate last year. #bbcqt
Brexit is tory owned, Mr. Corbyn is trying gallantly to appease both sides in this crisis, Theresa May is a liar, she's only interested in appeasing the hard tory #Brexit ERG chaired by the multi millionaire Jacob Rees-Mogg, so stop blaming JC, #EUWithdrawalBill, it's May's fault
#Brexit was supposed to cut immigration, but now as fewer workers come from the EU the government is allowing more medical staff to come in from outside the EU. Can't say we didn't warn that #Brexit  would mean more non-EU immigration. #StopBrexit #LeaveLies
Dominic Grieve: "The Daily Mail is a vile newspaper." #Brexit
BBC News at 10 does 3 minute segment on Rolls Royce job losses in Derby. The word #Brexit is never mentioned. Restructuring apparently. Nothing to do with that shower in Westminster... #BrexitShambles
#Brexit means Brexit. 
“Dear World,We are Global Britain.Our Prime Minister lies to our government and they all backstab each other.Please come and do business with us.Love and kisses, @DExEUgov @tradegovuk @foreignoffice xxx”. #BrexitShambles#Brexit 
Did you vote leave thinking no deal was a conceivable outcome? If not, know it’s ok to change your mind, know #brexit is not inevitable, know others feel like you, know you can become a #remainernow
Unbelievable:EU official claims:- Farage, Wilders, Le Pen, Salvini on Putin's payroll  - Russians responsible for #Brexit Funny he did not mention his great friend George Soros who has publicly pumped billions into political campaigning
Remoaners claim they don't want to stop #Brexit we just want a vote that COULD stop it which we will like totally never usIt's like my son asking me for chocolate at dinner time and swearing he won't eat it until later.Get behind the Government or go! 
Two pics sum up unprecedented days in Commons for me:  Tues full @theSNP  benches for points of order protesting #Brexit votes #PowerGrab; Weds empty benches after #PMQs #SNPwalkout - we will use all options  available to stand up for Scotland...
MUNDELL has been called on to RESIGN by RIGHT-WING TORY THINK TANK over his mishandling of #Brexit billAnd part-time Tory RUTH Davidson doesn't escape their criticism eitherRUTH stands ACCUSED along with Mundell of DELIBERATELY CAUSING a CONSTITUTIONAL ROW to thwart BREXIT 
Dear Labour Remainers. If Corbyn opposes Brexit it might be stopped, but if he supports it, there will be nothing anyone can do to stop it. If you want to stop #Brexit you must ensure Corbyn does the right thing. The future of our country now rests on your shoulders.#StopBrexit
Just another example of why you would have to be off your head to trust anything May and her UK government appear to agree to. #Brexit #Brexitshambles
You mean a lie.The PM lied to her back bench MPs.That sort of "verbal agreement" that later turned out to not honored by one party of the agreement....a lie.You spin it well, but it is obvious what has happened and the EU is watching.#Dictatorship#Brexit#PeoplesVote
Looks like Mrs May has reneged on her promise to allow Parliament to do its job and hold the Government to account on #Brexit - more evidence that this country is now run by a coalition  of hard-right Brexiteers and the DUP. 
BREXIT: Tory Brexit chaos explodes as rebels declare war on 'sneaky' Theresa May /#EU #Brexit #meaningfulvote
Only 21% of voters in the latest @YouGov poll think the Government is handling #Brexit well (net -45% well/badly). Yet TMay leads JCorbz by 15% as best PM. Fifteen per cent!
And the EU's trade deal (still unratified) with Canada called CETA is currently blocked by some member states. Isn't the EU wonderful?#Brexit researched facts for ordinary people:  
The crucial term is “in principle”. Confirms we are set to leave without a substantive deal on future partnership, only withdrawal & transition agreed—then enter 21 months purgatory. Puts the U.K. in an even weaker negotiating position. Very worrying news. #Brexit 
The European Arrest Warrant is a key part of Scotland’s fight against crime. It speeds up cases by allowing the rapid & smooth transfer of individuals between Member States to face justice. @scotgov is clear that retaining the EAW should be a key outcome of #Brexit negotiations. 
So, pro Remain Theresa May replaces Minister who is a Remainer in a Leave constituency who quit for #Brexit conflicts with an pro Remain MP in a Leave constituency.  What could possibly go wrong?
I will be on the @TonightShowTV3 later along with @MaireadMcGMEP @AodhanORiordain @LNBDublin to talk about @campaignforleo first year as well as the latest on #Brexit. Hoping CAP reform will get a mention.
Once again we must point out to Remainer MPs that this man is the EU Parlt's #Brexit Co-ordinator.  Is this misguided thinking truly what you want to stay part of?Original #Brexit research & news daily: 
It you think that #brexit will help the UK then you have been sold a lie.And the saddest thing is that the liars will benefit.
Polish call for #EUreferendum comes amid the full throes of #Brexit and the rise of anti-EU #populists in Austria, Hungary, and Italy, posing questions for future EU cohesion.
Jacob Rees-Mogg’s fund is opening up in Ireland, Nigel Lawson wants to be a French resident and Andy Wigmore is planning to move to Belize. Why don't they stick around and enjoy the "sunlit uplands" they promised after #Brexit? Hypocrites!#PeoplesVote
Scotland. Remain in the UK and subject ourselves to #PermaTory rule, where draconian laws are made by braying lunatics, in their effort to make a success of a country severely debilitated and degraded by #BREXIT,or independence. I agree with the SG who made this resolution. 
Soooo wrong on so many levels from both sides.#Brexit 
One thing is clear, the lack of a nationalist voice in Westminster arguing against Brexit makes a hard border more likely. Sinn Fein should take their Westminster seats and use their mandate to defend the interests of all the people of Ireland on #Brexit.
Big exclusive here from @waitey - largest firm of architects in the UK, the world-renowned @FosterPartners considering moving HQ out of the country in face of #Brexit

If #Brexit happens Leavers will not be satisfied. The right-wing press will direct them to new targets for hate - Muslims are clearly at the top of the list at the moment, but any group which doesn't fit the label of 'decent white middle-England' could be targeted.#S

#SuckItUp? It’s about time @BroxtoweCons did something about the disgraceful #MP @Anna_Soubry & her behaviour. #AnnaSoubry is ignoring her constituency, & the entire country’s decision to #Leave the #EU & defying her @Conservatives party manifesto! pic.twitter.com/yqFa1VIMTR #BREXIT
 WATCH: The UK Government is working entirely within the Sewel Convention as part of the devolution settlement.The SNP should put their toys back in the pram and get back round the negotiating table. #SewelConvention #Devolution #Brexit 
Message to those arrogant MPs who've still not got the message of the #Brexit voteIf you don't vote to deliver #Brexit 'toute suite' we will vote you OUT at the next election.You might then realise what OUT meansOUT means left, gone away,departedWe voted to be free of the EU
“We have sought consent” said @DavidMundellDCT . Yes, but you didn’t get it. That’s the point. #Brexit #PowerGrab
David Mundell confirms the view we long thought he held: "Scotland is not a partner in the UK, it's a part of the UK". Know your place, eat your cereal... #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill #PowerGrab
#UK : TENS OF THOUSANDS To Take To The Steets In #Brexit Anniversary Rally Next Week!  Will May listen?       #fo2eu
This is very significant. Virtually unnoticed amendment to #Brexit Bill looks like it means we’re heading for #CustomsUnion #SingleMarket or near as.
SNP frustration shows that #Brexit will not only result in economic chaos but also fuel calls for Scottish independence. Government arrogance in dealing with Scotland matched only by their incompetence in trying to negotiate #Brexit
Honoured to be the first EU leader to meet Spain’s new PM Pedro Sanchez  at the Moncloa in Madrid. We’ll be talking about how much Spain and Ireland have in common re #Brexit and #FutureofEurope and looking ahead to the next @EUCouncil meeting.
Labour threw away a chance to defeat the government over the EEA/single market amendment. It has left the country heading towards the economic precipice and people asking what exactly our opposition is for.Me for @LeftFootFwd #Brexit #EUWithdrawlBill

If you're one of the millions who voted #brexit in the referendum, and had been promised it would be beneficial, do you now understand that they wilfully lie to you?#StopBrexit2018 #PeoplesVote #Remain #FinalSayForAll
British people voted for FREEDOM!Iain Duncan Smith tells May: Get a deal by EU summit or WALK“The British people voted for freedom & Parliament must remember that nothing should stop the Government delivering on that vote.”#Brexit #Leave #EU Go #WTO
#BestForBritain appears to have suffered a system failure  Try switching it off and on again. Or better still, just switch it off #Brexit 
Mundell was asked to appear in front of Holyrood’s Constitutional Committee meeting on #Brexit and justice today.He won’t be attending.There’s your “respect for the national parliament of Scotland” right there. 
Weatherspoons to punish Europeans by not promoting Belgian beer & French wine at its pubs in the run up to “brexit day”. we should all show our support for #Wetherspoons for their stance on #brexit

Gvnmnt has just won every vote on #Brexit . The will of the people and the will of Parliament is for proper Brexit. What do we get from Grieve @Anna_Soubry ? Plots to scupper democracy and speeches that patronise and insult MPs and leave voters. Get behind @Conservatives or go!
The Daily Mail wants to silence anyone who dares criticise #Brexit, but WE won’t be bullied. Join the #PeoplesVoteMarch on June 23 to make your voice heard!For all the details, and to pledge to march alongside us, visit:Please retweet!
Good to see the Royal College of Midwives join the @theRCN & growing number of others calling for #PeoplesVote on a #Brexit deal (if this shambles of a Govt is capable of reaching one) 
Back in the chamber for @theSNP to ask @DExEUgov what they will do to address @EHRC advice that losing #CharterofFundamentalRights after #Brexit will weaken #HumanRights in UK. Answer = nothing because UK Govt disagree with @EHRC. Shocking
Jacob Rees-Mogg. A hypocrite by any reasonable definition. A do as I say, not as I do spiv,  example of so much,  wrong with politics today.  City firm co-founded by Jacob, set up investment fund in Ireland..warning about dangers of hard Brexit. #Brexit 
No more Monsieur Nice Guy: Time to play Barnier at his own Dirty Game!No payments without a Good Deal.Immediate stop to all #EU fees.Trade Deals with Commonwealth.Duties on German & French cars.All step by step until we get an acceptable deal.#Brexit
Spot on James, madness. #Brexit must, and can still be, stopped 
Travelling to London to speak @UKandEU event. I’ll call on the Prime Minister to come clean on #Brexit, to erase the red lines & get the UK Brexit ready by establishing a positive relationship with the Single Market.

“Unchangeable decisions have no place in a democracy.” But to these rebels one thing clearly is: the decision 45 years ago to join the EU. Listen to those who advocate a so-called “meaningful vote”, and you realise it’s not at all about democracy, it is about thwarting #Brexit.
The government has totally lost control over #Brexit. A no deal fudge with their own MPs will end in tears if PM fails to deliver on her promise to them
Good & bad news for #brexit this week. On negative side Jaguar & Rollls-Royce slash 6 000 high quality jobs in UK.On plus side Weatherspoons to punish Europeans by not promoting Belgian beer & French wine at its pubs in the run up to “brexit day”.That will show them...
European Parliament, changes to number of MEPs after #Brexit:- Cut from 751 to 705 MEPs- Redistribution of the 73 UK seats: 46 available for possible enlargement, 27 to under-represented countries (incl. +5 for France)-Formal adoption by Council on 28-29 June#EP2019

I think this is one of the most interesting #Brexit stories for many days EU to create new sea route between Ireland and mainland Northern Europe that will bypass Britain after Brexit under “preparedness” plans being drafted by @MartinSelmayr
Today’s #DailyMail is silly & sinister. They won’t stop  #DominicGrieve (send him your support) from fighting their hard no deal #Brexit. Sad & dangerous times when MPs are vilified for meeting campaign groups they don’t even support! 
 @OwenSmith_MP If you’re a #remainer or a #remainernow & like Owen (and me) you believe #Brexit will make the UK poorer, weaker and more isolated, it’s vital you do what you can to oppose it!Write to your MP, talk to friends, join local anti-Brexit group, back #peoplesvote!
Last night’s #Brexit vote marked the 100th #Labour front bench resignation under Jeremy Corbyn. That is an achievement which sets him apart from any other political leader.
Six Labour MPs quit over #Brexit vote as 74 vote against their whip.Looks like there are far more Labour MPs with principles than Tories. Pity so many Tory MPs fell for May's con trick on Tuesday.
“Fidelity to the promises that are implicit between the governing & the governed is absolutely essential to the health of our democracy...The real danger of extremism in our politics is if we ignore what people voted for” @SimonClarkeMP#Brexit
We stand on the verge of a Western renaissance:- USA: Trump - UK: #Brexit - Austria, Poland, Czech, Denmark: EU critical, migrant critical gov't- Italy, Hungary: populist gov't- Sweden: anti-migrant party 1st in poll- Slovenia: populist win- MSM collapse- 'Stop NATO war' 
(Reuters) - Lawyers for #Brexit campaigner @Arron_banks ordered the European Parliament’s chief Brexit coordinator @guyverhofstadt on Wednesday to retract a claim that Banks colluded with Russia to deliver Britain's vote to leave the European Union.
Owen Smith - I remain a remainer... l would love this country to block, thwart, resist, revert #Brexit as it will make my constituents poorer & my country weaker & more isolated. I can't believe this Govt is still pursuing a policy to make our country poorer..#StopBrexit #FBPE

Congratulations to Mrs May, who has successfully dragged us out of the Charter on Human Rights.I'm sure the #Brexit fanatics will explain that they KNEW they were voting to be tortured and killed by the government, and that it's worth it.
You do realise that New Labour was centrist and under Tony Blair it led Britain into a war in Iraq so disastrous that most of the world's present day problems can be laid at its feet. #brexit 
Just to remove any uncertainty, I am hard #Remain. I am marching with like minded friends on 23rd June in London who are also hard Remain. Hard Remain means no #Brexit. No May Brexit and no fucking Corbyn Brexit. Fuck Brexit and what it is doing to my country.#StopBrexit
Bankers from the City of London are threatening to leave if #Brexit is implemented. That would be the best thing that could happen to Britain. These parasites have been sucking the blood out of the British #economy for ages.
Now, #r4today, you do need to get Jacob Rees-Mogg in.You urgently need to ask him why it is acceptable to inflict a Hard #Brexit on the entire population of Britain excepting his wealthy clients.
The  threats against MPs have been cynically whipped up by Tory politicians & the right-wing press including the PM with rhetoric about the "Will of the People" which demonises opponents of #Brexit as enemies of the people.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Looking at the list of #Brexit “rebels” tonight, it reads like a Who’s Who of every treacherous scurvy plotter and wrecker who cost #Corbyn the last election and cost Britain the chance of a #Labour government. Because of them we have Theresa #May
Surely some mistake @michaelgove? Is not maintaining EU environmental standards and principles the basic starting blocks for your Green #Brexit?#EUwithdrawalbill
House of Commons -  tonight after the rejection of The European Single Market by .@Conservatives  and .@UKLabour  has given a clear message to Companies -  prepare to exit the UK.Folly of the gravest order.#Brexit #FBPE #LewishamEastByElection
74 brave #Labour MPs rebelled tonight. You can be a rebel too. If you are a party member, sign up today to join members across the country proposing our @Remain_Labour & @Labour4EU motion in their CLP, calling for a #PeoplesVote to resolve #Brexit 
#Brexit is the defining issue of our generation. If we abstain, we will be  complicit. We stand by our principles, or we stand for nothing.  If you want the #Labour Party to stand against Brexit and support a #PeoplesVote now is the time to join us.
Laura Smith MP: 60% #Leave"Taking rules from Brussels but having no role in making them is simply not good enough for Britain.I promised Crewe & Nantwich I would respect the referendum result.Remaining in the EEA is not compatible with that"#Brexit #EU
Delighted to have supported my Prime Minister in every single vote this evening, voting against unhelpful Lords amendments. #Redditch voted to leave, I am here to deliver on the will of my constituents. Tonight’s votes will bring closer to the sensible #Brexit they voted for. 
Dear people of BritainYou must all move your assets offshore to avoid the chaos of #Brexit caused by stupid lying bastards like @Jacob_Rees_Mogg .  He is the chief #bedshitter but is running away from his mess.  You should do the same.  Oh, no, you can’t because you arent rich.
When:Your MP's don't back you on #Brexit90+ rebel6 of your front bench team resign because they disagree with youThe total number of MP's that have resigned from your front bench smashes the 100 barrierI imagine that @jeremycorbyn has had better days!#EUWithdrawalBill
#Remain fanatic #AnnaSoubry has told 17.4 million #Leave #voters to "suck it up" regarding her #Brexit  betrayal.

Just joined the #SNP.I am not one for joining parties, but felt it was time for something different. As a No voter from 2014, the events since #Brexit and especially the last couple of days, made it clear that the only way is #indyref2 and #DissolveTheUnion.#ScotRef #YesWeCan
Tens of 1000s of Welsh jobs depend on frictionless trade with the EU. An #EEA-based #Brexit is now the only realistic, ready-made option for #Aberavon, #Wales and the entire UK, particularly given the shambolic incompetence of the UK Govt. The time for abstaining has long passed.

The £20bn Euro security project UK is being shut out of - because of #Brexit Tomorrow’s Guardian 
Anna Soubry received £6,000 from pro EU More United Ltd 8th May 2018 according to  MPs Register Financial Interests. Nice little earner to defy #Brexit & @theresa_may in this week's Lords Amendment votes.
Never underestimate Corbyn's Labour. Every time May's Govt get into a #Brexit crisis Corbyn assists them. Five Labour frontbench MPs have resigned in protest at Corbyn's propping up Tory Brexit. How do left-wing Corbynistas feel abt this shambles? 
Jeremy Corbyn brought the house down at today’s PMQs, leaving Theresa May ‘absolutely fuming’By @timothyjwoods7 #PMQs #Brexit
The Commons has just voted to take away the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights after #Brexit, eroding our rights and equality protections. #EUWithdrawalBillThis is a needless step backwards for the UK. Rights lost aren't easily won back.
You are so wrong!  I voted NO in 2014, but now, thanks to #Brexit, am 100% YES for #indyref2. I am not the only one!This cannot continue. There is nothing left for Scotland, but independence! We can do it!#scotref #FreeScotland #DissolveTheUnion
So on the #brexit #WithdrawalBill amendment that could have protected jobs in London & rest of UK, Corbyn orders his MPs to abstain.Corbyn's stuck 2 fingers up to voters in #LewishamEast He's saying their jobs don't matter. Their vote can let him know what they think of that.
To @MilesBriggsMSP & @ScotTories questioning @theSNP actions today- tonight we’re voting according to our constituents wishes on #Brexit unlike you. Oh & an afternoon at my desk allowed me to catch up on some of the casework your boss can’t be bothered doing
This is the UK’s direct and complicit censorship of an American In the U.K.  They won’t let him gain new followers and they unfollow if you were following him. Who really believes @#FreeTommyRobinsonNow will happen under Socialist Theresa May? Long live #Brexit 
Has #JeremyCorbyn been sacked from #TheresaMay's cabinet yet? Is she too weak to even do that or are #Labour too weak to remove him? #BothTheSame #Brexiteers#BrexitShambles #Brexit #FinalSayForAll #EUWithdrawalBill
We haven’t been forgotten: we’ve been betrayed. Despite their false reassurances the U.K. government isn’t interested in fighting the corner of 1.3mn Brits on the continent. Shame on them. #brexit @BritishInEurope
This is just a bloody disgrace.  Why isn’t @BBCNews splashing this!  The #1 Hard Brexiter in Parliament is moving business out of U.K. to mitigate the disaster of #Brexit.  You could not make it up 
At the stroke of a pen we could end this pathetic #Brexit farce. Revoke A50.Much damage already wreaked, it would take a long time to repair, but the relief in the country would be therapeutic, the economy would boom.#StopBrexitSaveBritain And put the kettle on.Good night!
.@Anna_Soubry is out of order here. Anna is quite awful in response to the points made by @UKLabour MP @CarolineFlintMP on #Brexit because they do not meet with her own remain views.Well done the speaker for calling her out. #EUWithdrawalbill
Lords amendment 51 (LA51) to the #EUWithdrawalBill aims to keep the UK in the EU Single Market after withdrawal from the EU, through membership of the European Economic Area. This would avoid the worst economic damage of #Brexit, so I will be voting to keep LA51 in the Bill. 1/3

For the next time Rees-Mogg says #brexit will work out fine and we don't have to worry about a hard Tory Brexit....#ToryBrexitShambles
My constituents are not against all migration - but they want to feel that we have better systems in place, that they feel it is fair and managed. And that is something they haven't felt for a long time. @CarolineFlintMP makes a passionate defence of her constituents. #Brexit 
You have to admire the neck, really........Arch-Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg sets up Dublin arm to trade in EU after the UK quits #brexit  via @IrishTimesBiz

Caroline Flint is a rare MP who supported Remain but actually understands why her constituents disagreed with her and respects their decision. The odious treatment she received from Soubry and her "fellow" Labour MPs shows what a bubble they live in.#Brexit
Tom Brake MP: #Brexit is like being on a ship heading towards an iceberg & offering the Ppl an option to jump into the water or head for the lifeboats..but there is a 3rd option..ask the Ppl if they now want the ship to change direction.ME: Welcome aboard the SS #Brexit-anic
‘No deal is better than a bad deal’ was never a credible #Brexit negotiating position. Lamenting that the Government isn’t preparing for no deal is a red herring. (Plus it doesn’t have the £, time, capacity or ‘tech’ to do it.) 
 Today @SP_LocalGovt @KeithBrownSNP gave evidence on city deals. UK Govt no-show.  Earlier this year @SP_HealthSport conducted #Brexit enquiry. UK Govt no-show. Now @SP_Justice members have been informed, David Mundell won’t appear tomorrow. A partnership of equals?
Scottish lawmakers storm out of UK parliament in #Brexit row. And suddenly, everyone knows what is going on regarding Brexit in Scotland and London so whether or not it was staged, it worked. 
Remain in the House as part of the establishment, abstain for Scotland and sit on the fence over #Brexit while waxing lyrical about Karl Marx in the abstract. As authentic as an Irish pub in Dubai. 
Sinn Féin, Alliance Party, SDLP and Green Party have released a joint statement on human rights and equality in the event of EU exit #Brexit #HumanRights

Hilary Benn currently making magnificent speech on #Brexit Bill. #EEA #SingleMarket
Ken Clarke says that no member of the public, during the referendum, ever asked him about the single market or the customs union. That’s because Cameron et al said, on numerous occasions, that #Brexit would mean leaving them both. Has the “father” of the house been nodding off?
I’ll be speaking for @theSNP at @PrideEdinburgh this weekend celebrating our gains 30 years on from the fight against #Section28 & warning of the threat to #LGBT Rights from #Brexit & the #HostileEnvironment on #immigration
.@scottishlabour's position on #Brexit is summed up perfectly by @KirstySNP.
Theresa May suffers guffaws & humiliation as Jeremy Corbyn jokes about Boris’ remark about Trump taking over #Brexit talks. WATCH : Theresa May’s expression and Boris Johnson red with embarrassment.  
I see you're still working against #Brexit and the British government Anna. And the democratic will of its people. Putting the EUs needs above those of who you're supposed to be representing in writing isn't your finest hour. 
May other citizens of #Europe note that, today, 59% of Scotland’s Members of the UK Parliament walked out of the debate on #Brexit that 62% of Scots had voted against. Many of us are finding it hard not to feel colonised by a political spirit that is alien to our dearest values. 
Labour colleague after Labour colleague from constituencies that voted Leave have intervened in this debate to urge support for #SingleMarket #EEA amendment to #Brexit Bill.
I'm not alone in this. #Brexit is life-threatening. People need to know this.
Damn - the Govt Solicitor General is being absolutely brutalised on #Brexit by Labour MPs and, well, everyone...Brexit is a mess that’s falling apart. 
Leavers say that we should ignore the opinions of those who abstained in the referendum. Well it is much more responsible to abstain if you feel unsure or insufficiently informed than to vote on the basis of ignorance & blind prejudice.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #Brexit
I used to be an opera singer - #Brexit has allowed this arbitrary skill set to be unleashed on the general public on July 8th for the @artists4brexit's Big Brexit Party - please come and support me - buy tickets here 
Yesterday’s most important amendment from the Lord’s with some further amendment was on the #GFA which not only places it in law but also means we will have to be in a #CustomsUnion with the EU & in effect the #singlemarket. Let’s just suck it up and move on!!  #Brexit
How the British establishment sees our limited democracy: Perfectly fine to squash Scottish devolution into a 15 min non-debate. But to protest abt this state of affairs is a "stunt". #Brexit #PowerGrab
Labour spokesman- action will be taken against Labour frontbenchers voting for the EEA: Says everything you need to know about the current #Brexit supporting @UKLabour leadership
Remember Westminster watchers the SNP walkout on #Brexit #PowerGrab isn't just abt WM disrespect of the SNP but of the Scot Parl. Scot Parl voted 93-30 against Brexit bill with SNP, Labour, Lib Dems & Greens in majority. Only Tories against.
SNP Westminster leader ⁦@IanBlackfordMP⁩ tells ⁦@daily_politics⁩ his party will use “every measure at our disposal” to take on UK government over #Brexit impact on devolved powers 
The Prime Minister confirms at #PMQs to me that there is NO level of damage Brexit can inflict on UK firms and jobs that will lead her to grant the people a final say on the deal and a chance to exit from #Brexit. This is the state we are in! #FBPE
“I will do everything in my power to delay and impede and interfere with and stifle and muddle and obfuscate and obstruct and confuse and derail and discombobulate in any way I can to see that #Brexit never occurs on my watch.“

The #EU is dying. Everything it has touched has been a disaster thanks to authoritarians like you. Its values and principles are not compatible with democracy and freedom, and that’s what people want. Your attempt to create a new Soviet Union in Europe is doomed. Happy #Brexit. 
nobody but nobody will be the least interested in the rest of #pmqs Fully support @IanBlackfordMP and the SNP team for refusing to be silenced again.  Yesterday was the last straw. #EUWithdrawalBill #brexit
It is “a democratic outrage” @IanBlackfordMP asking for the House of Commons to sit in private over #Brexit vote"I have had a mixed sequence of advice" says the Speaker #bbcdp #pmqs
.@jeremycorbyn: did @theresa_may do as @BorisJohnson suggested when she met @realDonaldTrump and ask him to take over the #Brexit talks? Her response below is a must see. She is not amused. #PMQs
PM flummoxed - completely and utterly lost for words as @jeremycorbyn asks her if she took Boris’s advice and asked Trump to take over #Brexit negotiations #PMQs
These #PMQs could be interesting after yesterday’s disgraceful treatment of Scotland and the ripping up of the devolved settlement by the UKGovernment over #brexit
I understand the arguments of those protesting not to leave the #EU i really do but ultimately for me staying in the bloc would be more damaging for our nation's future then leaving. I voted #leave and I would do so again now. I'm very #proeuropean but anti #EU #Brexit
Three ministers 'meet anti-Brexit group over second referendum'  #Brexit 
Science is a fundamentally collaborative & global enterprise & the UK should seek arrangements that create the lowest possible barriers to practising scientists seeking to move across borders #TogetherScienceCan #Brexit

We voted to #Leave #EU & ever since we’ve had unedifying spectacle of metropolitan elite trying their hardest to stymie that decision matched only by incompetence of those who are trying to implement it.Brexit means #BrexitCan we FINALLY get ON with it?
'We've seen this extraordinary Tory reliance on the Idea that former Imperial colonies will open their markets.. Its just not true'. #Brexit 
Europe has a fifth column in its ranks: Putin's cheerleaders who want to destroy Europe & liberal democracy from within: Le Pen, Wilders, Farage, Orbàn, Kaczynski, Salvini use Kremlin money & intel. Like Farage's friend Arron Banks, who colluded w/ Russians to deliver #Brexit
I'm an American and I stand with the 17.4 million who voted for #Brexit! May you relinquish the thrall of the EU and commence your sovereignty!
.@wallace_anna & @EmilyKhan11 answer some of the most commonly asked questions about #Brexit in this short video: 
No wonder Brussels wants everything written down and legaled. This govt's promises aren't worth the paper they're written on. The damage #Brexit has done to our international reputation as an honest, decent partner is immeasurable. #BrexitBill
You got a Tory Gov't, you got #Brexit & now on road to a Hard Brexit. Well, that's what happens when voters listen to what they read in Tory owned newspapers & fall for FBPE & Open Britain Trap. Should've listened to Corbyn & not 2 those who misrepresent him.#WednesdayWisdom
Hi mainstream media, Now that Theresa May has put off any major decisions on #Brexit, again with her fudge with Tory rebels, any chance yo could now report on #ToryIslamophobia and #ToryRacism? It's an actual thing and people are worried. Thanks!
Jacob Rees Mogg -Tory #diastercapitalist.And he's not the only one.As this fiasco continues, watch out for many  of the #JaredAndIvanka s of #Brexit to surface. Without shame. Hey, it's #business! #AlwaysBeClosing 
 Keep an eye on our website @EU_Commission for the latest on the #Brexit negotiations & @MichelBarnier’s agenda:  - You can sign up for updates here:  
EU collapse:- UK: #Brexit- Greece: bankrupt- Slovenia: populist win- Italy, Spain: banks insolvent- Sweden: anti-migrant party 1st in poll- Spain: independence Catalonia, looming elections- Italy, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Czech: 'no more migrants'Orange: latest attacks 
If yesterday proved nothing else, it showed the #FBPE brigade in the clearest possible terms that attacking Corbyn changes nothing because, as many have said for some time now, he cannot stop #Brexit. I'll now be auto-blocking any still thick enough to believe otherwise.
This is the Land Rover Discovery, Thousands of JLR Jobs have just been lost due to #brexit as JLR Switch production from Solihul to Slovakia, hope that you are happy now #brexit #morons But still we have got our country back Innit
The root cause of the UKs weakness in the #Brexit negotiations is a weak leader, who weakened her own foundations with a ridiculous manifesto in the last GE, which seemed designed to upset everybody.
UK Justice Minister #PhillipLee resigns over #Brexit “I believe that the evidence now shows that the Brexit policy our government is currently pursuing on the basis of the 2016 referendum is detrimental to the people we are elected to serve.” Brexit is supposedly 288 days away. 
To be clear...if I’ve been promised a walk I expect it to happen.... #brexit #meaningfulvote
May is likely to bow to pressure from pro-Europe rebels as #Brexit debate continues in parliament 
.@IanBlackfordMP tells #BBCGMS that the lack of time given to Scottish MPs to debate the #Brexit bill was a "democratic outrage" 
Thanks #Brexit ... Goodbye #London Bonjour #Paris
We deeply regret the UK leaving, but EU27 will stand firm and united in the #Brexit negotiations. Thank you to @MichelBarnier for keeping in close consultation with the @Europarl_EN and safeguarding the interests of EU citizens.
Britain could keep frictionless trade after #Brexit by joining EEA and customs union, Michel Barnier says.  Non merci.
I think we understand perfectly that Scotland has been well & truly shafted. #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit #PowerGrab #DissolveTheUnion #bbcdp
If #Brexit were cancelled I think this would be the response of the majority of Brits:"It's been cancelled? Oh I thought we'd already left, Ahh well, did you see Love Island last night?"
JD Wetherspoon announces it will "offer more drinks from UK and non-EU producers and brewers in the run up to Brexit". Champagne and German wheat beers out. UK sparkling wine and craft beers in. #Brexit
Precisely because #Brexit has turned out to be much more complex than was anticipated during the referendum, the result will be a #Brexit no one voted for. 
As England's soccerball team head to the #WorldCup in Russia we will see a great analogy for #Brexit A nation stirred up by jingoism begins to believe it can win on the world stage despite knowing the reality is that they'll lose and only Russia will gain from it all

#Brexit Some of us didn't know what we were voting for in the referendum. If I knew then what I know now I would have voted remain. I voted leave due to immigration and didn't realise the economic repercussions. Am I the only one? I doubt it. We weren't properly informed!

"WAKEY, WAKEY" - Our #Brexit call this morning to all MPs to wake up.  
Yet another day waking up to radio/tv discussions over #Brexit - with most of us not really knowing what is going on!  When will this torture end ? #GroundhogDay :
Day 2 of the #EuWithdrawalBill: heading into Parliament for another day at work and defending Scotland from a damaging Tory hard #Brexit. Just a pity that only 35/59 Scottish MPs can be relied on to do that. 
The @theSNP leaderships position on #indyref2 has been "let's see" what #Brexit outcome will mean for #Scotland Well now we know. Time for @NicolaSturgeon to call it and end this pantomime.
⁦As the UK wakes up to fact that the Kremlin may have helped mire it in its #Brexit folly, Britain and the rest of the West should look to Russia’s neighbours for advice on how to deal with Kremlin meddling and aggression, writes ⁦@edwardlucas⁩
Indeed why are you not trying to stop #Brexit @lisanandy and reflect the views of the majority of Labour voters & members. This culture comes from #Brexit so pl explain  why you don't oppose it @EK_EuropeanMove @Labour4EU
President of the CBI: "There's zero evidence that independent trade deals will provide any economic benefit to the UK that's material. It's a myth,". Extraordinary times when the leader of this pro-Conservative organisation speaks out like this.  #Brexit 
This sums up how yesterday the govt squeezed & railroaded #EUWithdrawalBill amendments through.I fear today may not be better. On such a complex & crucial piece of constitutional legislation. After months of doing nothing. #Brexit 
"The truth is that the Brexiteers don't give a flying frig for Ireland, North or South, and that includes Irish Unionism and the DUP." Such a pity that @duponline don't realise their English nationalist allies would betray them in a heartbeat to reach the promised land of #brexit 
Young people really ARE getting more stupid, study finds  So #Snowflakes really are stupid! That explains why they dont understand that older people with wisdom and sense voted for #Brexit
@theresa_may has betrayed Leavers.Completely.Totally.Utterly.I could not feel more emotionally drained and despairing of the future of my country than I do tonight.I will never cast another vote in this country, now that #brexit is effectively DEAD. #EUWithdrawalBill
Hard to believe that barely 2 years ago the UK Government & @ScotTories were patting themselves on the back for putting Sewel, the principle of devolved consent, onto a "statutory basis". Today, finally, they effectively tore it up for the sake of their chaotic #Brexit obsession.
Here’s another great video prepared by @LLJourn this time with #Remainernow Gary from Norfolk. He talks about the lack of information about ramifications of leave vote at #euref and how he’s seen his prices go up & that #brexit is not wanted by the young!
How many man hours and millions have hardline remainers wasted to produce nothing and get nowhere all these months? Had they accepted the result and pitched in there would by now be a strong cross party backing for EEA Efta. #Brexit
#Brexit today -   - 
I’m sorry that I ever was pro-union. #Brexit has showed, quite blatantly, that Westminster treats Scotland with utter contempt. I never saw it before. I’m truly sorry and horrified by their actions.

Very much a side note to today’s #Brexit shenanigans but, jeeez, what a bad way to do parliamentary politics.No one seems to have a clue what’s going on, and MPs spend ages trooping out of chamber to vote.
The @georgesoros funded anti #Brexit @BestForBritain group has allegedly been meeting with three ministers to try to persuade them to back a second Brexit referendum.How much longer are we going to stand for him messing with democracy?#EUWithdrawalbill
Look at @TheGreenParty’s MEP Molly Scott Cato getting the best #Brexit possible, in the national interest, while the Tories continue faffing about with their #BrexitShambles and Labour fail to hold them to account. Pls can we elect more Greens? #VoteGreen #StopBrexit

How @MollyMEP achieved more meaningful #Brexit discussions in a single meeting with Michel Barnier than the entire UK government has managed in two years.
This is the contempt which Westminster feels for Scotland's Parliament and Scotland's MPs. Devolution all but ignored in debate and the leader of the 3rd party told to contemplate suicide as an option. @ScotNational #EUWithdrawalBill #BrexitBill #scotlandsplaceineurope #Brexit 
I reckon @Arron_banks must have watched my US Senate video. He absolutely bested the doltards on the parliamentary star chamber today. Ran rings around them #Brexit @talkRADIO @JamesWhaleShow
A.C.Grayling demonstrates a very poor grasp of mathematics.DUP+Tories > all other partiesCorbyn couldn't have stopped the Hard #Brexit vote yet you still attack him: why?You need to be attacking those "Brave Tory Rebels" who all totally FAILED to rebel. 
Democracy seems to have won on points today rather than knockout. Hoping that whatever this concession is doesn't prove to be the "away goal" that scuppers the bill on its return to the House of Remoaners. The will of the people MUST be enacted IN FULL #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit 
 “led people up the garden path” in #Brexit #Referendum  - Arron Banks admits :
No doubt #FBPE will be blaming Corbyn for Tory Government avoiding a major defeat on its #Brexit bill. After all a minority opposition can always beat a majority government by simple tactic of lying about the mathematics of the voting system eh? 
When David Davis used the term 'constructive ambiguity' to describe his approach to #brexit, he meant 'I am a liar who makes stuff up on the hoof, depending on who's asking, to fool the public into trusting me, with the intent of stopping a Corbyn government at all costs'
...the Brexiters wanted to give Ministers a passport to crash out with no deal, if MPs don’t accept the PM’s #Brexit deal. Parliament said ‘no way’ today - hence the big concession. A good day for parliamentary democracy.
While Corbyn abstained . Cowards to the left us , fools to the right . In the meantime parliament just handed the executive unfettered power & hijacked devolution. Put that in the next Labour manifesto. #Brexit 
It's been a day of wrangling and compromise, but the government has dodged a major #Brexit defeat on the #EUWithdrawalBill.
Very warm welcome in Munich tonight - absolute solidarity with Irish position on Brexit, thank u @NielsAnnen - On to Berlin for tomorrow #Brexit @GermanyDiplo

David Liddington smirking to Mundell after filibustering out any debate on the devolution amendments to the #Brexit bill.Absolutely disgusting. 
Grim. @joannaccherry asks Speaker whether, when discussing options for MPs seeking debate on devolution & #Brexit (denied today), it was disorderly for a Conservative to shout "suicide" across the chamber.  Speaker reprimands the MP for "distasteful" language. #euwithdrawalbill
So most SNP MPs not permitted to intervene on Ministerial waffling, no Scottish Tory MP spoke up on behalf of our parliament and devolved powers & Scottish Labour MPs abstain on vote, hiding behind pathetic manufactured excuse. What a farce - Democracy #Westminster style #Brexit
 Any final UK-EU withdrawal agreement will need to win the approval of the European Parliament according to Article 50. If it doesn't, there will be no deal.Watch our video to find out more about the European Parliament's key role in the #Brexit negotiations. #Article50
Ahem. I keep referring to soft dictatorship, because that is where we are at. We are getting Tory Party over parliament every single time. This won’t end well. #Brexit
"The Mother of Parliaments" a place where free speech and debate is curtailed and carefully choreographed as to masquerade as being democratic.The sooner #Wales and #Scotland are independent nations the better. @YesCymru#EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit
To avoid defeat in today @theresa_may gave concessions that mean she cannot threaten the #EU with #Brexit with no deal. This significantly weakens the #UK hand in negotiations. The "no deal is a better than a bad deal" idea is now dead. She's compromised the future of the country
Anybody notice how the near constant abuse by some Remainers of foreign-born #Brexit campaigners like @LowTaxChloe and @GiselaStuart have been consistently under-reported.Why?Sick of seeing Remainers telling them to "go home" because they personally disagree with their views.
There is less than one minute to go in the "debate" on #Brexit and devolved powers. The only speech that will be heard is from the Tory minister. Disgrace.
This afternoon/evening I’ve voted against 11 Government #Brexit amendments that were debated for just 3 hours, and which now leaves <30 minutes to discuss devolution issues. @theresa_may & Co have denied any proper parliamentary scrutiny. #EUWithdrawalBill
#EUWithdrawalBill. A half-victory (after partial government back-down) on the key issue of allowing #Parliament to have a meaningful vote on the #Brexit deal. Does this mean that battle will resume in Lords and come back to Commons again?
Govt seems to be paying price for never adjusting to post-election Parliamentary #brexit reality.
Government just won every vote comfortably. #Brexit #Dontbelievethespin #Theproofisinthelobby
It's all Jeremy Corbyn's fault, he could stop #Brexit at any time but he just doesn't bother. With the support of the Tory rebels, he could ... oh wait#EUWithdrawalBill
Calm down everyone. #Brexit is in motion. We are leaving EU CU and SM. It’s happening.
Isn't it obvious? Can successfully kicked down the road; moderates duped again by a full-on Machiavellian government in the process of an extreme right-wing coup. They'll get their desired #Brexit if this continues. Death by a thousand can-kicks & blatant lies.
I really hope @Peston analysis is correct. If it is, still all to play for to avert severe #Brexit damage from risk of no deal & can keep pressure on for #peoplevote with #optiontoremain before it’s too late.So many leave voters did not vote for this mess!#remainernow

We deeply regret that the UK has decided to leave the EU. But the EU27 will stand united to preserve the interest of European citizens in this very difficult #Brexit negotiation. Thank you @MichelBarnier for your work & report to the @EPPGroup today.
The government concession on the #meaningfulvote means we are one small step closer to a #PeoplesVote with the chance to stop #Brexit. If you are a #Labour supporter, join our campaign to make it happen. Brexit is not inevitable.
Too many Tories/rebels putting fear of a democratically elected Corbyn govt before allowing Parliament a #MeaningfulVote on #Brexit P*ss poor #PaperTigerRebels

So that’s it. Meaningful vote on #Brexit voted down 324 to 298. Words fail me

Dover, this twit is your MP. Be afraid of his #Brexit,  be very afraid. 
Nothing angers Brexiteers committed to the principles of Parliamentary sovereignty & elected representatives taking back control more than when Parliament exercises its sovereignty and takes back control. #Brexit 
It was the duty of the @BBCNews to rigorously question and examine #Brexit and those promoting it, to test whether it matched up to the many promises, and was fit for purpose. In this task the BBC has absolutely and totally failed. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE
Tomorrow MPs vote on an amendment to the #EUWithdrawalBill to save the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Here's @CoreyStoughton explaining why they must rebel against the PM. This is our last chance to keep all our rights after #Brexit - write to your MP now: 
Surely it would more accurately reflect the current state of #Brexit to conduct the House of Commons debate in Russian and then give the final vote to the women from #LoveIsIand
It really is a quite desperate and rather public example of how the UK Government has been in chaos on all aspects of #Brexit negotiations, both with EU & rebel MPs: last minute, half baked and desperate ‘concessions’ offered, all geared at saving Tory bacon 
Looks like Chief Whip has bought off moderate Tories with promise of “structured discussions” on the Grieve amendment. That doesn’t sound very water tight to me. #Brexit Bill. #meaningfulvote

Brilliant speech by @KateHoeyMP.Showing she has more respect for the #EURef result in particular & democracy in general in her little finger than most EU-phile Labourites & Tory pro-#EU, anti-#Brexit Remainers have in their entire body.#EUWithdrawalBill
Labour Leaver Kate Hoey says she is rebelling against her own party by not backing the Lords on a meaningful vote - says it is dressed up as parliamentary democracy but they really want to stop #brexit - it is disingenuous she says 
Dr Phillip Lee in his resignation speech understandably mentions the hackneyed line of the “manifest flaws of the EU” .... how small those flaws look now in comparison to the utter shambles of UK governance. #brexit
The short of the EEA argument is the fact that we have been an EU member for 40 years and nothing less than a fully comprehensive framework for future economic collaboration with our neighbours is a sufficient replacement. It is that simple.#Brexit
That was the vote for the Borough of Broxtowe not the constituency but hey let’s not the facts get in the way... #Brexit 
No @Anna_Soubry..with all due respect this isn't about what you believe in...its about what the people who voted in a democratic proccess believed in & selected.. this isn't about your constituency..it's about the total electorate which voted #Brexit .. #EUWithdrawalBill
LOL at @Anna_Soubry , crying at those that voted #Brexit, the Brexit campaign is "supported by Russian bots and dirty money". After 40+ years, I never was, and never will be "influenced" by ANYONE on the #EU Fourth Reich project. #BBCParl #BBCNewsChannel #AfternoonLive #SkyNews
Amber Rudd & Justine Greenjng join moderate Tories on the back benches, chief whip in snatched conversation with front bench. Then moves to back benches. Takes Justine Greening out the back. Stay strong Justine. #brexit bill
I intervened on @EdwardLeighMP: We had many hours of debate and decisive votes before we sent the article 50 letter. That is the point when Parliament decided to back the referendum. We can’t keep chopping and changing. #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill
Romanian MEP tell me to “go home”. I will once we’ve got real #Brexit. Perhaps he’d like some of his countrymen back? 
Whipping Labour MPs to abstain on #Brexit EEA amendment is whipping MPs to support Theresa May & her Government,  against best interests of Labour votersHow did Labour find itself in this position?
Ken Clarke on #Brexit ‘I have never known such a weak parliament’ and urges MPs to take control if they don’t like the final deal 
Look, @Theresa_May is taking us in circles. Why leave the #EU only to try and get back what we've already got? No, we can't find an answer either. This video in 15 seconds explains why #Brexit makes no sense. Please RT. 
There will be literally no continuing purpose to MPs who cave in to govt depriving them of any power over direction of #Brexit. If they vote to deny themselves a meaningful vote, there is absolutely no point to them as so-called democratic representatives
I urge you, people, to watch the debate on the BBC Parliament TV channel on the #EUWithdrawalBill and you will witness some appalling treachery of MPs who are confusing the whole issue with one aim - to block #Brexit All Blairites are totally in the pockets of the EU.
For all their false rhetoric over the last year, today is the day that the 13 Scottish Tories really have the opportunity to do the right thing for Scotland. I suspect, however, that they will put party before country. #Brexit

Pleased to get the 1st intervention in on ⁦@DavidDavisMP⁩ #EUWithdrawalbill speech pointing out UK Govt breaking their pledge in #GreatRepealBill White Paper to make changes to retained #EU law by delegated legislation only where “necessary” #Brexit 
Today the Government have used parliamentary chicanery to rule out all prospect of a serious debate on the future of the Northern Ireland border. This is a scandal. So much for Parliament taking back control. #FBPE #Brexit
Young People’s Minister @MareeToddMSP and I had a good discussion about young people’s involvement in , and views on #Brexit when @cisweb helped us launch the recruitment for the Children and Young People’s #Brexit panel which will inform @ScotGov on key issues.
So just to get this straight, #brexit was a vote to take back control by handing it unchecked to an unelected leader of a minority government which does not have to respond before Parliament or allow the people another chance to voice their opinion? #EUWithdrawalBill
#PhillipLee is  someone who put country over party and that is a rare quality in politicians and business people today. #brexit 
"After eight years of budget cutting, Britain is looking less like the rest of Western Europe and more like the United States, with a shrinking welfare state and spreading poverty."-@nytimes#austerity.... and now #Brexit.Both brought to you by the  @Conservatives#Article19
Just voting against the Government’s attempt to curtail debate on #Brexit Bill to just 12 hours. On, as Vernon Bogdanor reminds us, the most important Commons debate since the Norway campaign debate in 1940.  
Thanks very much - I've met with lots of people from NI who are gravely concerned about the course #Brexit is taking! 
Philip Lee's behaviour is totally out of order. He was elected to represent his constituents & deliver the will of the British people. The 2017 @Conservatives Manifesto committed us to leaving the Single Market & Customs Union. He should lose the whip! #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill
Proud to say @theSNP MPs have been among the strongest voices advocating retention of the #EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in #EUWithdrawalBill & I’ll be speaking about the importance of this again in the debate tomorrow #Brexit 
What I don’t understand about #Brexit is how relatively few public figures or activists are pushing for the workable compromise that surely most voters would prefer. As Leave & Remain voters respectively, LBSProtect & I have sent this to our MPs today, aided by @GAtypical. 
I’m backing our Prime Minister to vote down the attempts by the House of Lords to frustrate Brexit. We need to get this Bill passed, to allow her to negotiate a trade deal in our best interests. Redditch voted to leave the EU and that’s what I intend to vote for. #Brexit 
All Conservative MPs need to remember today what the 2017 @Conservatives Manifesto said: "As we leave the EU, we will no longer be members of the Single Market or Customs Union." #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit
It's really very simple. Both parties stood on manifestos committing to deliver #Brexit. If your constituents voted leave, then your duty is to all you can to ensure that happens.
#Brexit was Putin's 1st successful attack on western democracy in 2016.At a contentious Parliament hearing, major LeaveEU officials Arron Banks & Gary Wigmore are being grilled about Russian connections, data & a cash trail.Sound familiar?Livestream:
Today MPs have a chance to force the Government back to the negotiating table to agree a #Brexit deal that works for the country, with membership of Europe’s Single Market and Customs Union at its heart. 
Never forget. This man asked people to vote on #Brexit. Without defining what Brexit meant. Without carrying out any projections of consequences. All in an (unsuccessful) attempt to settle an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted his mates and f***ed off into the sunset. 
#EUWithdrawalBill Lords Amendments in @HouseofCommons.... @alisonthewliss & I appropriately attired with Alice in Wonderland symbolism.... #RabbitHole #Brexit #BrexitChaos
Trump & #Brexit are 2 sides of the same coin: a coordinated attack on the global system that has ensured peace & prosperity since the Second World War.  This is why I'll be marching for a #PeoplesVote on 23rd June and in opposition to Trump's visit to UK on 13th July.#TrumpKim
“Liberal” Media joyous over the resignation of a Tory government minister none of us had ever heard of from a position nobody knew he even had #SomeguycalledLee #Brexit
Brilliant from @adamboultonSKY who has just asked some Tory woman (I've just started watching) to name one country which has offered a #Brexit trade deal better than the one it has with the EU. If only the @BBCNews had such quality journalism. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Damning judgement of Government’s reckless and chaotic handling of #Brexit by former justice minister @DrPhillipLeeMP. Theresa May is stumbling towards a disastrous outcome that few if any voted for in 2016. 
This has got to be one of the hardest decisions a gov’t minister would take so I have total respect to him for standing by what he thinks is right regardless of which side of the debate you are on @DrPhillipLeeMP #Brexit 
A class war is being waged across the UK and Europe as a snobbish sect of the upper classes dump on the face of democracy and seek to deny #Brexit. WATCH: My speech in Strasbourg this morning. #WoolfesWeeklyWarning #EuropeanParliament #Plenary
Justice Minister Phillip Lee quits the government over #Brexit, saying he could not support "how our country's exit from the EU looks set to be delivered" 
1) MPs on all sides, a few thoughts on #BrexitWhilst you are all buried in amendments & counter amendments, and the frisson of whips & rebellion, it's worth putting 3 basic facts in front of you, for your considerationIn summary, Brexit is wrong for UK
This should not need saying, but: In a healthy democracy MPs should not be threatened by the media for standing up for their constituents. And in a democracy people should be allowed to change their minds. #Brexit 
#Brexit update: Today MPs vote on whether they should mark David Davis’ homework. He’s keen that they shouldn’t (he claims that risks him getting a lower final grade), which convinces me that they should, on behalf of us all. #BrexitBill
Our ad in today’s @FT calls for MPs to listen to the 61% of Brits who want Parliament to have a #MeaningfulVote on the government's #Brexit plan. Democracy is at stake! 
Remain-supporting Conservative MP Phillip Lee has resigned as a Justice Minister saying he will be able to "better speak up for my constituents."His Bracknell constituency voted 53.2% leave.He should be de-selected and a pro #Brexit Tory selected in his place.He is a disgrace, 
Heading to Westminster and looking forward to voting with other @theSNP MPs to protect Scotland from a hard #Brexit. Will @RuthDavidsonMSP's @ScotTories MPs stand up for Scotland? Or will they blithely follow their whips and vote to make Scotland worse off?
Respect to Dr Phillip Lee for putting his country before party and personal interests, which is what we are sent to Parliament to do.I have spoken to at least one other Minister who is as disillusioned as he is with this whole #Brexit mess. Will they follow his example? 
It seems that one #Conservative MP is willing to put country before career, patriotism before party, #Britain before a bad #Brexit Will there be any others? 
A gov't minister has resigned over #Brexit being actively detrimental to the interests of his constituents. He just so happens to be my brother-in-law & I know how much this decision has cost him. Well done @DrPhillipLeeMP for showing integrity in the face of blind foolhardiness.
Looking forward to seeing every Tory and Labour MP today voting in accordance with Brexit commitments made in the manifestos they were elected on. As public servants they’ll surely honour the public will. #Brexit
It's fantastic to see the Royal Mail finally commemorating the three stages of  #Brexit. 
#brexit is a shambles.  Few MPs likely to show courage & put the country 1st this week.  Time to take back control. March with me on 23rd June for #PeoplesVote on the real options.  Meet at Pall Mall at 12.00 & march to Parliament Square.  Please watch & share my video message
"I believe that the evidence now shows that the #Brexit policy our Government is currently pursuing on the basis of the 2016 referendum is detrimental to the people we are elected to serve". #BrightBlue
MPs of all persuasion should remember that all of the population is 'the people', only some of them want #Brexit. We will all suffer the consequences of a lack of empathy today. Please do the right thing for our country, even if that is to the detriment of your party #EmpathyDay
Theresa May is likely to survive the #Brexit votes because Tory rebels like Soubry will bottle it again as May offer some “we’ll work it out later” fudge.This’ll mean just 9 months to Brexit with no plan, no detail and not a single clue.#ToryBrexitShambles
How MPs vote on #Brexit will affect the UK for generations to come. They must force the Government back to the negotiating table to agree a deal that works for the country, with membership of Europe’s Single Market and Customs Union at its heart.
MPs vote on their OWN future!A “Meaningful Vote” happened when 17.4 Million people voted #Leave & to break ALL ties with Brussels.MPs need to remember this over the next 48 hours.Betrayal of #Brexit will NOT be forgotten at the next General Election#EU
#Brexit minister David Davis said there would be no reversal of the decision to leave the #EU whatever the outcome of divorce talks.
No 10 accused of forcing through #Brexit votes before #Leave campaign investigation is published
This tweet has aged well. #powergrab #Brexit 
Still worse the @GovUK Ministers who publicly back #Brexit  and indeed enable it , all the time knowing it will be a disaster for their country and for those they are meant to be serving.  Knowing because they have seen the incontrovertible evidence.... 
Every MP will be judged, as the damage of a hard  #Brexit gets worse, on how they voted this week & whether they had the courage to ignore intimidation like this & vote in their constituents’ & the country’s best interests. 
In her speech last night, the #PM completely got the need to leave the Customs Union saying if we do not, we will not have delivered #Brexit & “the political consequences would be devastating”.She is right. It would be a betrayal of the #EUReferendum & we would not be forgiven.
Next two days in Commons overturning the whims of an unelected & unaccountable House of Lords to ensure the instructions of  British people respected over #Brexit. @daily_politics
What a brilliant piece of writing by ⁦@rafaelbehr⁩. Essential reading for anyone who wants to understand what’s really going on with #Brexit despite yet another pretended show of Tory unity on #EUWithdrawalBill
Today the DUP will vote against the will of the People of Northern Ireland. They will also abuse democracy by refusing Parliament a final say on #brexit
Our 15 favourite responses to today’s Sun front page  #thesun #brexit 
Thanks Matthew. Will you be standing by the factual accuracy of this piece in 3 years? I'm curious because you co-authored this piece from 2015 which falsely claimed the Vienna Convention would protect all rights of @BritishInEurope after #Brexit. 
Lots of tough #Brexit votes over the next two nights.We must regain control over immigration policy, be free to make free trade agreements, and control our laws.That means leaving the Customs Union.Otherwise, as the #PM says, the political consequences will be “devastating”.
*your reminder on a crunch day of #Brexit voting in parliament that around half of Britain's population have no idea what the Customs Union is or have never even heard of it* #r4today
Historic couple of days coming up. We'll see @RuthDavidsonMSP 's MP's go against the wishes of their constituents, to deliver legislation that will damage Scotland's economy and reduce our quality of life. Ruth is OK with this. #partybeforepeople #Brexit

When MPs vote today, they should remember the will of the people.Last year May asked for a bigger majority to deliver the Tory vision of #Brexit. The public resoundingly said no.The Tories had their mandate removed. The will of the people is NOT a Tory #Brexit.

That winning margin was just 1.9% of the population.All of this division, uncertainty and turmoil, for 1.9%. Really?Brexiters act like they are "The Only People" Parliament has a duty of care to 65m, not just 17m. That's what Parliament "forgets at its peril".#Brexit

Courageous @guardian journalist @carolecadwalla (who was chasing down the Russia and Cambridge Analytica stories before the U.S. media was paying attention) calls in to right-wing #Brexit advocate @Nigel_Farage’s show.Watch his cowardly reaction:
These are some of the symbols of Britannia, according to The Sun.  Cooling towers An angry seagull A mini  Fictional Loch Ness monster#Brexit is insane. 
Here we go. #Brexit Britain 2018. The face of intolerant, xenophobic nationalism. How did UK politics end up low as this? 
This is what remainers sound like when they bang on & on about not wanting #Brexit  
Brought two new batches of Gorbals jam down with me to London this week - the other jar would not have got me through the #Brexit votes! #GorbalsJam #GoodAboutGorbals #GorbalsFair
They literally put a f**king rollercoaster on their front page.To advocate for #brexit 
28 years apart...It will never end #Brexit 
It is really astonishing that almost two years after the referendum PM has not developed yet new arguments against greater Westminster’s scrutiny over #Brexit. Lords amendment on the meaningful vote does not undermine UK negotiating position but introduces greater transparency
They’re getting worried #Brexit 
Every country in the world has a “customs arrangement” with the EU ... some just pay tariffs, but members don’t .. that is what arrangements do . #brexit
The notion of the "Will of the People" is absolutely toxic to democracy as it delegitimises the core democratic right to oppose government policy & portrays opponents as "enemies of the democratic will of the people". It is a device of dictators & demagogues.#Brexit #StopBrexit
Far from showing respect for legal checks on government, Tory reactions to the Article 50 Court Case displayed a fascistic contempt for the rule of law. Is it any surprise that the Brextremists hate the ECJ and ECHR.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
Nearly 6 in 10 Scots see themselves anti-EU, while only 37% consider themselves pro.Per poll by John Curtice.Another myth shattered?#Brexit

Grateful if you would consider helping my son Alexander with his school project on the economic impact of #Brexit.    All responses anonymous and it only takes 2 minutes to complete.  Thanks ! 
Awesome. Another union pitches in with support for a #PeoplesVote. Workers are waking up to the threat of #Brexit to prosperity and are making their feelings known. They can’t be ignored. 
Real proud of all you bEUtiful people out in London for the #Remainathon  tonight and tomorrow, y'all keep safe and create some kinda merry hell for those #Brexit fans. With you in spirit, keep on keepin on to #StopBrexit  #FBPE #Remain #PeoplesVote 
At this point, it is probably easier to ask which Democratic nations Russia has not committed an act of war by criminally interfering in their Democratic processes.#StupidGate has ties to #Brexit via the Russians.#TheResistance
I voted for #Brexit so that our parliamentarians can be held accountable for their decisions. Once UK sovereignty has been fully restored, I'm perfectly happy for our MPs to vote on whatever the topic of the day may be. Until then, I expect all MPs to respect our vote to Leave. 
The big news from this weekend is not coming from the Trump-Kim summit in Singapore.  It is the news out of the UK that Russia has now been linked to #BREXIT and linked to the Trump campaign.  This is an international crisis.My little story starts with this photo<THREAD>

Very much looking forward to tomorrow and honouring the commitment made in the manifesto I was elected on - to vote with the government and back the democratic will of the people #Brexit
Wish I’d had the balls to have used my camera at the 1922 Meeting with the #PM just now!She was very firm on #Brexit and the need to be able to make trade deals (ie out of Customs U).The Party has its tail wagging.More confident for good results over the next couple of days.

#Brexit Britain Part 2. Tata to move all production of Discovery Land Rover to Slovakia, wider manufacturing output falls 1.4 per cent in April and export growth slumping. Not a “bump in the road” aka Boris Johnson. The result of impending disastrous end of friction free trade.
#brexit Britain Part 1. Government whips to manage yet more British marginalisation and decline by voting down all Lords amendments to EU withdrawal bill.Meanwhile PM May can only express her “disappointment” about Trump’s attack on the west and its values at G7. She needs him.

Brexit Minister .@SuellaBraverman refuses to give way to answer my question on what she believes is a 'meaningful' vote for Parliament.  Apparently because she needed time to complete her speech. She then promptly sits down, leaving an hour left on the clock! #Brexit #FBPE
Without a hint of irony Gina Miller - who demanded MPs had to rule on #Brexit because we plebs couldn't - now says the people must take back the power on 23rd June 2018 with a march for a " #PeoplesVote "because MPs won't stop BrexitWe did that on 23rd June 2016 and voted leave
The UK negotiates #Brexit with the Commission (Barnier) not the Council (Tusk). For Theresa May today to claim the opposite to her backbench 1922 Committee is fundamentally dishonest. #EUWithdrawalBill
#brexit is spiralling out of control.  Few MPs are likely to show courage for the country this week.  Time for the people to take back control.  March with me on 23rd June for a #PeoplesVote on the real options - please watch & share my video message
Fellow Remainers - It would be great if you could join the #StopBrexit section of the #PeoplesVote march on June 23. And lets make it noisy, not just little groups of a dozen or so chanting or singing Ode to Joy but 100s or 1000s.  #Brexit #FBPE
The Corbyn fanatics are so foolish, I can't even be arsed to get annoyed at this ridiculous accusation. I'm a socialist and not a Labour supporter while they're a #Brexit party.
BREAKING: Taoiseach has raised the prospect of Article 50 talks being extended in order to stop the UK from leaving the EU without a #Brexit border deal in place. Full video here shortly...
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "The people had a vote, 17.4million people. The biggest exercise in British democratic history - to leave the EU.“If you give people the second vote, what is that vote going to be about?" #Brexit 
Not at all surprised that Labour's front bench cannot answer the question of whether they support a final say on the deal or people's vote. When will Corbyn start representing the many? #Brexit #FBPE
Lab & Tories are too scared to debate with @AMDWaters & the media are too frightened to interview herThe truth is very powerfulPeople realise they have been lied to over #Brexit, #Immigration etc@AMDWaters will tell the other parties they have no clothesIt's time for a change
British manufacturing unexpectedly recorded the sharpest fall in output for more than five years in April, declining by 1.4% and the trade in goods deficit unexpectedly widened by about £2bn.So much for #Brexit devaluation boosting output.#StopBrexit
The tide is finally starting to go out on the High Priests of #Brexit, and not before time. There is a sense that the British public & business is finally seeing through their deception. More in my speech: 
As the #WithdrawalBill makes its way back to the Commons tomorrow, a reminder that staying in the #CustomsUnion would block the major benefits of #Brexit: striking free trade deals across the globe and bringing down the cost of goods for UK consumers. 
Tonight I'll be joined by Burke and Hare to talk about the effects of #Brexit in the funeral sector.
Dear @DanielJHannan we Remainers have warned over & over again that the #Brexit promises were nonsense and that reality makes this kind of 'vassal' status a likely outcome. You can help prevent it by campaigning to keep the UK in the EU!#StopBrexit #FBPE 
I asked @theresa_may: I fully support the PM’s wish to be a leader of free trade worldwide. Doesn’t that mean that we need to get our vote and voice back at the WTO as soon as possible & leave the customs union in order to do that. #brexit #WTO
People must have the right to agree or reject the #Brexit deal - our @TSSAunion will now campaign to give the British public a voice!  
This story was broken by Carole Cadwalladr of the Guardian on June 9th.She has been the driving force behind exposing illegal activity by Alexander Nix, Stephen Bannon, Cambridge Analytica, and foreign nationals in the #Brexit campaigns.

Crucial amendments to the #Brexit bill being voted tomorrow. Tell your MP what you want them to support: 
Now that we have established, beyond any doubt, that there was huge American and Russian interference in the referendum, how can anyone pretend that we should carry on with #Brexit.
Tomorrow the #EUWBill will be back in the Commons. I'm clear that its only the @Conservatives who can deliver the #Brexit that #Redditch voted for. Labour are hopelessly divided and split on the most important issue facing our country for decades. I'll be backing our PM.
Follow @carolecadwalla because she will ferret out the truth on #Brexit 
#Brexit uncertainty, Rolls RoyceHouse of FraserPoundlandDid you vote for this? All so you can have a different colour passport? 
A new poll from BMG finds that an overwhelming majority of voters say Britain must be completely free to strike its own trade deals after #Brexit.Both Number 10 and Starmer should take note – even Remainers want Brexit done properly. 
Furious. Voted Labour at every general election since I was old enough. My first Lab MP in the 80s was Red Ken. Thought the Rev Tony not left wing enough & opposed the Iraq War. I'm a party member, & utterly anti-#Brexit. Corbyn & Milne are Stalinist loons. 
The Sun, the Daily Mail and the Telegraph look to be losing patience with Theresa May’s weakness on #Brexit.  The message is clear to Number 10. Change course or lose the confidence of the right-leaning press. 
Did you vote leave because you were led to believe that the warnings of companies moving jobs abroad as a result of #brexit was just #projectfear? Sadly #Brexitreality is different . But please know it’s ok to change your mind your mind, be #remainernow & help #StopBrexit
Mrs May @theresa_may is more concerned about the unity of her party than the unity, prosperity and future of the country she is supposed to govern. As if that wasn't bad enough, Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn is guilty of the same. Neither are fit to govern.#Brexit 
Just announced Jaguar Land Rover is moving all production of the Discovery to Slovakia. Cost of #Brexit beginning to really harm the UK now. We must stop Brexit now. #JaguarLandRover
If anyone is still under the illusion that #Brexit was not rigged they are living in a dream world from which they are quite happy to see others suffer and die as a result of their actions #FBPE

Issues for further discussion on UK note on #brexit temporary customs arrangements include implications for existing EU rules; is it a backstop?; impact on FTAs?; fraud risk w/ VAT; need for multiple adaptations by business & authorities?

Having voted Labour for over 30 years I find it highly irritating to be called a Tory by a bunch of people who are doing the Labour party more harm than good.I won't be voting Labour again under the current #brexit supporting leadership.
In the #Brexit referendum in 2016, there was no noticeable difference in voting patterns between men and women. Polls conducted since the referendum show that more women now think the decision to vote to leave was "wrong" in hindsight. #WomenAgainstBrexit @RemainerNow

Media tycoons in Britain and the #BBC have openly conspired with May's government and Brussels to destroy #Brexit The disgraceful campaign to slander Leavers in the MSM by false claims they were influenced by #Russia was a giveaway.
Contrary to the Brexeratti beliefs, I believe that a post #Brexit Britain will be easy prey for all countries we want to trade with. We will be forced to accept any terms, including freedom of movement, lower standards etc. This is not what you voted for.#StopBrexit  Prey
Tomorrow's vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill could be last chance to prevent existing human rights protections being watered down after #Brexit. Here's why MPs must vote for #humanrights 
This might be a bit radical:  I'm pretty sick of all the #Brexit talk.  Hard Brexit, soft Brexit, Brexit in name only, transition deals, backstop deal....When I voted along with the other 17.4 million people, the choice was 'leave' or 'remain'. Leave means leave! 
More nonsense from UKIP’s sole elected representative in Scotland.  Clearly he thinks everyone should leave Brussels next year - in fact staying & trying to mitigate the #UKIP inspired damage of #Brexit  will be vital to our short, medium & longterm interests. 
Sorry but there isn’t such a thing as a “sensible” #Brexit.  Continued #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion membership will provide maximum available mitigation but still not as good as full EU membership.  Leaving isn’t “sensible” & Scotland didn’t vote for it.
Usual rubbish spilling over into Monday. I didn’t vote for #Brexit because a Russian bot or a big bus told me to - but because I told me to. And I’d do it again without any hesitation.This extreme remoaning has been at gutter level for months. It has finally reached the sewer!
Yes pretty evident where his own strategy lies & where his #Lexiter cohort stand on the issue..let the #BrexitShambles happen under the Tories, blameshift & win the next election. The one that has surprised me is Starmer...he must know the folly of any #Brexit. No hiding tomorrow

Brexit is exacerbating the staffing crisis in the NHS. Brexit threatens 100,000s+ jobs, especially in the NE & West Midlands. Brexit has already damaged the economy and sharpened austerity. #Brexit will hurt those who have least. It is the biggest issue for a generation.

No, not exactly - maybe a bit of both. They wanted to upset the US election. They didn't know how far they could get. #Brexit proved a lot farther than first thought. They wanted to test the data weapon @GenFlynn stole from DARPA. They used location based cookies for that.
"They represent only themselves and not the overwhelming majority of British people" .............Oh, the irony. #Brexit 
Because, boys and girls, in Mr Corbyn's @jeremycorbyn #Brexit Britain, you are going to need every single penny. That's of course, if you still have a job.

The campaign to discredit and eventually cancel #Brexit started in Britain the moment the win for Leave had been announced and has now reached its climax. Don't kid yourself that the EU was not behind it. Billions must have been spent from the EU secret slush funds on it.
The EU has spent nearly 50 years burrowing into this country, and sucking power and wealth from us through a million tiny channels:  #Brexit
This for me is the key point.  Why would *any* UK citizen but especially politicians & commentators still support #Brexit whilst knowing it's in the interests of Russia & it's attempts to destabilise the west?It just makes no sense.

Some very powerful words from the Prime Minister ahead of the #Brexit vote this week.She slams the House of Lords for the unnecessary amendments and accuses them of going far beyond their duty to cause problems.More of this please Prime MinisterFrom today’s @dailyexpressuk
Something fundamental must be going on for this to happen. Scottish optimism, English malaise & confusion maybe? A #Brexit effect perhaps? 
So it turns out that Redwood's sinister 2014 threat was not the only Tory attempt to silence business opposition to #Brexit. 
I think Labour in any future election manifesto must commit to a thorough investigation of the those who might have influenced #Brexit with a promise of prosecution for anyone who transgressed the laws.
This is the government perverting our democracy. Regardless of whether it is technically legal, this kind of action grossly violates the very core of our constitution, and the perpetrators must be very harshly punished.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Quite simply, anyone who voted leave had absolutley no idea what they were voting for.Think about that.  We have fundamentally changed the country but have no idea what we are changing it to.Total insanity#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit

It’s quite remarkable how @guyverhofstadt will grasp the slightest opportunity to demonstrate pettyness or vindictiveness. Not quite the material from which statesmen are made, but may explain his sad performance as the #EU Parl’s chief #Brexit ‘negotiator’.
#Brexit is a defining moment in the history of our country. It has facilitated the rise in racial hatred and fascism.Do you want this to be the future for our country?

My scoop that UK intelligence thought the #Brexit referendum was so corrupted by Russian money as to be “not free and fair” is from November last year, five months before Oakeshott claims her emails were “hacked” this March. UKIC have always known.

The EU is meddling in the affairs of Britain on a daily basis yet the British media is coming up with pathetic reports about Russian 'interference' in the #Brexit vote. What the hell is going on? Have media tycoons in Britain gone nuts and sold out to the EU?
Further proof if any were needed that #Brexit is all about keeping the Tory party together. I don’t know why they are so worried. Labour have once again let them off the hook. Naturally #Scotland is not even an afterthought #EUWithdrawalBill
Richard Christian(port of Dover) - EU freight is processed in about 2 minutes & we handle 10,000 lorries a day which = 180km of freight. Non EU goods takes 20mins to several hours to process & this somehow has to be brought back down to 2mins post #brexit#FBPE #marr #ridge
I've made a list of women who tweet about #Brexit. It already has 79 members... Please feel free to RT, subscribe or suggest others I might have missed: 
.@NicolaSturgeon on #Ridge says if Northern Ireland gets a special deal in relation to #Brexit then she could not allow Scotland to be put at a  competitive disadvantage.
“Let us speak the plain truth... What is driving this country headlong into a chaotic and punishing Brexit is a blind desire to cut immigration.” A must read by @chakrabortty  : #Brexit is based on a lie. 
Spot on @JonAshworth. Step one is to have the courage to call for a #PeoplesVote  and stop #Brexit. Step two is a radical and reforming #Labour government that makes investment and reform of the NHS our number one priority. #Marr.
Now we know  #Brexit vote influenced by 1. Kremlin gold2. Russian trolls and bots 3. DUP Dark money4. Mercer/Bannon's Cambridge Analytica working for free5. Campaign overspending, co-ordination and coverupBut these had no effect? Stop chasing Unicorns  @IsabelOakeshott
Gordon brown is on #marr sounding even keeled, honest, intelligent, well spoken and quite brilliant. Very statesman like and ambassadorial.If he'd been like this in 2010 we might have had a LD/LAB coalition.Would have been nice.. Wouldn't be here with #Brexit etc.
Yeah yeah you LIAR MSM and Theresa May "Russia influenced my vote on #Brexit".... as if the other 40 years under the EU didn't happen, and my vote was "bought" in six weeks. LIAR UK state, LIAR remainers trying to stop Brexit. #marr #marrshow
#marr fundamentally, whatever your views on #Brexit, if you voted to support it you were voting to support a Russian agenda.  If that doesn't make you pause for thought, are you really a patriot?
Whatever you believe, hang on to these points from Oakeshott's own testimony: that Banks & Wigmore were "tools" of the Russian state and that she had possession of evidence of Russian interference in #Brexit from "summer 2016", before or after the referendum she doesn't say
Poll: Who is the person to deliver #Brexit? Vote and retweet for a big sample
Lord Newby(LibDem) - You can't quote specific polls because there aren't specific polls.. all the polling in recent months shows the majority of people think the government is making a mess of the #brexit negotiation & they want the final say #PeoplesVote#StopBrexit #FBPE #marr
Do you think Russia influenced the result for leaving the European Union? #brexit -  'downplayed Russian links' RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters
Journalist @carolecadwalla, working with @peterjukes, scores a first, exclusives in both the Observer *and* the Sunday Times, uncovering Russian meddling in #Brexit referendum. Or perhaps you believe @IsabelOakeshott's account of why she sat on evidence of interference until now
A reminder to MPs across the house ahead of this week’s historic #EUWithdrawalBill vote We voted for #Brexit because our democracy is so important to us. The country expects to be heard. 
#bodylanguage This is the world in which if we continue with #Brexit we will be operating alone, as a country of 66 million, rather than part as a union of 741 million representing most of a continent. #StopBrexit
"Some MPs want to tie the Government’s hands on the CU, this will send a signal to the EU to offer us a poorer deal. We mustn’t weaken the Government in negotiations" @CarolineFlintMPLabour MPs in #Brexit constituencies must support the #EUWithdrawalBill
Two years on from the referendum. The 1,500,000 living in #destitution are still waiting to hear from the #government what the tangibe benefits of #Brexit will be for them. Will it feed them, cloth them, heat their homes or pay their rent? Will it?
REVEALED:  “What have you been paying for, for 45 years?” - Great Sunday #Brexit read: 
This was the week when #Brexiteers ceased to give @theresa_may the benefit of the doubtNow there is no doubtPM is planning a #Brexit in name only.That is not what 17.4m of us,in the biggest democratic vote EVER,voted for.#MayMustGoWe want a PM who will deliver a true #Brexit
Hopefully treacherous Lords amendments, which attempt to kill #Brexit, will be thrown out.Then the Tory Brexiteer MPs need to write to Chairman of 1922 Committee calling for a leadership vote.#MayMustGo because she lied to usShe said she'd take us out of EU & we're staying in.
It is critical we don't understand #TrumpRussia as a uniquely American event, rather than just one theater in Putin's global war on liberal democracy.The UK was attacked during the #Brexit campaign using similar tactics complete w/Russian connections. 
#Brexit is eerily similar to #TrumpRussia. Here’s just one “coincidence”: the major social media company for BOTH campaigns was.....#CambridgeAnalytica.Not to mention the overlapping alt-right trolls and “pundits.”
My contempt for politicians supporting this debased #Brexit & bringing our UK to an existential national crisis is beyind imagining.What the hell is wrong with these charlatans who risk so much for so little. What do we gain that's worth having? NOTHING.
So before Canadians turn to the pages and screens of their corrupt MSM tonight to see how the G7 summit is going, might want to check out these photos. #MAGA #POTUS #POTUSTrump #cdnpoli #uspoli #ukpoli #Globalists #MSM #TrudeauMustGo #Brexit 
Trump has been an associate of Nigel Farage, one of the leaders of the #Brexit movement in the UK. They are both connected to Arron Banks, a wealthy Briton who helped fund the referendum.Banks met with Russian intelligence operatives before the #Brexit vote. 
Dear brexadis I have been accused of being on @georgesoros payroll. I can assure that this is bollocks despite how happy I would be to take his cash to stop #Brexit. If any of you can get me on his payroll I will pay a finders fee of 25% so brexists get me on his fucking payroll
Our #Brexit politicians pander to these yobs while ignoring the great majority of responsible and educated young people who oppose #Brexit. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Meanwhile Corbyn and Starmer cook up the really original idea of having and eating a Single Market access cake, hoping no-one will remember that the Tories tried the same thing 18 months ago, with a predictable lack of success. #StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Arron Banks, the businessman who bankrolled Nigel Farage’s LeaveEU campaign, had multiple meetings with high-ranking Russian officials in the run-up to the #Brexit referendum, contradicting his denials @carolecadwalla @peterjukes
I am a huge fan of our country.I am a huge fan of democracy.Brexit is not in the best interests of our country.Brexit is not an act of democracy. #Brexit #StopBrexit
At the EU referendum, 7 out of 10 Labour constituencies backed Leave. Only 7 out of 222 of its MPs did the same:  #Brexit
Vladimir Putin Rides his British mare Banski in his historic victory over Britain at the battle of #brexit 
Extraordinary stuff in @thesundaytimes on #Brexit #Russia these allegations must be investigated.
Funny how the British #media never discovers any financial links between the EU and the UK politicians and mainstream hacks who basically eat from the hands of Brussels and Berlin but bangs on about Russia's influence on #Brexit
#FBPE So Russia bought #Brexit with £21m of Arron Banks money in return for which he gets a gold mine or three!! Referendum NOT the #WillofthePeople  We must have a #PeoplesVote
So Banks says he needs to check diary to see how many times he met Russian reps.If it was just once, as he’s previously claimed, he wouldn’t need to check!Appears the net is beginning to close on Arron Banks & other members of the pro- #Brexit elite.
Many congratulations to the courageous & hard work of the team of British patriots responsible for tomorrow’s front pages on the relationship between the #Brexit campaign & the Kremlin.
BOOM: The day after  launched its campaign, The Russian Ambassador "introduced Arron Banks to a Russian businessman who offered Banks a multibillion dollar opportunity to buy Russian goldmines".#Brexit was a Putin op. And it worked.

‘Rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb’ there’s far to much mumbling at Parliament about having to deliver #Brexit because the people voted for it. So here’s a rhubarb pie for our #PiesNotLies demo .@SODEMAction on Tuesday. #PiesNotLies
Amazing turnout today at out action day in #LewishamEast campaigning for @lucyvsalek. Lucy is the only candidate standing up against a Tory-Labour hard #Brexit and fighting to ensure we have a #PeoplesVote with an option to #ExitFromBrexit. Good luck Lucy!
A bunch of colossal twats fuck up the country and politicians sit back and watch it happen.This whole episode has exposed our political class as spineless and irrelevant.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
So now we know why the EDL posed their action tonight . More smoke and mirrors . Don’t let them trend , make sure the truth that Brexit is a foreign contrived affront upon our democracy trend . #Brexit#BrexitFraud#StopBrexit
From the files of "Russia didn't meaningfully interfere in #Brexit, right?" Cross-listed with "Brexit and the 2016 US election weren't some kind of Russian-funded two-for-one deal, were they?" 
Congratulations to @thetimes who have come up with the ultimate #Brexit - #TrumpRussia exclusive

Now imagine the shift among Labour Leave voters if Labour had been campaigning hard to expose #Brexit as an attempt by the worst of the tax-dodging elite to screw the British people and get themselves a #BrexitTaxHaven.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
The links between #Brexit and Russia's interference in the US election just keep multiplying. The Brexit referendum was a dry-run for the Trump campaign, and many of the same actors were at the heart of both.Why is there no equivalent of the Mueller investigation in the UK? 
So the #Brexit folks (@danarohrabacher's friend, Farage, and Wigmore)  were doing the exact same thing that the Trump fam and surrounding #MAGAs were doing. Not surprised one bit. No doubt the real story is much worse. (Murdoch owns The Times.)  
There is nothing patriotic about Brexit . It is the single most unpatriotic weapon used against UK since WWII. Those responsible will be held to account . Their cheerleaders may want to reflect on their support of those trying to undo our Union. #Brexit 
Arron Banks of Leave. EU had "repeated contact" with Russian officials throughout #Brexit campaign to "to discuss business opportunities & issues of mutual interest".And we still don't know quite how Banks was able to pour so much cash into the campaign.
Oh my god. The leaders of Leave might actually have been traitors successfully working with Putin against the UK government? That's outrageous, it's shocking, it's... it's... it's, not even remotely surprising is it? Sorry, I tried to be shocked. Really I did. #brexit

Former ice cream van man Owen Smith had “strong views” on #Brexit. When he overstepped the mark and broke collective responsibility Corbyn sacked him from the front bench. That’s leadership.Compare and contrast to Theresa May... 
17.4 Million Brexit-voting Britons “crying out” for “proper strong leadership”Nigel Farage:”We have the wrong leader!If we had a leader who actually believed in #Brexit & prepared to see a vision for the future we could make a success of it.”#Leave #EU
Even worse. Why should just over a third of the electorate which turns up vote in a government which is progressing a hard #brexit option which only 7% of voters appear to support? Something's rotten in the state of British democracy. @acgrayling
Liam Fox:"There is No mechanism here by which EU can keep UK in ANY arrangement any longer than which we have specified.There has to be an end to the period.We said we are Leaving EU in March 2019But we have to Leave!We have to be outside #EU"#Brexit
I have been saying for years that @Conservatives are the party of the working class. Labour have abandoned their political base. To keep these voters we must deliver proper #Brexit 
Matthew Parris has some excellent advice for Tory MPs who know how ruinous #Brexit will be.But will they have the courage to put country before party?#PeoplesVote
Something we all want to know. Who is Juncker? I didn’t get a vote with his name on a ballot paper. #Brexit
Aha, @Nigel_Farage has realized what anyone with a modicum of political knowledge already knew: #Brexit is bonkers. & he's covering his back by pretending it COULD have worked if we didn't have a useless PM.Brexit was always doomed.#StopBrexit NOW
As @Jon_Danzig writes: ‘Our political leaders should have the courage to state what they already know to be true: it’s in our country’s best interests to #STOPBREXIT. Especially now that polling confirms the country agrees: #Brexit is a big mistake.’ RT: 
Just a short note to "Lexiters" like Corbyn & others.Certainly you can hold your nose & look the other way but when you stand for #Brexit you're lined up with these people, and all the ugliness that will ensue when they are empowered by "well meaning" brexiters 
A good #brexit is as impossible as a vow of silence from Nigel Farage says @Feorlean at #SNP18. #Brexit is about keeping the Tories in power at all costs & at the expense of democracy in Scotland #ScotlandPlaceInEurope #FBPE
1. The Tory #Brexit blob are liars. They are spinning the lies that we can negotiate a relationship that goes beyond CETA but with none of the obligations. This is not possible. The EU is never going to agree to that.
Ladies and gentlemen, I present you with #Brexit and the “will of the people”...
My wife’s just landed in Rome and called me: ‘That was easy getting through customs. But the queue for non EU was enormous. What’s going to happen when we leave the EU’?Me: Don’t worry, it’s not going to happen. #Brexit is dead.

Fair play to The Guardian, this is absolutely on the money. Constructive ambiguity and triangulation have well and truly had their day. It’s time for Labour to start leading, and to make the case for an #EEA-based #Brexit, with confidence and conviction. 
Her Eddisbury Constituency voted to LEAVEBut @Sandbach is trying to stop #BrexitOne of her elderly constituents writes to her to complain of her treachery & MP reports her to PoliceCrime is up 36% in Cheshire and she is wasting Police time like this?She should be de-selected 
Two years after #Referendum, the warring #Tory factions are still incapable of agreeing a starting position for the negotiations on the key #Brexit issues, let alone finding a way forward that wouldn’t damage our economy 
The #Tories are literally killing its own citizens with their unnecessary savage cuts... kids going hungry, working families using food banks. #Brexit is not at the top of their list. You need to start attacking the evil  #Tories and get your priorities right. #Idiot
your daily reminder that #Brexit is like #Creationism/#Fundamentalism a disturbing mentality that makes no compromises with reality & never concedes anything #BrexitIsaCult
Brilliant, for god's sake let's have more of this from Remain panelists on @bbcquestiontime This #Brexit supporter thinks Customs Union, International treaties & obligations are just unnecessary "details", if you're going to give him a platform then fine, but FFS challenge him! 
Looks like the Remain Campaign are heading for a fine.Looks like they have been untruthful regarding moneySpent trying to stop #brexit.Put all the traitors in the Stocks and give em what for. 
Mogg, Johnson, Corbyn, Labour & Tories all playing the same game. #brexit is a house they know will collapse but they’ve all promised to build it.Trick is to choose right moment to leave the house & blame others inside for their work building it.Nobody wants to be 1st or last.
ThisUKIP no longer justifiable as permanent BBC news residents, Tory #Brexit leaders are frankly bad telly so instead @BBCNews facilitates shadowy right wing "think tanks" with their young, articulate women to present a credible face to Voodoo brexit goobledegoop
Having some fool shouting "why don't we just leave!" week after week to rapturous applause on @bbcquestiontime might be good telly for some but doesn't actually help the country or help inform people on #Brexit, it just keeps the UK population in ignorance
#Brexit Dream Team. 
She should be de-selected.She was elected on a manifesto that said #Brexit would be delivered and she is doing her best to stop Brexit.Also bullying an elderly lady who questioned why she has broken her promise is a total disgrace.She is a distinctly odd, strange character. 
Dear @BBCr4today why do you continue to give airtime to the poisonous little wretch Nigel ? He’s a racist, a mysoginist, white supremacist supporting demagogue of the extreme white right. #Brexit 
Remember that both Labour and Conservative MPs were elected on a promise to deliver #Brexit.  MPs must, in obedience to their manifestos and the referendum result, strike down any attempt to thwart Brexit. 
The DUP seem wedded to idea that EU are attempting to “annex” the north - but what have #BREXIT #RHI #ToryAusterity #MarriageEquality #AchtAnois got to do with Barnier & Verhofstadt?
#Brexit is another example of what I always talk about re: levelling with people. TMay (or any PM) would be in much better place if had always said: this will take five to ten, it will involve lots of ties for quite a while.

At last election most of the 17.4m who voted for #Brexit voted Tory or Lab cos both parties promised to take us out of EUIt is now clear the Tories & Lab lied to us.At the next election they will vote for a party like @ForBritainParty who will #BrexitNow & will keep their word.

Absolutely right. And the single worst thing that could happen to the working class is for @UKLabour to stand by and let #Brexit happen. Brexit will hurt most those who have least. 
Hands up if you think Theresa's living on borrowed time? #G7 #BrexitMeltdown #Brexit #G7Canada #G7Summit
If you advocate no deal #Brexit you’re ready to cause real pain to real people’s lives, just because you’re so ideologically driven and so ill prepared for Brexit that you can’t get a deal.It’s irresponsible in the extreme.
The demand that Northern Ireland remain in the Customs Union is not based upon the practical outcomes of such an approach, but rather a desire to wedge Northern Ireland out of the UK by stealth:  #Brexit

The stakes couldn’t be higher on #Brexit. Please take a few minutes to read this important update. Including details of how you can take action to help prevent a disasterous hard Brexit. 
Peter Bone MP - "It’s not even a soft #Brexit, we are not coming out. The idea that there is a date in the document is an aspiration."The more I read the document the more depressed I got. It allows us to stay effectively in the EU indefinitely." 
"People like Boris (Johnson) have strong views on Brexit, but so do I" - PM Theresa May responds to criticism from the foreign secretary over #Brexit negotiations
Richard Madeley - "The people have spoken, they want to leave – that includes leaving the single market and customs union – and let’s go on with it and make it work. And I voted Remain." #Brexit 
Watch - The Tories have been so busy negotiating with themselves on #Brexit, they forgot they have to negotiate with the EU. They’ve been arguing over a fantasy ‘backstop’ that was never on offer from the EU.#ToryBrexitShambles

Britain's sea ports handle an estimated £511 billion worth of goods, of which£228bn are exports. Most of the exports are sent to markets beyond the EU's declining customs union....So why is the entire #Brexit process revolving around £5.3bn of imports/exports with Ireland?  
This makes me feel sick to my stomach - a multi-millionaire saying he’d doesn’t want anyone to panic during #Brexit ‘meltdown’!? 
SHAMEFUL !Tory Arch Brexiteer BLAMES Civil Servants for chaotic #Brexit negotiations.NO Peter !It's the indeciveness, incoherence , sheer incompetence & in-fighting of the Tory Cabinet & overseen by weak PM which is to blame !!
The #Brexit problem in a Tweet. Leavers have mentally left the European Union. Remainers have not. And the PM appears to be listening too much to the latter.
This week's Tory Ministers who under normal circumstances would be sacked:Javid, who told #marr he'd not repatriate British citizens illegally deported;Grayling, for the Northern Fail fiasco;Johnson, for saying Trump would do a better job of #Brexit than May.#bbcpm #c4news
I think this is the most disingenuous tweet I have ever seen. YOU KNEW #BREXIT WOULD SHAFT THE UNION. Not the EU, not the British people. BREXIT. So as project fear comes true don’t dare try and hold your hands up. You are the one responsible.

Next stop in Northern Ireland is meeting business and civic society leaders at @QUBelfast to get their views about current issues like #Brexit 
Boris Johnson is right; if Trump were negotiating #Brexit, things may have gone better. Primarily because Trump would have sacked Boris Johnson as quickly as he sacked Scaramucci. Only one clown per circus.
#Brexit : Europe will not be intimidated by Brexiteers, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier says 
To avoid any confusion between the EU backstop & the UK customs paper: I reiterate that our backstop cannot apply to whole UK. 4 freedoms are indivisible.  This is not a rejection of the UK customs paper on which discussions continue. #Brexit
Here is @WingsScotland's take on the @NatCen @ScotCen #bsa35 #ssa17 research on the impact of #Brexit on Scottish politics we published last night. 
The Tories are stuck with May and May is stuck with Johnson and Davis. In the new Britain, abnormal politics are here to stay  #Brexit #Conservatives #Politics
Is it not time we walked away from the table, £40billion in hand and prepare for WTO rules? The EU clearly have zero interest in negotiating because we keep bending and backing down. Latest ploy is about Ireland trying to aquire Northern Ireland by stealth. #brexit #Backstop

Tory MP @SCrabbPembs #HowWillBrexitBenefitMe?We didn't ask him WHO voted for #Brexit the people voted for it is not a good enough answer!We now need a choice based on the facts we've learned SINCE 2016 the ones we should've had before the vote was even considered#SODEMaction
If @realDonaldTrump were leading the charge, then #Britain would've had #Brexit implemented the very next day after the #EU #Referendum! Instead we have @theresa_may the #LOSER in charge! #MayMustGo #BBC #SKY #LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress @Conservatives #ConservativeParty #TheresaMay
The bungled #Brexit app is already a total disaster.  It only works on Android (and will never work on iPhone) It relies on glitchy facial recognition systems Third-party companies will process the sensitive dataRead the full story: 
FM @NicolaSturgeon says @BorisJohnson is not fit for office after a secret recording discussing Trump & #Brexit leaked. #SNP18 @theSNP
The lies poured out by the Tory Brexiters & #Brexit press are destroying our democracy. A public that cannot tell the difference between truth & falsehood is immune to reasons & facts, and will either retreat into apathy or become prey to the politics of unreason.#StopBrexit
The Tories are happy to foster a damaging Brexit and let workers pay the price. Boris Johnson knows we are going to get a bad deal and yet he plods on regardless with his nonchalant attitude.  The Foreign Secretary is turning into a Trump tribute act #Brexit #BrexitMeltdown

Ever since the #Brexit vote the majority of the #government, #Parliament, the #civilservice & #Treasury have been trying to overturn our #democratic vote. They are on the #EU's side not the #UK's! #MayMustGo #BBC #SKY #LBC #UK @ConHome @CCHQPress #TheresaMay @Conservatives #Tory
While @theSNP meets for #SNP18 it's clear that support for Labour is in freefall across Scotland and the UK. Only the #SNP provide a strong, positive vision for #Scotland and an alternative to the catastrophe of #Brexit 
Three big questions yet to be answered on how on earth #Brexit can happen without disrupting #trade and damaging our #economy :
From now on life long education has to be our national priority as well as courses on logic and rational thinking. Economics and history to be compulsory. The idiocy of #Brexit must never happen again.We should encourage mass immigration to make up for our piss poor gene pool.
Man I’m a remainer BUT we lost the referendum. Get over it. Blimey it’s like when a despot cancels an election because he lost. This is becoming silly now. Make Brexit work and forge new relationships with other countries especially the Commonwealth ones. #Brexit
Peter Bone MP:"It’s not even a soft #Brexit - we are not coming out!It allows us to stay effectively in #EU indefinitely.They’ve crossed the Red Line, it’s NOT acceptable & many of my colleagues on back benches won’t support it.And I certainly won’t."
Polls fluctuate on public mood in NI, but this poll commissioned by BBC has very high figures: 42% favouring Irish unity, 62% saying Westminster doesn't reflect their lives, 42% support Stormont's return. 28% of unionists swing to Irish unity due to #Brexit.

This country has simply got better & far more important things to do than #Brexit; to waste all our energy, bandwidth, money etc on a project which will makes us (except leading #Brexiteers like JRM) poorer & weaker when we need a domestic ‘Marshall plan’ instead is just criminal
#Brexit risks UK citizens with carcinogenic chemicals and asbestos as we are forced to adopt falling standards in US trade deal

Lets be very clear mr Johnson the people of Ireland north or south will not pay for a border and you must understand this clearly. The border  is of huge significance to people who live work travel and trade across it and your dismissive attitude doesn’t help your #brexit case 
So high petrol prices are the result of a low pound. Low pound is the result of #Brexit.#Brexit is the biggest disaster for this country since the War.There is no advantage to leaving the EU.Why are we doing it?
Theresa May is as bad as Tony Blair. She is an Utterly Useless Prime Minister. She is a Remainer & is deliberately holding up Brexit. She'll apologise in 10 yrs when UK is finished & she has a cushy EU job. REES MOGG for PM  #ForBritain #ukip #brexit #conservatives
I hate to say this, but I don't think the person who wants #Brexit the most is @theresa_may I think it, sadly, is @jeremycorbyn I voted twice for JC and #Labour in the GE. But, even though I live in a marginal, I will not vote this way again if Lab helps Brexit. It will be LD
Disturbing how leading Tories regard #Brexit as a game of brinkmanshipThey demonstrate scant regard for our jobs, rights, and safety 
I see @BorisJohnson has been parading his ignorance in public again while pontificating on #Brexit.So, let's talk about the Millennium Bug.
It's  obvious that under #Corbyn The #Labour Party is prepared to see maximum chaos from Brexit that will in turn produce unrest... #Corbyn hopes this will deliver his Quasi Marxist utopia.#brexit》mass job losses.There is another way.#ExitFromBrexit
.@NicolaSturgeon: "It seems to me that all the Prime Minister did yesterday was continue to try to fudge the issue." #Brexit #bbcgms #SNP18
When our resident court jester .@BorisJohnson talks of dislocations and bumps on the road to #Brexit he means UK job losses. Can't remember that featuring on the side of his red bus.
The #EUWithdrawalBill will be debated next week. Get up to speed with our most popular #Brexit briefings:- Customs Union - The "meaningful vote" - Sifting Committee - Devolution 
The #Brexit vote has failed to boost the Scottish independence cause and the SNP’s pro-EU stance cost the party seats in last year’s General Election, a new survey has found.
Dear resigning club member,Your letter statesYou ‘expect’ to fully leave the club in 2021,You want ‘frictionless’ access to all club facilities after that date, butYou don’t want to obey all of our rules.The committee will decide on your proposal, when we get it.#Brexit
.@guyverhofstadt says the latest #Brexit solution tabled by the #UK doesn't work.All a bit predictable I have a feeling we will soon see how tough the UK and PM can be.#LeaveMeansLeave
Very significant breaking poll from Northern Ireland.  Taken with today’s Scottish results of Social Attitudes Survey & Scottish You Guv poll confirms that #Brexit has opened up the entire constitutional future of these islands - and that the dynamic is for change. 
Theresa May talks about a country uniting behind her on #Brexit. Ha...she can't even get her Cabinet to unite behind her on it.
The @BorisJohnson leak doesn’t do any damage to his image. This is what the public are all thinking regarding #Brexit.

Out now: EU Committee’s report on UK-EU relations after #Brexit: 
Do you ever get the feeling you're losing? Cos it's beginning to look increasingly like you are...This #Brexit has nothing to do with the Will of the Ppl which 26.5% never justified this is about the ERG trying to impose its will on the Ppl...The Ppl are wising up. #PeoplesVote
You almost feel sorry for May having to deal with these incompetent egomaniacs,  until you remember she appointed them & she chose, needlessly, a hard #Brexit. 
Another iconic Sun page, reflecting precisely the mood of the country #brexit 
Reflect on this : by her own admission to her own MPs tonight Theresa May says the #Brexit choice to which she has led her country is between the “unacceptable” & the “unpalatable”.  But there is actually a third choice  - the un-Brexit option which would also be un- May !
Anyone who disagrees with Boris Johnson's comments are not dealing in reality I am afraid. The same things are being said by thousands of members in our party & millions of people around the UK. The people of our great country deserve alot better. #Brexit #Conservatives
70% of leave voters think #Brexit is going badly. Perhaps that’s why Rothermere wants Geordie Greig to ‘detoxify’ the Daily Mail!#PeoplesVote #ExitFromBrexit
If anything sums up the lack of understanding of NI of those responsible for negotiating #Brexit this is it.I live as far from the border as you can in NI and cross it about 10/12 times a month. If you live at the border, that's daily or weekly. #brexitshambles #breckless
When pound shops go into admin you know the country has problems. #Brexit is directly to blame for many of the problems retailers are facing. Weak pound and lack of consumer confidence, things are only going downhill from here. Scrap useless Brexit NOW! #Poundworld
An Explosive Leaked Recording Reveals Boris Johnson’s Private Views About #Brexit, Trump And Russia. He's far from happy. It isn't over yet!! via @alexGspence
So... 2 years into #Brexit a day of “drama” about whether our negotiator might resign over internal differences on a detail in fallback language should we fail to secure an objective we have not yet defined on one limited aspect of future trade in goods with EU....
Boris Johnson has told a dinner of Conservative Way Forward donors that #Brexit is in danger of being sold out. Every Brexiter will agree with every word of this. At last a Cabinet minister stands up for Brexit. 
For both Tory and Labour leaderships, #Brexit is simply about trying to keep their parties together. Hang the interests of the country. Outrageous.
Just heard Steve Bray on @BBCNews @ 10pm shouting:"SSSSSTTTTTOOOOOPPPP #BREXIT!"Epic job.Well Done!@SODEMAction
Calm down people. What Alan Duncan ACTUALLY SAID was that we COULD have a referendum with a choice of:1 Leaving with the deal or...2 Leaving with no deal!So before the remoaners crack the champagne this could lead to the hardest of hard Brexits. Fine by me#Brexit #backstop
Theresa May has ceded control to the EU at every turn, starting with the negotiating timetable, to the divorce bill and then agreeing to no border infrastructure in Ireland. She has no intention of threatening a no-deal. Brussels is in command. #Brexit
On the morning of the vote nearly two years ago, I tried to get myself to accept #Brexit. After two hours of brain ache I gave up and haven’t stopped fighting it ever since. 
  Is this just a coincidence? #EU #UK #Brexit 
Trying to keep up with whether David Davis is quitting or not is like#Brexit #BrexitShambles
Today has been a very bad day for #Brexit Probably the worst it's had so far.Let's hope for more days like this!And a #PeoplesVote leading to an #ExitFromBrexit
Standing on just one of the 208 border crossings between Northern Ireland and the Republic. My right foot is in Louth, my left foot in South Armagh. #Brexit 
Lewisham East Lab tries to claim remainer credentials whilst Corbyn would behappy to march through the lobby with Ress-Mogg. Only way 2 stop #Brexit is to vote for @lucyvsalek
So we currently contribute 12% of EU research funding and win 15% of it. So by leaving we lose 3%. Another great #brexit benefit.
This right here is the biggest traitor to the British People.  #TheresaMay abandoning her rational, informed political beliefs to jump on a rickety band wagon to #Brexit unicorn fantasy land has doomed the UK and the future of her party with it! #toriesout #StopBrexit 
A week is a long time in politics (sk the saying goes) and even longer in the world of Brexit!So after this weeks news is Brexit likely to be :Please #retweet for a wide sample#Brexit #stopbrexit #PeoplesVote
To be clear, the backstop is the only way UK has found to leave the EU and TM just called it 'unpalatable' *find synonyms*To our PM, #Brexit is now regrettable, unwelcome, upsetting, distressing, lamentable, repugnant, nasty, horrible, dreadful, hateful, distasteful and foul. 
Liam Fox - "there has never been a period where government have been asked to do such complex things as we're been asked to do around the #brexit process"Liam Fox 2017 -  a post-Brexit free trade deal with the EU should be the “easiest in human history”#StopBrexit #FBPE
It's difficult to emphasise how much of a potential political earthquake this is.IF Daily Mail starts shifting its stance on #Brexit then the pressure on May & the Tories for a rethink will be enormous. Shares in a #PeoplesVote & an #ExitFromBrexit have just shot up in value.
Look at the Referendum campaign it wasVery Clear in almostEvery rally,Every speech,Every television debatePeople were saying,Leaving #EU meantLeaving Customs Union &Leaving Single MarketTo free ourselves & Cut all ties with Brussels#Brexit #Leave
The next editor of the @DailyMailUK is going to be Geordie Greig, he's an arch remainer, won't it be ironic, the same paper that under #PaulDacre led the way for #Brexit could now under a new editor be the one that dismantles and stops it, what a delicious thought #StopBrexit.
Introducing #Brexit Tracker with timeline and post-ref polls and whether Britons think vote to leave was "right" or "wrong". Last 15 polls have lead for "wrong" to leave. Thanks to @PropertySpot @Jim_Cornelius @SybilleRompe @fascinatorfun @StatisticSingh @sumisuki for feedback.
In the nearly 2 years I have been on Twitter, my resolve to resist #Brexit has only strengthened. The only defence the Brexiters have is trolls, they cannot provide a single piece of evidence to convince me that Brexit will be delivered in any form that will be acceptable >>2
How many times do we have to tell Leavers, including politicians who should know better, that the right to oppose is fundamental to democracy, and that where it is denied democracy dies.#StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote

My tiny cameo in today's #Brexit excitement - annoying @MichelBarnier about the British customs proposal as he arrived to speak to trainees at the European Parliament.

Irish Gov are playing politics and trying to stop #Brexit.We should boycott all Irish products until they stop being so idiotic.If Irish want an hard border on their side that is up to them but we are not going to have a hard border on the N Ireland side. 
As they say: "someone familiar with the matter" told me that no one (#Parliament) wants to carry the water for the fiasco known as  #Brexit.  Many folks are running for cover. (and what happens if the EU says "no"?)#DavidDavis#IrishBorder#Backstop
Lifelong Tory and member. Backed May throughout the Brexit despite fudge after delay after compromise after surrender. Backstop fudge is last straw. Boris, Gove, Javid, heck just about anyone (no not you Soubry); you have my vote if you challenge#Brexit #TheresaMay #Backstop
Brussels losing patience with UK government #Brexit fudges. My thoughts  
EU Withdrawal Bill | To those who have contacted my office asking whether I will back Amendment 19(a) of the #EUWithdrawalBill. I confirm I'll be supporting this.Amendment 19(a) seeks to ensure the British people have a final say on any #Brexit deal. Full response below.  
5 slides on the #Brexit #Backstop for Northern Ireland/Ireland from @DPhinnemore and me. 1. Why there will be a Backstop in the Withdrawal Agreement.Plus a synopsis of the EU and UK positions on the matter.(Thread 1/6)
The “definitive arrangement” is an FTA or walk away. Always has been. This backstop issue is one the EU has created as a trap and you know that full well.Who starts a deal by talking about what you’ll do if you don’t get a deal? The only answer can ever be: WALK AWAY#Brexit 
Nigel Dodds MP, DUP deputy leader: "Theresa May has stuck to her word that no PM could countenance a border in the Irish Sea... our red line has not been breached." #Backstop #Brexit
This cannot turn into a Brexican stand-off. @OllyRobbins must go. #Brexit #fudge #CustomsUnion #dd @DavidDavisMP 
Difficult to see how UK proposal on customs aspects of IE/NI backstop will deliver a workable solution to avoid a hard border & respect integrity of the SM/CU. A backstop that is temporary is not a backstop, unless the definitive arrangement is the same as the backstop. #Brexit
Gordon Brown has come up with proposals that address some of the fears about free movement that led to #Brexit. All of them can be achieved without quitting EU.
#Brexit Investment in Britain’s car industry has already halved since the 2016 Brexit vote, falling to £1.1bn last year, compared to £2.5bn in 2015. via @FT
Dear Prime Minister @10DowningStreet , Re. New customs ‘arrangement’.  This isn’t #Brexit. Time for you to go - now. 
Imagine for a minute being one of those remainiac MPs doing their utmost to sell the country down the river and weaken UK plc negotiations, after all said and done the time to get behind #Brexit was the day after the referendum.
Nick Clegg - Big British companies tell me privately that #brexit is a disaster but they won't speak out publicly... brexit is just so big there comes a point you just have to speak out & he wishes more would. #StopBrexit #FBPE
"It remains vital that a legally-binding backstop is agreed to provide certainty that, in all circumstances, a hard border will be avoided." Tánaiste @simoncoveney today issued a statement on the publication of UK proposals in #Brexit negotiations 
The reason why Remainers are succeeding in destroying #Brexit  is not just becasue of treachery of MPs, ministers, judges and press barons but the sad fact that the modern political system in UK is designed to block any change that does not suit the agenda of the ruling elites.
Indeed, and that’s why we need to keep growing and publicising the #Remainernow campaign, so leave voters are willing to speak out as they see others do it and realise their is absolutely no shame in admitting you have changed your mind once you know more on #brexit reality 
After crunch talks between PM & #Brexit Secretary David Davis, UK's "backstop" plan for EU trade published — with an "expected" end date of 2021 
Careful wording aimed hopefully at EU, DUP and all cabinet opinions on #Brexit : a time limit with no specified time limit - that respects commitments made to NI - #fudgetastic
The Davis shambles is the last straw. Whether you’re Leave or Remain NO ONE VOTED FOR A CLUSTER**** Brexit that will destroy the economy just to keep Theresa May in No.10. Labour the only route to a #Brexit that doesn’t break the country economically or splinter it socially. 
Remarkable to see a relatively junior senator like @nealerichmond absolutely school former Minister & Tory Leader Iain Duncan Smith on #brexit 
Dami, who voted to leave the EU, tells us why he's unhappy with the #Brexit negotiations & why he will march with us for a #PeoplesVote on June 23"If it's wrong not to have a referendum on EU membership, it should also be wrong not to have a referendum on the terms of the deal"

It's becoming increasingly obvious that May does not intend to deliver a real Brexit, she represents the Republic of Ireland more than is the prime minister of the United Kingdom. Time for a change at 10 Downing street?#Brexit#MayMustGo
The UK government has conspired with the #EU to make #Brexit seem as difficult as possible in order to turn people against it. Soon they’ll float the idea of a second referendum, which will be incredibly damaging and divisive. Much more so than now. 
“He may very well pack up his bags from 9 Downing Street, just down there, and leave the government, and what happens after that, could be anyone’s guess” @bbclaurak tells @jo_coburn about David Davis #bbcdp #Brexit 
.@bbclaurak might not be loved by everyone in Scotland's indy community but she just gave a bril summary of Tory #Brexit wars & how the UK is being held to ransom by a dogmatic, inflexible gang of Brexiteers who are refusing to compromise with Theresa May. #bbcdp
Every single #Brexit headline these days could be replaced with this: “Tories Shocked to Learn Choices Have Consequences; Claim Life Unfair”
The ERG group have told @theresa_may to sack @OllyRobbins Representations have been made to the chief whip that Robbins’ Irish backstop is unacceptable & has put No10 on a course towards selling out on #Brexit, and his position is no longer tenable 
 Following this week’s round of #Brexit negotiations, @MichelBarnier will brief the press tomorrow at 2pm (Brussels time) @EU_Commission  You can watch it live here:

To all those who have contacted me from #Arfon and from further afield, here is my position on #Amendment19a of the #EUWithdrawalBill. AS @PlaidArfon MP I will be supporting Amendment 19a which would give the British people the final say on the #Brexit deal.   
Media in Scotland (some of them anyway) starting to reflect the chaos and damage being caused by a #Brexit the country neither voted for nor wants.   Meanwhile the worst  and weakest Prime Minister in generations claims we are the ones “out of touch”…. 
Qatar owns more of London than The Queen. If this fact does not make a mockery of #Brexit then what does?
It’s Thursday.And we should never forget that this whole #Brexit disaster is the unwanted offspring of a mad design to silence the eurosceptic fruitcakes in the Tory Party. Pathetic.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote

May be wrong, but have feeling @Jacob_Rees_Mogg has about one week left to decide whether he wants history to remember him as a Tory statesman who saved Britain's democracy, or just another Conservative Party hack who, when it came to the crunch, put party before country.#Brexit
Public opinion at first did what you’d expect: rally behind #brexit after #Referendum result. But it has then slowly but surely shifted the OTHER way, with a clear majority now saying #brexit a MISTAKE... 
Today feels like a day when one or two Tory political figures will take (or not take) actions which determine how history sees them in perpetuity: hero or coward.#Brexit
We voted to leave the EU which means all aspects.Leave means leave.#justsaying#Brexit 
Almost 2 years since North voted to Remain in EU referendum & British Govt on track to get bad deal or no deal. Yet DUP insists that North shouldn’t accept better deal on offer from EU 27 for jobs, farming, peace funding, education, rights & movement of people. #Brexit 
That whole #Brexit thing is really working out well for the Brits just like they were promised by the lying sham dirtbag bigots who promulgated it.Nigel Farage/Bannon/Louise Mensch/Aaron Banks/Wigmore/Raheem Kassam used same fear mongering play book to elect Trump in the US. 
Trump walks away from talks with North Korea. Talks are then back on track and more to his liking.EU keep insisting the non issue of the Irish border is resolved. May delays, fudges but stays negotiating. Walk away Mrs May and take the £40 billion payment with you.#Brexit 
On 23 June 2016 we voted to leave the EU and take back control of our country.On 24 June 2016 the Establishment decided this was the wrong answer.We know what we voted for. We voted Leave. The opposite of Stay. #Brexit
BBC News - Carillion collapse to cost taxpayers £148m. Remind me. Which Government couldn't read the warning signs in their statutory accounts? It isn't the one delivering #Brexit ignoring all the warnings & forecasts because they're all negative is it? 
If #Brexit was such a good thing for the UK, the Cabinet would have come up with a plan ages ago and been singing the benefits out loud everyday. Instead they skulk in a corner, unable to agree an approach and unable to explain a single solitary benefit of leaving. It's bollox

Dear @OwenPaterson The UK decided to leave. The UK asserted there could be no hard border in Ireland. The UK and EU agreed to the backstop. The UK has failed to come up with an alternative. So in what world has the EU attacked the UK? #brexit 
I remember 29 Mar 2017 just after #A50 was triggered. Theresa May said that she did not want to reveal her secret #Brexit strategy. 15 months later, David Davis revels that the cabinet has still not agreed on the Brexit strategy. A complete and utter pack of lies. #KickToriesOUT
Dacre's sizzling off into retirement, Lawson slinks off to France, Farage denies claiming Brexit is improvement, UKIP implodes, Hannan admits it isn't going well, no trade deals, Davis resigning (again), Trump's our 'special relationship', May's hopeless. EU stands firm. #Brexit
MEMO to David DavisYour CONSTANT threats to RESIGN are wearing a bit THIN now David.Either PUT up or SHUT up !Let's face it - as the responsible Sec of State  your *constructive ambiguity* appoach to the #Brexit negotiations have not done the UK any favours !
Significant pro #Brexit commentator who has been saying "everything's fine - bloody Remoaners" now saying, very clearly "hang on, this is a bit of a catastrophe, isn't it?"Today Customs Union, Tomorrow some kind of SM membership, Brexit dead by end of the summer 
#CarryOnBrussels The MPs want #brexit to be a disaster, so UK stays in EU. They argue over trivial things that are easy to sort like UK's borders and customs, and making a mess of it, deliberately.
I realise #Brexit is important to many people but it would be hilarious if it all foundered because nobody knows how to regulate getting stuff from Derry to Muff.
Absolutely loved seeing @patel4witham at tonight's @ConWayFor summer party. She's a brilliant champion of #Brexit and Conservative values! We're all super excited about Britain's bright future as a sovereign, independent, global outward-looking country!  
My quick tribute to Paul Dacre. (1) He did (with Murdoch) probably give us #Brexit and (2) was one of the last all-powerful editors able to resist the risk-averse journalistic sameness imposed by the lawyers and accountants now spread throughout newsrooms 
#Brexit cannot mean continued membership of the CU even in a time limited capacity bcse that is not #Brexit. ‘Let’s just get over the line’ is a specious argument bcse it would take a generation to de-couple and untangle. The next 7 days are going to be interesting.
Fruit is rotting in fields as #eucitizens are put off coming to the UK due to hostile #Brexit environment and depreciation of £ as a result of the vote!Did you vote leave but this is not what you voted for? It’s ok to change your mind, be a #remainernow
The problem with the "Will of the People" is not about numbers. The problem is the way in which it demonises political opponents as enemies of the people, and thus delegitimises the core democratic right to oppose the government.#StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
“failure of leadership to neglect” News for you, @campbellclaret: you don’t get to say what our leader should speak about or when.He was excellent -again- in #PMQs today.What was the subject?#Brexit. Fancy that!Not only is he a TRUE leader, he’s our next @UKLabour PM!
It was a terrible error of judgment for Justin Welby to publicly embrace EU utopianism.  #Brexit
Tonight might be the night #Brexit dies, Dacre is resigning, Davis looks likely in the morning and the man with no principles Johnson is spotted schmoozing rebel MP's#FBPE
Rats leaving the sinking ship as #Brexit starts to founder. The latest is Paul Dacre, resigning as Editor of the odious Daily Fail. Hooray! 
To while away his retirement, Paul Dacre has an estate in West Sussex, a home in Belgravia, a 17,000-acre estate in Scotland and a property in the British Virgin Islands (a tax haven). Paul Dacre likes to pretend #Brexit is a revolt against "the global elite".
He's responsible for division/hatred/racism/xenophobia, he's demonised/scapegoated migrants/benefit claimants/sick/disabled, ffs this individual and his newspaper have along with the tories sowed the seed that will turn us into a post #Brexit wasteland, good riddance Paul Dacre.
The Westminster betrayal of #brexit is becoming nightmarish a slow motion torture leading to the death of any pretence of democracy in our country
David Davis may resign? @Channel4News reporting too.. It’s all going very well eh?#Brexit #EU
Should you, for any reason, be interested in what Cabinet committees (and sub-committees) are, what they do and why they matter, take a look at the @instituteforgov explainer  #Brexit 
#Brexit ~ #ForTheNation  The Government & indeed parliament as a whole made you a promise. They entered into a contract with you. Break a contract, there's always consequences.
#Brexit ~ #ForTheNation  If we need to debate the largest vote in British history, how is it remotely possible we don't need to debate a General Election that's dwarved by it?
Our political leaders should have the courage to state what they already know to be true: it’s in our country’s best interests to #STOPBREXIT. Especially now that polling confirms that the country agrees: #Brexit is a big mistake. RT @Jon_Danzig's report: 
Channel tunnel operator says it's "too late" to avoid serious disruption if UK leaves EU in March. FTA says none of freight industry's eight #Brexit demands have been addressed by Govt. Commons must vote next week to give the people the chance to stop this chaos. #voteonthedeal

Prof. Alan Sked - "The civil service keep on making figures: I’m surprised we don’t hear about the seven plagues of Egypt and the death of the firstborn."These figures were looked into by the Institute of Economic Affairs who said they’re b******s." #Brexit 
This will be the last time I say this: at any other time in history, the precarious future and fate of 1.3mn British people living overseas would be a huge story for the media. Sign of the times #Brexit #Citizens @BritishInEurope
We guess that by pointing out that no deal #Brexit would render 3.6m EU citizens illegal overnight, with very limited #citizensrights, if any at all, we are scaremongering. Are we @andreajenkyns?
Yes - I will be there - those 2 days are going to be crucial in turning #brexit around - a good crowd will make  a huge difference.  #FinalSay #stopbrexit
This is still as true now as it was last year when first posted. Thank goodness @UKLabour isn’t in charge of #Brexit. #LabourFail

Trying to follow Labour #Brexit policy: in a nutshell. 
Both Labour and the Tories are stuck on a political merry-go-round. It's time to admit that a good #Brexit deal is nearly impossible, and get on with getting out.  Me for @prospect_uk
How about you all email this story to your MP and ask them to vote against #Brexit-or give the people the say on any deal. We won’t stand by and let the country be pushed off the cliff to economic disaster. @peoplesvote_uk
Fully support @gordonjohnbrown proposals to ensure that #Immigration is managed. Compatible with membership of #singlemarket and #EuropeanUnion. Pity his government and mine acted too late to stop disastrous #Brexit vote. But not too late to stop Brexit.
Tory benches attempt to shout down @IanBlackfordMP questions at #PMQs on #Brexit reality. After protests from @theSNP MPs Speaker intervenes to make sure he is heard. @theresa_may has no answers. #dejavu
Leader of the @LibDems @vincecable and parliamentary candidate for #LewishamEast @lucyvsalek have invited members of the public to sign their joint letter calling on @jeremycorbyn and @UKLabour to support people having the final say on #Brexit.#LiberateTheUK

Any business that stays silent now and next Tuesday evening finds UK definitely outside Customs Union and Single Market - need not complain after as too late then. #brexit
Where are you now on #Brexit?Are you still a Remainer/Leaver or have you changed your mind?Please Retweet
The plain fact @theresa_may has not understood is that, if we cut all ties with the EU and bomb their capitals, there are some who will spin it as “soft #Brexit” and “a betrayal” because THEIR POLITICAL SURVIVAL DEPENDS on it. So she may as well do the right thing by the economy.
.@britishineurope campaigners say 1.2 million people - the population of Birmingham - are being treated like 'hostages' by both sides during the #Brexit negotiations.  And they're right.   @ottocrat @guitarmoog @savlocal @alextaylornews
Did you realise that Great Britain still has Theresa May as PM and still doesn't know what it is going to do about #Brexit?I'll take a stab in the dark and say these two things are not unrelated.
Will you run a @betteroffout street stall and join the fightback against Soros and Soubry? #Brexit 
Mr. Corbyn totally and utterly skewered the #Maybot today, 'It's not the Opposition conducting the #Brexit negotiations, neither is it the govt', that one line completely smashed the tory leader today, she can't have long left now, her demise can't come soon enough #PMQS
Opinion poll shows a 47%/40% majority think the decision to leave the EU was a mistake. 62% think the government is handling #Brexit badly, and only 81% of Leavers still think it was the right decision  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Both Tories & Labour peddle the fiction of Single Market rewards without responsibility whilst families are already £900 worse off as a result of #Brexit How much poorer will families become as the Prime Minister & Labour opposition indulge in fantasy politics. #PMQs #Plaid
It is time for Tory Brexiteers to remove PM & replace with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg or @michaelGove, both of which could deliver the #Brexit we voted forTories need to be far tougher with their rebelsThey should be immediately de-selected & put in pro brexit candidates to replace them. 
Poll: polling companies now consistently showing a 7 point swing towards #Remain which would translate into a 55/45 result once don't knows are removed. Do you think this is a sufficient mandate for a #peoplesvote on #Brexit? Please RT far and wide, particularly #Leavers!
No deal is better than a bad deal. I ask the Prime Minister, in what circumstances is she prepared to walk away from the negotiations, saving the British taxpayer billions of pounds. #PMQs #Brexit 
Corbyn treats the privatised railway system as a hopeless shambles, but he wants to plough on with #Brexit which is a already a hugely greater and more destructive screw-up than railway privatisation could ever be. #StopBrexit #FBPE
By not opposing #Brexit, Mr Corbyn is aiding & abetting the Govt's destruction of the country. Unfortunately JC, whom I believe to be fundamentally a decent bloke, is getting very bad advice from the likes of Seumas Milne, who is to him what Nick Timothy is to Mrs May. #Rasputin
How ironic that the real Red Tory turns out to be the leader of the Labour Party #brexit
So @ScotTories didn't like being reminded today that they opposed devolution in '97 and that Ruth Davidson lobbied against the Vow.  Seems nothing has changed - a party that is anti-devolution and ignores the @ScotParl on #Brexit.
This was foreseeable from the first moment after #Brexit vote. Which is why so many of us urged government to look at continued ESM and CU membership. Still time to stop this train crash and make some sensible decisions. 
As the Westminster psychodrama intensifies, remember the big picture. There's no good news for Scotland (nor elsewhere) in #brexit and there's still plenty ways *you* can help stop it. 
#BREXIT could mean 'bonanza' of £540 million & 5,000 jobs for Scottish seafood industry!             #fo2eu
Good questions for once from .@jeremycorbyn on the government's chaotic approach and disunity on #Brexit  It is a pity Labour's policy is in the same state and Corbyn is backing a Tory hard Brexit. #FBPE
Tory benches attempt to shout down @IanBlackfordMP searching questions at #PMQs on #Brexit reality. After protests from @theSNP MPs Speaker intervenes to make sure he is heard. Naturally @theresa_may has no answers
Record number of #voters think #Brexit is wrong 
Voters in Lewisham East can now see Labour opposed to single market and opposed to a people's vote on #Brexit. Only @lucyvsalek is fighting for these. Labour remainers should vote @LibDems to pressurise Corbyn to change tack
At #scottishquestions @ScotTories determined to distort the truth that by a majority of 3/1 MSPs 4 out of 5 of parties in @ScotParl voted to withhold legislative consent to #EUWithdrawalBill despite me & @TommySheppard repeatedly making that point #Brexit
Many referenda have been held in UK.All the outcomes have been implemented,even if the outcome was wafer thin,as in the Welsh Devolution Referendum.If #Brexit is not implemented it'll set a very dangerous precedent that we have not encountered before.
In order to maintain the fiction of Labour unity on #Brexit, Corbyn supports the kind of have our cake and eat it drivel the Tories proposed and the EU rejected over 18 months ago. The British people are being utterly betrayed by our 2 main parties. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Only a Labour #Brexit will protect jobs. Read my response to @Keir_Starmer commitment today to proposing tariff-free access to a single market. @unitetheunion
Both Conservative & Labour parties are suffering from the same vice on #Brexit: their positions are dictated by the imperative of party unity. As a result, the Tories are paralyzed into avoiding all hard choices, & Labour puts forward positions that are knowingly unnegotiable.
Did you know, #DWP staff can overrule a doctor's note declaring you unfit for work? Well they can and, without any medical training either.This is #UniversalCredit. This is #ToryBritain.This is a #HostileEnvironment#benefits #indyref2 #Brexit
Every vote for @lucyvsalek in the Lewisham East by-election is a message to Corbyn that he cannot keep supporting the Tories on #Brexit.
Ministers told to stop telling lies about the ease of securing post #Brexit trade dealsThere are no deals being negotiated with countries outside the EU and it will take years for any to be agreedDo you hear #Leavers. It was all lies and always was!
And this is why history, the electorate & even his young acolytes will eventually wake up to his ideological deceit & his support for this #BrexitShambles one that can only leave us Poorer, Weaker with Fewer Rights & less Control.Jobs 1st #Brexit pah!
To those that bleat about returning law making to the UK after #Brexit think about this. Your MPs run the UK the way they see fit. They don't give a toss whether you like the rules or not. Let's face it, who wants austerity, inflation and school, police, fire and NHS cuts?
I don't oppose Corbyn's position on this to undermine him, and hate the fact that some others are motivated by that goal. I am so passionate because Labour have in their hands the potential to limit the most damaging effects of #Brexit. They risk letting that chance slip away. 
The Labour leadership's rejection of EEA membership and talk of "full access to the internal market" is the cherry-picking drivel the EU has made absolutely clear it will not accept. The reality is that Labour supports 3/4 of a Tory hard #Brexit.#StopBrexit #FBPE
We don't trust Theresa May to decide our future. Whether you voted to LEAVE or REMAIN we should all fight for a vote on the final deal.If you agree spread this message, we don't have long.#WednesdayWisdom #Brexit #protest

Anne-Laure Donskey says that uncertainty over #citizensrights causes immense concern for EU citizens at an individual level. The threat of no deal #Brexit, which would leave many EU citizens unprotected and exposed to UK immigration system is a major worry. 
Like every other smear campaign against #Corbyn, misuse of the #FBPE hashtag by those on Labour RW and in #ToryParty, purely to trip up Corbyn on #Brexit and undermine Labour, has haemorrhaged its effectiveness - if it ever had any - because of over-use. 
Brexit Ministers showing a complete contempt towards Welsh interests. Not a single visit by a Govt Minister to either Holyhead or Fishguard. This is indicative of a wider disregard to Welsh interests in Westminster. #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill 
Read and weep. Because our biggest trading partners have no idea what kind of #Brexit the government wants, they are already planning to cease trading with us. We are seriously on the brink on major economic disaster, walking over a cliff, with a media blindfold on. 
Yeah why not play some more political games - I mean, it’s not as if  the national interest is at stake or anything like that ...#brexit #sellout
About time. May's Government has been happy to sacrifice UK businesses on the altar of #Brexit ideology for months now, I'm surprised industries have resisted fighting back this long.#PeoplesVote #exitfrombrexit

63.4% did not vote to remain in the EU; most abstainers being scared by the Government statement that #Brexit would mean not being in the single market and customs union, so the economy would crash. They said: "It's your decision". So when did they decide it wasn't our decision?

2) Corbyn kills the chance to stay in EEA via abstention, then promotes a similar (but deliberately vague) amendment - who's purpose is *not* to succeed, but to publicly fail in order to provide fake "soft #Brexit" optics to Labour Remainers"We tried to stay in SM but...."
1) So...Corbyn was facing a #Brexit crisis -whipping MPs on EEA amendment would expose him once & for all as a LeaverSo his current plan is to create a smokescreen - abstain on EEA amendment to guarantee its failurethen submit a similar one which is guaranteed to fail as well

Today's #abortiondebate was an issue concerning the human rights of Northern Irish women and their right to make a choice, remember this, Theresa May, her party and the DUP would gladly kill off all our human rights with their hard #Brexit, these are the kind of ppl in power.
This is what's going on in the real world of #Brexit - our political class need to smell the coffee and fast to avoid a jobs massacre! 
This looks like single market membership in all but name. A step in the right direction but will be hard to square with existing commitment to not be “rule takers”. It’s almost like leaving the EU is a bad idea #Brexit

Mike Hookem MEP - "Following #Brexit, we as a nation should be free to impose our own 200-mile exclusive economic zone, police our own waters and set our own rules, under international law." 
Corbyn is playing politics here - he is willing to risk a hard Brexit in order to bring down the government & position himself to bring about a Labour inspired Brexit. The PLP must rebel and vote for EEA membership - they must put country before party. #EEA #Brexit

1. I'm often told off for attacking my own side - but when it comes to #Brexit I don't see London think tank idiots as allies. They are part of the problem. The time for slogans and propaganda came to a close in June 2016. Now we need serious answers to difficult question.
.@EU_Commission issued a #brexit preparedness notice on “rules of origin”. What to do as UK input into products becomes “non EU content”? This affects EU27 businesses who benefit from EU preferential trade deals which will no longer apply to UK.

What I want to see on June 12th......apart from an instant victory in the #A50challenge...EVERY MP who is opposed to #Brexit, no matter what party they are in, should move to just in front of the Speaker, and shout him down for as long as it takes for May's attempted coup...

The only advantage I can see to #Brexit is that at least we could give up decimal and could move to a Babylonian base 60. 10 is rubbish! Only divisible by 2 and 5. 60 is brilliant! Divisible by 2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30. 
It’s a great opportunity for a great country, we have a bright future ahead, the EU needs to respect the mandate the British people have given our PM, not frustrate and undermine at every turn. #Brexit
2/2 And many who voted remain, like I did, now support Brexit because they are sensible democrats who respect the biggest vote ever in our nation’s’ history. Time for us to back the PM and deliver our manifesto promise to deliver #Brexit #EU.
1/2 I’m very glad that the EU Withdrawal Bill is back in the Commons next week with plenty of time for debate. My constituents voted overwhelmingly for Brexit and they want us to get on with it - they haven’t changed their minds. #Brexit
Only 4 in 10 Brits are saying #Brexit is the right decision for the country. For @UKLabour voters it is fewer than 3 in 10. Public opinion has changed decisively, it is essential that Labour Party policy does as well. #PeoplesVote
This is the most ridiculous EU-blaming I've yet seen.The British politician @DanielJHannan is surprised that after the #Brexit referendum the EU did not try to keep the British in the EU. "Our door was open, but the EU has closed it."YOU closed it, Dan, not the EU. Own it. 
Parliament is allowing less time to debate all 15 amendments to the epoch changing #brexit bills than it allowed to hear tributes to the death of a politician who has been out of power 2 decades. 
Latest @YouGov @thetimes poll. In hindsight #Brexit right 40 (-3); wrong 47 (+3). Fwork 28-29.5.17. Record wrong lead - previous high was 6 pts in Jan. 
Brilliant #Brexit article by the team this morning: “How many would have voted Remain if they'd known this?”  You have to read this! 
Ireland now has the largest Ro-Ro ferry in the world to access the #EU and bypass the #Brexit shambles. Maybe Scotland should be thinking of doing the same. And guarantee Scottish exports get to their markets without additional tariffs. #YES #Indyref2

#PeterBone #MP - "If we have a #nodeal situation, we don’t have to pay the £39billion & we make our own laws in our own country judged by our own judges & we can have our own #immigration policy. That is a very big plus for not having a deal.” #Brexit  #BBC
Could somebody from the @LibDems @LewishamLibDems please confirm that it is party policy/tactics to send members/activists door to door telling people that if #Brexit is allowed to continue, the #IRA will start bombing families in the UK again? #IlliberalAutocrats #ProjectFear2
Glib nonsense, devoid of analysis or even simple knowledge  , presented with that patronising confidence that reeks of  arrogant entitlement  - living proof that #Brexit is a con perpetrated by a few wealthy right wing ideologues at the expense of the rest of us…

#brexit Worth watching the whole thing (43 seconds). Interesting how many times the two interviewers try (unsuccessfully) to stop what he's saying from being heard. 
Whether May stays or goes, #Brexit is collapsing into a shambolic (but very dangerous) horror-show presided over by fantasists.It's destroying the Tory party (no tears for them) but it will destroy Labour too if it takes it on.The only way out of this mess is a #PeoplesVote.
Astonishing. Having promised White Paper on #Brexit & Customs...No10 now say they’re delaying until after June EU Council meeting! In absence of a Govt plan, it’s clear Parliament has to take control next week. If Ministers have no plan, their ‘whip’ surely has no credibility 
We see through your facade Caroline. You are just miffed because you cant play games with the #Brexit bill.Stop lying, Brexit has been debated for over 60 hours already. 
Is public opinion on #brexit on the move? Latest @yougov survey for @thetimes finds 40% say UK right to vote to leave EU; 47% say wrong. 7-point gap is widest yet. A sampling wobble or a real change? Next YouGov poll worth watching out for. 
People, let’s be clear: Absent Cabinet agreement on customs union, customs partnership, maxfac, Irish border etc, There is No #Brexit blueprint  via @financialtimes

The Tories have hardly passed a piece of legislation for 12 months - but now Parliament is expected to ram the #Brexit Bill through in just 12 hours. Pathetic and puerile.

Here they are: All of the issues that @theresa_may thinks can be debated and agreed upon in a single day... Please retweet and make sure everyone knows what the @Conservatives are trying to do (bypass fair democratic process by pushing through #Brexit regardless). 
Absolute disgrace and contempt for Parliament - Government giving just one day to consider over 200 amendments to the #Brexit Bill - so much for “taking back control” - more like taking the... @Open_Britain @peoplesvote_uk
Said this before and I’ll say it again - many will only accept that #Brexit was a bad idea when it bites them *personally* on the arse. Likewise Scottish "No" voters. And the teeth are getting sharper and closer.
Watch out for Dictator May trying to subvert democracy next week by failing to allow enough time for Parliament to debate #Brexit amendments. We must not allow the @Conservatives to get away with what amounts to pure contempt for the democratic process.
Only 5% of Labour MPs voted to leave the EU, compared with 52% of the broader electorate... This self-styled people’s party is about as far from the people as an organisation can get:  #Brexit
Peter Bone MP:Say 'thanks very much, we tried very hard but we can’t reach a deal.We’ll go our own way.'That would cause EU to change its attitude!#EU sell £70bn more goods to us than we do to them.They need a trade deal MORE than we do.#WTO#Brexit
For Remain campaigners Labour's stance has made life much more difficult. We've had to fight on 2 fronts & faced fierce attacks on #FBPE. Talk of a "jobs first Brexit" has undermined our arguments. With both main parties pro-#Brexit our message has had trouble reaching the public
I was a yes voter in 2014 #indyref today after much thought on how the @scotgov and @ScotGovFM are performing within the confines of the Union... I am now a firm "hell yes." #ScotRef #Scotland #Brexit  Let's give all our children a good future.

So that's your #Brexit vote, folks. Subject to an 'unprecedented' official inquiry - "the biggest data protection investigation ever" How can we possibly say this was a fair vote? And that's not including the allegations of overspending, co-ordination and destroying evidence 
It’s scary to think that those who made the promises have no exposure to the consequences when they don’t get delivered. They could just have promised anything. And they probably did.  #Brexit
The EU "shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State" - Article 50 on EU obligations re a member state's withdrawal.By saying he won't negotiate with Britain, M Barnier is violating EU law.But then when has EU always followed its own laws?#Brexit

Dear Brexit trolls: stop being so insecure. A journalist is asking how @BritishInEurope in the EU 27 are affected by #Brexit. This is not a Leave or Remain issue: it’s about real people’s lives. Mark is reporting on a hugely overlooked group most of whom had no vote in 2016

Piers Morgan just introduced @bernardjenkin as a’neutral’ party on #Brexit. What a joke! He is spouting devisive will of the people’ garbage.
I'd like to formally complain to .@Channel4News about giving a platform to this person to spread industrial scale lies. I'm the last person in the world who wants to defend @David_Cameron, but he NEVER said #Brexit would lead to World War 3. That was Chloe's mate, @BorisJohnson.

12 European countries (EEC12/EU12) formed the Single Market in 1987, and another 3 joined the EU in 1995. In the attached, I compare the evolution of GDP per capita for those who joined with those who stayed out (EFTA countries). Notice the timing of the growth divergence #brexit 
Right #FBPE, it's time to turn up the pressure on a #PeoplesVote so we can stop #Brexit. Let's make history and save our country from the clutches of these self serving Tory maniacs who are tearing britain apart. Write to your MP. March. Rally. Speak out. Together we can do this!
Since the EU referendum, I've been telling people, we are going to see food shortages because of logistic nightmares at the border.  #brexit 
It's at least interesting that when it comes to trade & #Brexit talks the DUP won't countenance any difference whatsoever between the UK & Northern Ireland but when it comes to women's rights to their bodies the DUP think they know best. Religion & nationalism is a volatile mix.

This #Brexitometer (from Falmouth yesterday) gives an indication of why Brexiters are afraid of a #PeoplesVote.They know #Brexit is a complete mess & that even many Leave voters can now see this.So they have to insist that the "people's will" was set in stone in June 2016.

The dividend we will reap from not paying into the EU budget would provide a useful stimulus to economic growth, one of the many benefits of #Brexit. We must not be bullied, and must leave the EU as fast as possible, with no deal if that is necessary.

What to expect from June #EUCO regarding #brexit ? My personal impression: Not many are expecting very much now. If this is so, October would then have to solve ALL problems (withdrawal, NI, governance, future …) in one go. Odds still unclear.

The very BEST deal for #Brexit is no deal. We should offer zero tariffs to the EU, a soft border with Ireland if reciprocated, and that is IT! No £39bn bribe to the corrupt EU, and no residing in ANY of its institutions
Disorderly #Brexit is just that: it’s going over a cliff-edge by leaving the EU without a legal agreement. It will disrupt supply chains. So not surprising that includes food (we import a large proportion) and fuel supplies. An EEA+CU Deal can avoid all this. 
Stella Creasy - No one can look at #brexit right now & say it's going well.. no one talked about a £40bn divorce bill.. no one talked about leaving the SM the way the Gov wants 2.. the public should have a say now they know what leaving actually entails. #PeoplesVote#FBPE #marr pic.twitter.com/znHUUly4Jm

You sold the complex as the simple. You cheered on the undeliverable. Now the wheels are coming off #Brexit, you blameshift. 
I really don’t see how an informed vote on a written text setting out UK’s conditions of withdrawal can be considered undemocratic but a referendum on a single question completely void of any meaning beyond #brexit means brexit is to be taken as the democratic will of the people.

"Stop trying to block #Brexit" say the people who swung a tiny numerical "win" by illegality, industrial-scale corruption and outright lying.Why wouldn't we? Nobody wants illegality, corruption & lies to "win" except cheats, shysters and liars. Oh, and fellow-traveller racists. 
Hear me out... we have an Irish border, but in space.#brexit 
2-0 HAHA YOU GUYS CAN SHAKEW SHAKEW BACK HOME AND EAT YOUR GARRY 'ND JELLOF #THREELIONS #ENGLAND #BREXIT #GODSAVEOURQUEEN
How absolutely dare you @KateHoeyMP call my @LibDems colleague @catherinemep - or any other diligent, sensible MEP or MP who opposes your crazy #Brexit - a traitor? They have more patriotism in their little fingers than you & your dogmatic, cultish set of Brexiteers combined 
Fantastic response to our inaugural #PeoplesVote street stalls in Cowbridge and Penarth this morning. Well done & thank you to all our volunteers.Just look at that Brexitometer - it’s very clear that the public think #Brexit is a disaster & want a #FinalSayforAll.#StopBrexit
Jeremy Corbyn faces mounting pressure to back a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit after a raft of Labour MPs signed a letter calling for a vote on the final dealJoin them in supporting @peoplesvote_uk, and by RSVPing to march on June 23 at 
So have I got this right - the last remaining advantage of #Brexit is that we’ll be in control of our own poverty?
Stop referring to Remainers as "pro-European". Like the vast majority of Leavers, I'm pro-Europe. I've lived and worked in Europe, travelled most of it and throughly love it.Remainers are 'pro-EU' which is nothing like pro-European and is arguably quite the opposite. #Brexit 
Fantastic afternoon engaging with our fellow #Lancaster residents on #Brexit. Whether we agree or not, having the conversation is always a good thing.  Thank you to everyone who took part in the discussion and entered their choices on the #Brexitometer. @peoplesvote_uk @euromove
"The greatest achievement of the #EU is that it has brought peace to a continent that was historically at war... The greatest threat #Brexit poses is bringing conflict to our continent, for example what is happening on the #Irishborder"#EUsupergirl at #EYE2018 #StopBrexit
“It falls to Theresa May to drag us out of this swamp. We don’t envy her, but she needs now to make a decision.Mrs May cannot kick the can any ­further down the road. She must be realistic, assertive and brave...or make way for someone who can” #Brexit
The fact that 75% of young voters do not want to leave the #EU should be reason enough to remain. Add the complete shambles #Brexit has become and the question remains, why are we continuing with this nonsense?
Given that  #Brexit looks like being very different from what was promised, it’s not surprising that there are more and more calls to reconsider:  
Interesting poll suggests that leave voters are against all forms of #Brexit!Something like this (A being the Brexiter)A- "I want cake"B- "ok, which cake would you like?"A- "none of them, but I still want cake"B- "but there is no other cake"A- "I want cake"ad infinitum 
Mr Barnier:"What is sometimes hard for British to understand is that we DON'T want to negotiate, we DON'T want to compromise on who we are."Britons also DON'T want to compromise on who WE are!UK wants to #Leave, it is OUR choice to #Leave#Brexit #EU

BIG NEWS !!!On July 5th, an EU court is set to hear the case of British citizens living for over 15 years in the EU27 who were denied a vote in the ref. If successful, the case could ultimately force the referendum to be held again.#FBPE #Brexit 
Sammy Wilson is a colleague on the #Brexit Committee, a great guy and a fellow Brexiter. I support his comments that it is time we got tough with Brussels and showed some mettle.
#Brexit's central idea of leaving the world's biggest & most advanced free trade zone to pursue 'free trade' was always oxymoronic. Now it's a dangerous miscalculation backfiring on the British people. Nobody voted for this. #StopBrexitSaveBritain #BrexitShambles #AmericaFirst
MPs and peers will be sent a roadmap next week detailing how they could stop #Brexit by the George Soros-backed Best for Britain group, which has amassed £2.3m in donations to spend on a nationwide lobbying effort to persuade parliament to change its mind.
Dr Chris Leigh - "EU research programmes only fund around three percent of UK research and development activity. "So the impact of any significant change in our scientific relationship with the EU would in reality be very small." #Brexit 
#Brexit has shown us how Reason can become Powerless in the face of Self-Interest, Ignorance and Primitive Nativism. In other words, those with the most to gain must manipulate, exploit and suppress those with the most to lose. Stop them. #StopBrexit Let Reason fight back.
Just a thought @eucopresident, why not create an EU webpage where UK citizens can register their interest in retaining EU citizenship after #Brexit. It would give the EU a true sense of the desire of the majority of UK people who would like to retain EU membership. #PeoplesVote
We haven't got an independent trade policy Ed. We're stuck in the EU and your mates are trying to keep us inside the protectionist Customs Union which means we would have our trade policy set by a foreign power. This really is Brexit 101#brexit #Libdems #trading #steeltariffs
I hate to say it but #Brexit has awakened a monster. Tolerance the first victim of the vote.This country is becoming unrecognisable. 
I had a nice reply to one of my tweets saying that I should forgive the public for voting #Brexit because the were fed misinformation. This is true, but I'm still amazed that they could follow the lead of spivs like Farage, Johnson, Gove, Rees-Mogg etc.
‘Don’t let the Tories trample over Wales’...says the party who willingly gave away our powers so the Tories could ‘trample over Wales’. #Brexit #LabourFailAgain
The #Brexit con artist @Nigel_Farage decides that his lies no longer stack up so decides to make another one.#FBPE#PeoplesVote
Legatum Institute 'crossed line' on #Brexit, Charity Commission finds'Here we have New Zealander with acquired Maltese citizenship and fortune made in Russia, creating Mayfair think-tank that abused charity rules to help win argument for hard Brexit.'
Please @EmmanuelMacron do not let the architect of #Brexit and enemy of the #EU escape to France.
If @theresa_may had half a brain, she would have made the #Brexit negotiations ‘cross-party’ and invited other parties in to sit at the table.As it is, she has really cemented the fact that Brexit belongs entirely to the @CONservatives and has done so from the outset.
COMMENT OF THE DAY: Let that be a warning to all 16m of you. #Brexit 
Is it just me who thinks “The will of the people” is going to be the parachute deployed by politicians and right wing press to absolve themselves when it all goes Ally’s Army after #Brexit ?
If in doubt about #Brexit, print money.What could possibly go wrong?  
It has been reported that Ms Hoey is a member of the hard-right #Tory #EuropeanResearchGroup, and she associates with the sectarian Protestant #OrangeOrder. As the values of both groups run counter to #Labour's, she's a traitor to her own party. Moreover, #Brexit betrays the #UK.
Of course the case for Scottish independence is "far stronger". That is proven by the vile abuse of the British nationalists increasing 10 fold. They know #Brexit has ended their precious union! 
How could anyone support the Tories, knowing they’re working to destroy one of the UK’s treasures? And how could anyone think a Corbyn Brexit won’t also spell doom for it? #nhs #brexit
This is #Brexit idiocy of the highest order. These tariffs were ALSO imposed on Canada. Why would the USA treat the UK differently? Why would UK get a better deal? 
If it was an "aspiration", why was the figure only £350m a week?£350m on the side of the coach was used to sell #Brexit.They lied.One third of people believed them and voted accordingly.
This is very clearly now an attempt to stop #Brexit. Read the article, read the quote. They clearly ask for the people’s vote to be a choice between the PM’s deal, OR (wait for it) “the deal we ALREADY HAVE” - in other words NOT leaving the EU. Outrageous! 
Our government have their heads buried in the sand if they think 17.4 million voters will keep quiet if @theresa_may fails to deliver #brexit.The pot is simmering nicely. 
When the Tory International Trade Secretary & a Labour frontbencher BOTH warn that #Brexit is harmful to the UK economy, it's clear that leaving the EU would be a complete disaster. @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn @vincecable Time to offer us a #PeoplesVote
Schools are broke. The NHS is broke. Social care is broke. Meanwhile a few look set to make a mint whilst distracting the rest from the fact that the country will remain....broke.#Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica
Iain Duncan Smith demands the horse called Remain bolt after he has locked the free movement stable door #brexit 
++BREAKING++Legatum brexit scandal.The charity commission was so shocked by the obvious untruthful aspects of the “institute” #brexit report it requested it be removed from its website. This is pretty much unprecedented at this level. D 
Who needs the Taliban when you've got the DUP  striking a sectarian note wherever they go whilst pulling the strings of Theresa May's coalition government made out of match sticks and chewing gum. #ArleneFoster #brexit
Antoinette Sandbach who some of us had a spat with a few weeks ago, is now threatening her constituents who have asked her to resign because of her opposition to #brexit.With being reported for Harassment.Thanks to all who emailed her.52% voted Brexit.
Goodness this guy is good...try opening your eyes, ears, minds & hearts #Brexiters...stop believing the BS those backing this flawed #Brexit feed you. Seek FACTS & separate from the FICTION this #BrexitShambles is based on.Back a #PeoplesVote a #FinalSay + a #StopBrexit option
If it was your brother/sister/child jumping off a bridge would you rather I walked on by and said “Oh well, that’s their decision” or would you rather I stayed and urged them not to jump? #Brexit is mad,  I will do what I can to stop it. 
#EUsupergirl questioning the legitimacy of #EUreferendum where @The3Million & expats were denied a vote. Election spending rules were broken and #Brexit was missold based on lies. "#willofthepeople is not a valid reason to back #Brexit; the result was advisory only" #stopbrexit
Barclays boss admits #Brexit worries reducing  their lending in the UK.  This will hit business borrowers, productivity and jobs. This lack of confidence now widespread and likely to increase as Brexit negotiations stall
Here is what the #EU is currently facing: #Brexit, Euroscetpic Government in Austria and Italy, Poland and Hungary refusing to be pushed around by Brussels.  Coming apart at the seams.
If @UKLabour would reject #Brexit, initiate a vote of no confidence in @Theresa_May’s government, and force an early general election, they could win on a platform to remain in the EU, without any need for another referendum. Join our discussion. Link: 
Another week, another group of @LondonLabour @UKLabour MPs call for a #PeoplesVote. Thank you for having the courage to call for change. #Brexit is not inevitable.  @DavidLammy @TulipSiddiq @wesstreeting @MikeGapes @coyleneil @RupaHuq @GarethThomasMP
Looks like there is going to have to be a hard border in Ireland. Various luminaries queue up to tell us that things that work won't work so let's take them at their word. If you don't want a solution then fine. We won't have one. Hard border it is.#Brexit
#Brexit means problems, hassles, costs and lost opportunities for Britain’s creative talent: 
It’s a very serious problem that the Labour leader is backing the Conservatives’ chaotic Brexit, in opposition to the views of his backbenchers and party members.  And @theresamay has, rather rudely, still not extended thanks to @jeremycorbyn for his support on #Brexit
Rather than flying kites in the Brexiteer press, it'd be great to see @DavidDavisMP & the UK Govt actually bring formal #brexit proposals to @MichelBarnier and the EU negotiating team, the clock is ticking
There is so much sense in this by Chris Patten, last British governor of Hong Kong, former EU commissioner for external affairs and Chancellor of the University of Oxford, in a world of #brexit nonsense, everyone should read it  
"This is a huge decision for our country, perhaps the biggest we will make in our lifetime, and it will be the final decision" - David Cameron, 10 November 2015. #Brexit #PeoplesVote

More PAIN for Greece as Germany gets TOUGHGreece owes Germany €248 BillionEckhardt Rehberg:“With IMF insisting on large-scale debt relief for Greece - a 3-digit number [Billions] - I have a problem"Or does Greece have a problem with euro!#Brexit #EU
Worried by David Davis’s blatant bid to be fool of the week, Barry Gardiner tries to play catch up by continuing to back #Brexit despite concluding it’ll make UK ‘infinitely more vulnerable’ to trade wars.
EU don't know what free trade is.They erect huge tariff barriers to protect inefficient EU producers,& make the poorest EU cosumers pay excessive prices for basics like food and clothing.After #Brexit the poorest consumers in the UK will be a lot better off.#HappyDays
John Sheridan: "I'm sorry but I don't intend to live in No-Man's Land.We [in the border region] are quite happy living & working together.#Brexit could take away our physical freedom & it could take our mental freedom.+It literally has the ability to put us out of business." 
I think if are now honest & practical, we’ve run out of time to negotiate a sensible deal. We should now postpone the exit date by 12 months to give the U.K. & our EU. partners a fair chance to arrive at the right solution for the greater good & benefit of everyone. #brexit 
Tony Robinson thinks that there is no cunning plan for Brexit, so he will march to Parliament with us on June 23 to DEMAND a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal."Forget everything else you were going to do on that Saturday - just go!", he says.RSVP: 
Great coverage of @WalesForEurope’s cross party & pivotal letter calling for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. 
With new trade sanctions imposed on UK, Liam Fox & Boris J now v quiet about our future deals with US post #Brexit. They have always been delusional about “special” relationship and latest Trump action proves why we should stay with EU #FBPE
It's time for Yorkshire's MPs to join their Welsh colleagues in calling for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit to take place before the date we are scheduled to leave the EU. 
After #Brexit every day will be a #nationalfishandchipdayBecause it will be impossible to export British fish..“...if we can’t get our fish to market, it makes no difference how much quota we’re allowed to catch or who fishes in our waters.".
*Only* 49% of Londoners think people should have a vote on Brexit dealReveals how misleading the post-referendum coverage has beenLondon is not Remain Central People often forget that 40% of Londoners voted for #Brexit 
The United States “is offering the UK a worse open skies deal” than we have now as part of the EU. #airlines face big difficulties if we go ahead with #Brexit via @raconteur
Why did nobody else think of David Davis's wizard idea: that N. Ireland could be simultaneously inside and outside the EU?He's either been reading too much quantum physics or someone's put something in his coffee. #Brexit #bbcnews
Great quote from Chris Leslie: “If there was an award for coming up with unnecessarily complicated and convoluted solutions to self-inflicted problems, David Davis would win it every year.” #Brexit #FBPE
Yeah. #Brexit really shook the establishment, didn’t it. 
#EU Article 13 could 'destroy the internet as we know it': What is it, why is it controversial and what will it mean for memes?  #EU #Brexit 
Whatever the EU and the UK might say, the issue of citizens' rights after #Brexit really isn't solved yet. 
I am beginning to get an ever-so-slight, incy-wincy feeling that #Brexit may not be the greatest idea. Retweet if you are beginning to get it too.
Retweet if you think this lemming on a spoon would be better as negotiating #Brexit than Theresa May's government 
You don't appear to have mellowed with time or in the face of overwhelming evidence any form of #Brexit can only leave us Poorer, Weaker with Fewer Rights & less Control. And the ppl you ref to = 26.5% i.e 37% voters & only 51.8% of those voting.#FinalSay
Italy's populist parties reach new deal to form a government  #Italy #EU #Brexit 
#FarageOnLBC doesn't care that you'll be poorer. “After Brexit whether for good or ill, we will be self-governing. That’s the point. I never said it would be a beneficial thing to leave and everyone would be better off, just that we would be self-governing." #brexit #FBPE

The EU isn’t a democracy. It’s a plutocracy dedicated to imposing on Europe’s people an ever closer union they don’t want, and won’t vote for:  #Brexit
If Labour leadership really wants to protect the many not the few then it urgently needs to oppose  the Government’s #Brexit shambles & champion a #PeoplesVote on the final deal
Great to see #LeftAgainstBrexit launch today! The more @UKLabour supporters with the courage to stand against #Brexit the more likely we are to change party policy. Look forward to all working together! @julie4nw @Manuel_TSSA @michael_chessum 
To understand what "Global Britain" will be like post #Brexit, see Liam Fox's pathetic grovelling to the US when faced with trade tariffs. Within the Single Market and Customs Union we're part of one of the world's most powerful trading blocs. Outside it we're simply expendable.
I am proud to support the #LeftAgainstBrexit tour. Labour needs to look at the bigger picture and understand how #Brexit will damage our communities. Come together and help us #StopBrexit >  <@guardian @UKLabour
Anthony Scaramucci, long-term Trump associate, makes it absolutely clear that British farming and our NHS are on the line in any trade deal with Trump. "I've known Donald Trump a long time and he's not going to change on this."We need a #PeoplesVote.#r4today #Brexit
Michael Gove, telling everyone that it would be very silly to start #Brexit without a plan.#PeoplesVote
Tory #Brexit squeeze ain't worth the juice! 
An investigation by the Charity Commission finds that the think tank Legatum  “failed to meet the required standards of balance and neutrality” on #Brexit. 
Just think about this, IF @theresa_may had done the job we elected her to do and delivered on the vote to leave the #EU #Brexit would have already happened and we very likely would be immune to steel tariffs from @realDonaldTrump and the #USA
"BARNIER LAYS DOWN THE (EU) LAW" - UK to submit to ECJ law for 8 years after #Brexit. When will someone like @Jacob_Rees_Mogg stand up? Full #Brexit analysis: 
#tariffs are in the news, but main barriers to international trade are regulatory & technical standards. On services, there are no tariffs. EU is a global standard-setter. It's madness for the UK, a services economy, to walk away from the EU regulation-setting tables.#Brexit

Wanting the UK to be a normal independent country, just like 167 other countries in the world, makes me an 'extremist', apparently. This is patently ignorant, silly and, well, extreme. #brexit

I can't think of a time when we had worse politicians. Ministers head, clueless, to disastrous Brexit. And then there's Corbyn. Desperate.
Another low for unionism: PM Theresa May says SNP partly responsible for #Brexit. Think she should look behind her.
The electorate did not vote for #Brexit at all or any cost. They rely on parliament to look after their interests

I am done with the UK. First Brexit. Now this? #GBBO

FATA should merge with KP as per popular demand & a referendum is the best route. Reps so far have done nothing
It's obvious that the #Brexiteers have no clear idea of what #Brexit actually means. Why didn't the Remain campaign challenge them on this?
Remainers want EU flags at Proms say it celebrates Euro contribution 2 music not political. Funny not before Brexit?

Britain is "completely lost" and can be expected to "plead" for a Brexit deal, according to senior EU officials.
Brexit will be tough for European Investment Bank says its chief
After Brexit students will still have visa-free access to Europe like they do in many non-EU countries.
So Fox roundly ignores vast majority of biz saying that #Brexit is a bad idea - then tells them its their "duty" to export more to save him?
Forget Brexit + grammars for a minute, here's some things the Govt prob didn't want you to notice this week:

The fight is on for what shape the EU will take in light of Brexit
Very odd Brexit team for HMG. Davis and Fox expressing 'personal opinions' the whole time say Number 10. Johnson, unusually, says nothing
Watching the govt Brexit effort is like watching someone with no sense of taste or smell trying to describe a lemon.
The rightwing media, being incapable of admitting misjudgement, will never concede that a post-Brexit future is anything other than rosy.
Davis has no answers.. Fox attacking business leaders.. Boris doesn't understand.. Dept of Brexit Blunders?!!! #whatcouldpossiblygowrong

Theresa May's gov are in denial over BrexitIt's either sheer arrogance or plainly no clueBut I reckon it's both, which is dangerous

Brexit: omnishambles or clusterf**k?  @Usherwood takes the big questions:
PM makes it clear she'll do it her own way when it comes to #brexit negotiations. No running commentary and won't reveal hand prematurely.
Just gave PM opport. at #pmqs to ear-mark 1st 2wks of £350 mln per wk available for NHS post Brexit for rebuild of St Helier. She declined.
May refusing again to confirm whether she intends to secure single market access - not good enough #Brexit #PMQs
We don't want a running commentary, Prime Minister. We just want some details as to what #Brexit will mean, rather than waffle #PMQs
On Brexit, @theresa_may has adopted @BorisJohnson policy of having and eating cake. Not clear the EU 27 will provide that cake #PMQs
On Brexit, the economy & today on their housing crisis - the Tories simply have no answers to the challenges facing working people #PMQs
The 'Remain' camp philosophy, if there's bad news, it's down to 'Brexit', if the UK appears to be thriving, 'It's early days yet'.
And, yet again, it falls to @AngusRobertson of the SNP to raise the dominant question: govt's lack of a plan on Brexit
Am no Corbyn fan but think he is right never to descend to personal abuse.  Looks cheap when done, he looks more dignified. #brexit
Housing/women's refuges both important but Corbyn failure to mention Brexit confirms fears he's not interested in leading opposition on that
Angus Robertson, unofficial opposition leader, actually tries to hold PM to account on Brexit.
SNP's @AngusRobertson tells Theresa May her gov had all summer to come up with a Brexit plan and has produced only 'waffle'.
20 mins into PMQs and @AngusRobertson asks first question on Brexit. Do Labour not care?
Housing an important issue, but amazing that Cabinet divisions on Brexit/single market and Grammar schools, not exposed...
It breaks my heart that the Tories are being allowed off the hook. They have to be challenged. Brexit cannot be in their terms #PMQs
Housing crisis is huge. But this, obv, was #pmqs to (try and) skewer gov't on the emptiness of its approach to Brexit.This ain't opposition

Er, yes that would fall into the "legal obligations". Scientists concerned that after Brexit, net funding falls away
The Tories told civil servants not to make plans for Brexit. Never understood why it wasn't a bigger story. Perhaps after today it will be.

David Davis and Brexit by Bob Moran - political cartoon gallery
Despite an entire summer to define plans for leaving the EU, all the government have come up with is "Brexit means Brexit". Clear as mud.

David Davis - his view on #brexit
10 weeks after brexit and the stupid Tories still dont have a clue.... God help us
"Brexit means Brexit" means "even if we realise after study that we'd need to be mad as  a box of frogs to leave the EU we'll still do it"
David Davis says gvt's post-Brexit immigration system to be “more rigorous” than a points-based system -
Brexit means..... England deciding everything#YouYesYet?
Clear preference in @LordAshcroft's mega poll for #Brexit to prioritise immigration. More at
Odd that #Brexit leaders so keen to "give people control" on in/out referendum but far less keen when it comes to what Brexit looks like.
Attended today's Brexit statement in Parliament with Mr Brexit David Davis. MPs staggered by the lack of progress or clarity.
It's apparent that the Tories nor David Davis know what #Brexit means for the common folk. We want firm plans NOW not tomorrow. #GodHelpMe
Theresa May says Australian-style points-based system NOT tough enough for migration. If true, we support a tougher alternative. #brexit
So the conclusion from David Davis giving first official update on #Brexit is that the government has little idea what it really means
MPs are going to debate a second EU referendum
Brexit means2016: Leaving the EU2018: Renegotiating with EU2021: Eurostar ticket price increase2023: Dover renamed GOver2026: Brexwhat?

Flying back now: revealing G20 summit for UK's post Brexit place in world... Japan memo a big moment - crystallised trade offs, and choices
One key reason people voted for Brexit was because of the '£350m extra for NHS' pledge - Theresa May refuses to comment if she'll back it.
What we've heard from David Davis this afternoon  can only be described as 'The Ladybird Guide to #Brexit' Pathetic
Dear Peter Lilley,When India was partitioned, 1million+ people died and 14 million were made refugees.Let's hope Brexit isn't that bad.
David Davis says that most remainers have accepted Brexit... is he really this delusional?
It would seem that the Japanese government has done a more thorough analysis of Brexit than the UK government has. Quite extraordinary
Remember how 71 per cent of City economists predicted a recession this year following the referendum? Are they sticking to their prediction?
And the Scottish people voted to remain part of Britain in a democratic referendum, so get over it and move on!!
David Davis tells the Commons the government will not dilute workers' rights in Brexit negotiations. We must hold them to that. Every day.
"Let's brick up the Channel Tunnel". "It is abt time we made Britain Great again" says working class man. #Brexit voices on BBC on #r4PM.
So begins retreat of Remainer to wherever #brexit zealots take us, all in name of existential (British) nationalism
Glad confusion over meaning of Brexit has been sorted. It means we leave the EU. Why didn't I think of that?

"Brexit isn’t about making the best of a bad job. It is about seizing . . . huge and exciting opportunities . . ." Well said @DavidDavisMP

What does #Brexit mean? @DavidDavisMP tells the Commons: It means we will decide  our borders, our laws, our taxpayers' money. 100% right.
David Davis's argument that the Brexit referendum mandate is greater than that enjoyed by any government is almost entirely meaningless.
We are leaving the EU so leaving the single market. Why does BBC pretend that the referendum did not decide this?

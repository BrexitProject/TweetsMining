Asked this very question a few wks ago in @TheNewEuropean. #EU now talking about slowing #Brexit down because UK is "not ready".#bugsbunny
"The EU is a bunch of unelected bureaucrats in Brussels."Hardly.#Brexit

US negotiators openly admit they are eyeing up the NHS as part of post #brexit trade deal. Well done #Leavers
Support for #Referendum on #brexit deal growing, says poll :
Amber Rudd admitting we need EU immigration. #Brexit is becoming an even bigger farce, it would be funny if not so tragic for us all.
The likes of KT Hopkins are test-beds of extreme rhetoric, if it works it's moved into the mainstream, it not then it's put aside.#Brexit
Foxtons blame #Brexit uncertainty for plunge in profits 
This sentence explains everything... #Brexit 
EU already claims that if the UK doesn't give in to their financial and immigration demands then talks will be delayed. Time to walk #brexit
@Bonn1eGreer @WeAreOneEU @solange_lebourg Tories set 23 year lead time for clean air. Why no warning of #Brexit & its ramifications?
Always remember, Leave was 5 million votes short of the kind of supermajority normally necessary for constitutional change.#Brexit
The #Brexit campaign cynically and methodically stoked up anti-migrant sentiment. The same people now cynically and methodically deny this. 
James Dyson: If #Brexit talks fail with the EU it's 'no big deal' 
A #Brexit bombshell which Aberdeen South's @RossThomson_MP campaigned for, because like all Tories, he doesn't actually care about Aberdeen.

Following a Corbyn & #Brexit discussion this morning, I present to twitter the Corbyn/Remain supporter dilemma (hint, it's not really one) 
Really pleased with the #fintech and #brexit discussions at @Level39CW today - London as a #fintech hub continues to offer great opportunity
UK Govt thinking: 'You know how we voted for #Brexit on an anti-immigration base? Now maybe we just better find out what that will cost us?" 
I've asked Amber Rudd to include the evidence for a different immigration policy for Scotland in this study #brexit 
#Brexit means controlling our own immigration system.
Good that the @UKLabour front bench seems to be edging towards staying in the Single Market & Customs Union #Brexit

I've grown up in a world where I have freedom of movement in 28 countries. Now the Tories' #Brexit is taking my freedom away. I feel trapped
Study of EU migration so late and so close to cliff edge reinforces sense that Tories are not in control of #Brexit
Brexit was about taking back control, not extending free movement! Pod One with @Nigel_Farage#Brexit
For those that voted for #Brexit you do realise that Amber Rudd's investigation into EU migration is going to show that it needs to stay
As the consequences of #Brexit are understood and huge added value of European standards remembered, the likelihood of leaving diminishes. 
Brexiteers asking Remainers to look at the upsides of #brexit is like stepping in poo and celebrating the dog having a healthy digestion
No good words this early in the morning to comment on Labour MP gleefully tweeting Breibart's take on Labour #Brexit policy. Strange times.

Nigel Farage, just an ordinary guy hanging out as ordinary guys do in front of a gold lift with millionaires and the POTUS to be. #Brexit 
Farage trying to dupe the British people once again. Was Freedom of Movement on the ballot slip? No! #Brexit - all deceit and lies! 
The tragedy is, even when #Brexit is killed, the country will still be broken and divided. This is Cameron's legacy.

It has become abundantly clear that the choice is #brexit for a minority of 17 million now, or the NHS for the whole country now and forever

So why don't these pro-EU Tories stand up against the Brexiters? Cowards betraying Britain & failing in their duties as MPs.#Brexit 
I am sure this the Gove / Tory #Brexit agenda.  Environmental/ Food  protections will then be reduced / eliminated/ traded away. 
The European Union maintains that my friends in Hamas are terrorists. We must leave this awful, deluded organisation. #Brexit 
Brexiters shouldn't try and shut down Remainers. We lost. We won't get over it. It's called freedom of speech.#Brexit
If Gove & Fox row publicly about American chickens how can this shower of a Government ever hope to negotiate #Brexit?
Remain voters are not "unpatriotic" by "talking the country down".It's the opposite. Remainers care about Britain's future after #Brexit.
As Blackadder might say "#Brexit is a fate, worse than a fate worse than death".We have to ask "Whose interests are being served by this?"

The Labour fallacy (in the 2017 manifesto) - no, leaving the EU does not require leaving the single market #Brexit

And on the most important issue @jeremycorbyn you are recycling Tory-kipper lies and protecting the Tories on #Brexit.#StopBrexit
Needs stressing. To every Labour activist who says that #brexit is the Tory's mess & they own it. Labour own it too!
/ @LibDems are right, Fox's demand is just another of the ways in which #Brexit is being used to undermine democracy 
Disastrous.  The opposition should speak truth to power, not gamble our future away on a reckless fantasy #brexit.
Corbyn's hard #Brexit will expose Britain more to Chinese imports, so worsening the impact on British workers.
Are you listening? Do you have even the slightest concern? Can you show how #Brexit will match @UKLabour values? @Keir_Starmer @jeremycorbyn
How many of the families now living in London were living in London before the UK joined the EU (EEC)? Very few indeed.Point made. #Brexit
Dear @OwenJones84 Probably fairer to bundle the question into one placehow did you learn to love #Brexit?
#Brexit: Blame the politicians, not the voters. Please read and share @Jon_Danzig’s editorial. Link: 
Wonder if Patriotic Leavers are aware that - apart from non dom media moguls - #Brexit engineered with US dark money and Russian dark arts?
#brexit - Let's call the whole thing off. #stopbrexithour
Lack of Trade Unions in workplaces and bad bosses destroys conditions, not immigrants. @TheGreenParty are clear on this fact. #brexit

Jacob Rees-Mogg MP - "There is so much positive to say on #Brexit - it is an exciting opportunity and something we missed in the election." 
Here's an interesting and useful diagram about #EU institutions. Put your cross where you think #Brexit Britain will end up. #SpotTheBall
I can't say this enough to Lib Dems but had you not supported austerity so vehemently during coalition there would be no #Brexit today. 
They only way #brexit could ever be stopped is if the people curb the power of the right wing press to influence their opinions.
I will never, ever forgive Corbyn for not being the Labour party or real opposition at our hour of most need since the 1950s #Brexit #Corbyn
ICYMI - excellent article on #Brexit from head of Germany's FIIG 
Remainers don't want some half-baked transitional deal, we want the self-destructive lunacy of #Brexit binned ASAP!#StopBrexit #ExitBrexit
What is the point of Remainers making huge efforts to attack the Tories if Corbyn is going to stab us in the back?#Brexit #StopBrexit
The unearned sense of entitlement oozing from everything the #EU says & does, proves to the world that #Brexit was the right thing to do!  
Fighting #Brexit is like wrestling a snake. You can only give up when one of you is dead.
I've spent months reading, listening, and arguing on twitter. But I'm still unclear what @UKLabour's exact #Brexit policy is. Which sucks.
How to ditch  Corbyn?? I'd do Anything to never have to hear or see him again supporting May on prime time Sunday pro #Brexit andrew marr
Why are remainers attacking Corbyn?Because he wants the same hard #Brexit as Tories& is selling same "cake & eat it" message as Vote Leave 
Corbyn is May's identical twin on hard #Brexit ...that eclipses all his rhetoric as the months will tell 
Just one of the reasons why, growing up in Cornwall, I love the EU. #Brexit 
British "expats" (what media call white immigrants) in Spain. I'm sure Daily Mail outraged at refusal to "integrate" & "adapt." #Brexit 
Indeed. Also Scotland's First Minister @NicolaSturgeon has also pointed out Corbyn's fundamental error re #Brexit:
Hey @jeremycorbyn. That's a fabulous lie. Fancy sticking on the side of a big red bus to give it more impact? #Brexit 
ICYMI: A #Brexit reversal still looks unlikely — but not impossible 
Tick. Tock.  #Brexit
I was the @LibDems candidate in #BrentCentral, the Labour candidate (now MP) promised to fight hard #Brexit. She deceived us. Disgraceful! 
Why Lib Dem leader @vincecable thinks there should be another #Brexit referendum #Ridge

"It will be a version of the Hotel California: Britain will check out, but never leave." #Brexit #eudk 
But it's not.... How long Labour's incoherence on #brexit can hold will eventually become a major issue 
So now that we've all calmed down can we just quietly bury #Brexit and get on with real life? 
It is simply not feasible to support an anti-austerity agenda AND #Brexit. They are incompatible. #Brexit will force UK to cut taxes further
We voted to #Leave EU last yr. We must NOT have transitional #Brexit. End immigration NOW before Italy gives half of Africa passports #UKIP
Tories being hammered for lack of #Brexit plan but Corbyn's gibberish on #Marr suggests Labour doesn't have a clue either...
Where are @UKLabour at with #Brexit? Shadow Trade Sec @BarryGardiner answers @skynewsniall #Ridge
Labour has shifted the Tory agenda on #BrexitTories NOW appear to be majoring on Labours line :"Jobs & the economy MUST be central"#Marr
One of the most disheartening things of #Brexit is journalists letting that kind of untruth going unchallenged. Corbyn simply wrong  
@jeremycorbyn agrees with me that a Tory deal with the U.S. sounds like #TTIP . #Brexit #marr

A democracy relies on a general consensus about the basic rules of the game that simply does not exist for #Brexit.
1. A lot of people are asking what the point of #Brexit is when there is little scope for regulatory divergence.
Within 5 years of a normal general election, you get another one. But #Brexit would not be like that, which is why passions are so high.
Remember the hope and joy generated by the 2012 London Olympics? How did we let it all go and let #Brexit poison our politics?

Still awaiting any evidence that #Brexit course we are embarked on is not detrimental to the UK in every way. Just ask Theresa May.

18) as is implying student debt will be written off.  And not taking a clear stand on #brexit (either for or against) is cowardice
14) Jones knows this and studiously avoids any mention of Labour #brexit position, fine for a party cheerleader but poor for a journalist
13) no-one could describe this interview as "honest" or "straightforward"-Labour under Corbyn is fudging on #brexit
Come on @UKLabour MPs enough of waiting for the 'right time' to oppose #Brexit. Do it now, you'll be much happier people!
.@LibDems @vincecable this is why we must stop #Brexit

We may know #Brexit threats of violence are a paper tiger, but if they succeed in frightening some of the public they will have succeeded.
This cartoon from the morning after #Brexit still seems apt 
A diplomat told me #Brexit's "not really about the Scots or N Irish or even the Welsh. It's about a nervous breakdown in English society." 
We've been lumbered with a generation of politicians, both Tory & Labour, who don't even understand the basics of the EU or FTA's. #brexit

A reason why Legal Twitter is comparatively quiet today - an awful lot of heavy reading.....#Brexit

#RepealBill summarised: Loss of your fundamental rights as a human being, and more power for ministers. #FightBack #Brexit
The Scottish and Welsh governments are refusing to give consent for this #Brexit law 
The EU are taking #brexit very seriously and are acting professionally. UK representatives seem to think it's a public schoolboy jape.
Charter of Fundamental Rights NOT being transposed into UK law. Don't trust the Tories with your rights. #Brexit
.@jeremycorbyn gives EU's chief #Brexit negotiator @MichelBarnier a personalised Arsenal shirt as they meet in Brussels
Why are MPs like Stewart Jackson who sound like semi-criminal thugs disrespectful of the Law allowed to remain in the Tory party!#Brexit 
A Tory government which lost its majority will use the powers of a 16th century mad king to cling on in a 21st century democracy. #Brexit
This is ironic after Brexiteers spent years calling for more powers to be devolved to uk parli  #Brexit #RepealBill

This graphic shows our environment legislation is more affected by #Brexit than almost any other area of law. Vital we get #RepealBill right
The 'Great Repeal Bill' is actually the 'Great Duplication Bill', so what's the point? says Nick Clegg #Brexit 
4) it's simple-both Tories & Labour are pushing #Brexit through but neither understand it
I wonder how many #Brexit voters actually had any idea of the negative knock-on effects for cancer care & research (or even thought of it)
2) anyone from government involved in #Brexit should simply be asked "you don't know what you're doing, do you?"
London needs to retain access to EU talent after #Brexit-letter to @DavidDavisMP:  #postBrexitLDN @TechLondonAdv
As a cancer specialist, I can state that this threatens cancer care in U.K. Another potentially dreadful consequence of #Brexit 
Regardless of how you voted last year in #EURef, do you think the UK should Leave the EU? #Brexit

Let us be clear we have lost control of #Brexit
I think it's good that we're getting the shit kicked out of us over #Brexit. We deserve it.
In #Brexit Britain it is important to recall the classic formulation of an MP's duties as expounded by Burke and restated by Churchill. 
Even the Daily Express carries headline '#Brexit is dying'  
1) We have to accept that the #Brexit leadership had very little practical knowledge about the thing they spent years fighting against 
No wonder the Tory Right and the tax-dodging #Brexit press barons want Britain to quit the Single Market. Tax haven #Brexit for the rich.

The best letter on #Brexit. No the best letter EVER, published by @FT (by Cambridge prof Nicholas Boyle.
Cons are saying that they're depending on #Labour voting for everything..That's how they'll get #Brexit through.  They're confident. 
Jeremy, that's called membership in the EU...#LabourBrexit-you'll need  Ouija board to understand...#Brexit 
Brexit: Barnier - "that is not possible. As does Brexit mean Brexit, impossible means impossible.  #Brexit. 
Joint UK pharma industry leaders letter on #Brexit, just published by @FT
#Brexit consequences are "direct result of choices made by UK" @MichelBarnier​ "Brits can't leave single market & keep its benefits".
Interesting from @Keir_Starmer. >70% @UKLabour voters are #remain. @uklabour should address causes of #brexit not go along with FR fantasy. 
Small reminder: ‘exact same benefits’ were also the words used in your leader’s Amd to #QueensSpeech. Sorry Chuka! #Brexit 
John Major: "...if they decide to leave on the basis of inaccurate information... then I regard that to be deceitful"#Brexit #StopBrexit
At last UK business is starting to speak up about the horrendous implications of the government's current #Brexit "plan". More please. 
Well, remaining in the EU would prevent Britain from having frictionless trade with the rest of the world. #Brexit 
Quick reminder as it appears to constantly escape you: we won the argument and we are leaving #Brexit 
Good to see business through #CBI finding its voice again. Momentum is shifting towards a single market/customs union #Brexit
If the UK had formed a cross party department for #Brexit it would have gone much better. The tribalism is causing us to be opaque.
I watch the news, I read the papers. There are no good #brexit stories. Does our PM and her cabinet just bury their heads in the sand?
What we need Keir is to stop this ridiculous country destroying game, and stop pandering to racists and xenophobes. #Brexit is bad!
Do you already have plans for what you are going to do when the cancellation of #Brexit is announced? Scream, kiss your neighbour/dog/cat... 
We need to abandon this asinine #Brexit thing. Country can't be held to ransom on basis of a single vote of over a year ago.#Labour#Tories
Watch this video to learn why getting a good deal from the #Brexit negotiations is so important for everyone. 
News reaches Wimbledon that #Brexit has been cancelled. Or possibly that Roger Federer has arrived on Centre Court. Wait - maybe the latter. 
Two weeks into #Brexit negotiations and really feels wheels are coming off UK 'position' (whatever it is). Silence from Brexiters deafening

UK business leaders to call for indefinite delay in leaving single market: #Brexit
'If we leave we will be able to trade with the rest of the world' - all brexiteers #EU #Brexit #JapanEU #EUJapan
Personally I'll campaign for a law that would enable the criminal prosecution of the #Brexit liars and hate-campaigners.
Ex Foreign Minister #Brexiteer now says #Brexit 'will damage #Britain's influence in the world' says William #Hague
Why on earth would a Labour leader want to be associated with a #Brexit built on a fear of outsiders whipped up by the right wing press? 
I viewed Liam Fox's performance in the #Brexit debate in the HOC. "Physician heal thyself". He is utterly delusional and needs help.. 
A senior Tory had a Trump-style tantrum about the media. The internet responded [TWEETS]  #Brexit
So the chattering classes have engineered their own self-referential circle jerk, sealed off from other opinions.#Brexit 
This would be worst possible outcome for Scotland's top economic sector, shows why @scotgov needs to be involved in #brexit negotiations
WATCH: Dr. @LiamFox criticises #BBC for negative #Brexit reporting 
I'd like to know how much money has been wasted on Liam Fox's Department of International Trade. A complete farce #Brexit #SingleMarket
Working visit to port Zeebrugge, hub of single market. #brexit will affect some regions and sectors more @GeertBourgeois @jvanovertveldt
The BBC would rather see Britain fail than see #Brexit succeed, suggests Liam Fox 
Let's see how #Brexit is going today... 
Seeing as #brexit is broken, unfit for use, passed it's sell by date, we may as well bin it! #brexitbinit
Same here Julia but I have met a few Remainers who now wish they'd voted for #Brexit. 
Yes. What does @LiamFox have to say in response to the #EU's new Japan trade deal? How will the #UK top it after #brexit?

The EU's chief #Brexit negotiator spells out why he believes no deal would really be a bad deal
#Brexit will make Britain far more dependent on the whims of international capitalists, It's why the Tories want it & Corbyn should fight it
Quite obvious that UK never really thought this #Brexit malarky thru'.  Still haven't. Still thinking the Empire will save them.
Not so long ago people were outraged by 'spin'. Now it's just a torrent of unpunished right wing lies.#Brexit #StopBrexit #Remain
In the #EU Britain benefits from the best trade agreements. Why throw all that away with #Brexit? Please share: 
Supporting the UK's #creative industries @EquityUK, concerned about the impact of #Brexit on their members 
It's dishonest for Labour MPs to claim they're sticking up for interests of working class voters by backing #Brexit. 
In short, our farmers will miss out because of #brexit & our car exports to EU will have competition from Japan 
Was out for lunch. Has #Brexit been cancelled yet?
Dr Liam Fox​ hits out at @BBC​ by saying "elements of our media would rather see Britain fail than #Brexit succeed" in @HouseofCommons​.
Just noticed this on my FB. Excellent letter to the FT. #brexit #sex #onanism #tory #labour pic.twitter.com/KSsQZVADZz

Thank heavens we are leaving the awful, failing anti-business EU! #Brexit #FFS 
Here is Paul Mason admitting that the current labour leadership's "constructive ambiguity" on #brexit won't wash. He sounds a bit panicky. 
Jeremy outlining #Labour stance: @BloombergTV re:  #Brexit:-#FOM; access to #SingleMarket no tariff; right for EU citizens..sounds like EU-
You can whinge all you like, take the side of the EU 'negotiator' all you like, but the UK is for #Brexit.Strap in & sit comfortably.
Big breakthrough - #EU signs a trade deal with world's 3rd largest economy. That must be painful for UK PLC.... #Brexit 
Which are you in #Brexit debate? HT @BBCDanielS

Im afraid, any MP who backs #Brexit in any capacity, is a complete fool. That includes any party leader, the PM, and anyone who endorses it!
Probably spoken too soon; Mrs May should easily exceed Cameron with her ineptness.....even without #Brexit issues and negotiations. 
It also risks rights of 1.2m @BritishInEurope who might have to rely on 27 different courts to interpret their #citizensrights post #Brexit 
MEPs have rejected a proposal to give "special designated status" to Northern Ireland after #Brexit - by 374 votes to 66.

It is unclear whether #brexit shall pass. But what is abundantly clear is that a post #brexit UK will be fairer under #Labour.

Yeah yeah- that's what the polls said right up until Referendum night. Crap polling, total rubbish. #brexit 
This is literally why @The3Million need ECJ jurisdiction or similar after #Brexit to avoid rights erosion.Shocking parallels. 
Nice one in #Brexit times. 
How was it not obvious #brexit would spell the end of EU Citizenship for Brits?

How is this possible when 54% currently want to Remain? Have we got 6% who want their citizenship cake and to eat it? #Brexit

#newsnight The Commission’s legal draft of the  #brexit agreement reached in December is based on the third “fallback” option re #Ireland -because the UK hasn’t put forward anything forward on how the first or second options could work. Government’s fault, not EU’s !
Leaked "explosive memo" from Boris Johnson to Theresa May suggests the Tory government has been misleading both the British Public & the EU regarding Irish border arrangements. Labour's @BarryGardiner accuses government of "bad faith" & calls for transparency and honesty. #Brexit 
Bloke who gave us Black Wednesday and Maastricht (and took the Tories to their worst defeat since 1832) is going to speak on #Brexit tomorrow. Move along, nothing to see here. #JohnMajor
If #Brexit keeps going the way it's heading I suspect that @sinnfeinireland will be painting a new mural honouring Volunteers Nigel Farage and Sammy Wilson.
Very busy #tonighttv3 with #BeastFromTheEast #brexit and government buying of ad space in newspapers (and trying to hide it) all on agenda.
Watching Scottish media news tonight I was under the impression that #Ryanair was departing Glasgow airport cause Scottish Government hadn't abolished APD. Seemed odd, so within seconds of going on Twitter, I found statement claiming #Brexit was reason.England controls our media
HERE'S a thing !I'm trying to work out - just whom exactly is the *Consigliere* (enforcer) behind Theresa May #BrexitIs it :Bernard Jenkins ?Rees Mogg ?Boris Johnson ?Answers on a postcard please !
A busy day ahead tomorrow as the draft legal text of the political agreement between the UK and the EU is published on #Brexit 
In the complex, erudite world of #brexit, the Irish border, a customs union & the rest of it, is the core strategy to hope the public will end up saying #Whateveah?

Right. So if I've understood correctly, #Brexit plans are somewhere between a Mad Max-style dystopia and a bag of crisps. Sounds great.
They’re coming after our Parliament. Time to put the band back together. #ContinuityBill #ScotRef #SNP #Brexit #torypowergrab #indyref2 #BrexitShambles
You can not leave a club and dictate the rules.. From where I sit in the UK it is the UK getting beaten up not Ireland.. after all they are still in the club !!  #brexit #remain #leave #fbpe #wato #newsnigt #r4today #bbcdp
Boris Johnson has effectively told PM that against everything he & govt said over previous 2 years wrt #brexit & also what the UK govt signed up to in phase 1 talks in December - that the UK should restablish a hard border between NIre & the Republic of Ireland. Unbelievable 
"A single regulatory space on the island of Ireland" and with those words the EU fires the first shots towards a united island. #Brexit
So, hang on...Assuming the whole adds up to 100% (of our economy, which it must), to whom have we been exporting the x% not to the EU? If it’s the rest of the world, why do we need #Brexit to trade with the rest of the world? We plainly already do...#StopBrexit #FBPE #ToriesOut

Glad to see Stella backing a #FinalSay on the #Brexit deal! 
Boris Johnson thinks 95% of cross-border travel will go unchecked. 35,000 make this journey daily. 5% = 1750. The alarming thing is that BJ thinks 50000 monthly border checks is not a problem - idiot #rtept #brexit #ireland
Here we have a BBC journalist being blatantly biased over #brexit. Why do I pay a licence fee @BBC?

Once again #tonighttv3 talking about #brexit and not one panelist who supports it. The bias in Irish media is doing the public no favours.
This is the #Brexit ballot paper. It asked one basic question. Since then a handful of prominent zealots have claimed other things were written on it: no single market, no customs union, end the Good Friday Agreement; no transition deal, Vote Tory etc. Try to remember the truth. 
This tweet has aged well for Mr Hannan hasn't it @BorderIrish#Brexit #GFA
Yet more utterly irresponsible comments by @BorisJohnson on #Ireland border today and yet more chaos + confusion on UK government approach. There’s an easy solution: Customs Union + Single Market @Open_Britain #Brexit 
There’s idiot Boris showcasing the Ballymena bus he is now happy to throw NI under. #brexit #noBorder
Absolutely spot on. It is time we fought back. 100% agree with the view of the Prime Minister on this. #Brexit 
Brexit has created chaos in Britain – nobody voted for this | Zoe Williams  #StopBrexit #Brexit #FinalSay #BrexitShambles #TheresaMay
Here is the answer to the ERG’s dismissal of the #GFA issue - and the beginning of the end of #Brexit
“There’s no border between Camden & Westminster... When I was Mayor of London we anaesthetically & invisibly took £100ms” from people who crossed the boundary. A crass comparison which does a great disservice to all those concerned about #Brexit & a hardening of the NI border. 
So proud to join the @isitworthitbus in Southampton and Portsmouth today, giving a speech explaining why islanders voted #Brexit and why many are questioning #isitworthit

Who'll be first unionist to squeeze out a threat of violence if the #Brexit wet dream they've been having with the Tories goes sour?Extra points for trying to make sound NOT like a threat of violence? Because, you know, *terrorists*.
"@MichelBarnier also said differences remained over what rights EU citizens coming to the UK during the transition would have."We would like to remind that #citizensrights for @BritishInEurope and us are far from being sorted following #Brexit Phase 1.
The Irish border is a serious issue and may yet scupper #Brexit, so instead of giving Bernard Jenkin a proper grilling on it, Evan Davies bottles it, serious times call for serious questioning, come back Jeremy Paxman, #Newsnight.
So the latest arrogant Brexiter to appear on the media, Bernard Jenkin, basically daring the EU to put up a border. This kind of brinkmanship is absolutely pathetic. UK is being run by lunatics right now. #Newsnight #Brexit
Will @Jacob_Rees_Mogg kindly apologise for parroting this misleading nonsense which is based on deducting the tariff as if it applied to the retail price. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Brexit: bordering on the ridiculous - via the European Commission, we expect to see the fruits of the lack of understanding on Ireland. There is no single Westminster politician who has publicly demonstrated a grasp of the border issues...  #Brexit.

Its intriguing how often these days, when listening to hardline brexiters that the thought occurs: the only rational response to their arguments against all possible compromises is that we should stay in the EU. #brexit #newsnight
The Scottish Gov are letting us all down with this infantile and dishonest behaviour. Stop fighting democracy #brexit 
Had a chat with @ShelaghFogarty earlier on @LBC about borders, #Brexit and more on @LBC. Listen back to some of my interview over on their website.
Their absolute contempt for the Irish / Northern Irish is sickening  #BorisJohnson #irishborder #brexit 
Northern Ireland effectively to remain in the EU Customs Union after #Brexit says EU draft of withdrawal agreement. Now we await the Hellfire and brimstone from our DUP brethren. I expect they are working on the Sermon as I tap.https://t.co/gotEXFqmPx?amp=1
The EU's draft legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement may mark the point when it emerged as the only organisation in control of #Brexit .The Tory government is so neutered by its internal conflicts that it has no draft of its own.So it either buys the EU version or it walks.

1. Sadly the issue can't be about hard or soft #Brexit..both = Brexit...soft is simply harder in waiting...we lose Rights the minute we leave the EU, the right of FOM & the right to take our govt to the ECJ if the former attempts to remove our rights. We lose consular assistance.
These questions should have been asked repeatedly during the referendum. During the general election. During the negotiations. During every fecking interview and press conference this government held in the last 20 months. It is the UK wot done it. Not Ireland or the EU. #brexit
#Tory Gov, do we need to remind you, that it is your red lines and pursuit of #Brexit, that has created the border problem.  
During the 80's and 90's the @Conservatives sold off Gas, Electricity, Water, Telecoms etc & now they want to sell off the rest of the country including our NHS via #Brexit - They have to be stopped. #StopBrexit #FBPE #FinalSay #FinalSayForAll#StopBrexitSaveOurNHS #WeAreEurope
#Brexit Only one option, imo.  Remainers and Soft Brexiteers need to join together and get this craven govt. out.  Park the bus before it reaches the cliff-edge, take a breather, and sort it out together when more sensible, less divisive, heads take control of the steering wheel.

Outside of the #EU #CustomsUnion, #Britain will be free to go global.   The ability to reengage with the #Commonwealth and agree our own #tradedeals with the #world’s largest #economies and the fastest growing markets is one of the key prizes of #Brexit. Our time is now!

So @SkyNews leads on the leaked letter from @BorisJohnson where he argued there may have to be a hard border in Ireland after #Brexit (despite earlier comparing it to the congestion zone in London) whereas @BBCNews goes with the snow. Don’t want to rock the boat now. #StopBrexit
2/ This is obviously only right under two assumptions. A) that Nike does not produce in country already exempted from Duty (GSP or EBA) through the EU and B) that the UK won't charge any import duty post #Brexit

If the DUP really had Northern Ireland's best interests at heart, they'd jump at the chance of being the only UK region to remain aligned to the EU. Huge opportunity to attract FDI. But sadly they have more sectarian hatred of Ireland than sense #brexit
Nick Robinson & the BBC seem slightly taken aback that @scotgov is defending devolution in the #Brexit process. It's maybe time the BBC realised Scotland is not a county or a region, Scotland is a nation. 
The #Civil Servant who was actually head of this #Brexit government’s newly created Dept for International Trade, reveals that there is, in fact, no prospect of fulfilling the #brexiter promises of getting better #TradeDeals than we have now via EU

Let’s say this slowly and carefully again - even the @GovUK’s own figures show that any  trade benefit from new treaties outside EU is dwarfed by benefit of existing EU trade.  There is no - repeat, Ross, NO - pot of gold at the end of the #Brexit rainbow. 
This is dry stuff, but read it to see what it takes to get a chemical registered in the EU. Then imagine having to do it twice, once for a domestic regulator not recognised by the EU & once for the EU. Then imagine doing this throughout a long manufacturing supply chain. #Brexit

It’s Tuesday.And my country is still trying to reinvent the wheel. It keeps turning out square.Just abandon #Brexit.#StopBrexitSaveBritain

As an EU citizen with the #Brexit gun held to my head for the last 20 months by the Tory Gov I find it pretty rich for Tory MPs to accuse @UKLabour of weaponising Brexit to win my vote.The damage is self inflicted.
Sir Martin Donnelly former civil servant to Liam Fox: In giving up the CU & SM we're exchanging a 3 course meal for a packet of crisps....I'm trying to encourage discussion of the facts.ME: There is one central FACT re. #Brexit; if we don't #StopBrexit we will be WORSE OFF!
Good Tory Ministers listen to & back UK business. We do great trade deals as a member of #CustomsUnion. Chasing unicorn trade deals adds air miles but Governments’ own analysis show they won’t make good the damage #Brexit will do to UK economy. 
Does anyone remember the HARD BREXIT Labour manifesto, 8 months ago? Read what it said about #Brexit:   Brexiteers must stand behind @KateHoeyMP @frankfieldteam and colleagues in their fight.
#Brexit status report.The Tories insist we'll get unicornsLabour tell us their unicorns will poop rainbowsNeither have read @cstross' 'Equiod'
Corbyn’s #Brexit betrayal sees the new Labour heartlands of North London put one finger up to the true Labour heartlands of the North of EnglandNo surprises there then! How long are northern, dyed-in-wool, Labour voters going to carry on sitting back and taking this? 
Under a different PM the UK would be leaving the EU next year, job done. The Tories could then crack on with trade negotiations with America, Australia, New Zealand etc and invest EU contributions at home. Instead we have dithering May’s #Brexit by a thousand capitulations.
Ha ha ha ... Project Fear#Brexit is not safe in the hands of Labour. 
Strange times when the FT front page lead is the #CorbynSpeech on #Brexit but the front page of the Guardian, once a left of centre paper, doesn't mention it. #r4today
“Some will tell you that #Brexit is a disaster for this country and some will tell u Brexit will create a land of milk and honey. The truth is more down to earth and it’s in our hands”  JC speaking sense here.

Scrapping EU red tape will allow your Child to earn a WAGE! Don't deprive the poorest of the benefits of #brexit Jacob Rees-Mogg for prime minister 
Given the number of potential Tory defectors Corbyn is one of the most powerful actors in #Brexit politics. It is grossly misleading of some Corbyn supporters to pretend that he is powerless and that Brexit is a purely Tory show. #StopBrexit #FBPE
The takeaway from @jeremycorbyn speech today was:1) the pressure on #Brexit is working2) but we're still not there yet with Labour LeadershipIt's the people who leave who will force a full change of heart on Labour, not those who stayLong way to go still
You know the World has gone topsy turvy when The Financial Times gives Jeremy Corbyn the only Front Page in #TomorrowsPapersToday and it's positive!!#CorbynSpeech #CustomsUnion #Brexit #TheresaMayMustGo@Rachael_Swindon @OwenJones84

If a Tory government finds itself at war with the CBI, it might as well turn over the keys of Downing Street. #Brexit 
.@JeremyCorbyn’s Great European Policy Switch went down like the ­falling wet snow in Labour ’s ­heartland.Shoppers in Barnsley market in South Yorkshire didn’t warm to his conversion to “a customs union” with the EU after #Brexit. #TheCorbynCon
The @Conservatives trade minister @LiamFox attacks business because the @UKLabour party is now more pro business than the Conservative party.An example of ideology over basic common sense.#FBPU#Conservatives#Labour#Brexit 
This is an excellent campaign, by @MoreUnitedUK . The fact is that we can either have a hard #Brexit, or we can protect and strengthen our #NHS. We can’t do both. High time that Parliament debates this vital issue.

Dear @BBCNews & Chris Morris - As an actual business woman rather than a business lobbyist, I am not “broadly in favour” of Jeremy Corbyn’s latest views on #Brexit & the customs union.
Spoke to an English neighbour here in France. Turns out they voted for #Brexit. The reason 'well it'll stir things up a bit in the UK'Walked away.....
Delighted to take part in a #Brexit event for @Maryhill_SNP & Glasgow Regional Association. Great turnout , local MSP @BobDorisSNP to the fore along with local Cllr’s & very adroitly chaired by my old friend Joe Farrell.  Good to see  @AnneMcLaughlin there too.
Oh come on. How was it ever *not* going to thus?, backing : knows *how* to avoid a hard border and knows what to do to get it.: grumbles about what it doesn’t want, but has no workable plan.#Brexit 
Nobody wants a hard Irish border – but it suits Brussels and other factions to make it difficult  #Brexit
Are you any clearer yet what either UK party wants out of #brexit      ?  ?  ? 
#Breaking Labour front bench just confirm/admit in Commons that "A customs union is in all essence THE Customs Union of the EU" #Brexit
On behalf of which government were you meeting representatives of a foreign power?You certainly are not a British government representative.In fact you are not even representing your own voters as they clearly voted for #Brexit
What a shame Jeremy Corbyn hadn’t clocked this danger to jobs during the #Brexit referendum. He might have campaigned with a fraction of the enthusiasm he did during GE17.  The old Eurosceptic is facing reality at last. #BrexitFacts
Are you listening #Labour voters? @jeremycorbyn along with Keir Starmer don't give a *tinker's whatsit* that many Labour voters voted for #Brexit,  @UKLabour intend to keep UK in the #EU ignoring YOUR vote to #Leave.
“The UK economy has already been damaged by 8 years of Conservative austerity, where wages are still lower today than they were a decade ago. After years of Tory bluster, the Conservatives have been found out.#CorbynSpeech #Brexit
How many more reality checks do ppl need B4 they realise #Brexit's a crock of ordure?! It can't be made to work in the UK's interest neither the Tory/ERG version or the Labour fudge will deliver a BETTER deal than the one we already have. #FinalSay 2018 & a chance 2 #StopBrexit
Now let me get this right.  Dicky is Scottish @scottishlabour leader.  Scotland voted to remain in the EU.  Dicky supports #Brexit.  So he doesn't actually respect the result of the referendum his constituents and all of Scotland produced.   
Corbyn’s betrayal of both #brexit and #uklabour working class support. LP now the party of the bosses.
The Customs Union is a central component of the EU. It is the creation of EU treaties; it is coded into the dead bureaucratic heart of the Brussels machine. In rejecting the EU, we rejected the Customs Union, it’s as simple as that. #Brexit
Tory Brextremists like to peddle the idea that the EU impedes free trade. This is nonsense! 1. The EU is the world's greatest free trade area.2. The EU has the power to make great trade deals.3.  Free trade is now more about NTBs far more than tariffs.#StopBrexit #Brexit # 
I would say that cynicism is putting a £350 million lie on the side of a bus. #Brexit #BorisJohnson
For an alternative to white, middle aged, career obsessed, self-absorbed, disingenuous politicians talking about #Brexit, try @Femi_Sorry. He takes the novel approach of using facts not slogans off buses to make his case. And he’s better looking too.

Nigel Farage - "It’s perfectly clear. The nonsense about trade. Governments don’t negotiate trade deals. The European Commission negotiates trade deals. “If you are part of a customs union, you will not be involved in that." #Brexit

Where Newsthump actually does news and not satire about #Brexit! 
Dear @theresa_may & fellow nasty @CONservatives, Attacking @jeremycorbyn won’t solve your internal divisions and/or your #Brexit problems.But please do keep it up. It will help ensure a bigger majority for the @UKLabour party at the next General Election. #CorbynSpeech 
In NHS England, EU nationals make up 10% of doctors, 7% of nurses & 5% of scientific, therapeutic & technical staff. #Brexit is already impacting the #NHS so why is no one talking about it? Take 2 mins to write to your MP

Pleased to welcome @simoncoveney to the @Europarl_EN again. EU solidarity with Ireland remains steadfast. The legal text of the #Brexit withdrawal treaty must honor the commitments made in December  & ensure any hardening of the border on the island of Ireland is avoided. 
Below is the resignation letter and tweet from @keir_starmer from 2016 when he called #Brexit catastrophic and said that @jeremycorbyn needed to resign.I wonder if he thinks that #Corbyn should still resign?Don’t retweet whatever you do, as it will show up his hypocrisy. 
Listening to Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit speech. Trying to keep up on his & Labour's position on #brexit feels like this #CorbynSpeech

Very good meeting with @MichelBarnier today, focusing on #Brexit legal text of draft Withdrawal Agreement to be published on Wednesday - we are of the one mind, translating the political commitments of December into legal text - no more, no less. 
Since the referendum,@jeremycorbyn has consistently backed the @conservatives destructive #Brexit that risks jobs, the economy and the Union.His slight movement on the Customs Union and some EU agencies is positive, but there’s a long way to go before the rhetoric means reality.
Politically, Corbyn has played a blinder.He followed Napoleon's advice about not interrupting your enemy when they make a mistake.And THEN - when the time is right - he presents a decent, sensible plan and brutally exposes the Tory dire and destructive vacuum on #Brexit
John Redwood: Labour changes its mind2017 Labour Manifesto was quite clearThey laid out details of global trade policy so clearly ruled out staying in the/a Customs UnionMany pro Brexit voters voted Labour because they stood on pro #Brexit ticket#EU

Dear @LauraPidcockMP the so-called "Will of the People" is a wholly anti-democratic notion; a device of dictators & demagogues which portrays opponents of the govt as enemies of the people, and checks & balances as obstacles to carrying out the people's will.#Brexit #StopBrexit
Staggering! 94% of #smallbiz feeling ignored by Government on #Brexit. A seat at the the negotiating table is the bare minimum requirement for the true heroes of our economy. They've created 73% of all UK jobs since 2010...
A sharp rise in food prices and huge damage to the agricultural industry is likely post-#Brexit.  This Government must protect our farmers or they will face costly and disastrous tariffs.

To all @UKLabour Party members who wanted the UK to leave the EU I’m sorry. @jeremycorbyn has let you down. Corbyn’s plan keeps us in the EU with no influence.You don’t have to take my word for it. See what your own Front Bench and MPs say about it! #Brexit #CorbynSpeech
The @JeremyCorbyn speech on #Brexit :"Labour would seek a final deal that...maintains the benefits of the single market & the customs union...with no new impediments to trade and no reduction in rights, standards and protections”Full text of speech: 
Labour's position on #Brexit will also appeal to the employers with whom I speak on a daily basis, and who tell me that the chronic uncertainty brought about by the government is causing the investment tap to be turned off. 2/2
The real difference now between #Tories and #Labour on #Brexit is Labour will adapt with changes in circumstance, while the Tories will stick their fingers in their ears and go LALALALA. Which is more mature? #CorbynSpeech
Politically, Corbyn has played a blinder.He followed Napoleon's advice about not interrupting your enemy when they make a mistake.And THEN - when the time is right - he presents a decent, sensible plan and brutally exposes the Tory dire and destructive vacuum of a #Brexit plan
#Corbyn says he wants the #UK to be 'internationalist' but this is completely at odds with having us in a Customs Union with #EU which will prevent us making any trade deal internationally unless agreed upon by the #EU as a whole.THIS IS NOT #BREXIT
PM's spokesman says government will not be joining a customs union after #Brexit in response to Labour's plan for "new and comprehensive UK-EU customs union" 
I have always had time for @KateHoeyMP. She is increasingly isolated in being one of the few @UKLabour MP's to put Country before political ambition over #Brexit.She was right when she said  "Any form of Customs Union would mean leaving the #EU in name only."
Meeting @MichelBarnier this afternoon on #Brexit and preparing the EU draft Withdrawal Agreement, to be published later this week. Commitments made in December between EU and UK must be clearly reflected in new legal text. EU solidarity remains strong with Ireland's concerns
Good to hear @jeremycorbyn emphasise regional rebalancing of our economy in his #Brexit speech: “To shift it away from the low pay, low skill, low investment economy it has become, so that no longer will some regions get a mere one-sixth of the investment that goes to London.”
Labour wants "full access to EU markets" which maintains benefits of single market and customs union - Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says  #Brexit 
1. There is no right or wrong answer to the #Brexit question. It is simply a question of whether you want to be an independent self-governing nation or whether you want to be a subordinate of the EU.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn gives a speech on #Brexit 
I can’t believe I’m spending so much time restating arguments won by the late great Mr Benn on the EU decades ago - to left wing people! #brexit #Brexit
The Customs Union locks out food exports from poor third world producers, would preclude anti-dumping laws protecting British steel and forbid individual trade deals with the BRICS countries. Which parts of that do left-wing people not understand? #Brexit
Kate Hoey MOCKS EU trade BLUNDERSThink how long EU has taken to get trade deals & still not got them with China, India, USAHalf-in, Half-out makes no sense.That would still give EU control.Even EU said 90% of growth worldwide is outside #EU#Brexit
For James O'Brien, his radio show is little more than an opportunity for intellectual showboating, bullying and mutual masturbation among his acolytes. He is little more than a sneering engorged ego fuelled by contempt. An opportunistic parasite who contributes nothing.#Brexit
#Brexit is already impacting the #NHS. Why is no one talking about it?? Write to your MP now to demand a parliamentary debate - this is far too important to sit back & hope for the best 
On a day when we’re celebrating important & welcome improvement in Labour’s #Brexit policy - worth re-nailing those Lexiteer myths 
I am a Northern Labour memberI voted Remain without hesitation and would do so again.I 100% support what Corbyn and @UKLabour are doing on #BrexitJust because folk voted Remain doesn't mean they think Labour should oppose the referendum result.
So Jezza has always been the politician that votes 4 what he believes in & always stuck by his POV however bad or unpopular it was at the time. Today 4 the first time he will change Labour's #Brexit policy against his own inclinations and shaft 70% of lab voters. #TheCorbynCon
So, our ‘Leaders’ are finally girding themselves up to come off the fence, a bit, over #BrexitNot much to choose between them so far, if indications are correct, but what’s your preference?(Retweets needed, comments welcome)
Dear @UKLabour and @jeremycorbyn. There is no upside to #Brexit for the poor and the vulnerable. There is no upside for business. The majority of people now want to #Remain in the #EU. Base your strategy on that for that is the view of the vast majority of @UKLabour members.

Staying in a customs union with the EU after #Brexit wouldn't avert a customs border at Dover or in Ireland. UK would also need to remain in the single market in goods, as I explain here 
1. Barry Gardiner: We respect the British Ppl's Will to be a Soveriegn country.ME: Your claim that #Brexit is the Will of the Ppl is flawed given only 26.5% of the Ppl voted 4 it. Only 51.89% of those voting, 37% of voters backed it in a non-binding vote after a flawed process!

When it comes to the EU negotiations .@jeremycorbyn and .@BorisJohnson are in agreement - you can have your cake and eat it. While he is about it, Corbyn should go the whole hog and steal that phrase about 'selling us all those BMWs and that prosecco'. #Brexit #FBPE
.@jeremycorbyn's #Brexit betrayal. The @UKLabour leader is expected to say he will sacrifice the ability to strike new trade deals in order to keep the #UK locked in an #EU customs union – and allow free movement to continue.

We are paying the lot at the #BBC £3.7 billion a year and in return they give us shit like #TheMashReport with a smart arse comedian who looks like an ISIS field commander in a suit constantly taking the piss at the expense of people who voted for #Brexit
#Labour right to say that, if we #brexit, we need to stay in a #CustomsUnion with EU. Not just vital for #trade with EU (& to avoid hard border in NI), but also for #Trade with rest of world: the many existing deals we negotiated as Europe, rather than separately, shld be kept!
Labour's latest #Brexit policy is an act of submission to a foreign power unseen since the Vichy government of France in 1940. Worse it is a cynical ploy designed to undermine the government during difficult negotiations. 
Hard Brexit = Hard border which threatens peace. The only rational resolution is for Britain to scrap #Brexit and to remain a full member of the #EU. Please share this two-minute video:  #StopBrexit
Cost of #Brexit continues to rise.   #BrexitReality is not what we were promised by the #Leave campaign. (via @InFactsOrg )

#Brexit Jeremy Corbyn wants to stay in Single Market & Customs Union now. The halfwit hates the EU all his life voted against EU all the time. Anyone believe a word this clown  says. Be worst Prime Minister of all time if he gets in. Shake magic moneytree pays for everything.

Tax havens AND not paying corporation tax. If you support #brexit them more of this WILL happen. 
There is now a clear majority in Parliamentfor @jeremycorbyn version of #Brexit whereas the Prime Minister does not have a majority for her version of #Brexit . In effect Corbyn is now  running the country from the opposition benches.
The latest #Brexit policy by @UKLabour explained. Labour want to sacrifice trade with the blue bit to protect trade with the red bit. Madness!
It is time for @GOvUK to recognise that no amount of spin or bullying or #Brexit bluster will shift @ScotGov from its defence of the powers Scotland voted for and won’t give up…
The driving force in Brexit is, as Irish Times columnist Fintan O'Toole says in article about Good Friday Agreement in The Observer today, "a specifically English nationalism for which the rest of the UK is ultimately dispensable." #Brexit #SNP #indyref2
Let's blame #brexitshambles on the Irish and SNP shall we. Doesn't matter that England voted for it and Tories & Labour are absolutely incompetent making the mess, just blame everyone else for the fallout of #Brexit
Anna Soubry is correct we are "absolutely sick to death" ... of her trying to undermine the government on #Brexit.

John Redwood: #EU seems intent on No DealEU decided to reject proposed UK/EU partnership they think UK wants before PM has even set it out!Further evidence EU either does not want a deal or thinks UK will just take dictation for a very bad deal#Brexit
There is no advantage to a customs union whatsoever. Unilateral tariff shadowing is all that is required to avoid rules of origin and subsequent border paperwork. A customs union would be a sledgehammer to essentially miss the nut. #Brexit

If Labour do well in the May 3 Local Elections it will be interpreted as a vote for #Brexit. That's what the media will say, and it will be concluded all around that Remainers have no electoral influence and can safely be ignored#StopBrexit #FBPE #ABTV
EU suddenly concerned about borders? (NI customs border) Oh! Now they want to punish us for #Brexit I see. I didn’t hear ONE IOTA of concern about borders when fake refugees including terrorists illegally crossed EU external borders. In fact, the big boss waved them in!! #BBCSP
The big #Brexit crunch will be in parliament.  
Government has spent 20 months since referendum negotiating with itself about #brexit - and still not got clarity. Only 9 months left to negotiate with rest of EU. What chance of a deal that will work for Britain?
And the BBC has brought an Italian NHS worker on why?? A little attempt to emotionally blackmail the public into seeing how wrong the were to vote #Brexit? F*ck off! #BBCSPI know a guy. Gay, Italian, living in the UK. Pro-Brexit and anti the undemocratic EU. He on next week?
Just as Labour openly caucuses with Momentum & Communist Party of Britain, "Conservative" arch-Remoaner Dominic Grieve implies his pro-#EU allegiance is so strong, he would vote with Labour & risk a hard-Left Corbyn Govt, just to stop #Brexit.Just let that sink in. 
"Retired" EU Climate Commissioner drawing £210k a year from its pension scheme he paid into for just two years, whilst netting £17,500 a month salary #Brexit

Interesting. Having previously blamed Ireland, now seems it’s Scotland’s turn to be constructed as barrier to sunlit #brexit uplands 
So, under Labour, the UK wouldn’t be able to go out and forge trade deals with countries around the world, a key pillar of #Brexit. This is a betrayal. 
Alex Deane - "We need to look to our relations with the rest of the world and build trade deals with them because, like it or not, we are leaving the EU. We now have to accept that reality." #Brexit 
Here's the problem with the UK approach to #Brexit. We want to play by the Rules. The EU prefers to make them up. It would be better to tear up the rule book, tell them we are off and they won't be getting ANY of our cash.
UK de facto Deputy PM (David Liddington) warns the Scottish & Welsh not to try to derail #Brexit. N ireland already causing unforeseen problems. Proof if needed this is an #EnglishBrexit.
"We want to persuade our colleagues of the merits of our argument" - @LiamFox on setting out government's approach to #Brexit  #Marr
HA!!#marrAM to Fox (disgraced former Defence Secretary now #Brexit Trade Sec)"He (Keir Starmer) was a lot clearer than you (Fox) "YEP and would make a better job of the entire negotiating process !
So it's the dastardly SNP ruining #Brexit, is it? Not a hopelessly shambolic and incompetent UK Tory government that couldn't negotiate its way out of a wet paper bag, whilst dragging us out of the EU against our will?
Bin the transition, secure US trade deal and let’s go global! #Brexit

Good #Brexit news for a Sunday!  British trade exports growth is 2.5 times faster than that of Germany.  Latest official German figures.  Full #Brexit story: 
Germany's top 2 trade surpluses are with the USA and the UK.  British govt must ensure German people know.  Full #Brexit story: 
Does anyone seriously think other large countries like the US, China or Japan would accept the terms being proposed by fanatical Remainers for the UK?The mere suggestion is laughable. #Brexit
That which is not reserved is devolved - I thought Ross would know that, being an MP an' all that Or are you too busy sookin' up Theresa's bahookie to see when your country is being shafted Ross ? How about aiming some of your whining towards the disaster of tory #Brexit ??

EU guidelines say that after #Brexit , UK citizens may need visas for travel to the EU, and short-term stays (90 in every 180 day period), dependent on a legislative decision by the EU during a transitional period, should there be one. 
US trade secretary Wilbur Ross publicly described #Brexit as a god given opportunity to steal UK trade”. So understandable he’s happy as he’s American. Farage seems more interested in the benefits of brexit to US than the UK. I think there’s a word for that type of person

Don’t take the wrong turn, Britain. #Brexit is a dead end. Tell the driver we want to stay in the fast lane - in the EU. But how to tell the people in control? By supporting the #GreatNorthernMarch on 24/3. Send them a loud clear message: #StopBrexit
I remember when the Govt was supposedly pushing to start trade talks but was being 'punished' until 'sufficient progress' on divorce terms, i.e. #brexit bill. A year and a half later the EU is still citing the media because there is no official UK position on future relations. 
It is clear on #Brexit (though not to the people who claim to be running the country) that a policy of managed, selective regulatory divergence is not a workable basis for UK’s future relationship with  #EU.
The EU appoints a new civil servant to be responsible with dealing with any UK future relationship proposals ...#Brexit is the only way if the EU doesn't want to deal.

YES!! #Brexit has a youth vote and it’s about time the media stopped ignoring them and that their voices were heard! Great article @StevenEdginton 
To those claiming "staying in customs union goes against the will of the people" as expressed in the one-off #brexit referendum in 2016. Does this preclude the UK ever joining any customs union with any other nation or bloc forever? Or does this just apply to one with the EU?
UK corporate investment down by £7.2 billion and an 80% drop in EU nurse applications to Gloucestershire hospitals. Just some of the facts revealed last week about how #Brexit is affecting our economy and #NHS. The public must be granted a vote on the final deal.
Being in the Customs Union but not in the Single Market is illogical. Being in both but outside the EU is madness, the worst of both worlds. Betraying #Brexit will never be forgiven by millions of people and would fundamentally realign British politics in a very negative way.

Here we go: a summary of the 260-pages report I hand over to the Swedish government today -what should Sweden, a free trading UK-likeminded country, prioritise in the upcoming #brexit negotiations? And why is neither #EEA #CETA #DCFTA a perfect solution?

So, after EIGHT HOURS of meeting at #Chequers to at last get an agreed #government position on #Brexit , STILL nothing agreed (or nothing they’re willing to tell us).
Go figure! Not one single elected representative from Scotland deciding the future of Scotland’s relationship with Europe. UK ‘democracy’ in action. #Brexit 
If you need any proof that the UK isn’t a democracy and the devolved nations are nothing but asserts to be squandered. There was not one Scottish voice at the Tory #Brexit war Cabinet meeting. It’s an English only affair! It’s a f@cking insult and some folk still don’t care
I don't like #Momentum but I cannot disagree with this.British politics needs to stop the lies and get rid of the liars !- We cannot build a #democracy based upon lies- We cannot have a #brexit based upon lies- We simply have to nip this in the bud ! 
Goods arrive into NI via ROI, GB + EU for distribution across Ireland. Each loads different commodities and origins. Hugely complex #Brexit 
This is the worst case scenario ... Brussels senses Theresa May is weak and starts to play her. Time to go Theresa, before you do any harm ... give the job to someone who is totally committed to #Brexit and watch the EU crumble.

If u missed it yesterday, here’s @campbellclaret posing the crucial question all @UKLabour members need to ask of themselves - whether they want to be complicit in a hard-right Tory #Brexit 
Labour’s @EmilyThornberry just announced that they plan to betray the 17million voters who chose #Brexit by keeping us in an identical customs union to the one we’re in now. Binding the UK to all the current rules and regulations of the EU. #TheCorbynCon#LabourFail

.@EmilyThornberry has just said they would give up the right for the #UK to give up any ability to negotiate our own trade deals if it kept the #EU happy. I swear I have no bloomin idea what the @UKLabour #Brexit policy is anymore.  
I've tabled a new amendment to #TradeBill  mandating Govt to form "a" Customs Union with #EU #Brexit. It's gaining x party support @ChukaUmunna @NickyMorgan01 et al. It would be in the national interest if the Government & official Opposition also backed it.
If Boris resigns, I seriously would welcome his challenge on the leadership before they sign us up to the most ridiculously soft #Brexit. Boris, Jacob, should filed their team of #Brexiteers and do this country proud before the gutless ruin it.
#theortonfamily Derek and Neville having a chat about #brexit 
Another example of @theresa_may ‘s weak leadership and lack of clarity in relation to #Brexit damaging the UK economy.  She must restore some sort of seasonal workers scheme or face a labour crisis in the agricultural industry. 
Brussels torpedo's May's #Brexit plans as it reiterates how a third country will be dealt with. How is it the PM and her Cabinet are funding it so difficult to understand what's been explained to them umpteen times. Are they really that thick?
But Anna there is no hard or soft #Brexit only Leave and your constituents voted Leave, call me old fashioned but I believe in democracy.

Nobody gave ‘informed consent’ for #Brexit. That’s because in the #EUReferendum, the electorate was not sufficiently informed. That’s why there needs to be another vote on Brexit, so that Britain can now give its informed response. See all our posters at

610 days since the referendum on leaving the EU;590 days since Theresa May became PM;331 days since the UK notified the EU under Article 50 that it is leaving;329 days since the EU published its plan for #Brexit;Today the UK gov't will try to thrash out what its aims are.
Look at that! #EU guidelines for future #brexit relationship with the UK have been published: Theresa May's cake-and-eat-it approach, which we have said would be impossible to implement since before the brexit vote, has been declared "not compatible". Thread.

At the Cabinet Away Day at Chequers, there is much mirth as David Davis provides a report on his progress so far and plans for #brexit 
Throughout #Brexit negotiations, @Theresa_May continually puts @Conservatives party politics above the national interest. The patience of businesses is wearing thin and she must show some clarity and make some decisions rather than be paralysed by her party’s divides.

What is the point of leaving the EU if you risk staying in transition period indefinitely. I really hope it’s not true. You either leave, or you stay. Being in permanent limbo won’t be beneficial to anyone -whether Leavers or Remainers. #Brexit
What is the point in the cabinet convening at Chequers to determine government policy on #Brexit when it is already being dictated by the Tory Economic Ruin Group. There’s no need to cease UK participation in the Single Market & Customs Union but they demand it so the PM consents
Unacceptable - Gov’t transition strategy says: 1) it wants EU to discuss extending transition period beyond Dec 2020 with only an “indicative” end date. 2) In a major climbdown May’s gov’t fails to demand end freedom of mov’t rights for EU citizens during transition. #Brexit

Government’s proposal for #Brexit #transition :Article 1: The UK shall no longer be officially listed as a member of the EUArticle 2: Nothing else changes (and that is, actually, the least damaging option!)
You can’t trust anyone who talks about a ‘hard’ or a ‘soft’ #Brexit. There is only Brexit. Those talking about either only want ‘no Brexit.’ 
I hated Lord of the Flies when I had to study it at O'level, as I thought the characters were disgusting. I had little understanding (as girl with no brothers) that boys could be so horrible to each other.I understand now.It is a good analogy for #Brexit Britain.

If the Tories abandon the GFA as the only way to deliver #Brexit, those in the cabinet should be charged treason.

Lib Dems out in numbers to remind .@BorisJohnson of his promise of £350 million a week for the NHS after #Brexit. Very sad that Govt's own report  confirms there will be less money for public services after Brexit, not more. #FBPE
Magnificent rallying call by Tory peer Viscount Hailsham (Douglas Hogg, former Lord Chancellor) in speech on #EUWithdrawalBill. He wants UK to stay in Single Market and Customs Union ‘and if I could, to frustrate #Brexit’
In the Bundestag today first session of the new European Affairs Committee. First topic: #Brexit ! Well-informed debate after intro by State Minister Roth @MiRo_SPD expressing clear support for @MichelBarnier
The Treasury used a 'rigged' model to arrive at their pessimistic #Brexit forecast - by ruling out any possible economic benefits from Brexit by assumption. 
A German diplomat told @Theresa_May in Munich, ‘Things would be so much easier if you stayed’. But the PM was having none of it, and said #Brexit was final. So, she can change her mind, but the country can’t. Read and share @Jon_Danzig’s ‘EU ROPE’ blog:

"This whole thing about how Brexit is good for trade is obviously complete nonsense," says Tory MP Ed Vaizey. We wonder what his boss will make of that?@edvaizey | @Matthew_Wright | #Brexit | #wrightstuff
I wholeheartedly back this letter of support to the PM which gives power to her elbow in these crucial negotiations to achieve a clean #Brexit. Out of the Single Market, out of the Customs Union and delivers a special economic partnership with the EU that works for the whole UK 
Britain is doing #Brexit backwards: deciding to leave, then flailing around trying to work out how, and by when.Surely working out how to do it, and then doing it, might have been a better plan…?

Staggering to see @IanBlackfordMPdemanding action on genocide in Syria to be followed immediately by a Tory Q on blue passports post #brexit. Priorities are clearly in place.#PMQs
Can’t believe Corbyn has used six Prime Minister’s Questions to ask about #Brexit details. This would have more credibility if Labour had a position on Single Market, Customs Union and Freedom of Movement.
Leaked paper suggests Theresa May wants to extend transition period beyond 2020 and won't end FOM. The "they need us more than we need them" narrative is dead. The country is on the ropes. #Brexit 
The PM claims @UKLabour is not clear on what it wants from #Brexit - she is convening an away day at Chequers tomorrow because her cabinet can’t agree on the EU. Is this another bad joke from the PM? #pmqs

Britain: we need a #Brexit transition period because we do not know how to do Brexit.And so, dear EU, might you extend that transition period beyond the end of 2020…?This is getting ridiculous now.
Whitehall's latest #Brexit analysis made a number of false assumptions - including failing to model the agreement with the EU that the government is itself seeking! Doing so yields much more positive results, argues @julianHjessop and @Econs4FreeTrade 
So according to @FT the Tories want to “preserve” City of London privileged access to the EU - but not UK exporters of goods and services? The City would be wise to decline this match/firelighter. It  would inflame public anger.. #Brexit

Precisely! Time for the UK government to accept that #Brexit means 3rd-party status. When it comes to it, the UK just isn't quite as special as it thinks it is. 
The letter from the #Tory #Brexiters to #TheresaMay provides a handy list of the MPs who want a job-destroying #brexit-at-any-cost, no matter what damage it does to #Britain

#Brexit and Lord of the Flies. A primer from a recovering English teacher.1. It starts off as quite a good analogy. Jack thinks everything will be ok "because we're British, and the British are the best at everything."
Brexit: pure, unadulterated fantasy - we are not going to get the EU to accept mutual recognition of standards and the sooner we recognise that, the better. We will have to remain tied, for the time being, to the Union's harmonisation programme.  #Brexit. 
There is something almost magnificent about #Brexit. There are no imperial spoils to justify or redeem its exceptionalism anymore. It is the supremacism of a post-imperial age. We are leading the world now in naked irrationality. The empire finally consumes itself.
I am upset about #Brexit, but for many of us pro-Indy folk in 2014, we foresaw this coming. So it's not a real shock. I guess millions of others are just playing catch up.
Bungling civil servants put WRONG data into #Brexit study!“It appears breakdown of EU talks would be POSITIVE for UK: one-off gain of £38bn on #EU budget + £180bn from non-budgetary Brexit gains + £433bn from EU tariff revenue: some £651 BILLION in all"
Keep at it @KateHoeyMP. When you have stirred anti #brexit @Keir_Starmer up, you must be doing something right. Kate has always been one of the few decent @UKLabour MP's. Look at the replies baying for her. It sums #Labour up.

Time for the Tory moderates to grow a pair and call the Brextremists' bluff. Up to now they've given into to every extremist threat to explode themselves and the rest of the party into smithereens. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
The ERG seem to be playing very skillfully. 62 MPs effectively in control of gov #Brexit policy. Guessing they are good bridge players. And dreadful human beings.
We've warned that the Tories would use #Brexit to replace EU 27 workers with cheaper & more exploitable 3rd world workers. Now Gove says the UK will need migrant farm workers from outside the EU.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Britain must retain full regulatory autonomy and be free to sign new trade deals during any transition.- Jacob Rees-Mogg leads MPs in letter to PM Theresa May setting out their #Brexit red lines. 
It seems a shame that as the Tory party collapses in on itself over what was originally a low priority moot point about Europe; that it seems compelled to take the whole country down with it.#StopBrexit#FBPE#Brexit
Disgraceful. Where were the Tories, labour & Lib Dem MPs? #brexit is the single biggest issue facing Scotland’s society & economy yet only @theSNP MPs turned up
"Most businesses here don’t trade internationally, but they are still bound up in the red tape that comes with the EU. That is not Mad-Max dystopia, it’s being free of red tape that is totally irrelevant." #Brexit 
Theresa May has been warned Britain cannot become simply a “ruler-taker” after #Brexit, in a letter signed by 62 Tory MPs including Jacob Rees-Mogg this week. 
Interesting - not least because 3 Scottish Tory MPs are so ideologically fixated that they sign up to support a type of extreme #Brexit  that would devastate their constituencies and impoverish their constituents 
And this is how #Brexit will play out. Theresa May will say Britain can’t deal with the “bullying EU”.She announces “no deal”.She wins the support of hard Brexiters & right wing media who portray her as some sort of Boudica heroine.Brexit voters lap it up.

62 English tory MPs holding the country to ransom with their demands on May for a hard #Brexit despite all the evidence that shows it is a bad idea.Electorate now say stay in CU and SM. But hey this is posh boy democracy.
Involving @theSNP in #brexit discussions is like inviting Guy Fawkes for supper at the Houses of Parliament. Scot Nats want to break-up Britain, they're 5th columnists and only a minority in Scotland. 
Myself & @PeterGrantMP were delighted to meet with Franco-British parliamentary friendship group @CommonsEUexit. French parliamentarians keen to hear from @theSNP about majority in Scotland for #Remain, impact of #Brexit in Scotland & #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
#Brexit surprise is not the referendum loss but the manner in which those with power handled it-no time out, no request from #HMG to parliament to carry out in-depth studies, no effort to address the complexities-a ruling class incapable of ruling
It showed an astounding lack of detail and understanding in relation to #Brexit realities. We’re still in the dark on the gvt.s plan to tackle the Irish border which is key to his brief as Foreign Secretary and crucial to the future of our nation.
The Irish peace process cannot be a victim of the #brexit cult.  #WeNeedTheGFA Sooner these brexit charlatans take responsibility for this absolute clusterf*ck the better.  Of course, that would require integrity.  Sadly lacking in any of them.

Growth in the UK fashion industry was 6% a year until 2016. Uncertainties around #Brexit has reduced this to 1.6%. Further trade barriers to the EU will damage the industry. We must stay in the single market and customs union or face severe economic impacts nationwide!

UK tax burden (taxes as % of GDP) is set to average over 34 percent in next 5 years, the highest sustained level we have seen since 1950s. A new era of tax reform and tax reduction is needed to ensure UK economy is competitive after #Brexit.

A Tory putting national interest over party politics! A shame that it is so rare during #Brexit negotiations. We didn’t vote to leave the single market or the customs union. The public must be granted a vote on the final deal.

The reason we never get a single example of which EU regulations may change - and why we must insist - is because it is on exactly that battlefield that #Brexit finally dies. The move from vague promises of all magically being winners to details of the many, many losers to come.
As I've said before, #Brexiteers have stopped pretending #Brexit is going to be great & now just say we can't defy the 'will of the people' & it won't be 'as bad' as Remainers say it will - there's no mandate for this chaotic scenario...none at all#DavidDavis #MadMax #r4today

A Corbyn #Brexit would be the worst of all possible outcomes!‘An onslaught of new regulation would be forced upon UK businesses & banks under a Labour Government, Jeremy Corbyn will admit in a radical speech today’#LabourFail #TheCorbynCon
In 1983 Kinnock campaigned on a manifesto that pledged to #BREXIT from the EEC (EU) without a referendum.Now he wants a second referendum cos we didn't vote the right way in the first one. 
The English Home Office is instructing Scottish Residents, Scottish Citizens, to leave the Country after #BrexitThat’s right, the English are telling people WE accepted in Scotland to vamoose!A message to the Home Office, fcuk off! And when you get there fcuk, right off again
We're now entering #Brexit at ANY COST territory#Kate Hoey wants to tear up the #GoodFridayAgreement to ensure the Brextremists get their Hard BrexitI think there is a need for a cold, rational look at #brexit - It's not sustainable!#StopBrexit
This is an utter outrage and must not be allowed to happen. N.Ireland peace is not a Brexit bargaining chip. The UK also committed to protect GFA in the Phase1 #Brexit deal. If we go back on that why would any country in the world trust us to make agreements in future 
Dr Graham Gudgin - "What we are trying to do is present high-quality arguments in favour of #Brexit, many of which haven’t been made and don’t seem to get into the press or, in some cases, the BBC I’m afraid." #BriefingsforBrexit
John Redwood MP - "Britain knows exactly what Britain wants – we want to leave the EU, take control of our borders, our money, our laws and have a free-trade, friendly relationship with the EU, without being under their laws or courts." #Brexit

I think you need to rewrite the comment that #Brexit is “Britain’s biggest mistake since WWII” as it might look like you think we were mistaken in our WWII approach! Or do you think that? 
Not content with just being happy to wreck our economy, seems #Brexiteers like Paterson, Hannan & Hoey are prepared to even sacrifice the #GoodFridayAgreement to get destructive Hard #Brexit - that's called fanaticism & a total disregard for the people of Northern Ireland
53% of British companies think Brexit is good for Britain's prosperity - two-thirds of company bosses say they'd rather be out of the EU. - FTI Consulting poll.#Brexit #OpenBritain #GlobalBritain
Apparently 8,000 (EIGHT THOUSAND) bureaucrats have been recruited to Whitehall to deliver #Brexit at a time when the civil service was the smallest since WWII. If that's "taking back control" you can shove it. Imagine how many nurses that would pay for. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Julia Hartley-Brewer:I tell you what, paying £100bn, £40bn, £20bn…F*** off, frankly, F*** off… not a chance, not a single penny!UK a net contributor for 40yrs - 12% of #EU budgetThe idea we owe money for all our contributions I find absurd#Brexit
New British party inspired by Macron seeks to overturn #Brexit 
sick to the stomach listening to threats to peace here in NI because of #brexit & now the rhetoric being spoken by SF SDLP & Leo Varadkar about they will not except direct rule , what does that even mean "will not except" NI needs a budget & Westminster needs to deliver it now
Rather than acknowledge the stark, inherent contradictions of maintaining an open border in Ireland whilst leaving Single Market & Customs Union hardline #Brexiteers @OwenPaterson @KateHoeyMP & @DanielJHannan prefer to sacrifice Good Friday Agreement on altar of a hard #Brexit
owen patterson Dan Hannan and Kate Hoey as THE GOOD FRIDAY ARSONISTS BURN #BREXIT BURN 
@SiobhanFenton @DanielJHannan @tom_corby1 He's neither incompetent nor getting the facts wrong.He's producing fake news for his followers to believe & spread. This is new-school autoritarianism, Russian firehose style.Time to re-read your #1984.#Brexit #Minitruth #Ingsoc
Now @KateHoeyMP claiming the good Friday agreement isn't sustainable. She'd burn her own homeland down for #Brexit These hardline brexists are arsonists  
Good Friday Agreement is not threatened by #Brexit, simply because the EU was irrelevant to it.GFA signed 1998, enacted 1999.EU was a mere trading bloc until Lisbon enacted 2009.Therefore GFA had no reason to account for EU membership.This is not rocket science.
During our recent @cambridgeunion debate, it was a privilege to watch @MorrisseyHelena deliver a barnstorming speech in favour of #Brexit. This interview with @kalyeena continues to make the positive case for our future beyond the EU.
A crisis is what's happening to our #NHS, particularly in E&W. A crisis is the situation being created by #Brexit. #KFC running out of chicken is NOT a crisis. Get a grip #BBC. It can't possibly be a slow news day.
As Home Secretary Theresa May suppressed 9 reports proving immigration has little effect on jobs or wages. So, in effect, Theresa May lied in a way that she knew would boost support for #Brexit. Her lies should put her in jail. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Says here if #Brexit causes a border problem, it will be Ireland’s fault.Oh riight.  Like  Archduke Ferdinand was to blame for starting war in 1914 by getting in the way of an assassin’s bullet in Sarajevo. Obvious. 
We are leaving the EU and embracing the rest of the world. And we need to do both these things well if we are to make a success of #Brexit says @ShankerASingham #tradedebate
This disastrous government is paralysed by internal divides whilst @uklabour are failing to provide effective opposition, failing to vote against the government’s hard #Brexit. Parliament has a responsibility to lead the debate in relation to #Brexit

New British party inspired by Macron seeks to overturn #Brexit 
“They are leaving at an alarming rate”: European #NHS workers on the winter crisis, austerity, and #Brexit’s impact. “It’s a house of cards, and we’re getting closer and closer to the point where it’s all going to collapse.”
“The EU need our trade, they need access to our markets. We export far less than they do to us. They need a trade deal. "I have had it from the head of German industry, they need a trade deal more than we do because of the massive trade deficit." #Brexit

Brexiteers plot to ditch EU food & safety standards to stitch up dodgy trade deal with US post #Brexit. For small-scale farmers & food producers a threat to their viability.For consumers chlorinated chicken & hormone-reared beef. #BrexitReality

1) I lived through the Troubles, born NI in 1970.2) Nothing in the GFA is dependent upon EU membership.3) #Brexit is NO threat to NI peace.4) You're using the death of my countrymen as a political tool & it disgusts me, particularly given your leader is an pal of the IRA. 
WTF? Tory MP #CraigMacKinlay on #bbcdp again like he is a serious authority on #Brexit or anything. He is on trial on May 14th for #ToryElectionFraud & facing potential jail. Funny #BBC never mention this. And why keep having him on?
Michelle Barnier clarifying what the Lib Dems have been saying for months – there is no trade deal that can avoid all barriers to trade.  No such deal can make up for us leaving the customs union and single market.  #Brexit will be an economic catastrophe for the UK.

Worrying but unsurprising that gvt. sources said little had been decided after 2 recent cabinet Brexit committee meetings designed to find a common position on leaving the EU. The UK is being held back by Tory splits which are threatening our negotiating position with #Brexit.
Great words from inspiring young man @calummillbank.#Brexit is sucking the life out of Parliament & distracting us from tackling issues that will make a real difference like inequality, NHS crisis, housing, homelessnes, and the list goes on. #Brexit will only make us poorer.

Something going on in Tories re: #Brexit & UK: All this "Good Friday agreement has failed" spin coming from Brexiteers (Hannan, Paterson) not just abt Brexit but a right-wing xenophobic English nationalist version of Britain. Beware this rest of UK. And can Corbyn wake up fast?
Listened to a bit of @Jacob_Rees_Mogg yesterday on @LBC while fishing a pike match. It was just sickening to hear the leave callers going absolutely orgasmic with their support for him. Not a single one of them questioned the actual truth of #brexit.  Just speechless - #fbpe
Real British ultra nationalists are trying to unpick a peace treaty in the name of #Brexit, so David writes about Braveheart. We need much, much better than this.

I hope at today’s Labour frontbench #Brexit ‘away day’ the importance of safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement is weighed in the balance. As a minimum, Labour needs a crystal clear policy urgently backing permanent Single Market & Customs Union - votes in the Commons coming soon 
They never had a plan. They never thought they'd win. Look at their faces, they know what they've done, what they've said. They knew then what #brexit would mean - a disaster. 
There is no political or economic benefit to #Brexit. That is now clear to all including Brexiters. It's now time for rationality to take hold of govt and this fanatical nationalistic cult that controls the Tories to be consigned to the dustbin of history.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
And, yet, I don’t see farmers loudly demanding a change in tack by Tories on #Brexit - farmers should apply every ounce of pressure they can to  Scotland’s 13 Tory MPs who repeatedly vote for damaging ‘hard Brexit’ options, rather than their constituents’ wishes & best interests. 
A cross party Commons committee warns Brexit would mean a huge rise in food prices. No-one voted to be poorer @Labour4EU @labour4europe @London4Europe @EuroLabour #Brexit 
The number of Labour voters who voted remain vastly outstrips those who voted leave. Labour must take on board this rigorous research @Labour4EU @labour4europe @BestForBritain #Brexit 
Do you think selling off the NHS to US corporations and the return of a hard border in Ireland are a price worth paying to achieve #Brexit?
I'm less concerned about Corbyn's past than the fact that he & Mr Cleverly are both supporting #Brexit, which, if the US Mueller investigation is any illustration, was massively driven & secretly promoted by the Russians

There now seems a coordinated effort by brexiteers to end the "Good Friday Agreement" as @DanielJHannan joins other Tory politicians in publcly writing it off. #Brexit cldnt be made to fit the GFA, so itsn't Brexit that must find the compromise, but the GFA that must be destroyed

Tory and Labour's pro #brexit stance makes as much sense as driving a car into a wall at 100 mph,  not applying the brakes and just hoping it won't hurt too much.

I discussed #Brexit today with @AndrewMarr9. We must mitigate the negative consequences of it and build a close relationship. Citizens shouldn't pay the price. But first we must know what it is that the British Government wants! Share your thoughts here: 
Theresa May’s key demand over the terms of the transition period after Brexit would amount to a “demonisation” of EU citizens in the UK and will be rejected, the European parliament’s #Brexit coordinator, @guyverhofstadt has said.
It is not acceptable to alter EU rules on the free movement of people during any Brexit transition, the European Parliament’s co-ordinator @guyverhofstadt on #Brexit has warned. 
High time we united to make this known to the EU? - Brussels expects submission. The British do not submit! #BrexitNotSubmit#Brexit

While you've got Ruth Davidson on  might be worth asking her why she became unavailable to all broadcast media when they sought her about her views re #brexit impact assessments & the Scottish economy?  
Nearly 40 leading intellectuals have launched a campaign to back #Brexit, demanding an end to patronising “propaganda” that dismisses “leave” voters as “idiots”. 
It's about time that remainer Theresa May & her government realised that we are Great Britain and we are big enough and strong enough to leave the #EU and ALL of its institutions!RETWEET if you agree!! #Brexit 
Colour me totally unsurprised.  All those who voted Leave because they didn’t like TTIP & similar trade agreements could be in for a shock #Brexit 
Don't accept illegitimate #Brexit vote. If taxpaying 16-17 year olds, EU citizens and expats got vote in #EURef, we would not be leaving.No taxation without representation, it is the basic rule of democracy, did women's suffrage teach us nothing?!#FBPE#StopBrexit
"JUNCKER PLAN FOR WORLD DOMINATION" - Jean-Claude's shocking military statements in Munich yesterday. Full #Brexit story: 
When people talk about “rights” understand that the European Arrest Warrant #EAW removes the RIGHT of British citizens to habeas corpus, trial by jury and innocent until proven guilty, May’s support for its retention is a #Brexit betrayal. 
Whether they're for or against #Brexit ordinary Britons and other Europeans are already being forced to make life-changing decisions.AFP presents some of their stories: 
Chilling clarity - @iainmacwhirter on the threat #Brexit poses to peace in Northern Ireland: “Because the constitutional question was raised to a higher level [by being in the EU, with no border], both communities in Northern Ireland felt secure.” 
I'm still beating myself up for voting to Leave. I want to shout at all the idiots that are desperate for #Brexit to happen and ask them why they're being stupid but I can't because I was one of them once.  Over 600 MPs not doing a thing to stop this mess.

#bbcnews TheresaMay saying “ideology shouldn’t get in the way of cooperation in Europe”  ...err...  isn’t that exactly what #brexit is?
Make no mistake the Tories will sell out Britain with #brexit and all those who are for the social and economic status quo will enable it to happen even if they're for remain. 
Another of the real reasons for #Brexit:Make it easier to hire and fire people' and scrap corporation tax, says Sir James Dyson" #StopBrexit #FBPE
Two real reasons for #Brexit:The Tory Brextremists don't want Britain to have an economy that is really like Singapore's, for example with high levels of public housing. What they crave are the low taxes for the rich and the long working hours for the rest. #FBPE #StopBrexit
The Tory Brextremists don't want Britain to gain more sovereignty. They want the UK to be dominated by the US in a trade deal, and by the demands of multinationals & the super-rich as a price of investing here.That will give them their #BrexitTaxHaven.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE

HMS #brexit is becoming more like the Titanic everyday. Pride comes before a fall & the cliff edge is approaching. Paying a mortage, buy food every week, use the NHS, have a job relying on imports or exports, running a farm...? You'll be casualties to this idealistic dream.

Fascinating that the complexities of EU funding are reduced by twittering #Brexiteers to a single untruth ; that UK bears the burden of funding too many Brussels bureaucrats & ungrateful Eastern Europeans.  In fact , incontrovertibly, #Brexit will cost UK more than membership.
Since #EURef, the EU has taken on elements even pro-EU politicians spoke out against - moves towards an EU army, common Euro budget, and more. The EU we voted to leave has already disappeared. There is no going back now, there can be no reversal of #Brexit.

The U.K. remains committed to European security after #Brexit, said PM @theresa_may today at #MSC2018. See the full speech here: 
It's not up for debate.  If Corbyn believes in extending democracy to party members he'll set up a #Brexit policy commission.If not, he's an authoritarian fraud, and, like authoritarians before him, is just using "voice of the people" as cover for his own agendaThat's it

What spoke volumes in @Theresa_May's #Brexit security speech was what she didn't bother mentioning. She can't just cherry pick the hard-edged crime-fighting measures she wants to take from the EU - she has to bring home our crucial rights protections too.

A helpful reminder ahead of the #LabourParty #NPF discussion on #Brexit 
-@Der_BDI Director General Joachim #Lang: "British government has quite clearly lost all sense of time. Instead of specifying concrete proposals with regard to future relations with the continent, London is delaying making its position clear." #MSC2018 #Brexit 
Tory Brexiteers now declaring that an international peace agreement is over, without going back to the people who voted for it in a referendum, while at same time demanding EU signs up to an international security agreement. #Brexit getting crazier & scarier everyday 
Theresa May increasing stakes in #Brexit negotiations about internal security. Asks for new form of cooperation agreement and issues thinly veiled threat: failure to get bespoke deal will end internal security cooperation with „damaging effects for both sides“. #MSC2018
Did Theresa May really warn EU not to put ideology before citizens' ?What the fuck does the silly woman think her government is doing to the UK now?Fuck #Brexit safety 
The Tories would rather sacrifice peace in Northern Ireland than admit #Brexit is undeliverable. 
#Leavers now threatening civil unrest if they don't get their way. But what is their way, there seem to be dozens of different versions of leaving the EU upon which nobody agrees.May talks about uniting the country behind #Brexit. You'd have more chance unscrambling an egg.

Mueller's indictment describes Russian sockpuppets' "stated goal of "spreading distrust towards the candidates & the political system in general".Exactly what they were doing during the #Brexit campaign.Here's "David Jones", complete with Union Jack & 100K followers, on 22/6/16 
1. FGS the Govt pressing on with its intent to force #Brexit upon an increasingly reluctant ppl in the face of mounting evidence we are already being damaged, begs a question about their mental capacity. Both Govt & Opposition have a get out of jail fee card-a #FinalSay - use it!
Say what you like abt USA but at least their security/justice once they kick into action arent afraid to safeguard national interest. UK will never tackle Russian influence on referendum & we’ll carry out #brexit cos we’re too embarrassed to publicly admit we got played by Putin. 
Steve Edginton, 18, political blogger and owner of Youtube channel Politics UK, has dismantled the claim many people who voted in favour of #Brexit will be dead by the time the UK will have left the EU@StevenEdginton
Here is the ugly face of modern Tory unionism - ignorant of the complex fabric of the UK & embracing #Brexit vandalism & prepared to rip up such successes as the Good Friday Agreement. Take note Scotland this is Tory unionism. 
#Michael Caine says “I voted for #Brexit. What it is with me, I’d rather be a poor master than a rich servant. It wasn’t about the racism, immigrants or anything, it was about freedom.” This guy has his finger on the pulse - a man of the people in touch with the silent majority .
Angela Merkel called for a "fair balance" in the final Brexit deal but unfortunately Brexiteers didn't vote for balance - we voted out - and Merkel's idea of "fair" and mine bear no resemblance #Brexit
FBI indict Russians over US elections.The UK haven't even started an investigation over Russians involvement in the Brexit campaign.Why are our government through lack of action colluding with Russian interference in #Brexit ?
Just watched .@bbcnews usual pro Brexit spin from BBC Reporter.Truth though was evident from the terrible body language between Merkel and May.Frau Merkel is not for turning.#Brexit is bonkers.

.@Theresa_May's hopes of securing her preferred kind of #Brexit deal have been given a boost by Angela Merkel.The German Chancellor wants a EU-UK relationship "as close as possible" - a more positive outlook than previously presented by Michel Barnier.

Absolutely brilliant stuff from @StevenEdginton! Fantastic to hear a young Conservative Brexiteer on MSM cheering on #Brexit and putting an end to this nonsense that all young people are Leftie Remainers. Thanks to @JuliaHB1

As I was saying this morning - and have been saying for the last year. Germany's position on #Brexit won't change. 
“Is it possible to reverse Brexit?” by @anandMenon1 Very many words when the answer is simply: yes.The piece - like a lot of #Brexit commentary - assumes UK will be able to stick to the Article 50 timetable. I’m pretty sure it won’t.
UK car production down for first time since 2009 and investment down by >£500 million in last year. #Brexit and announcing we won’t be in the Customs Union is hurting the industry with @LandRover announcing that they are cutting down UK production due to #Brexit uncertainties.
As Merkel and May meet today: - Germany’s position on #Brexit won’t change:- ‘Going over the head’ of @MichelBarnier won’t work. He gets his orders from 27 EU heads of state.- Now contingent on the U.K. to lay out what it wants on future trade (beyond organic carrots.)
This statement by Jaguar Land Rover owner Tata Motors to the US Securities and Exchange Commission reveals exactly what they think of the effect of #Brexit on their business."There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully".source: 
An extract from '#Brexit: A Drama in Six Acts' by Paul Craig, St John’s College, Oxford."Moreover, they have endowed the country with productive human capital that would have cost the UK £6.8bn in spending on education" 
Thanks for having me - @ScotGov will do everything we can to try and help business through #Brexit uncertainty and confusion.

The #brexit referendum was the blackmailing tool Cameron used to succeed in renegotiation UK's position in the EU given that threatening withdrawal alone wasn't credible because of the enormous costs of exit. British public, you've been duped.

So, for all the talk of the “neoliberal” EU, our #Brexit pitch to poorer countries is that we won’t hold them to things like human rights, child labour, health and safety, in the way that the EU does. Is that what Global Britain is? Let’s have the #FinalSay on that. #StopBrexit

There is no deal to vote on - #brexit has already been voted on and that means no CU, no SM,  no ECJ, no FoM, no membership fees - NO EU! - anythinng less is not #BREXIT it's merely a total betrayal.

What a takedown of Boris by @OliverKamm. Also worth noting that there was not a SINGLE mention of Ireland/NI in Boris's big #Brexit speech yesterday - not one. 
The real fear now haunting Cabinet #Brexit zealots is that this idiotic displacement activity project will be scrapped and they'll have to get down to tackling the UK's deep-seated economic and social issues, for which they have no solution.
If you think #Brexit is a question of "domestic politics" after all this time, I'm afraid there's nothing I can do to help.

Americans know about Russia and #Brexit, I think. Do they know Russia has attacked each and every one of their allies? Attacked Spain, France and Germany, Hungary and Poland, in this same way? @PutinRF hates democracy. He must be removed. That’s step one. Just step one.
You rely on Remain warnings - dismissed as ‘Project Fear’ - to claim “it was said repeatedly that we would leave the Single Market” before the #Brexit vote, @tomhfh. Show me where YOU said it. I found no instance. Instead you were claiming we would be IN even after the vote.
So, Mundell's off to Japan and Ruth Davidson's in Afghanistan. Anything to avoid #Brexit analysis questions, it would seem.What next - Murdo Fraser in Outer Mongolia?Actually, on reflection that sounds pretty good to me.

How do people not see the connections between our ever-rising cost of living, our businesses insecurity, interest rate rise giving us even less money to spend (leading ultimately to economic downturn) and #brexit (which has not even happened yet) - or see them and care nothing? 
Brexit is a civil war and a second referendum is the only viable path to a lasting peace - by me #BorisJohnson #brexit #SecondReferendum
The Irish government has produced its own Brexit impact assessment. It says Irish GDP will lose 4.3% in a free trade deal and 7% in a WTO (no deal) scenario. This is the lunacy of #Brexit. We knew it damaged the UK economy.  Now we know it hurts the Irish economy too.
And well done to @tomhfh for setting out clear, concise and compelling reasons against #Brexit neverendums 
Well said @LowTaxChloe and everyday I speak to young people outside of the anywhere Uni bubble who want #Brexit not only to happen but happen now. 
Scottish exports to the Netherlands worth more than £2 billion a year are at risk because of #Brexit.
Had we had a vote, the result might have been different.So whenever I hear a UK politician take about "implementing the will of the people" it sticks in my craw. Brits in Europe are the UK citizen demographic most directly and profoundly impacted by #Brexit. /4

The smartest strategy for Sinn Féin, what will genuinely upset the applecart, is for it to put ideological objections aside for a strictly limited time, and take up its 7 seats in the House of Commons; cut May’s working majority from 13 to 6, with difficult #Brexit votes ahead.

#BorisJohnson romances a remainer #brexit 
Immensely disappointing collapse in the NI talks not only partly due to pressures of #Brexit but will also affect internal UK negotiations on #Brexit - no elected NI voice and DUP stranglehold over  @GovUK emboldens #Brexiteers in their undermining of devolution.
Uncertainty around EU #citizensrights is having a “devastating impact” on the #NHS.“In some hospitals, one in five NHS workers have EU passports - if there is a #Brexit cliff-edge in migration, it will be the NHS going over it”.
This is how @GovUK is seen from mainstream Ireland.  @DonnellyStephen is main opposition spokesperson on #Brexit

Leave the EU they said. Vote #Brexit they said. The European Union's a shrinking market they said. 
If stories are true of £100 billion #Brexit bill  how can the UK trust May/Johnson/Davis/Gove?
How many UK newspapers and media outlets will cover the news that #Brexit bill has secretly been upped to £100 billion and how many MPs will be aware?  My guess to both is zero.  Hope to be proved wrong.
Don’t need Bullingdon Boris lecturing me on #Brexit. The 48% will never accept it. Get over it Boris and admit it is an utter and total mess of your making. Give us a 2nd ref so we can start to undo the damage you and your Brexit flunkies have caused the UK.
I have no words to describe @BorisJohnson's #Brexit speech. 
Once again, the citizens of Northern Ireland have been failed at a time when critical decisions are needed on #Brexit #Health #Education #Legacy #Stormont 
Sounds like the EU27 have decided that the "'punishment clause" aka footnote No 4 in the draft #Brexit transition text published last week should be replaced with a less tough-sounding paragraph in the Withdawal Agreement that will refer to standard EU infringement process
Report out that real #Brexit bill is £100 billion 
Did Boris Johnson actually spell out what sort of #Brexit the government wants? Nope, thought not. It was a Boris speech about Boris's leadership ambition and Boris's ego. Boris bullshit basically.
We should not fear #brexit? - Dismantling of NHS - Our rights being stripped- Henry VIII powergrab- Human rights targeted - Dehumanization of our EU cits- Looming #BrexitFoodCrisis If you're not scared you aren't paying attention.#FBPE?
Boris Johnson gave a 4,600 word national address on #Brexit today. He didn't mention Ireland, or Northern Ireland, once. He did talk of stag parties in ancient cities and eye-popping activities by British citizens in Thailand. Insulting, reckless behaviour.

Hey Ireland.We gave you a £14bn bailout in 2008 & have been more than fair over repayment.88% of your energy comes from/via UK.You are worst hit by WTO tariffs of all remaining EU nations.Calm yer drawers on the anti-#Brexit rhetoric.
Boris Johnson's #Brexit speech mentioned:Irish border : 0 timesOrganic carrots : 6 times
UK taxpayers gave Ireland a backdoor bail-out of more than £14bn after the crash of 2008.We offer this kindness but Ireland then interfere in OUR EU Referendum.And why are they actively trying to use the border issue with N Ireland,to scupper #Brexit? 
Is there anything to be said for just  putting Sr. Michael in charge? #NIExecutive #ArleneFoster #StormontTalks #Brexit

Did Corbyn's animal welfare proposals mention the elephant in the room? #Brexit
The most worrying thing about the #BorisBrexitSpeech is that it was the PM approved start of @GovUK campaign to outline the  “road to #Brexit” yet it was fact free, vacuous and without any initiatives to resolve crucial areas like customs union & NI (which wasn’t even mentioned)

My take on #borisspeech is that as the tide is turning & more people are getting behind REMAIN & while #Brexit lies are slowly unfolding; Boris has only a small window to ride the Brexit wave into leadership of the Tories.

Boris J tries valentine offensive to prop up his failing attempt to grab PM role. Describing #Brexit as a “liberal” concept is as perverse as framing his period as Foreign Sec as being a success.  He is either misguided, delusional or foolish, perhaps all three at once
Europe's economy grew at 2.5% in 2017, compared to just 1.8% in UK. Before the #Brexit vote the UK was growing faster than the rest of the EU.  
Nail on the head. One of the best articles ever written on the looming catastrophe of #Brexit and why Remainers should never be bullied into submission.It’s worth reading and retweeting.
#Remain means the same thing to all, it is clear, it is concise, it is unequivocal.#Brexit means many different things to many different people.Even the government's MPs have opposing views on its final implementation.A vote on a fractured concept cannot be a valid mandate.

Boris Johnson's defence of #Brexit was incoherent mushIf Boris Johnson genuinely wants to win round Remainers he will have to do better than his speech this morning#StopBrexit #FBPE
'Here's something we agree on... a double referendum'Labour peer and remainer @Andrew_Adonis calls out Conservative's @johnredwood over his call for two #Brexit referendums before the process began. 
The government’s own impact analysis shows that Britain will be worse off in every sense post-Brexit.  We cannot allow @theresa_may to continue with her catastrophic hard #Brexit.  The public must be granted a vote on the deal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit
Those of us raising concerns are not ‘traitors’ or ‘mutineers’ blocking #Brexit but frankly urging Govt to come up with more than soundbites & to get on with the serious job of contingency planning with honesty & transparency
Boris Johnson managed to squeeze the words 'irenic', 'spitzenkandidaten', 'murrain', 'justiciable' into his speech. But while he was obfuscating loquaciously, he left us no clearer on resolving the intractable problems of #Brexit: the economy, citizen's rights, the Irish border..

Boris Johnson's #Brexit speech ends. BBC cuts straight to unrelated statement by Jean Claude Juncker, then the weather. You couldn't make it up.
This is one of Boris Johnson's best speeches. He highlights why Britain deserves to be a free global entity and not some kind of chattel, that the EU restricts access to in order to give them more importance.#Brexit 
The people overturned the Poll Tax because it was a hated Tory policy.The people will overturn #Brexit for the very same reason.
Boris Johnson’s #brexit speech was nothing more than a warmed leftover from the #EUref campaign. He just added more fluff. No new detail, none of the clarity everyone is screaming out for. Any deal must meet Labour’s tests...
Has Boris Johnson's speech made you change your mind about stopping #brexit?#FBPE
Johnson's major speech against the background of unaccountable, obscurely funded right wing think tank More evidence that far from the populace 'taking back control' #Brexit is being run by dark money from unknown beneficiaries 
#Brexit is "not about shutting ourselves off", Boris Johnson says, suggesting a new link could be built between Britain and France 
If Boris Johnson really wants to allay fears on economic impact of #Brexit he shd put the #impactassessments in the public domain & tackle their conclusion that disadvantages far outweigh minimal advantages of #Brexit. I’ve seen them. They’re dire.  #FBPE
So far Boris Johnson reassurance speech on #Brexit consists of the usual platitudes & a new bizarre argument that UK will continue to be engaged in Europe because people go on their holidays there. Pathetic #brexitshambles #FPBE

THREAD: 6 key questions Boris Johnson must answer in his speech on #Brexit today:1. Given staying in the Customs Union is the only way to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland, & coming out would threaten the Good Friday Agreement, why does he want to leave the Customs Union?

"If I hear one more time from the Labour front bench: 'We're not going to change until public opinion changes...'. Public opinion is not like the weather. The weather we can't affect. Public opinion we can affect by setting out an alternative." - @campbellclaret on #Brexit

Sorry @BorisJohnson, but you crossed a line with your lies in support of #brexit. Your scaremongering about Turkey was disgusting. Your betrayal of your country and those who believed you when you said £350m would go to the #NHS cuts too deep. No amount of speeches will save you.
Final Vote on the Deal? #BrexitPlease RT after you vote for a larger sample.

Let's be honest Boris, the only way to reunite the UK is to have a fact based final vote on the deal with the EU that includes an option to exit from #Brexit.
What British people fear the most about #Brexit that it's managed by one of the most chaotic Government of all time! #VictoriaLIVE

Once I get through the paywall I will read this. I’m not known for being silent on important #Brexit matters! 
More than 18 months on and my blood temperature still skyrockets every time someone says the #Brexit vote was 'the will of the people'. #fuckoffboris
Come on @jeremycorbyn, you can change the whole landscape of these #Brexit negotiations with just a few words and actions.  An embarrassing defeat for the government would go some way to stopping their catastrophic hard #Brexit. 
"It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled" - Mark Twain #Brexit 
Will somebody ask @BorisJohnson today why he’s still refusing to publish his own Government’s economic analysis illustrating the harm his version of #Brexit could do to livelihoods across the UK? Perhaps because he’s worried the public might change their minds? #FactsMatter
Like @ForBritainParty Lab say they will ban live animal exports for slaughter.Good.But they can't do that until we #Brexit and the #Blairites in the Lab party want to stop Brexit.

'Global Britain' will be rallying call for Boris today. The reality of course is that #Brexit will undermine British influence & trade across the world. The EU is a springboard to a Global Britain, not a barrier to it. 
I am wondering if Gov have ordered ships 2 protect UK fishing fleet, hired more border force, started implementing smart border for Ireland, in fact have they done anything in preparation for us leaving. If not, why not @Conservatives or are U focusing on scuppering #Brexit
Boris Johnson reaching out to Remain voters is like Mrs Brown’s Boys reaching out to Monty Python fans#Brexit#r4Today
Boris Johnson talks today about thwarting the will of the people. You can’t thwart the will of the people if they get to vote on the final #Brexit deal. Here’s why

Labour could condemn the tax-dodging #Brexit billionaire press campaign of hate and lies about the EU, immigrants and refugees that won the Brexit vote. But it can't because it supports Brexit. #StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON
#HappyValentinesDay to all my fellow saboteurs, #brexit-deniers, snowflakes, weasels and "remoaners". I appreciate you all!   
It's hard #Brexit that'd be disastrous. Employers don't care abt 'liberal' aspirations. They want to know if they can sell their goods easily or they will leave. That means staying in SM/CU/EEA/EFTA, not throwing away our current mkts for some vague ideological freedom! 
We are not 'former' #remainers . Truth, decency, common sense, a backbone & integrity means we will continue to fight the #brexit catastrophe. #FBPE #stopbrexit #ABTV #r4today
#BBCR4Today tells me that #Brexit's Liar in Chief, #BorisJohnson, will "reach out to remainers" in a speech later today.I'd rather be "reached" by bubonic plague.
I was at the #Brexit information evening at the UK Embassy in Berlin last night, made possible by @BritsinGermany & @BritishInEurope /THREAD
Irish Govt has lots more public info on #Brexit than the UK Govt has. Something telling & very wrong in that. 
Somewhere in the bowels of the #BBC is an interviewer waiting to burst on to the scene by taking apart a leading #Brexit advocate on air. Then, the current generation of #Brexit pussycat interviewers at the Beeb will be instantly ready for the knacker's yard.
The very same shysters who told the nation “don’t believe what Remain tell you; it’s project fear” are now unashamedly telling the same voters “you all knew what you signed up for; didn’t you listen to Remain?” #Brexit 
Just been on @BBCNewsnight. @DanielJHannan in a minority of one among Brexiteers arguing for immigration. Every day @GOVUK argues for more restrictions. Fundamental dishonesty (quelle surprise) from @BorisJohnson arguing #Brexit is a liberal project. It is all about barriers.
Daniel Hannan please note: this is the effect of the mere threat of #Brexit to British agriculture. This is but today's example. Similar instances pour forth in abundance every day. #Brexit is destructive to Britain. Full stop.#Newsnight
The mere idea of Boris Johnson presenting #Brexit as internationalist... isn't this the Foreign Secretary who has turned Britain into a laughing stock on every occasion he has stepped onto the world stage?  #Newsnight
This is apparently the first step in @GovUk “reaching out” to those still  opposed to #Brexit.  Maybe Boris not such a great choice to kick it off….

As I sit here, at a company gathering with my European colleagues - Italian, Irish, German, Dutch, French and Spanish, I am at a total loss to explain to them the madness that is #Brexit. Nothing I say sounds remotely rational. That's because nothing about it is... #StopBrexit
"One of the key benefits of #Brexit is no longer applying the EU’s Common External Tariff, which exports poverty to the third world," 
I honestly believe that the DUP would prefer direct rule from Westminster than let nationalists participate in a devolved government.I also believe their #brexit strategy is designed to put a hard border between NI and the Republic of Ireland.
Nigel Farage - "If the establishment do stop #Brexit from happening, I think you will find a very large number of people in this country who will be angrier than you've ever seen."

With only 51.9% in favour of #Brexit, unless you believe 96% of those were definitely in favour of leaving both Customs Union & Single Market then morally & intellectually both should at the very least be on the table for discussion.

To the Brexiters-since #Brexit, the pound has fallen to record lows against the dollar, inflation has risen to a 6 year high, meaning a sharp rise in prices and the UK is now one of the slowest growing economies in the G7 and European countries. What are the positives of #Brexit?
Irish PM Leo Varadkar has backed EU chief #Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, demanding “clarity and urgency" from the UK govt.“Time is running out. It's 20 months since the referendum, 20 years since some of them started campaigning, and we still don’t know what Brexit means.”

Congrats to @LBHF for becoming the first council in the UK to formally call on the government to give the people a vote on the #Brexit deal.  Hopefully other councils will follow and @jeremycorbyn will listen to members of his party
You demand that I respect your vote, because DEMOCRACY, and in the very next tweet say you believe #Brexit is JUST LIKE LEAVING A GOLF CLUB. Democracy depends on all of us taking our civic duties seriously enough to actively seek and critically assess information. I did. Did you?
The Sun reports that PM May intends to withhold UK contributions to the EU budget unless they have a veto over new EU laws during transition.This would severely increase the risk of a no deal #brexit

Tell me again how there was a lot of dishonesty on "both sides" of the #Brexit debate.For real. Where's the #Remain equivalent of these??
There will be a transition, there will be a deal, and the concessions the UK is making to get there will quickly be forgotten, just as the #Brexit bill row is already far behind us. 
Classic irreverent German carnival float about Theresa May and #Brexit in Dusseldorf #Rosenmontagszug
I'm wondering how many real #Brexit supporters there R? So many fake accounts, (often Far Right USA) being thrown at an ever growing number of real ppl supporting #Remain that I guess the only way to find out wld be to hold an actual Ref in 2018 & let the real voters vote.#FBPE

#Brexit is driven by English nationalism. But England's only identity is as ruler of Britain and Empire. So the fury of English nationalism is a seething rage against the knowledge that England must give up its identity in order to become a nation among others.#StopBrexit #FBPE
If everyone knew what they were voting for when they voted for #Brexit, then how come the Government still can't decide what it means 19 months later?
Brexiter: It's up to remainers to make #Brexit work.Remainers: We told you this can't workBrexiter: Get on with it and clear this mess up, it's not working because of you.Can you stoop any lower than blaming others for the mess you created it's pure cowardice. #StopBrexit
 @MhairiBlack: Labour’s backing for a job-destroying #Brexit deal is unforgivable. 
Confirmed: Brextremists want post #Brexit Britain to be a race to the bottom on workers' rights. This is not Project Fear it's #BrexitReality
A meaningful referendum on EU membership is held when a country has had a membership-long democratic debate on its position in the Union and not after years of fakenews-bashing and a 3 month campaign mired by scaremongering and disinformation #brexit
Hard #Brexit or Soft #Brexit: Make no mistake, the Tories see #Brexit as an opportunity to make us all work longer and harder for less.
That’s why MPs on both sides are examining the options & concluding EFTA & #CustomsUnion deliver #Brexit and secure our economy & GFA 
To a large degree #Brexit is about English nationalism, and for the English nationalists Ireland is a far away land of which they know little and care less.#StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON
Britain has traditionally played a blinder to get what it wants in the EU with diplomatic 'divide and rule' tactics with the 27. But with #Brexit and the Brexiters, we're playing 'divide and misrule' among ourselves.

Of course. If Britain decides and notifies before March 31st 2019 that it does not want to leave, that’s enough: #Brexit van be cancelled by a single letter. It’s in the end of the day a political, not a judical decision.

There are two reasons for this ridiculous @DanielJHannan statement 1. to whip up anti European sentiment & 2. to cover up the disaster that is #Brexit as somehow being "Europes fault". 
The cost to our economy of leaving the #singlemarket & #customsunion, (8%GDP, according to the govt’s own figures) is enough to pay for:     - a million extra doctors      - 500,000 social homes or - our entire education system .#BrexitImpact #brexit

As #LittleEngland drags Scotland into ‘splendid isolation’ Ireland integrates further with #EU buildng infrastructure for massive trade boom  England using #Brexit to  asphyxiate Scotland, and Scottish Labour&Scottish Tory willingly supplying the tourniquet
 WATCH: This morning I was a guest on @BBCOne for the @MarrShow - I was interviewed about #Brexit as well as the the crisis in funding local government services following the effective bankruptcy of Northamptonshire this week. 
The aviation sector must be prioritised in #Brexit negotiations.  The Government must stop and take notice or there will be significant consequences for the UK, such as the increased cost of flying. 
Last week, three separate polls from three separate companies were published. They all told the same story. Support for Mrs May & the @Conservatives is increasing. Support for Corbyn & Labour is in decline. People just want the govt to get on with #Brexit.
"The idea that we can’t do better as a free trading maritime country, making our own trade deals and bringing benefits to people in this country I think is incredibly defeatist." #Brexit 
#EFTA may not be perfect but it would be less harmful than a walk-away, no-deal hard #Brexit and it should be considered as the best route for transition. Link here for info from Commons Library 
"If we stay in the customs union, how will we have any influence? That means we are giving Brussels total control of our trade policy, but we are no longer EU members so we have no input ourselves." #Brexit 
The majority of MPs from across the Commons just want to make sure the North East & the rest of the country for that matter, isn’t brought down by a fantasy hard #Brexit

Chukka says in one breath #Brexit is bigger than party politics and then in another, that he can’t see Labour MPs voting on the final deal in the same lobby as Tory MPs Remain MPs are contrary and incoherent - a deliberate tactic - they confuse in order to deceive 
The Referendum:1. Wasn’t a General Election but a lifetime’s imposition.2. 17.4 million took a decision affecting an electorate of 46.49 m or 37.4%3. 62.6% of the electorate DID NOT VOTE TO LEAVEUse this as a template In realising why a lot of remainers feel angry. #Brexit

So, the EU are worried that a soft Irish border will create a situation where EU citizens can walk across into 'tax haven' UK and buy goods without the external tariff applied, thus undermining the 'Single Market'Oh well #Brexit #Irexit
A helpful reality check for those discussing #Brexit - free trade between U.K.+ EU is important and can be maintained through #Brexit - but only if Britain chooses to prioritise single market trade in negotiations 
Please lawd, get us over the line with #Brexit, so I don't have to hear the irrelevance of Anna Soubry on my TV any more.Obscurity & anonimity suited her well before, let her return to it.#BrexitPrayer

Excellent to see @ChukaUmunna and @Anna_Soubry working together. There's a real risk for May & Corbyn that MPs working to put national interest first on #Brexit discover they have much more in common with each other (& with @libdems) than with their own party leaders.

Join me LIVE on Facebook for a Q&A at 13.30 from @LiberalBritain #LaunchpadNorth in Sheffield. @thomasbrake will follow me with a #Brexit Q&A
More numbers leaked from the govt’s #Brexit impact study this week, showing a nationwide decline in growth under every possible Brexit scenario. Hugo Dixon writes why this should make Corbyn act and come out against Brexit. 
Not ONE of these angry, hysterical tweeters has been able to answer the question:‘HOW can @UKLabour STOP #Brexit?’Lots of hypotheses & noise around the Q, nd frothing at the mouth at their perception of Brexit, but not a single person has given a credible answer.Funny that.
.@SteveNickSmith is smoke.Cons are tearing themselves apart over #Brexit...and 5 minutes away from dethroning SECOND woman Leader..while she is PM.If the press and media didn't give them cover, they'd be goneThey created this mess because of their own internals.#BrexitIsTory

Jacob Rees-Mogg, Theresa May, David Davis, Liam Fox and all the govt Brexiteers need to read this thread from a British exporter. The damage that #Brexit will cause to British business and all those employed therein will be insurmountable. 
Cost to send an email: £0Cost to send a letter: £985.50When it came to triggering Article 50, the Government started the #Brexit process as it meant to go on - by making serious losses for the British taxpayer!

Just back from Dublin. Politicians and business all warned how a hard border on the island of Ireland would put stability and Good Friday Agreement at risk. Vital we remain in the Single Market and Customs Union post #Brexit for future of Wales, UK and Ireland
Regardless, of the #Brexit argument, I genuinely don’t understand how Leavers can square their fury at @georgesoros getting involved with their apathy towards non-British @rupertmurdoch and his pro-Brexit papers. Genuinely baffled
Brexiters want to return (via #Brexit Empire 2.0) to a golden era of UK trading with non-European countries to a greater extent than it does now, but it has only ever existed in their imaginations. Only way to avoid the consequences of their delusions is an #ExitFromBrexit
If a story puts @realDonaldTrump or #Brexit in a poor light, it is news & will lead news bulletins until they get some more fake news that is anti #Trump or anti #BrexitIf a story reflects well on #Trump or #Brexit it is ignored because it is not in line with the MSM narrative.

We need a proper process to debate #Brexit within our party so we can win the argument in the country. Two hours of discussion at the National Policy Forum next week is wholly inadequate - it’s as simple as that. 
Next weekend Labour members will meet in Leeds for the National Policy Forum. They will spend 2 hours on #Brexit & then put it back in the “too difficult” box. It’s not good enough - support @laboursinglemkt call for a dedicated policy commission

If Northern Ireland stays in single market, Wales must get the same deal. We mustn't be treated any different. #Brexit
Daily Record shackles Scots to Tories ankles so we get dragged of #Brexit cliff with Little England, and they show mock outrage 
Still no united cabinet on #Brexit. The sense of frustration at weak PM and paralysed govt is palpable. A hopeless administration with no leadership, direction or power. How can they  expect to speak on behalf of the country, when they can’t speak on behalf of themselves? #FBPE

#MyFoMValentine   On Valentine's Day, spare a thought for our fellow EU citizens. #Brexit will break up families and break hearts.  Don't let this be the end to their Freedom of Movement love story: 
This means that the stage 1 #Brexit agreement cannot be ratified. It depends on the UK honouring its promise of no border checks between Northern Ireland and Ireland, a promise it cannot deliver since May rules out membership of the single market and customs union.A key moment. 
"Once again, it is important to tell the truth. A UK decision to leave the single market and the customs union would make border checks unavoidable.": @MichelBarnier The UK govt being told, fairly & squarely, Fess Up.Pretty humiliating, this. #Brexit 
Fantastic!Barnier may REJECT 'Transition'"If these disagreements persist transition is not a given.To be frank I'm surprised by these disagreements.The positions of EU are very logical”UK position also very logicalWe want OUR country back!#Brexit
.@BorisJohnson .@michaelgove .@DavidDavisMP have consistently understated the problems caused by #Brexit on the Irish border.  It is time they came clean and admitted there will be controls on or close to the border. This will put the whole peace process at risk.
We're proud to support our friends @BestForBritain. The fact that the pro-#Brexit lobby are now resorting to gross misrepresentation and thinly-veiled antisemitism shows how desperate they are  Together we will #StopBrexit! #FBPE

.@NicolaSturgeon: If Northern Ireland stays in single market, Scotland must get the same deal #Brexit 
1. Quite evidently there are real problems between the UK Govt & the EU..the former trying to weasel out of the December draft agreement...appalling that one has to rely on @MichelBarnier for the real facts behind this #Brexit debacle & can't trust one's own Govt.
.@MichelBarnier has said that a hard border is inevitable if we leave the Customs Union. He best get some proposals ready then instead of leaving it to the #UK all the time!#Brexit 
Turns out that the long grass was, predictably, much shorter than May had hoped. So, now what? #Brexit 
Yes, indeed. There's a row because UK wants to opt into NEW EU laws, tightening integration between UK and EU police, security and courts, during the transition, and the EU doesn't want to let them. #oppositesday #brexit
Michel Barnier speaking just now on #Brexit: "I don't understand some of the positions of the United Kingdom."Neither do we mate, neither do we.
A UK decision to leave the single market and customs union would make border checks in Ireland "unavoidable" - EU negotiator Michel Barnier gives an update on #Brexit talks 
That Barnier fellah is a bit arrogant.UK media are there to polish his pompous ego, as they sit on the side of the EU.There will be no EU annexation of the UK during this Transition, or we'll be having none, thanks.#Brexit.
The EU and UK have "substantial" disagreements on transition, says Barnier. "If these disagreements persist the transition is not a given." He repeats this line twice, once in French, once in English, to make the point. #brexit
@MichelBarnier in press conf at end of this week’s #Brexit negotiating round: « La transition n’est aujourd’hui pas acquise » « The transition is not a given » 
Very good meeting this morning with @DLidington in Dublin - big focus on #Brexit and protecting Irish-British relations

This is absolutely explosive news: „EU expects & will ensure that  Northern Ireland remains in Customs Union & Single Market after #brexit ). We‘re reaching the point brexit choices can’t be fudged or delayed anymore. UK politics about to get interesting. 
From today’s @timesredbox:Only 6 per cent of people who voted Leave now think it was the wrong decision. Exactly the same proportion of people who voted Remain now think #Brexit is the right decision.
So the Sun and the Mail joining Farage and the Telegraph on the Soros/Lizard #Brexit 'secret plot'Demonisation and Demagoguery The press has genuinely lost the plot and is an active threat to decency and democracy

EU citizens! Yet more evidence of the shocking growth of far right nationalism and xenophobia in the UK since #Brexit. Worse, over 80,000 of them will gather in a meeting tomorrow, singing nationalist songs. This is what we in the EU have been working to stop since 1945. 
Imagine these arrangements had been made in RussiaFor citizens to read govt documentsThere would be outcryBut these documents are in the UK regarding #brexit&the "citizens" are our elected politiciansIts like being a colony of a banana republic.
.@jeremycorbyn ‘planning coup’ against @theresa_may, telling Brussels he envisions ‘very different’ #Brexit

The Tories’ divides would usually be enjoyable, if this wasn’t the biggest issue the UK has faced in modern times. Hammond is calling for a ‘very modest Brexit’, whilst Rees-Mogg says the UK will become a ‘vassal state’ and is calling for the hardest version of #Brexit
I went to see the #BrexitPapers yesterday - very grim reading.  Politicians need access to this information to properly represent constituents. Disgraceful that MSP colleagues are having to fight to see them on the same terms as MPs  #Brexit #BrexitChaos
If I thought walking out with the papers would change history I would have. In terms of content, imagine failed 1st yr economics assignment. Lots of sentences- some even joined up! Few numbers & those already public. #Brexit impact ranges from complete disaster to utter meltdown. 
Lots of Labour people getting in touch this morning to add their support to our call for a proper #Brexit debate in @UKLabour - the latest being the excellent @RupaHuq - make your voice heard too: 
Our Japanese car manufacturers say that when they located here as a gateway to exporting cars to Europe they were assured by previous Tory Governments that we would never leave the #EU.What's Japanese for 'Never trust a Tory'? #r4today #Brexit #bbcnews

Our Party DNA is to bring together members and supporters to develop policy. It's high time we had a proper debate in @UKLabour about #Brexit. Please take a moment to add your voice here  
Barnier is happy to indulge Corbyn by being seen with him, to enrage British negotiators & undermine May. But he'll struggle to get a #Brexit position out of him. If Corbyn ever gets off the fence his party’s unity AND support will collapse #TheCorbynCon
All aboard the gravy train. The gross extravagance of #EU politicians. “These people are not accessible and they are not accountable.” Thank goodness for #Brexit. 
A good summary from @claireperrymp  on #BBCQT on the incorrect #Brexit economy reports.She points out that the reports do not reflect the deal the government want and fail to take into account other details. She also deals with a heckling @terrychristian very well.
#BBCqt audience member says the country is united behind #brexit, let's get on with it. Can someone please let him know that actually a higher percentage of ppl are now in favour of a 2nd ref than voted to leave? 58% to 42%: 
I think the title of 'Remainer Of The Week', has got a new contender... Take a bow 'Terry Christian' . #Brexit #BBCQT
Must listen from @ticerichard on #BBCQT on the scaremongering #Brexit reports released this week.He points out that they cannot be believed & were written by the same people who wrongly claimed that there would be more unemployment, be a recession etc and the opposite happened. 
So glad Terry C on #bbcqt - he is such a perfect embodiment of anti #Brexit contempt for democracy/audience/his fellow panellists that he exposes what is at heart of so hard line Remain argument
Germany exports 5 times what we do to China I’m sick of listening to Bollocks We can trade with who we want to now #bbcqt #brexit Stop fucking lying to the country
Terry Christian is really doing his enthusiastically pro-EU campaign no good at all. Awful behaviour this evening. Spending more time attempting to belittle audience members than actually provide an argument. Yawn. #brexit #bbcqt
Emily Thornberry should get her own party to sort out its #Brexit policy before criticising other parties' policies #BBCQT
The brexiter on #bbcqt "we should have some faith...."You mean like voodoo or necromancy?I prefer analysis by experts.#Brexit
Well said @terrychristian on #bbcqt :#brexit is simple...only for simple people. Struggling to recall Richard Tice or anyone else from #LeaveEU telling British public about "benefits" of having Irish border reinstated or UK financial sector losing EU trading passports.
Terry Christian called ppl who voted out 'simple'. Most ppl that voted out were working class. Good luck with any career you have left you tit! #bbcqt #Brexit

Unbelievable. Even after 2 days of special meeting, the government has STILL not managed to decide what it wants in #brexit negotiations , 20 months after referendum, while costs of #BrexitReality become clearer by the day.
Typical interview conducted by the obvious remainer @faisalislam . @Jacob_Rees_Mogg was able to answer an off the cuff interview in clear easy to understand language which demolished the @SkyNews bias. Wonderful, #Brexit 
#Brexit: Japan's man in UK says unprofitable firms could not stay. - Just to remind everyone we have an EU trade deal with Japan already. If we leave the EU we lose it and probably most Japanese companies with a base here. Madness

Something stands out in this Daily Mail headline: Tory MP Henry Smith saying Soros should stop telling the UK to remain under EU yoke. The claim that there is a EU 'yoke' is a lie, the kind of big lie told by totalitarian regimes. #LeaveLies#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit #WATON
.@PhilipHammondUK calling for a ‘very modest Brexit’ is another example of this dysfunctional gvt. The fact that he is the Chancellor of the Exchequer however, should demonstrate that he knows that the economic impacts of #Brexit would be catastrophic. @theresa_may must listen.
Nigel Farage is complaining about Soros representing foreign interference in our politics. Here's Farage with Murdoch whose toxic foreign interference in our politics can be seen across Britain every day. And some other Murdoch graphics.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit #WATON
When I picked up the @Telegraph this morning, my reaction to the front page was one of irritation. The more ppl focus on trying to stop #Brexit, the more anyone asking questions about how to deliver it gets bound up with these folk. It's. Happening. Energies better spent on how
.@DavidDavisMP quite rightly saying that the #EU’s behaviour is discourteous and that threatening the UK over #Brexit negotiations is not acting in good faith. The UK continues to be polite whilst the EU continues to undermine us. I think it’s high time we got a lot tougher! 
Dear Remainers thanks for all the aggression and insults over the last few days, however, I still do not want to remain in a United States of Europe. #Brexit
Fraser why don’t you read @ScotGov published evidence to the Migration Advisory Committee & our recent #Brexit paper.  EU migration is not the “import of low skilled workers “ and you can’t , for example ,  replace research scientists with the “unemployed & underemployed” 
Labour voters could not be clearer: #Brexit is a tragic mistake. Having the courage to change Labour policy and make the case for full EU membership is in the national interest and the party's interest. 
.@DavidDavisMP on the #Brexit proposal from the #EU where they implied that they could punish the #UK during a transition period.He hits out at the #EU & refers to them not issuing the document in good faith, being discourteous & not being ‘conducive to working together.’
Alastair Campbell is no better than Tony Blair ... Both are War Criminals who should be standing in a doc instead of being paraded on TV and radio trying to derail brexit ! #WarCriminal #brexit
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "If you want to buy a Toyota that is made in Japan you have to pay 12% more than if you buy a Peugeot that probably wouldn’t work. We should be out of the customs union and we should be a proper free trading Nation." #Brexit 
Nigel Farage - "We had a referendum on this and we voted to leave the single market. That should be the end of the conversation. "There is a great tradition in Brussels of never accepting a 'no' result but this time, do you know what? We actually mean it." #Brexit 
NOTE to David Davis #bbcnewsWe are NOT stupid !How could the *assessment forecasts* model Govt position on #Brexit *end state* - when you DON'T know yourselves & you CAN'T reach agreement on !STOP treating us like idiots !
Putin fears & loathes Soros due to his efforts to build democracy in Eastern Europe. No surprise then that RT a year ago and the Russian Embassy today have attacked Soros, or that Farage joined in. But disgraceful that the Telegraph has joined the fray.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit

The environmentally damaging #HeathrowExpansion is put into doubt by #Brexit. With disastrous economic impacts, with the likelihood of business going elsewhere, it raises questions of whether the expansion, which was meant to make Britain the hub of Europe, still makes sense.
Given that #Brexit, by the government's own analysis, is bad for Britain, anyone still orchestrating it's implementation, should be removed from office as they fail the first duty of an MP. 
So, the BofE raised their growth forecast for 2018 by 0.2% from 1.5% to 1.7% and it gets hidden half way through the page by #BBCNews and the headline is "interest rates to rise" along with "you're doomed, mortgage rates will rise" spin.I blame #BrExit.#BBCDP

Head of Public Engagement Ryan Feeney was delighted to welcome Minister Shailesh Vara, MP, this morning for a briefing with some of our #Brexit experts, including @DPhinnemore and @hayward_katy.
This whole #Brexit process has been a shambles.  Our weak leader has shown her incompetence in leading this country. I thought #Brexit was meant to “take back control”. We have an ineffective government, paralysed by monumental divides.
I concur. #Brexit such an overriding issue that must transcend party politics.However one result has been good decent people in Labour & Tories & @LibDems discovering they’ve more in common with each other, than with May and Corbyn & their brexiters.I wonder where that’ll lead?
I’ll repeat: the German car manufacturers won’t be delivering the cake and unicorn model. Also, Germany’s position on #Brexit won’t change. @IanKingSky @SkyNews

Translation: for Nigel Farage to receive payments from Russian state via Putin propaganda organ RT is totally fine but if a Jew transparently donates money to an advertising campaign this is wrong. #brexit swimming in very dodgy waters now. 
Secret govt analysis shows a no-deal Brexit would blow an £80bn hole in the public finances:  That's only if the govt slashes regulation to save £40bn, including on the environment, which the government had said it will not do. #fbpe #UKtoStay #brexit

After seeing the impact of various #brexit scenarios on the regions, I am surprised that today, there are not multiple marches converging on London to sack parliament. A small group of loons, supported by a right-wing media cartel are marching the UK into the grave. While we wait
Either he's deliberately lied, or the Secretary of State for Scotland is so far from the process/insignificant/out the loop that he hasn't been trusted with the information. Either way, it brings his position into question. #Brexit 
When will you get the message that by voting through #Brexit you will be trashing UK economy & ensuring far greater cuts. You're a good man Andrew but this is close to hypocrisy @Labour4EU @EK_EuropeanMove
#Brexit supporters are behaving as a religious cult; their belief system, based on zero evidence, doesn't allow them to think they may be wrong on ANYTHING & everyone who argues against them is an unbeliever who needs stoning!
What’s that? I thought Labour were a government in waiting?Oh I get it now. People are tired of rhetoric from Labour and actually see the @Conservatives governing. Whilst Labour get splinters from the #Brexit fence & big financial holes appear in their spending pledges. 
Thinking of all the £millions, the energy, effort, going in to make #Brexit happen, then hearing senior social care folk in bits about unprecedented budget cuts, decimating services for those in desperate need, my heart breaks.
Since the 1950s the UK’s choice has been the EU or the USA. Sensibly we chose Europe at least until last year. We’re now getting a preview of what Brexit - the American choice - would look like  @Labour4EU @labour4europe @London4Europe #Brexit

All credit to @afneil ( not something I have said often) for laying bare the nervous evasions of a @GovUK Trade Minister who is terrified of saying anything about #Brexit in case it is the wrong thing and ends up looking and sounding ridiculous .

So the #Brexit analysis clearly shows that it will only add to economic inequality across the UK. The North, Scotland and Wales take the hit hardest. Tory policy damaged those areas so much in the 80s now they are planning to do the same again  
If you voted for #Brexit you voted for a worse standard of living not only for yourself, but for the next generation. A disgraceful, pitiful decision based significantly on your inability to live alongside other cultures.
"For the purposes of the treaties, during the transition period, the parliament of the United Kingdom shall not be considered to be a national parliament"- Actual wording drafted in the EU transition terms. We are to become a vassal state.#Brexit 
This is devastating on #Brexit: "One region which voted overwhelmingly to leave the EU would suffer a 16% hit to economic growth in event of no deal". We cannot stand by & let this happen. Sign up for the #GreatNorthernMarch here:

"Do you think #Brexit will have a positive or negative impact on people like you, or will it make no difference?"Britain, basically, in a chartYouGov Feb 1 2018 
Anbody else have the feeling that the Oxford English Dictionary is running out of words to describe the madness that is #Brexit?
Look at this for a laugh - Richard Leonard, who voted to support triggering article 50 thinks he can con you into believing that a Corbyn-led Labour hard #Brexit will save us from the horrors of a Tory hard brexit. You couldn't make it up. 
Nobody voted to launch the country into depression. Article 50 is revocable, EU leaders have been clear on that & common sense should prevail. The majority of the country didn't vote for brexit, that's a distortion of the result. We have a democratic right to oppose #Brexit 
The loss to GDP in the North West of England according to the Government's leaked #Brexit assessments:2.5% - Single Market8.0% - Free Trade Deal12.0% - No Deal

Dave Brown asks “Is there light at the end of the #Brexit tunnel..?” - Political Cartoon Gallery in Putney 
This is one of the most shocking recent surprises from #brexit:with CBI and now BCC taking a clear stand and clearly no support in parliament for a hard brexit, why it is still being discussed? Who props this government? Can it be just the media?  Asking for a friend. 
No @scotgov voice in trade deals! Fear is US Healthcare companies could challenge Scottish border as non-tariff barrier to try and force their way in. Cameron refused to rule NHS out of #TTIP & @theresa_may doing same with Tory-Trump Trade Deal! Cos = Tory #NHSEndGame #Brexit

A story in four acts #brexit 
My constituents have a right to know how the various #Brexit options will affect them. The Govt must publish their analysis now
1/ Trying to follow what's going on in  &amp; #Brexit news feels like a full time job. And yet even against that backdrop, today feels pretty extraordinary. Some of the news has particular impact on me personally.
Ian Paisley MP - "It’s about time the Government demonstrated a no surrender attitude to the EU bureaucrats who try to blackmail us, bully us over air flights, passenger and everything else." #Brexit 
So the Westminster #brexit damage impact study for Scotland is worse by 0.5% than the Scottish Governments study that scots tories called scaremongering. I wonder what @RuthDavidsonMSP has to say about that?
This might sound over simplistic; but would it not have been a better idea to have done the #Brexit impact assessments BEFORE we had the referendum?
Broadly speaking, the more a region voted for #Brexit, the harder it will be hit. Seldom have so many been so beguiled by so few. 
You know what ?I think I MUST be incredibly DIM.IMHOThe empirical evidence re the advantages of remaining in the SM & CUis PLAIN for all to seeThere is NO concrete evidence to the contraryTory #Brexit is a leap in the dark - a leap of faith - and faith is BLIND.
Big up #CheddarMan the first known Briton was black so all u anti immigration white nationalists when u lot leavin?  #Brexit

Credit where due @afneil. Fierce interviews today expose what an incoherent policy shambles both Labour & Gov are in over #Brexit. Well worth watching. Try not to despair! 
Devastating impact on incomes, jobs and ultimately for the revenues we need for NHS & public services - hitting Midlands, north and Northern Ireland especially hard. The public have a right to know, and a right to reverse this if they wish. Nothing need be inevitable. #Brexit 
Oh look, the place where are all the decision makers live actually benefits from a No Deal #brexit. Meanwhile the regions, including mine are absolutely fucked. 
The Tory gvt. is playing down the impact of #Brexit on the Aviation Industry.  Ryanair, EasyJet and their passengers rely on easy access to other European countries and the future of that is in doubt. The gvt. is leaving the airlines in the dark over #Brexit and need clarity.

The secrecy around #Brexit, the public denigration of evidence, and the intimidation of opponents are all familiar from authoritarian regimes, says @MollyMEP. 
"The biggest reason given for voting for #Brexit was a desire to #takebackcontrol – and I’d say people wanting to do that are absolutely right. But the problem of lack of control is centred on Westminster, not Brussels."

Vince Cable asks the PM to give an "absolute guarantee" that access to the NHS for American companies is excluded from future trade talks with the US#Brexit #PMQs 
Hilary Benn says remaining in a customs union with the EU would help keep an open border in Ireland, and asks why Theresa May is "so opposed to it" #Brexit #PMQs 
In the GE2017, unlike all the other parties, May campaigned on a single issue. She asked for a mandate to deliver #Brexit. May got 42% of the vote and lost her majority.The country was not and is not united in wanting #Brexit. It is not the will of the people.#StopBrexit
At #PMQs, Theresa May completely failed to rule out opening up NHS to US companies in a US-UK trade agreement. People were told there'd be more funding for NHS, not more US privatization. If that's the reality of #Brexit, everyone can ask if it's the right path for the country.
#PMQs ...did everyone hear what I just heard from May about the US & #OurNHS . She basically confirmed that she will be putting it on the table in the #Tories #Brexit fire sale. FFS.
Join our Pro-EU demo outside the Cambridge Union at 6.45pm tomorrow to show Jacob Rees-Mog that we don't just reject his hard #Brexit, we reject ANY Brexit!  @Scientists4EU @mikegalsworthy pls RT. #StopBrexit #FBPE

My cartoon Wednesday @TheTimes on #Brexit fudge cake.... 
Look. I voted remain but I won’t hear about another vote because that’s not a democracy. Disagreeing with over half of the voting country doesn’t mean they’ll magically go away. It’s a litmus test for a future we should all engage in. #Brexit
#Brexit Quiz part two:1. How many free trade deals with 60+ non-EU countries will UK automatically keep if leave CU/SM?EEA?EFTA?2. How many new free trade deals is UK ready to sign >Mar2019?3. How many countries will UK have FTAs with post hard-BrexitAnswers: 0,0,0
Which goes to prove the undemocratic, subversive nature of those colleagues, debasing our democracy using such terms in order to cow any dissent or debate & any right to defer from their view. This #Brexit isn't about the Will of the Ppl but about forcing their Will upon the Ppl
This is the secret door behind which are held the secret reports published by Buzzfeed. The reports confirm sectorally and regionally and whether the UK goes for an EEA, FTA or WTO #Brexit is bad for everybody. #FBPE
 Almost 30 years ago, it was #MargaretThatcher who warned the quails, oh pardon, the leaders of Europe, that the fate and well-being of Britain is not just in the European Union. #Britain #Brexit 
Forget about Russian meddling or US companies pushing fake and ‘dark’ news on the internet to influence the Brexit vote. It's been our own #Brexit billionaire press that's been peddling most of the fake news. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit #WATON
We have published the draft legal text on transitional arrangements to be included in the #Article50 Withdrawal Agreement →  #Brexit 
I'll be honest. I never thought the British people would be crazy enough to actually carry out #Brexit. But this control of our nation's direction now being led by the ERG/Rees-Mogg, with no credible opposition present. For the first time I'm really worried about our future #fbpe
The political motives for a "clean" exit from the single market  laid bare following revelations that a prominent Brexiteer is also a major shareholder in an emerging markets investment firm  #Brexit #JacobReesMogg
The @IrishTimes does not mince its words this morning - and who could disagree ? #Brexit 
Your periodic reminder: #Brexit transition is Today’s legal proposal confirms it: But  triggered Art 50 too early, now needs to buy , so transition is what you get.(There is of course another way… extend #Article50)
The first sign of a dictatorship is when all mainstream media reports in exactly the same way on key issues. That's what we are seeing in Britain now whether it's about #Brexit , #Trump , #Russia or pretty much everything else. Cover-up of domestic corruption is rife too.
"Have European citizens ever been asked if they want to be represented by a trans-national list?Again, the answer is No.”“We’re looking at a top-down, elite-driven project.Power without responsibility, so where are the checks & balances?” #Brexit #EU
In spite of @michaelgove's clear statement that the UK Gov will maintain farm payments post #Brexit, the SNP Govt have totally failed to make similar commitments, or make any plans at all.#Scottish farmers are being let down by the SNP (Again)

You can have the NHS or #Brexit . You cannot have both. £300 million per year spent so far on 10,000 extra civil servants to deliver Brexit. A&Es around £200 to £300 million short to cover the winter crisis this year. Wake up @theresa_may and @jeremycorbyn

Have you lot stopped #Brexit yet or are you all lazing about again?  I'll be catching up on news today and I'd better like what I see.  Don't make me come back there.
The hard left are the same as the hard right insofar as - they both think facts don't matter- they both think they are special- they both see #brexit as an opportunity for THEMSELVES- they are both putting party before country 
Brexit: turning the screws - As the Brexit debate in the UK internalises, the EU is quietly turning the screws, seeking to lock the UK into the most abject state of subordination during the transition period that it is possible to imagine...  #Brexit.

I still can't get my head around the idea that #Brexit will return powers of lawmaking to parliament. When the #Tories want to implement the 'Henry the 8th clause'. Which will remove the power of law making from parliament & put it into the hands of individual ministers. #Idiots

One day, surely, we'll all wake up from this #Brexit madness and find it was a nightmare.It cannot be a reality, that the UK's most senior politicians have so little understanding, that what they keep promising cannot be delivered in the way they claim. Can it?
#BrexitBrexiteer, we'll be like Norway.Realist, we missed that chance in the 70's when instead of reinvesting the profits from oil for the common good and establishing a sovereign wealth fund (which is now the largest in the world), we handed the profits to our mates.
Sometimes a front page stops you in your tracks. @thescotsman reports:  "Theresa May says public debate is being stifled by internet bullies". So here's a little poll on who's stifling public debate on #Brexit? (pls RT obvs)

I used to be proud of working for the BBC but am appalled by its #Brexit bias, the polar opposite of what the BBC should be about. It will take years to remove the stain.

There's 'risk' UK will be pushed to be energy efficient during  #brexit transition period. Unclear why anyone sane would think that's bad 
Sorry to bore on about the customs union again but remainers need to understand that whether voters knew #Brexit meant leaving CU or not is irrelevant. The prospectus of Vote Leave was "take back control" & that does mean repatriation of key policy areas, and that includes trade.

.@Anna_Soubry: It’s time Theresa May stood up to the “hard ideological Brexiteers” & “slung ‘em out” – otherwise "we'll get Jacob Rees-Mogg as PM".Will more Tories join her in standing up to these bullies & #Brexit-drunk fantasists? #newsnight
They're utterly mad. Every last one of them that thinks UK will thrive outside the EU. #brexit is a long, drawn out suicide note. It is delusional. It is utter, fucking madness #newsnight
In all this talk of potential economic effects of leaving the customs union remember this: if leaving the EU costs us only 0.5% growth a year that'll be worth £14bn. Or more than all of our EU budget contrubutions. #Brexit
Wow, Anna Soubry isn't mincing her words here Basically saying she doesn't want a Tory Party where hard right #Brexit fanatics like #ReesMogg & Redwood are calling the shots 100% respect to @Anna_Soubry for speaking out & sticking to her principles#newsnight
EU slaps a tariff of 30% on processed cocoa imports & an eyewatering 60% on some refined cocoa imports. The EU thus massively disincentivizes the growth of industry in cocoa-growing third-world countries.Why should Britain be part of this cartel? #LeaveCustomsUnion#Brexit 
In a more rational world where evidence and expert opinion is sought and highly prized #Brexit would have long since been consigned to the dustbin of history. Where it so richly deserves to be sent.

Ultimately this UK Brexiter argument that Freedom of Movement is wrong because it’s prejudiced against non-Europeans is a misnomer.What they really mean is they want UK to be able to be as nasty to Europeans who move to UK as UK is to everyone else.#Brexit

“The time has come to make a choice” - @MichelBarnier’s statement in London today following his #Brexit working lunch with @DavidDavisMP:

Sums up this government that @DrPhillipLeeMP was disciplined for calling on the government to be led by “evidence, not dogma” in its approach to #Brexit.  One of the most sensible things a Conservative MP has said throughout these negotiations #FBPE #ExitFromBrexit
This is it folks - in black & white. The EU cant be clearer than this. #Brexit marks the start of the decline of London as the financial hub of the european financial area. Dont say you wernt warned. 
George Galloway - If #Brexit is destroyed, the people’s verdict will have been betrayed. It will never be forgiven and incalculable damage will have been inflicted by the political class. 
Classic example of current @GovUK preference for “fudge” - scared to offend hard right #Brexiteers by being too open and the rest of us by being too harsh they just refuse to say or do anything until it is too late to object.  Thus #Brexit will happen by stealth….. 
Visiting European Banking Authority @EBA_News today. Preparedness for #Brexit is key. All competent authorities and market operators have to prepare now. When the UK leaves the single market, the  financial passport is gone. 
Hopefully @BBCRadioLondon is NOT OK with one of their presenters (@HangingBabylon) telling @ZacGoldsmith that the DEATH THREAT sent to his 80yr old constituent because they voted for #Brexit, should’ve been sent to Zac instead. The @BBC needs to address this behaviour.
Another snag for #TheresaMay’s  #brexit plans (or lack of them): #trade partners across the globe demand concessions for any rollover to Britain of existing EU trade agreements if we leave #CustomsUnion , even for transitional period:
Sadly I agree. @Femi_Sorry is being honest and telling young people what they will lose if #Brexit goes ahead; @jeremycorbyn is avoiding the issue & dodging it in an attempt to keep their votes. #OurFutureOurChoice #FBPE #FinalSay @UKLabour
#NHS unable to get staff, food rotting in the fields, low value of the pound causing hardship for millions. Thousands of comapnies unable to fill jobs vacancies. The Tories clueless on #Brexit. What a utter disaster for us all. @Theresa_May
The EU refuses a soft #Brexit, so we must invoke the WTO immediately 
Whenever leading (some cruelly suggest: only) economist for #Brexit Patrick Minford releases a new study, I like to share his pre-referendum prediction of how a trade deal will take less than two years because the EU will plead for help and we’ll take pity on them cos we’re nice. 
We've already made a choice on #Brexit you cloth eared twit ... We don't want any part of your monopolised Ponzi scheme any more. Now give us our cash back and watch yourself implode ! #Brexiteers Forever !
MUST READ by a former health Minister on the affects of #Brexit on the NHS 
"UK presence in EU is finished" French talking up hard #Brexit to convince Japanese corporates to divest from UK. This is the reality of brexit. Better get used to it.   
The mate of Jacob Rees-Mogg who attacked a young lady was also seen in nazi uniform, this chap is obviously of the far right which is now infiltrating the tory party, coupled with division, hatred, xenophobia, casual racism, this is #Brexit Britain, we should all be worried.
.@MichelBarnier could not have been clearer on #brexit today in his meeting with @DavidDavisMP "Without a customs union, outside the single market, barriers to trade on goods and services are unavoidable.” @Open_Britain - #brexit is reversible as facts become clearer
"It also means that a #Brexit immigration bill, promised in the Queen’s speech, will not reach the statute book before the registration of @The3Million EU nationals already living and working in Britain gets under way this autumn."
Worrying to hear that 80% of the UK’s Creative Industries are not confident that Britain will maintain its leading global reputation post #Brexit and over 21% say that a ‘no deal’ outcome would make them consider moving part or all of their business abroad.
I would bet that on my own I've launched more fierce attacks on Tory #Brexit in the last week than @jeremycorbyn has made since June 23 2016.I might be wrong, but I doubt by much!#WATON#StopBrexit #FBPE
Dominic Grieve excellent just now on @BBCNews exposing incoherence  of Gov position and implications for #Ireland in particular #Brexit @Open_Britain
Says @jeremycorbyn who is backing a #Brexit that is already slowing our economy and so cutting funding for the #NHS.The stench of hypocrisy!#StopBrexit #FBPE #FinalSay #WATON
The chaos of ‘Operation Stack’ will be but a tiny sideshow compared to the havoc wreaked in Kent outside a Customs Union. Might as well concrete over the Garden of England and turn the whole thing into a bleeding car park. #Brexit
#Brexit Quote of The Day goes, hands down, to Dan Hannan:@Jo_Coburn: So, the UK doesn't want to be in a Customs Union but we want a Customs Agreement or a Customs Arrangement. It's clear as mud isn't it? @DanielJHannan: It's considerably clearer than mud. #bbcdp
By ruling out customs union, the government's choosing to put up barriers to UK trade with Europe after #Brexit. It'll be bad for jobs, bad for investment & bad for business 
My press release on #TheresaMay ‘s cave-in to the hard #Brexiters and the damage it will cause if she gets away with it. A job-destroying #brexit. A #customs border in northern #Ireland#Brexitshambles
The internal coup d'état to topple @theresa_may is in full swing. She dismally failed to exhibit #leadership & #negotiation acumen on #Brexit & has no control over her Cabinet. @BorisJohnson has been hatching this coup since ages now & @Jacob_Rees_Mogg may just surprise everyone.
Perhaps one of the many journalists soliciting his views on #Brexit the single market & Theresa May's future could also raise this? 
The European Commission is mulling cutting off Germany and other wealthy EU nations from money used to build roads and museums, Handelsblatt has learned. Britain’s exit from the EU forces the 28-nation bloc to curtail spending.#brexit
The Prime Minister categorically rules out Britain staying in 'the' or 'a' customs union with the EU. Hallelujah!#Brexit#LeaveCustomsUnion
A majority of all young people, regardless of social status, voted Remain in the referendum  #Brexit is and always has been a hard-right project, you cannot build anything worthwhile on it.

Has anyone got a clue how govt proposes to solve Irish question without a customs union? #Brexit
It's NOT too late. And if the #Brexit bullies get their way then we all lose so we have to call out their mendacity. Adam we can stay in CU/SM as Leave campaign promised (it was Remain side which warned of leaving them). Nothing else really works for Northern Ireland 
My colleagues @JohnSpringford & @SamuelMarcLowe try to bring #Brexit enthusiasts back to earth. In trade, as in the universe, there is no getting away from gravity. 
I fear voters in #Scotland will only awaken to the true extent of the danger we are in after all exit routes are closed. Post #Brexit, post next Gen Elec.  and after #Holyrood powers diminished  to those of a Town Council.
Democracy has been hijacked. The clear majority - a proportion of Leavers plus all Remainers - want to stay in the #CustomsUnion but Theresa May has put fear of mutiny ahead of the People’s wishes so give them the  #FinalSay on #Brexit

Quitting the Customs Union would mean a trade deal with the US which, to the delight of the #Brexit Tories, would effectively destroy the #NHS.#FBPE #StopBrexit
Nice for Downing Street to make pompous declarations to #leave Customs Union. But do they realise, they are in charge of governing the whole country not just the questionable #brexit ref? Have they addressed the Good Friday agreement? #stopbrexit #cakeism #finalsay #WATON #FBPE
In a joint letter with @Plaid_Cymru, @theSNP and @LibDems, we have written to Jeremy Corbyn urging him to work with us to stop an extreme #Brexit. 
This is nonsense. We lost our majority in ‘17 despite winning more votes than Cameron ever achieved because of a) an appallingly bad manifesto b) a cult surge for hard Brexiteer Corbyn - your @Conservative colleagues are well aware what the country voted for in June ‘16 #Brexit 
Throughout #Brexit negotiations, @theresa_May has been trying to hide the truth from the public but the leaks last week shows her mask is slipping. #Brexit is going to damage the UK and the public must be given a say on the final deal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit
A message to @Keir_Starmer, if you believe there really can be a ‘jobs first’ #Brexit which will benefit our country then by all means continue to support Brexit. But if you know deep down it will damage us all please say so!
Reassuring news for the good people of Brussels: there is still blue sky behind the clouds (despite #Brexit ) 
After #Brexit food will be cheaper and the UK could be healthier says Dr @JonMarcStanleyby ditching the EU agricultural strategy and promoting our own  healthier policies.
Today's UK Govt announcement on membership of the CU isn't compatible with the first stage #Brexit agreement they made with the European Commission... How on earth is Barnier expected to trust May & Co with this shambles...?
#Brexit Agreed: "no hard border with Ireland". Stated: "no customs union". Anyone got a good formula for squaring circles? 
Customs Union is an anagram for Ms Continuous. Maybe she's planning to keep us in after all... #brexit 
"In or Out decision""Not for politicians to decide""Not for parliament to decide""No second referendum""Once in a generation""For your grandchildren""The decision will be respected"#brexit -  crystal 
If @theresa_may barters away our fishing waters in #Brexit negotiations it will be considered a failure to deliver on her #Brexit means #Brexit promise ... and should trigger her immediate replacement.
The statement from Theresa May that the UK will not be in the, or a Customs Union confirms the crazed, extreme Brexiters are now in control of government. Their ideology obsession with all things European will cause maximum damage to the UK. #Brexit #FBPE
”It is not our policy to stay in the customs union. We are categorically leaving the customs union. Brexit is about taking back control of our money, laws and borders. We are going to deliver that” - No.10#Brexit #FitForTheFuture
'Leading City Analyst', Bon Lyddon has also calculated that the annual net cost of EU migrants – once the tax they pay is deducted from benefits paid out – is £30billion a year.#Brexit #Brexiteers
Unfortunately, my company relies on the #CustomsUnion for access to the #EU. We do thousands of shipment each month into Eu as that's where are clients are. Our processing costs will sky rocket. We'll end up relocating into EU, job losses. Not happy #UK #Brexit #News #May
Corbyn supporters keep reminding us if we don't back him we'll be left with Tory #BrexitThere is no difference between Tory and Labour #BrexitIf Corbyn wants to get elected he needs to appeal to Remainers by reversing Brexit

I'm in your boat, voted for #brexit and regret it. I wasn't fooled by media or £350m nonsense. But hoped Parliament would have a greater say rather than this right-wing Tory agenda. Let me vote again!
Non-EU countries are ALREADY queuing up to give us worse trade deals than we have now. The idea that we can do better outside the EU is now demonstrably false. Another nail in the coffin of arguments for #Brexit. Time for a rethink. #FinalSay #FinalSayForAll #StopBrexit
The tory brexists give thanks to Jeremy Corbyn their friend their ally and the saviour of #brexit 
UK Govt said again today we're leaving the customs union.That means a hard border in Ireland.We agreed with the EU27 in December to avoid that through customs alignment ie a customs union.Tory #Brexit position isn't just objectionable, it's objectively impossible. 
"It's like buying a house. You put in the offer... You see it, are bowled over by it. Then you get the survey done and discover that the roof is falling in, you've got the neighbours from hell, that there's dry rot."@Andrew_Adonis on why there should be a 2nd #Brexit vote 
Despite what many people were led to believe, Parliament has never delegated the withdrawal decision to the people and has never made the withdrawal decision itself. Regardless of your view on #Brexit itself this current mess is unstable and illegitimate.
.@theresa_may has categorically ruled out keeping the #UK in any form of the Customs Union.Article in the @thetimes tomorrow.So, fellow Brexiteers, can we now please back her to deliver #Brexit? 
So, to heads of medical colleges & other health leaders, can we be clear that #Brexit is likely to harm mental health, increase death rates inc suicide, undermine NHS & make it harder to find care for elderly relatives?
Have spoken to many health leaders about #Brexit. All agree economic consequences will lead to higher death rates & worse care. Is this being made clear to public & covered in media?
This is a brutal but  accurate article from former Tory MP @MatthewParris3 & highlights why the #remainernow initiative is so important. Most Tory MPs (and half govt) know #brexit is not the right policy for the U.K. & sensible moderates must be encouraged to break ranks! 
If as doctor I make decisions that cost lives, am personally accountable & may be struck off. If Govt make decisions with same impact, where is consequence, even tho accountability is in Nolan principles? #Brexit

Liam Fox is less gifted at #Cakeism than the other #Brexit bandits. He said this would be the easiest deal in history, that it'd take only a day-&-a-half to conclude, that all EU's deals would automatically rolls over to us... None of that is true. Now he's scrambling for crumbs. 
Except, @BBCNews, that @vincecable corrected @AndrewMarr9 when he used that phrase and said it was a #FinalSay on the facts of #Brexit, not a rerun of 2016. This is surely said enough times by lots of people for you to be accurate in language?

Why Rees-Mogg and other Brexiters are attacking the civil service over its evidence that #Brexit will damage the UK economy: “If you’re selling snake oil, you don’t like the idea of experts testing your product.” 
#Brexit and #Trump are the same things. Once again, Britain is a 'Petri dish' for an alt Reich takeover of  Conservatives/Republicans. No wonder Rees Mogg was briefed by Steve Bannon
In my view the crucial issue for @theSNP re a 2nd #EU referendum is we cannot allow a situation where Scotland wishes re EU can be ignored or overridden again. Scotland’s wishes must be protected and respected #brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
#JacobReesMogg says we can import most foods cheaper with a US post #brexit  trade deal than buying from the EU. For example, oranges from Florida rather than Spain. So let's look at the difference in standards. It's not just about chicken! 
"Best possible deal for Britain" Essentially means having crashed the Rolls Royce heading down second hand car dealers to get "Best possible second hand car for Britain" #Brexit
Dominic Raab has today repeated the mendacious nonsense that we can be outside any Customs Union while having frictionless trade with the EU.These lies are perverting our democracy. The struggle against #Brexit is a struggle for democracy. #StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON

Spot on from @vincecable the public argument for a referendum on the #Brexit deal vs #Remain is being won. He's also right, that Corbyn is crucial on this, and, by ignoring the wishes of Labour members & voters, is currently the biggest obstacle to an #ExitFromBrexit@LibDems
Only ONE #Leaver on @daily_politics and FIVE  who voted #REMAINThe disgraceful @BBC campaign to kill off #Brexit continues apace.
2)  if you want balance on #Brexit you need an LD, Green, SNAP or Plaid representative to provide a proper opposing view. "Our fantasy #Brexit is better than their fantasy #Brexit" is not balance, it's just variations on the same lie the country's heard for 2 years
1)  Just a word on balance, guests & #BrexitThere's virtually no point in having a Tory & Labour MP on in the hope you'll get balanceBoth parties split on Brexit, both have essentially the same policySo you won't get honesty, just 2 variations of the same equivocation
Third countries already demanding concessions in future U.K. accords to allow it to stay in EU agreements during post-#Brexit transitional period. In other words, the future deals will be worse than the EU ones UK is throwing away. Who would have thought.
All the Gov forecasts before #Brexit were totally wrong.Instead of those making the forecasts being sacked, as they would be in the private sector,they are still there churning out worthless forecasts.The public sector rewards failure.

You, Sir, you are the one with the power to stop the march of the hard right in Britain. The shadow Cabinet need to convince Mr Corbyn to take a hard line against #Brexit. Without that hard line, Labour and Britain will be lost to the Tory hard right.

#Brexit is a crime against the United Kingdom and it's people. The perpetrators are an unhinged cabal of ideologues in the Conservative party. They are desperate liars and politically ambitious plotters. It's time to flush them down the toilet of history...#StopBrexitSaveBritain

"The #TREASURYGATE tweets"  The #Brexit Facts4EU team publishes @Jacob_Rees_Mogg's tweets on the scandal of the treachery of senior civil servants. Full story: 
YouGov poll of 28-29 Jan shows 40% think we were right to vote to leave the EU & 46% think we were wrong.Meanwhile government & most politicians plough on with a policy a majority of people believe to be a mistake.So much for respect for the people. #FBPE #Brexit #StopBrexit
Mogg should be sacked for attempting to pull such a stunt, It was a corrupt and fraudulent attempt to undermine facts. It's time everyone knew exactly what sort of person lies behind Mogg's "Gentleman facade"#brexit #remain #fbpe
For all his mannered politeness, Jacob Rees-Mogg has been showing of late that he can be more disingenuous than the next man.#r4today #Brexit
Sick of Rees-Mogg & Brexiters misusing the Royal 'we' as if it implies all of us. May tried using the Royal Prerogative too & lost out to Miller. We who are true Democrats demand a Binding #FinalSay to Confirm #Brexit or #StopBrexit in 2018 so that ALL of US can Rethink Brexit.
As far as I know @hmtreasury committed to govt policy to leave EU – Treasury cares about economy so is naturally pushing for sorts of #Brexit that minimise economic damage, which why many in Treasury think UK should go for staying in CU, @CER_Grant tells @BBCr4today
#FBPE has done sum great work. It's connected anti #brexit ppl, helped get issues trending & assisted in getting info on events a bigger audience. There are trolls, but don't allow anyone to bully or shame you into dropping it. There's a reason they're worried abt it.
Attempts to hide the true cost of #Brexit are a fraud committed by a government that doesn’t believe in what it’s doing 
It's imperative that we are given another vote so that we have a chance to right the wrongs of the first #EURef NOBODY knew what they were voting for. #Brexit is a shambles and needs to be stopped.
On the 23/06/16 I voted to leave the EU. When I woke up and saw the smug face of Farage I began to have a nagging doubt. This turned in to full blown regret as the consequences of #Brexit became clearer. If, like me, you've had doubts, then just look at who wants it the most.

The Remoaner establishment has now decided to resurrect Project Fear. They are deluded if they think that yet another bout of Treasury scaremongering will turn the public against #Brexit. 
Excellent. This interview really DID grill the PM on #Brexit...  That there were no real answers is the fault of Mrs May and her pathetic, self-serving, irresponsible lot, not the fault this time of the BBC.  We must ask and ask again....  What DOES @theresa_may actually want?
Michael Portillo - "The Treasury and the Foreign Office are both fanatically pro-European. All the analysis is going to go in one direction, as it did before the referendum." #Brexit 
John Redwood:Project Fear forecasters should try explaining why UK growth rate fell after we joined EU, why we have had a persistent deficit with them & why even EU study shows there was practically no benefit from joining the single market.#Brexit #EU
Andrew Neil'Political elites on both sides of Atlantic been used to getting their own way.So something of kick in the Andrew Adonis’ to discover they are now on sidelines.Their unfamiliar failing of alienation has turned into discombobulation'#Brexit
.@theresa_may refusing to outline her position in relation to #Brexit. She has continuously refused to provide clarity throughout these negotiations, hiding information from the public, contributing massively to the calamity that this process has become. 
Totally agree. I don't care how close we might come to escaping the  burning building that is #Brexit - I want to be well clear of it and  enjoying continued full EU m'ship. "Left but in name only" has a  *critical* word in it: "left". To coin a phrase..."Remain means Remain". 
 A reminder for @STVNews! The search for new #SFA Chief Executive ISN'T a crisis! Scotland being dragged out the EU IS a crisis! #Brexit

Some Libertarians consider that Libtards/Liberals are anything left of Jacob-Rees-Mogg...my question wld be,Is there anything left of Jacob Rees-Mogg's credibility after his false feed to a #Brexit minister yesterday? The minister who then falsely fed it to Parl#BrexitIsRubbish
Looking forward to catching up w/ @DavidDavisMP on Monday to discuss UK's orderly withdrawal, and meet w/ @EBA_News on #Brexit preparedness of EU financial service providers. Next EU/UK negotiation round starts on Tuesday in Brussels:

I think we've all learned a lot about the EU. It's not quite the monster our press have made it out to be, is it? In fact, if it's one thing #Brexit has revealed to me, it's how awful our press is. It's totally failing in its job to report, inform & hold the government to account
Well that was ghastly. Low point of this week's #bbcqt:Tim Stanley enthusing about #Brexit ushering in a new era of Thatcherism & the #Brexiters cheering him on - little knowing that Tory #Brexit is a Trojan horse for taking their rights, jobs & whatever prosperity they've got.

The idea that we will have greater national sovereignty when we leave the EU is pure nonsense. Our domestic policy decisions on taxation & public spending will be dictated by the financial markets. Our country is heading further & further to the right #bbcqt #brexit
Justine Greening doing good job of embodying the problem of a party crammed with politicians who just don't get #Brexit - to exasparation of #bbcqt audience & millions of voters. Problem not that she turned down a Cabinet job from May. More a problem was that she was offered one

Jacob Rees Mogg - Pants On Fire: did he conspire with @SteveBakerHW to mislead the Commons with a rigged Question? #Brexit 
#Brexit: Historians will scratch their heads in wonder. These are truly extraordinary times. Britain is upending the economic and foreign policies that have set its national course for half a century. Nothing in modern peacetime matches the upheaval.
Who was one of the biggest donors to the Leave campaign? And who subsequently made £220 million in the space of a few hours after the #Brexit result? Find out here:  #BrexitBadBoys
What do the EU and the Civil Service have in common? - Both are being used as scapegoats for the failings of British governments.Do not be fooled by the #BREXIT elites.
Without doubt one of Theresa May's best movies.'One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest'1975#MaysBestMovies#China #Brexit #bbcpm #bbcdp@haveigotnews @PrivateEyeNews
Scotland's #Brexit minister has vowed to publish a UK paper on the impact of leaving the European Union if he is given a copy.
Have to heard about #LorryGate ?The #Brexit bombshell for the British haulage industry that could put thousands of British drivers out of work!Please read and share the attached thread. #StopBrexitSaveBritain #BrexitShambles#FBPE #StopBrexit
Good news that @scotgov will support EU students coming to study in Scotland for 2019-20 #Brexit #scotlandwelcomestheworld
#CustomsUnion or #SingleMarket ? Comprehensive Trade Agreement,  MRA, MFN, NTB? See my easy-to-read guide to the jargon & acronyms that confuse us all when talking #trade, #brexit, #Deals  or lack of them:
Desperate #Brexit ideologues casting around for someone - anyone- to blame for the mess they themselves are making...Brexit minister Steve Baker says civil servants may be conspiring against the government 
This is dreadful for Merseyside & suppliers across the UK - Merseyside was transformed by EU investment & now this result of #Brexit from @JLR_News @meaglemp @CllrNickSmall @mayor_anderson @MetroMayorSteve
No doubt, @SamCoatesTimes, the EU law requirement for environmental impact assessments is one of those nuisance Brussels red-tapey thingys that Brexiteers plan to dump if we #Brexit 
The reports in the @guardian about leaked EU expectations ahead of #Brexit negotiations proves that the #Brexiters’ mantra that the UK will get a great deal because the Germans want to sell us BMWs and the Italians prosecco is a lie.  #FBPE
True cost of staying in EU is far higher than anything Treasury now predicts.We would become a regional province in a vast, German-led federal superstate, robbed of all national self respect.That is a humiliating price we should never pay.#Brexit #EU
 Preparing for the UK’s withdrawal is not just a matter for the EU and national authorities but also for private parties. The list of our #Brexit preparedness notices is available here → 
"We are going to strip you of your rights and privileges and we're not going to allow a #FinalSayForAll the people because it's the will of the people." #Brexit is collapsing under its own contradictions. 
The only guide you need for why people voted Leave or Remain for #Brexit 
#Brexit folk who seemingly so believe in Britain have gone after our judges, legal system, academics, Lords, media, young people & now civil servants. It's almost like they hate the country 
My msg is quite simple:1. WTO cliff edge=No Deal=disaster=Irish Border2. NoWay Norway=Pay & Obey No Say ongoing to avoid Irish Border so STAY+SAY3. Tory + Labour=No SM/CU/ECJ, No #FinalSay = #Brexit4. Brexit=Poorer + Weaker + Less Control - Rights5. #FinalSay #StopBrexit
"LABOUR MP Ian Murray has launched a scathing attack on #Corbyn & Leonard saying the leaked UK Government economic assessments about the effects of leaving the EU prove Labour’s “jobs first #Brexit” is impossible."Murray is a sensible, sane Labour MP.
The way #TheresaMay & this rotten Tory government have treated #EUCitizens is a disgrace. These are people contributing to our country & they're treated with contempt just to pacify the Daily Mail, Tory headbangers & some xenophobic Little Englanders - shameful#Brexit #bbcdp
EU 'Undemocratic' President selection MUST changeCzech Prime Minister Andrej Babis:“We cannot be in the position that we have nothing to say, that there are only 2 big nations and the Commission, which are really deciding about everything.”#Brexit #EU

I'm more than happy to put my trust in a public #people'svote to consider all #Brexit options 
#Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier privately told Nigel Farage: 'You must understand that your actions have consequences'...Shortly after Farage announced a 2nd ref might be a good idea. Join the dots.  
An extraordinary assault on @PhilipHammondUK and the impartiality of the civil service here - clearly choreographed by hard Brexiteers @Jacob_Rees_Mogg & @SteveBakerHW . Watch how @DavidDavisMP winces at what they’re up to. #wheelscomingoff #Brexit 
Juncker:“It will be more difficult to keep together 27 #EU member states during 2nd step negotiations because economic industries will try to convince their Govts to say yes to this or that UK proposals”Industries that pay your salary Mr Juncker#Brexit
If @UKLabour came out for #Remain I would campaign for them 24hrs a day 7 days a week. Defeating #Brexit is more important than any policy differences I might have. If they also committed to #PR I would campaign even harder for them. @Labour4EU
The #PanamaPapers & #ParadisePapers revealed the links between many #BrexitBadBoys and #tax avoidance. Small wonder they championed #Brexit at a time when the EU is making strides to improve laws to counter money-laundering and tax dodging. 
Peter Bone:'Great News!We’re only 422 days away from Leaving this terrible #EUOn immigration, obviously Project Fear mark II.We had Project Fear before referendum.British public listened to all the arguments & they decided to vote to Leave.'#Brexit
Supreme Court is to refer questions relating to the extradition of an Irish man to the UK, to the European Court of Justice. Thomas Joseph O'Connor wants to challenge decision to extradite him, on basis of UK decision to leave the EU. #brexit @rtenews
Freedom of movement and immigration are good for the economy. It’s time for the benefits of immigration to be promoted rather than allowing the immigration sceptics to own the debate. #Brexit #immigration
It is unfortunate that @UKLabour have been crowing over the leaked report that says immigration has been good for our economy and that #brexit restrictions will harm it.Has someone asked #Corbyn & #ODonnell if this has modified THEIR opinion that EU migration harms UK jobs ???
MUST READ: a vivid illustration on the chaos in government on #Brexit. Extraordinary and very alarming indeed 
Hard Brexiter & new Minister Suella Fernandes doesn't seem to know that UK car production is down for the first time since 2009 and investment down by over £500 million in last year. #Brexit, and announcing we are coming out of the Customs Union, is already hurting this industry.
Britain's economy will have a ‘better future’ outside the EU, @Theresa_May said yesterday.In an upbeat assessment, the Prime Minister said she was determined to confound the doomsayers, who claim leaving the EU will damage the economy.#Brexit #PMinChina
May’s comments about Freedom of Movement during transition *directly* contradict this (page 2).Joined up government, eh? #brexit 
With are ever more revelations about the lies & duplicity surrounding the #EUref and the Government's conduct in the 19mths since, I become angrier & even less reconciled to #Brexit. Feel the same?#NevvaGonnaGiveEUup Meme & Twitter storm tonight 6-8pm UK-time.Demand #FinalSay!
Tonight at 6pm we welcome @acgrayling to Cambridge to speak on how we can stop #Brexit.  Last few tickets left at  Join us and let's #StopBrexit #FBPE
1) "people ignored the leave campaign" & other #Brexit nonsenseI've been getting a few responses to this thread from people saying "it doesn't matter what Vote Leave said, people didnt vote leave for economic reasons"This just doesn't stack up at all
Once more, a very fruitful exchange with @europarl_EN Conference of Committee Chairs, with @CeciliaWikstrom and @GuyVerhofstadt. Working hand in hand with #EP to set #EU principles for transition and future relations and to prepare for consequences of #Brexit 
Should UK keep EU existing rules on freedom of movement - including the path to permanent residency - until the end of the transition phase of 31 December 2020? #Brexit: Theresa May to fight EU transition residency plan RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters
Here are the slides presented by the @EU_Commission #brexit Task Force to EU27 officials in their seminar about a level playing field for the EU/UK future relationship last week (and the basis for the story in today’s @FT) 
NL report urges businesses to tackle #brexit preparedness & avoid paralysis due to uncertainty. Planning and acting now is crucial. 
The #citizensrights all women dream team rides again. Final prep by @BritishInEurope and @The3Million ahead of our 10:30 CET Facebook live with @Verhofstadt and EP hearing at 14h CET #Brexit @JoannaMaycock @EuropeanWomen @catherinemep pic.twitter.com/01l3c6dezz
The first consequence of #Brexit  is that it's most important victim was the truth. We have a govt so scared of the truth that it refuses to give the people a glimpse of it. We are living through the most surreal episode of "The Thick Of It" #StopBrexitSaveBritain
UK would be £7,000,000,000 a year BETTER off with WTO tariffs.So let's just walk away now and end all this mind numbing #Brexit chatter. 
. @Anna_Soubry doing what Corbyn has completely failed to do - tearing into the lies, chicanery and madness of #Brexit and calling for a #FinalSay Referendum. #CorbynOut #StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON
Letter of the day on #Brexit from the ex boss of Shell @FT #Boris
We’d do well to remember that it’s the UK govt that wants a post-brexit transition period and the EU is saying “OK, provided you follow the same rules as the rest of us during that period”#BrexitReality #Brexit #BrexitShambles
“The only thing we know for certain about a Labour Brexit is that it would leave us in the worst possible position, taking us back to square one and forcing us to continue making huge payments to the EU” - Steve Baker#TheCorbynCon #Brexit
Watching the House of Lords debate #Brexit is like  watching a debate in the House of Commons 20 years ago.The House of Lords is just a expensive retirement home for MPs the voters threw out or retired MPs.The House of Lords allows ex MPs to continue to rule over us.
Great article about the utter lunacy of Britain’s current state of mind: “#Brexit is an act of protectionism promulgated by English nationalists who inexplicably style themselves free-marketeers” 
Remoaner civil servants 'misleading' GovtSteven Woolfe'Govt doesn't seem to recognise strength of British economy in relation to EU.Civil servants who are advising Govt mostly voted Remain.They have a mentality that we cannot leave the EU'#Brexit #EU
Lords warned not to force ‘referendum merry-go-round’ on publicLord Hague:Any attempts to undo the people’s wishes to leave EU could "plunge the country into a long and bitter dispute & division, greater than anything we have seen so far".#Brexit #EU
Dearest Lords,I was watching the BBC politics channel earlier, and couldn't help but notice that you were somewhat distressed over #Brexit. Being good citizens, we feel compelled to offer you the use of these to throw out of your prams.Sincerest Regards, Stop the EU 
The woefully simplistic analysis by @PeterBoneUK that only Minford’s #Brexit assessment is right is debunked here: And for the record, treasury forecasts were to 2030, assumed Cameron would sign A50 immediately and didn’t model for BoE action!
The whole #brexit debacle was created to appease the backbenchers and provide Cameron with more time. There was also an ambition by the Tories to reclaim voters that defected to UKIP. this was never for the benefit of the UK and it’s economy. It was about power.
Even if we get a bespoke deal better than a free trade deal which would cost 5% of GDP on the governments figures the impact is huge.  4% reduction in GDP is approximately $1 trillion.  Where is your £35ln a week gain now? #Brexit #Remain @Conservatives
As always an excellently researched, analysed and presented set of facts from the brilliant @tony_nog With provable reality like this, how the hell can anybody still believe in the insane religion of #Brexit? Unrolled thread from @tony_nog #Brexit 
That's great @Anna_Soubry but you shd have voted against #brexit instead of giving into whip and party line. #StopBrexit
Watching the Prime Minister walking around China, I feel sorry for her, she looks awkward and uncomfortable, despite the smiles. Going to China for three days isn't going to help her whatsoever domestically.It's not a good thing when you feel sorry for your PM.  #brexit
Vince Cable assures us Theresa May, as Home Secretary, suppressed 7 key reports making the same points. TM has form – “hostile environment” form – on the building blocks of fascism including racism, xenophobia & totalitarian grade control in RIPA. #Brexit is a means of delivery.
I've no doubt that it'll be the duty of the Mail, Express, Telegraph & the Sun to pile in with the scaremongering claim to support the #Brexit Junta currently occupying No. 10 Downing Street. #StopBrexit #exitfrombrexit #FBPE #FinalSay #FinalSayForAll #WeAreTheOppositionNow

Sorry @Andrew_Adonis 100% with you on #Brexit but 100% against you on #HS2 - note 343 MPs didn't bother to vote 4 your project only 13 Labour MPs did. @KevinBarronMP switched from backing to opposition because of lies on M18 Eastern Route from Higgins. @HighSpeedUK or NHS better
Why is May/UK media so  #Brexit fixated when she is on impt. China trip. What will hosts think of Little Englanders? - No deal for EU citizens coming to UK during Brexit transition – PM 
Great thread debunking, in detail, all the Leavers economic arguments Unrolled thread from @tony_nog #Brexit 
"With 52 percent of Irish beef destined for the UK market, we cannot put further pressure on the EU beef market in a trade pact with the Latin American countries,"    #Brexit #Irexit
Not as big a moment as @jeremycorbyn #Brexit group which meets imminently
Is that allowed with all the #brexit talk?
How very #Brexit Politbureau How very Brezhnev.How very "The train is broken so we will draw the curtains and say it is moving".
@Number10gov Remember #NDiBTaBD#LoveEurope #Leaveeu#Brexit
We are really screwed, we all know she has to go & #JacobReesMogg get in, he's the only one who actually believes in #Brexit  but suspect Corbyn might be voted in by the youngsters who buy into his bullshit & then we're REALLY in trouble!! 
ICYMI, I wrote to @ProfRWinston because I was so pissed off with David Davies referrring to our fears as "real or imagined". Winston summarised my disquiet in the Lords yesterday. #Brexit 
How will #Brexit influence the UK's position on #GDPR? Jessica Santos discusses this and more via this white paper.

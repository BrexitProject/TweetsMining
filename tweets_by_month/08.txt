Mr. Brexit? Because @RealDonaldTrump, your supporters will immediately regret it and chase you out of the country?
Mr. Brexit? Because you'll destroy the US economy, @realDonaldTrump, the way Brexit hurt the one in the UK?#Dipshit
Donald Trump is now calling himself "Mr Brexit." What should Hillary’s new nickname be?
Mr. Brexit? Because @realDonaldTrump stupid people will vote for you mindlessly like lemmings going over a cliff?

So according to #BBC, EU Referendum result was solely about immigration? All polls show that most voted for Sovereignty. Not mentioned once?
Let's be clear. Brexit referendum was a product of Tory division. To make it Labour's fault would be missing the bigger politics
They can blame Jeremy all they want but Lab's failure to take on the UKIP nonsense on immigration is what sunk the Lab remain vote. #Brexit

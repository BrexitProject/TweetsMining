Q for Cameron/Osborne: If you really believe Brexit = recession/doom/sun stops rising etc, remind me why you called the referendum?
David Cameron's former guru Steve Hilton is backing Brexit from "impenetrable" and "hubristic" EU

You think these Tweets are over the top? The Chancellor is now seriously trying to claim that Brexit will cause a worse downturn than 1929.
IDS sophistic on Turkey & EU. UK has veto; no good saying  British people has 'no say' because no referendum. No referendum on most changes.
One month to go until the EU referendum: Have you registered to vote?
So Brexit will cause a collapse in house prices, and recession, and war, and probably cancer. Why have we been given a vote on it, again?

The PM has claimed yet again that the OBR warns against Brexit. They don't. Why is he lying?
In the Scottish referendum we had free and inspired debate in kitchens, on buses, in closes. Anyone had an inspired Euro debate lately?

Wait so Cameron made a manifesto promise that he would hold a referendum that he says could plunge us into war? Seems responsible...
Win any debate on the EU referendum by confidently repeating "Schengen Agreement" until your opponent falls silent.
On paper of course Cameron is right when he says " this referendum isn't about me". But given he and Osborne would be out in weeks...it is.

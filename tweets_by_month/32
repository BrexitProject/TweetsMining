Who the fuck does Matt Lucas think he is, calling for a #PeoplesVote? Oh yes, that's right, he is a patriotic citizen who thinks we should all have the right to democratically vote on the final #Brexit deal. Matt is funny and smart, be like Matt demand a #PeoplesVote
Why are the @BBC framing the departure of Frank Field as to do with antisemitism, he was going to be deselected by his constituency for siding with a tory govt on #Brexit, his voters have suffered under these bastards and he kept them in power, ffs report this #bbcnews #Newsnight
At the end of today all I can conclude is:The Labour party is tearing itself to shredsThe Tories have torn themselves to shredsThe other parties are but shreds in the political totalityAnd #Brexit will render the country's future shreds.Wake up Britain!#newsnight #r4today

Not-so-fantastic-Mr-Fox enters next phase of #Brexit: the blame game. We've had shock, denial, anger & 2 years of displacement activity, now the cliff edge looms close, that he's teetering on the edge of the abyss is someone else's fault! So far, so depressingly predictable.

"if we embrace it"? Well Kate, you may have noticed, unless you've been off the planet, no majority will embrace any well defined #Brexit. It's crime based & bad for both UK & EU.The EU won't stop biz from being bold & optimistic. What Dyson longs for is mean, dirty & cheap. 
Of all the #brexit insanity this is right up there. £92m to do something we were already doing in partnership. And let's be clear, in the world of satellite projects that amount is small change. Although it would mean a lot to 92 schools for example or for incubator units.. #FBPE
Packed house for @euromovescot's Politician's Panel on #Brexit. Some pertinent comments and questions from the floor. "Here we are looking at a catastrophe in the making" and "How do we get our politicians to be honest?" Discuss. 
France doubts #UK would develop own #satnav rival to Galileo.A row over #Galileo, a rival of the U.S.-owned #GPS, became a flashpoint in #BrExit talks after London accused the #EU of shutting British companies out of the project.
#Squealer just can’t help himself can he. They’re not ‘propping up the Tories’ you vicious little man-child, they’re standing up for the majority -17m voters-who voted for #Brexit.As for Field being xenophobic, Owen’s fave word after bigot, no. He’s not. 
The right wing press worked hand in glove with #Brexit politicians to ditch European employment laws and workers rights. Promoting xenophobia as the main agenda to rewind Britain to a pre-WW2 pleb class of workers & a NEW ruling class. Farage the patsy = danger #FBPE #WATON #ABTV
You're wrong @AliCapper seasonal worker scheme is not ONLY solution stopping #Brexit would be better for all. A pity @NFUtweets doesn't call for a #Peoplesvote so farmers can vote on the Brexit deal they're getting not the lies Brexiteers promised @Labour4EU @EK_EuropeanMove

What is this televisual dogdirt @SkyNews are passing off as a 'report' into the PM's trip to Africa.Does the hyperactive heckler @lewis_goodall, who appears to have been mentored by Owen Jones, feel he's winning any 'debates' by repeating the word #Brexit like someone obsessed? 
I wouldn’t say I’m “poor” by any means. Own house, car, pay bills etc. But I do live on this very street. What we do fear is an incompetent, untrustworthy & disastrous government who allowed #brexit to mess up & divide the UK, for what reason? @CNN @DeborahMeaden @peoplesvote_uk
Frank Field recently voted with the Tories to prevent Britain joining a post-EU customs union, and says he supports a hard #Brexit on the grounds of the British people's "sense of destiny".It's astonishing that he still had the Labour whip.

READ: More broken promises made by Brexiteers. This wasn't the #Brexit anyone voted for. Important we have a #PeoplesVote to give the public the #finalsay:
What does the EU ever do for us? Well here's 8 things just since the #Brexit vote in 2016.
The man who predicted the #Brexit negotiations would be the “easiest in human history” now insists he shouldn’t be blamed if there isn’t a deal 
"#Brexit is a catastrophic disaster"RT after you Vote.
"In hindsight, was Britain right or wrong to vote to leave the EU"By region#Brexit 
We’ve undergone 8 years of austerity, on the proviso that the state has overspent. That has been the Tory mantra since May 2010.But we now have, suddenly, access to excess capital to duplicate spending on items we’ve already spent on?Inherently illogical.#Brexit 
Toffs' thinking is what will destroy Britain b/c it's what brought us the Charge of the Light Brigade, Gallipoli and now a no deal #brexit orchestrated by Boris Johnson and Jacob rees Mogg. Always remember the 1% aren't patriots they're thieves.
Couldn’t agree more with Sec. @LiamFox!  As we have seen this week, President Trump is serious about trade, and we want to do a great trade deal with the UK post #Brexit! 
The British people should get the final say on the Brexit deal, with the option to remain in the EU. Agree? Add your name: #brexit #stopbrexit #peoplesvote
Wonderful. Another #Brexit boondoggle, to go with our satnav vanity project. Will there be anything left in the budget for real defence, rather than repairing Brexit-related damage? 
So if the Swedish elections let the Nazis in (and it's looking likely), there'll be another plot twist to my #Brexit nightmare.
#Brexit: another company leaves.....
The sun will literally go out because of #Brexit. The world will be covered in ice, except for lands around the equator. The population of the EU will have to migrate to central Africa. Won't that annoy the far-right! The clogs are on the other feet now.
So... instead of “ better” we have those inside the NHS who believe #Brexit threatens the NHS service and provision of care. No one voted for that surely? 
Folks, I'm in Scotland with my day job and will be in the bar of the Holiday Inn near Edinburgh Zoo from 6-9pm this evening.If you want to swing by and have a natter about #Brexit  with the middle guy from #3Blokesinapub them come say hi.
"No matter how bad her zombie shuffle dance was @theresa_may won't be able to expunge the record of Britain in Africa" says @georgegalloway who talks to @RT_America's @Natashasweatte after Chancellor @PhilipHammondUK says #Brexit will result in more debt. 
We should be ready for a #Brexit deal being presented at the last minute by the Gov'mt. In contrast to no deal, it will be presented as the most wonderful deal ever & MPs & the public will be bamboozled into accepting it. We NEED a proper debate with information & a #PeoplesVote
Given Corbyn was unable to stomach saying that UK would be better off outside the EU, he must know the catastrophe that #Brexit will bring, yet Labour is failing to acknowledge it, still not listening to the overwhelming number of their voters who voted to reject messy #Brexit
The (almost) final version of the programme for the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference is now available for download at . Unfortunately the event is sold out, but we are hoping to put on a live stream. Keep watching this space for details.
In terms of the space programme required to actually do this, £92m is just a laughably tiny amount. But paying anything to reinvent a wheel we already helped design, build & pay for demonstrates the absolute and utter folly of Brexit. #bbcnews #Brexit 
The way markets react quickly to EU commentary on #Brexit, shows weak UK influence. TM stuck - hard Brexit alienates EU and soft Brexit upsets radical right. Better to hold #PeoplesVote and stop the whole thing
How is this man still allowed speak on behalf of his constituents? The U.K’s trade with Ireland is worth more than trade his trade with India, Japan, New Zealand and Australia combined. Almost £20 bn a year. This is inflammatory rhetoric and blatantly false. Enough. #Brexit 
Yet another major company no longer sees #Brexit Britain as a suitable home  for business. Whether you voted leave or remain no one voted for fewer jobs & less money in their pocket. That's why people need a #finalsayonthedeal & a chance to #exitfrombrexit 
So ‘conservationist’ Gove is running to the defence of ‘scallop dredging..thought to have the most severe ecological effect of all UK marine fisheries’Does not bode well for sustainable fishing if we #Brexit and the marine environment is in his tender care 
#Leavers. The UK isn't in Schengen. The UK chose not to have the Euro. Your elected MEP gets to vote on EU rules/laws. The UK has a special rebate on its membership fee, but still has full entitlement to ALL the benefits of membership and all EU trade deals. So why #Brexit
Excellent and well-reasoned article Robert Lee believes that the Chequers “coup” has failed. He explains why he believes that a Clean #Brexit – either through a Canada-style agreement or through a “No Deal” – is after all going to happen.
Thanks to @forthports for letting us visit #GrangemouthDocks - Scotland’s largest container port - to launch the new @ScotGov discussion paper on #Brexit trade issues.  No #Brexit still better than any #Brexit but current @GovUK Trade Bill needs clear response

Some #Brexit notes on where it’s at
#Brexit is not a poker game, @michelbarnier on @DLF, there are only losers. EU  must prepare for no deal. EU leaders have offered unprecedented partnership: FTA, aviation, research, security, foreign policy. EU will protect cornerstones of single market.
Topics on Twitter are often not defined by one hashtag. When using our analytics, vis, or alerts it can be worth expanding your search query to get the most detail possible. Here's a #brexit example for the last day showing 29,400 tweets. Full report:  1/4
.@Nigel_Farage for London mayor? #Brexit campaigner hints at SHOCK bid to oust Sadiq Khan 
Damn that far-right Dyson, spending and investing money in the UK. Doesn't he know #Brexit was voted for by racists? He is literally supporting fascism.
This is a good example of how what people are being told on the ground and the realities of #Brexit are often not the same. Brexit zealots have consistently lied to these people - people who’s jobs are now at risk. :-( 
Some very breathless reporting/reading of @MichelBarnier remarks y'day. So what is happening on #Brexit? Some thoughts on talking with both sides. 1/Thread
James Dyson urges Theresa May to be “bold” and “embrace” #Brexit “It would be unforgivable if the Government does not grab this opportunity with both hands“If we embrace it, Brexit can supercharge British technology and refocus minds on global trade”

Amongst all the rhetoric and posturing from the #Leave campaign, I've never heard an economic case for #Brexit having been made. Lots of soundbites, but no actual numbersAnd no case for #Brexit delivering a tightening of border controls, if indeed they're neededIt's pointless
. #Brexit is like putting a man on Mars. It may be successful, over the next 50 years, with huge combined effort & cost, many unintended consequences & multiple failures we will have to openly admit & learn from. It was never going to be easy & should never have been sold as such

Theresa May visited South Africa and Nigeria - as a somewhat knee jerk response to #Brexit.Angela Merkel is visiting Senegal, Ghana and Nigeria because the number one issue in the EU is illegal immigration.It's not like either leader has some "grand strategy" for engagement.

#TheresaMay gave herself the right to change her mind on #Brexit, so why deny this same right to the UK electorate?
Theresa May appeals to the narrow-minded, mean-spirited, zero-sum mentality of the core #Brexit supporters. #PeoplesVote
My Norwegian colleagues think #Brexit is totally fucking crazy. I categorically do not disagree.
Raab isn't pointing the gun at his own head. He and the #Brexit elite would profit very nicely from a no-deal #Brexit. He's pointing the gun at us, the British people, the hostages who will be pushed off the #Brexit cliff if his gang doesn't get what it wants.#PeoplesVote
The cost of #Brexit is astronomical.When is govt going to tell us how it proposes to pay for Brexit?.If we cannot afford adequate benefits to enable our poor families to feed their children during the school holidaysHOW CAN WE AFFORD #BREXIT?.
Indeed like @A50challenge it doesn’t have to even win permission for full hearing to get results. This is about building pressure. Ideally #Brexit needs to be stopped by #May surrendering. The tories will gain credibility if they choose that option. Everything else ends in ruin

#Brexit is a right wing coup which wants to destroy democracy, make people poorer and less free. It’s regressive, cruel and depressing but it’s definitely NOT ever interesting.

#Brexit isn't glorious independence. It's a shambolic retreat from Europe by a frightened, confused and criminally deceived nation, that has lost its grip on the modern world and prefers to blame others for its self-inflicted failings.#PeoplesVote #Brexit
The far-right Guardian is attacking the EU. So typical of the Eurosceptic British press. We in the EU love diversity. That's why we keep importing more and more. Haven't they seen the migrants landing in Spain? Unlike the hard right #Brexit Britain.
TM criticises Russian £ laundering in UK then a jaunt to Nigeria talking trade with a country that has rep for corruption. Her struggle to show some good news in spite of #Brexit is pathetic. PM making UK look desperate just to satisfy her right wing fanatics. #FBPE #PeoplesVote
Nothing captures the futility of #Brexit like this.If Brexit goes ahead our first 'post Brexit trade pact' will be to rollover an existing EU trade deal with six African countries.Confirming we can't do a better deal than the one we already have as full EU members. 
Do you remember the government saying that they were considering a ban on live exports for slaughter? If so, your memory seems to be better than the politicians’! Remind @michaelgove to take urgent action for animals:  #Brexit #ProtectTheBill

#African #trade deals are not a breakthrough, just a few of many deals Britain needs just to keep the SAME beneficial trading terms with over 60 other countries we now enjoy as an EUmember. They’re the “roll over” deals LiamFox promised to have ready “one second after #brexit”

One of the most distressing things about UK politics today is that there are so many stupid people in the government who readily speak utter tosh, with conviction. #Brexit

German Foreign Ministry on #Brexit: Germany would like an ambitious and close partnership w/ the UK. However, the priority is EU unity and further development of the EU. We will not decontruct #SingleMarket or allow special rules. 
Has the #Brexit referendum had any impact on UK trade? I teamed up with Dr Huw Edwards (Loughborough) and Dr Mustapha Douch (Lougborough) to find out. What we found: exports are around 15% down to our sample of both EU and non-EU countries. Full paper: 
The EU hasn’t just strengthened disabled people’s rights, it safeguards them too. #Brexit would put them at risk. MUST READ: @xrosiemckennax from @FFSake_
And a bigger platform needs to be given to the #Remain activists who have the personality & character to engage the apathetic and communicate the importance of stopping #Brexit. We have such talent in our community that needs to be supported not constantly criticised & undermined
Yep. PSA: it is time that not just #Brexit opponents, but supporters, and Conservatives as much as the left, said a firm no to Russian attacks on UK sovereignty, Brexit intervention included. And from now on, defending Britain is the focus of this account. cc @RussianEmbassy
I love space. Don’t use space to make #Brexit look like a good idea. We’re choosing to piss away good money on a project we decided to walk away from because of a load of lies.
From now on, @LouiseBagshawe my chat account is going to be dedicated to UK issues and fighting Russian influence on #Brexit and creating racial and religious division in Britain. cc  @RussianEmbassy
Conservatives, be careful. Accounts like @BrexitTory_ say things lots of @Conservatives and #Brexit supporters agree with, but the account isn’t British. It’s run by the enemies of the United Kingdom. We are patriots first, I hope. “she” never mentioned Ed Miliband in 2011. 
This , in one tweet, is why #Labour should oppose #Brexit. And tour the Heartlands with these figures regarding the #NHS I and many others  have said: it's either #BrexitOrTheNHS.We  cannot have both.Unless we sell/lease bits of it to US :#BigPharma; the House of Saud;China
Had a load of remoaners and #FBPE types say how Juncker is "just a Civil Servant" so it's OK that he is not elected. Yeah, what's the head of "just a civil service" doing at the G7 debating with top heads of government? Does the Head of the UK Civil Service do that? No! #Brexit 
RHA is calling for #Brexit implementation period to apply even if there is no deal.  UK and EU Governments no where near ready for March 19, nor are businesses. Time to admit this. @ChrisGraylingMP @DominicRaab @theresa_may @MichelBarnier
Success for Trump is putting a gun to the head of trade partners and forcing them to make concessions.Rees-Mogg & Johnson want to put us at the mercy of this bullying USA. Why should we not call them traitors!#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
.@TheRCN says #Brexit poses an “immediate risk to the provision of safe and effective care” in a letter today.Brexit will make our NHS worse. No one voted for that. #PeoplesVote please.
We Remainers cannot use violence as a political tool, but we can threaten to work tirelessly to ensure the #Brexit liars, crooks, cheats & charlatans are prosecuted and punished. Demographic & political change can make that a realistic possibility. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
GMB ballots members on #PeoplesVote. Nurses & RCN already support idea as new facts showing tragedy of #Brexit become apparent & others join daily. Leavers need to realise it's OK to change your mind when lies exposed. Labour need to see JC & clique losing, not gaining, support
So there be cool #Brexit things happening about town this SEPTEMBER-- Rally with @KateHoeyMP & @GiselaStuart  6th- @BigTentIdeas 8th- London Brexit Debate with @danielmgmoylan  & @MissVHewson 13th - "Brexit/Gender Debate'" with @Fox_Claire e moi  20th- @LondonLeavers 27th
I'm increasingly hopeful #Brexit won't be delivered because trust in politicians has evaporated, and has been replaced by a renewed faith in #expert opinion - such as that of @JasonJHunter - and proper #democracy. Hence the ever-growing demands for a #PeoplesVote 
Watch live: @DominicRaab answers EU Committee’s questions on #Brexit 
Given that the referendum was advisory, it is the democratic right of opponents of #Brexit to campaign to overturn the government's policy, and it is equally the democratic right of its supporters to campaign in its favour. That's democracy. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
The Government could face a #Brexit defeat next Tuesday if the Lords send back ‘a Customs Union’ amendment to the Commons on the Cross-Border Trade Bill. @LabourLordsUK must not let this opportunity go to waste.
No one has ever said no to Rees Mogg. He literally thinks money talks.  Rather than international law, treaties and rules. He’s a toddler in a very posh suit #brexit 
According to Economist Intelligence Unit our friends the Poles are being most supportive to our country over #Brexit to ensure we get fair deal. We will remember our Polish allies and can always depend on them! Daniel @lewis_goodall @PolandMFA @foreignoffice
The UK are not the goodies, or the underdogs, in #scallopwars. Our position on dredging out of season, fishing rights and conservation is embarrassing and shaming and it will only get much, much worse with #Brexit.
Let's be clear, #brexit is not about the EU, it's not even about Britain. It's about the rise of the Right globally and the march to fascism.  When Farage holds #brexit "rallies", they are a call to arms not for brexit, but for the rise of the Far Right and fascist regime. #FBPE
The UKIP/Far Right hockey stick graph.Before the #Brexit referendum only around 10% of the population were the slightest bit interested in the EU.Then along came Farage and his racist xenophobic pals to stir up hatred of all things foreign and Bang, the genie is out the bottle 
Our latest win comes from @Winch_Labour!Brilliant to hear they have passed their version of the @Remain_Labour & @Labour4EU motion for #Lab18. It calls on the party to back a #PeoplesVote and campaign to #Remain in the EU.#Brexit is not inevitable.
Same thing is happening over here with British politicians trying to pysh through a reckless chaotic #Brexit which benefits only the rich. Global politics has become deeply corrupt
Erm. The EU is stopping tax avoidance (their directive comes into force on 1st April 2019)#Brexit happens 29th March 2019Coincidence? No.#VoteLeave funded by virtually all the billionaire tax avoiders so they can continue to offshore their wealth without EU stopping it.
To summarise this excellent article; Wales, the poorest part of the UK,   has been shafted by austerity, and will be hit hardest by #Brexit.  Very  (very!) tough times ahead. Buckle up. Oh, and resist #Brexit 
When a brexiteer asks why do you want to give all your power back to the EU when you become independent? #indyref #scotref #brexit #DisolveTheUnion
Today's @Independent cartoon... #TheresaMay #MayInAfrica #Brexit 
Pleased to welcome Secretary of State @DavidGauke to #Telford today to engage with business leaders @marcheslep to discuss #Brexit implications positive frank discussions - very helpful.
I don't agree with you.Read the Manifesto & Keir Starmer's six tests on #BrexitCan you give me just ONE example where the Labour Leader indulges in *bickering* ?No you CAN'T - because he rises above it !!Turn your fire on the *culprits - AND the Tories . 
Pleased to hear that managers of high profile football clubs have shown #Brexit the red card.  The economic calamity that is #Brexit is already adversely affecting the UK and if the Govt’s disastrous plans proceed, football would be relegated across the UK.
Typical Right Wing Tory Headline .... Pound slides as Brexit fears continue to grip market..... Pound slides ? FFS The Pound has crashed and the UK is now Bankrupt thanks to the thick Tories and #brexit Morons @BBCNews #r4today
Whereas being ruled by this unelected person with his "Sciatica" is NOT a threat to our liberty, rights and prosperity?!#Brexit 
French fishing vessels in British water - clashes on the English Channel!RETWEET to remind the French that WATERLOO SHALL COMETH AGAIN if they continue to plunder our fishing stocks!98% of UK fishing industry want #Brexit - UK waters for UK vessels! 
This is utter nonsense from Soubs.  We shld be delighted & welcoming new members whatever their #Brexit views. Delighted tht @HarlowTories membership has increased by 24% because we"re an active #compassionate community focused @Conservatives Association
EU citizens! We have had such good results in recent elections by calling #Brexit voters names and labelling them as racists and fascists. We need to keep up the good work. It will definitely mean we win a #peoplesvote and stop the UK leaving the EU.
Normal Conservatives: A surge in membership is a very good thing. It reinvigorates the party and will help us win elections.Anna Soubry: No new members unless we can be sure they are basically Lib Dems in disguise so they don't deselect me.@Anna_Soubry #Brexit @Conservatives
The #brexit bar has dropped through the floor since 2016. We've gone from:-"Sunlit uplands""It won't be the end of the world" We demand a #PeoplesVote!!  #FBPE
EU citizens! #Brexit will leave the Brits literally shitting themselves. Thousands upon thousands of portaloos will line every road to cope with the queues of traffic, gridlocked because so many people are trying to flee to the EU, and stuck at customs.
New analysis from Eurfyl ap Gwilym and Gerry Holtham on the Welsh economy, #Brexit and the future of public services.  today on #clickonwales
Volunteers out in #Tring #Hertfordshire asking local people their opinion on #Brexit. Just as we are seeing across the entire country, people 'Strongly Agree' that there should be a #peoplesvote on the final Brexit deal.
"estimated 35 French boats appeared to surround five British vessels" in the English Channel."The French say they are trying to protect a scallop bed that they accuse the British of over-fishing off the coast of Normandy.Will get really exiting after #brexit. 
British fishermen vote Brexit because they want to stop other countries legally fishing in “their waters”. British fishermen then proceed to do just that and get pissed off when they get a taste of their own medicine. The irony is just too much  #brexit #brexitshambles
"There are risks that, if not credibly addressed, may damage population health": @theRCN support a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal: 
He's not helping. A no deal #Brexit will destroy British fishing. Our vessels will not be able to land fish in EU Member State Ports and we will not be able to export fish to the EU.
I hate to inform you Mr Rees-Mogg but trust in your kind of politics has already evaporated.When the country cannot access good healthcare & medicines, it may well evaporate some more.#Brexit 
Anyone who thinks UK will get a sweetheart trade deal with US after #Brexit should watch how Washington strong-arms Canada in #Nafta renegotiations this week. This is reality.
Right now politics is held together only because the consequences of Brexit are hypothetical. We won't know until we know. When we do, the whole political landscape will change. May's great deception will end the Tories.#Brexit 
“uncoupled from their own history, “unmoored from basic geography“adrift from economic reality.Where @rafaelbehr pins the false premise of the #Brexit trade narrative...and MPs like @DominicRaab who propagate it.
Anyone that is in any doubt about the farce that is #Brexit that our nasty clueless Government AND equally inept acquiescent Labour opposition are driving us towards, read this thread about bands touring Europe after 29/3/19 
Will voted leave but here he is on @SkyNews explaining why he changed his mind and why a no deal #brexit would be a disaster for the UK and the 'global britain' he voted for is not what will happen.@will_dryofoc #remainernow
When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of August 28, 2018 at 08:50AM, £1 buys 1.1004€. A weak currency is a sign of problems in an economy. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
26% of German aid budget is spent in Germany, on their migrant crisis.  Costs have risen 37-fold in just 3 years.  Read our exclusive #Brexit report: 
Aston Martin boss @AndyatAston, asked why he chose to list in London amid #Brexit turmoil, tells @BBCr4today: "The benefit of being a luxury company is that we are relatively impervious to those kinds of changes".GREAT corporate speak for "our clients are too rich to care".
Credit where it’s due: thanks to @bbcnickrobinson @BBCr4today for enabling @FairtradeUK to set record straight on #Africa & #EU tariffs: most African exports to EU already tariff-free, & there’s a risk some may face UK tariffs post- #Brexit unless UK rolls over EU trade deals.
"Germany Takes '2nd-Most Generous Nation' Award From UK" - but only because they're spending 1/4 of their 'foreign aid' in Germany, on migrants. Great research from the #Brexit Facts4EU team: 
May's threat to launch a rival satellite system proves how pointless #Brexit is. Total costs will run into billions to achieve nothing. The government squanders tax payers money as though there's a bottomless pit. #Leavers, did you vote for this waste?
It strikes me that those who voted to leave feel they will be immune from the effects of #Brexit.  When will they realise that apart from the Brexeratti, the bots and the trolls, everyone who voted leave or remain are going to feel the effects of #Brexit?
So #Leavers we've established the UK trades all over the world, Parliament is sovereign, democratically elected MEPs represent the people, UK already has control over its borders,EU migration is essential, there's no £350 a week for the NHS. So why #Brexit and damage the economy?
At The Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference we will be “Re-making The Case For Europe: re-learning why the EU has been a force for good” with @JMPSimor @acgrayling @albawhitewolf & @RCorbettMEP. A long overdue discussion!
It appears the vast majority of MPs still haven't bothered to read the official DExEU impact assessments of #Brexit. How can they make informed decisions without reading the data?Only one answer. They don't care, just so long as their salaries and pension are safe.

Well done ⁦@Nigel_Farage⁩ and ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩. Your retro nationalist buffoonery is costing the Treasury £440 million a week, way more than the UK ever contributed to the EU budget #Brexit 
#Brexit , an interpretative dance. 
#Brexit: Nobody voted to be poorer. Yet we are & when questioned @theresa_may has nothing to say other than 'the people have spoken'. Blindly forcing this upon us whilst WE live with the consequences! It's time to make our voices heard. Join us from 4th Sept 11-6pm #StopBrexit!

Holding a second #Brexit referendum would “further inflame the idea of an arrogant political class which isn’t listening, and isn’t dealing with the issues that gave rise to the referendum in the first place”- Andy Burnham, mayor Greater Manchester. One northerner who gets it? 
EU citizens! We have uncovered new evidence from the EU referendum on #Brexit. Remain actually won by 63% to 37%. But it was covered up by a far-right conspiracy of Russian bots and populists. Thank goodness we have good citizens like these to shine the light of truth upon it. 
Worth a watch - well done to the reporter repeatedly questioning #TheresaMay who refuses to say if she would back #Brexit now 
If you think there is an iota of trust in politics, then you, Jacob, are a foolThanks to dishonest, self-motivated, manipulative leaders such as yourself, the people have no faith in the UK political system to deliver a better quality of life#Brexit is symptomatic of distrust 
#Brexit will hurt all of us - it's just some of us will feel the pain quicker than others. Let's put our differences aside; whatever other political goals we may have, stopping #brexit needs to come first. #the5million #FBPE#FinalSayForAll
By arguing that a #PeoplesVote could provoke violent disorder Gardiner and McDonnell are saying that the far-right should be allowed to hold our politics to ransom. Article by @IanDunt. #Brexit
Certain individuals would have MPs believe voters will never trust them again if they fail to deliver #Brexit. That’s a fraction of the 37% who voted leave as opposed to the 63% who didn’t vote leave who will never trust them if they do deliver Brexit.
Excellent. Well done Bono! You are a true European. A thought that becomes a feeling. This is what we need. Feelings. It's when people start thinking about the EU that we get the problems, like #Brexit.
‘Brexit won’t be the end of the world’ seems to May’s new #Brexit applause point. Don’t remember that on side of any buses
Did arrogant Theresa May ever protest against Apartheid?#Mandela #SouthAfrica #channel4news #bbcnews #brexit 
We've been subjected to a barrage of pro no-deal propaganda from the Tory apparatus for a while - but today would indicate that the government is now a willing participant in the deception and is setting the EU up to take the blame for failure. This is a sham negotiation#Brexit
If you want to listen to someone who really knows about international trade, I recommend you follow @JasonJHunter. He may scare the bejeesus out of you with talk of #Brexit and WTO consequences.
TM rubbishes her own chancellor's negative #Brexit forecast whilst off to Africa whose total trade with UK is worth a fraction of biz  with the EU. Clearly he has better grasp of figures than her and is probably a better dancer! #FBPE
The trouble is that the #Brexit that you and others sold is undeliverable. Trust in politicians is going to be damaged either way. You guys might get more respect by saying sorry we can't deliver Brexit rather than crashing the economy breaking the NHS and destroying the UK.
#EUsupergirl @BylineFest "Economic Impacts" of #Brexit event at #BylineFest  #ThereIsNoBrexitDividend "People still believe there will be £350m per week for the #NHS because the politicians continue to lie to them. It is outrageous and we have to hold them to account" 
Tell that to workers in the manufacturing sector in the #EastMidlands who voted #Leave on the basis we’d get a #Brexit deal that would deliver a better economy and an extra £350million a week for the #NHS
Pro #Brexiter Andrew Neil has no idea of what the benefits of #Brexit are yet still slavishly supports it. What an idiot. 
During street surgery today bloke tells me ‘you are not a democrat, you should accept #brexit and shut up’. What a misunderstanding of democracy, democracy is the right to speak up. @BathforEurope
Great news for such a precious Welsh environment! So much of this exciting project will be funded by the EU. I wonder who will fund such ambitious projects to restore our wildlife and natural environment after #Brexit? 
The #Brexit crunch is coming, so after the summer break I've written a piece looking at the 10 questions we should be looking at....but are too busy shouting at each other to consider. Here are my ten... /1 questions
.@thomasbrake "Refusing to show MPs the full damage a no-deal Brexit would inflict on our country makes a mockery of the discredited mantra 'Taking Back Control'. The Government must stop these murky games and pledge to release this analysis." #ExitFromBrexit #FinalSay #Brexit 
The ‘People’ are deeply frustrated that @duponline has blackmailed @theresa_may into NOT accepting ‘Special Status’, and after over 600 Days, haven’t told us their plan to save Multinational Businesses, employing 95,000 people. #Brexit 
WATCH: The promises made about #Brexit have changed dramatically since 2016. We've gone from claims that we'll 'thrive' to 'it wouldn't be the end of the world'.New facts like this emerging are exactly why I’m calling for a #PeoplesVote. Please RT:
96% of Scotland's Westminster representatives requested that all UK nations should agree before #Brexit was carried. The Tories, with 1 MP, overruled. It was a UK vote because England decided it would be.
Boris Johnson 2016: "We'll have our EU cake and eat it!"Theresa May 2018: "Not the end of the world ..."#Brexit #NoDealBrexit
I think this should be Labour policy as there will be no way to fully dislodge the mindset of those who voted #Brexit unless facts are brought to light first  in an inquiry and then court cases. 
Chrissy, an intensive care nurse, was one of many people in Newquay who wanted to tell us why she wants a #PeoplesVote on any final #Brexit deal.#Cornwall #NHS
Since #Brexit politicians want to remove so many of our standards on food, pollution and so on, it's worth asking why we have such standards? Because, if profit is put above our health and welfare, people actually die. Simple as that.

Thank you Germany & @HeikoMaas for your continued support and your strong comments today: “We have to avoid a hard border, it is a pivotal issue. Any insecurity or deterioration in relation to Northern Ireland must not happen as a consequence of #Brexit.”    
By saying that no deal "wouldn't be the end of the world", @theresa_may basically admits that a no deal Brexit will harm the UK, just that other things could harm it moreThat is unacceptable, & re-enforces the need for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal
It’s not too late to save #Brexit, but we have to move fast and make it very clear that we expect our elected representatives to #StandUp4Brexit Please email your MP, follow @StandUp4Brexit and make a donation to our fighting fund at

“It is a sad paradox of #Brexit that no country has contributed more to the creation of the Single Market, and the promotion of free trade, than the United Kingdom.” - @simoncoveney speaking to the annual conference of German Ambassadors in #Berlin.
Btw: Rumour, from #OneWhoKnows (and does!). Possible snap election before March so that #TheresaMay can lock down her #Brexit plans. If #Labour opposes Brexit (not just HER Brexit).... the Party walks it.
Latest construction survey from @BuildingNews shows around 70% of builders oppose #Brexit & think TM deal a failure. Important as it employs 3m, is worth 7% of GDP, and is responsible for housing, HS2, hospitals & Heathrow. More and more support for #PeoplesVote
2 years ago, we were told that #brexit was the path to a better future. Now, it’s a matter reassuring us that  it won’t be “the end of the world”Every day, it becomes clearer that #BrexitReality won’t be what was promised. No wonder opinion is shifting...
#Brexit stupidity killing UK science, for what?> "The UK has coordinated more Horizon 2020 projects than any other country to date. In a no-deal Brexit, this leadership role is stone cold dead. That prospect is impacting projects being prepared right now."

Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham accuses 'arrogant' second #referendum campaigners of ignoring why people voted  #Brexit 
A moment that encapsulates why we ended up with #Brexit.@BBCr4today journalist Sarah Smith & UK’s Africa minister discussing how Britain & Africa will benefit post brexit from the removal of EU tariffs...that don’t exist.Don’t blame ordinary voters, blame the complicit media.
"Brexit won't be the end of the world but we are stockpiling food and medicine and putting the army on standby in case of unrest..." was apparently too long a campaign message to get on the side of the #Brexit bus!
Another thread from the priceless @JasonJHunter on how the EU will have to charge tariffs on UK exports after #Brexit - thanks to rules the UK helped to draw up 
Theresa May claims that a no-deal Brexit “wouldn’t be the end of the world”. Theresa May is not a moderate trying to hold the line. Her record marks her down as a xenophobic nationalist who sees democracy & law as barely tolerable impediments to government.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
If the Government backtracks on promises for a greener farming policy after #Brexit it will be failing farmers and nature.  55 NGOs call for @theresa_may to keep her promise.  #AgricultureBill 
It is ironic that those Leavers backing #Brexit because of sovereignty are supporting right-wing politicians like who want to hand over much of that sovereignty to a super-rich elite who couldn't care less about Britain and its people.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
This is an excellent thread in the impact of #brexit on aviation. This particular tweet makes the point very well. It's not politics, it's the law, it's insurance, it's safety. It's another example of why this government has got its head in the clouds. #FBPE
Remember a time when BBC journalists knew what they were talking about? When they were the brightest & best?@BBCsarahsmith has a discussion about non existent EU tariffs on African goods.This is how we got #brexit.People were informed by a completely uninformed media.
Of course it's Labour's fight, don't be so bloody stupid! #brexit would make the poor poorer - the very people Labour are meant to help. Corbyn colluding in the #brexitshambles goes against everything Labour are meant to stand for.
Don’t recall that ringing endorsement on the side of the bus. “It won’t be the end of the world”. Fact remains No Deal will be painful & there is no informed consent to crash out, no-transition #Brexit. 
.@rafaelbehr eviscerates the claim that #Brexit will make Britain more open to the world in just two paragraphs.EU membership is a springboard to global trade, not a barrier to it.If we value a global Britain, we need a #PeoplesVote and we need to #Remain in the EU.
#TheThickofIt was a British satirical tv series in which ministers' media interviews were always less than convincing. This is not a scene from the series.#Brexit  
This is the sort of interview where lies go unchallenged that brought us #brexit. It is also one of the reasons that fewer people now trust @BBCNews. Shameful rubbish. #r4today
#Brexit hero to zero in one easy step.... yes/no

Brussels keeps proving that Britain is better off out:  #Brexit
Emmanuel Macron for once has done the UK a favour, by rejecting Theresa May's plea for help to rescue her #Brexit plan This is another nail in the coffin for the #ChequersPlanWTO Brexit or free trade deal it is then Good!#StandUp4Brexit
At What Point Do We Admit #Brexit Was About Tax Evasion? | Shout Out UK 
Macron rejects May's plea for help to rescue her #Brexit plan.Another day..another nail in the #Brexit coffin. There is no 'Good Deal'..Bring it to a head asap...No Fudging..No Transition..No Extensions..just give us the #PeoplesVote & a #Remain option. 
On his epic train journey around Ireland it was great to welcome @Andrew_Adonis back to Belfast for a fascinating afternoon to discuss #Brexit @peoplesvote_uk @OFOCBrexit
May & Corbyn both supported #Remain. Both are now desperately working for Leave - despite the woeful, illegal campaign, the narrow margin of the result & the warnings about the UK's world standing post-#Brexit.I do not trust either of them. I will never vote for either of them.
The #ChequersPlan isn't the #Brexit we were promisedIt's important that we contact our MPs to express our views & ask them to #StandUp4BrexitI've sent my email, have you? If not, why not do it now? It takes 10 minsIt's vital that your MP hears you
I still find it utterly demoralizing that there are people still supporting #Brexit when there is not a single, tangible benefit for the vast majority of the UK.The Disaster Capitalists must be thankful there are so many Brexiters incapable of reasoned thought.
When it comes to #Brexit, we must not let the politicians forget about animals. Please call on @michaelgove to protect animal welfare when we leave the EU >>  #ProtectTheBill #StopLiveTransport

The #Brexiteers use the Greek experience as an illustration of how badly the #EU behaves towards sovereign states and their populations - showing they understand neither Greece nor the EU .  The comparison between bailout Greece & #Brexit Britain is nonsensical 
Joachim Lang, German Industry chief: “We suspect that the effects of a hard #Brexit will be considerably more serious than the British government is currently telling its citizens. And above all in Britain itself.” 
Great to see so many new followers. Welcome aboard the #UKEUchallenge!Big news coming on Friday August 31.  #UKEUchallenge #Brexit
This was a  campaign #Brexit poster.This was how the #Brexit vote was won. Preying on the genuine fears and concerns of the public.This is why there should now be a #PeoplesVote, now the truth is out.
Immigration, apparently too much of it into Britain from the EU led to lots of people voting to leave, but less people coming from the EU post #Brexit means more people coming in from Africa/Asia and elsewhere, why don't we have a vote to leave the world too? #PeoplesVote
MEP: Theresa May went in with a begging bowl accepting whatever EU was offering.She has made such a mess of negotiations.It was quite clear vote meant to Leave EU meant taking back full powers from Brussels - not a loose 'semi remain' #EU model.#Brexit
This is where the EU-27 & Commission, and UK Government positions are on #Brexit at the moment.Out of this little conundrum where do we end up? 
Once again the Brexiters are wailing that the EU is bullying the UK. We warned them that the EU was the stronger party & would look after the 27 not us, but they said that was project fear and that the UK held all the cards. Yet more stinking #LeaveLies!#PeoplesVote #Brexit

Euro is robbery of the century!We won’t be paying €20bn EU contributions!After all, EU is disintegrating itself.It’s over, not worth it!We won’t kiss Frau Merkel’s shoes no more, we won’t kneel to that Macron bully.Let’s end #EU kleptocracy!#Brexit
Securing a deal with the EU is top priority - but as a no-deal #Brexit looks increasingly likely, it's vital to prepare for it.Enter @iealondon's new series of briefing papers! First round: 'Planes won't fly' 'Mobile phone bills will soar'
No @edvaizey. Only people betraying #Brexit are those trying to enable the pathetic Chequers Agreement (which will never be agreed by @UKParliament nor #EU), & every @Conservatives MP who is trying his/her best to stop #Brexit from happening. You are all pathetic, & will lose.
Macron tells May to do one, as she pleads for help to rescue her infantile #Brexit plan. 
So, the big #Brexit news of the day appears to be that a SECRET MEMO was leaked outlining the CLANDESTINE PLAN of a SECRET GROUP - that is, in fact, completely public - to give the people of the UK a vote on the final EU deal - which is, in fact, their publicly stated mission.
 together bigger economically than whole of EU. Post #Brexit this strong Anglo-Saxon economic and military partnership will accelerate. We will prove to other EU countries thoughtful of their futures that you don’t need to be in a political union in order to trade.
Right, this lad has to be trolling now. Swapping the world’s largest economic bloc for better relations with Nigerian will benefit no one in the UK post #brexit 
As @WilliamKeegan writes in The @Guardian, ‘The only sensible option is to remain in the #EU.’ He calls on @UKLabour to ‘get its act together’ and help save the nation from #Brexit. Read the extract of his article on @Reasons2Remain #Facebook page. Link: 
It’s Monday.And after a week spent feeling the odd man out among Greek, French, German, Italian fellow travellers, returned in the hope that this #Brexit nonsense had been scrapped.Only to learn that Mad May is now calling for a ‘Space Race’ with the EU post-Brexit.#StopBrexit
 No-deal #Brexit Fear-Checker No. 1: Planes won't fly"UK & EU would still be able to make arrangements which are already extended to non-EU members, such as an ‘air services agreement’ to keep planes flying"
#Brexit doesn't need economic or political arguments in favour bc it's "the will of the people", you say? In that case, it may be wise to be certain of "the will of the people" once they have heard the economic and political arguments *against* #Brexit. #PeoplesVote
More than four-fifths of the World economy (82%) is outside the EU27, according to the World Bank. 90% of global economic growth is occurring outside the EU, note the IMF and the EU Commission.Fairly clear, then, where Britain's attention should now be directed to! #Brexit

#Brexit will strip millions of British of their #EU citizenship. Many are proud Europeans who wish to keep this status and associated rights. Please support this initiative calling on @EU_Commission to explore ways to establish permanent EU citizenship

#Brexit: A European Parliament study recommends a "bespoke legal agreement" for future data flows between the UK and the EU. Adequacy is not enough. #EUdataP 
Never forget. This man asked people to vote on #Brexit. Without defining what Brexit meant. Without carrying out any projections of consequences. All in an (unsuccessful) attempt to settle an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all his mates and f***ed off into the sunset. 
D Davis urges us to ‘start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it’.This is the last refuge of these scoundrels. No answers to valid questions about disastrous harm of #Brexit, just empty rhetoric 
If Labour are supposed 2B helpless in Opposition re stopping #Brexit because they aren't in Govt, as many Corbynites state in defence of their semi complicit policy; there really is no point putting them in Govt. I wouldn't employ someone with a track record like that.#FinalSay
History has shown that when people come together with good purpose, that everything can change. So it is with #Brexit. Keep on fighting for a #PeoplesVote to #StopBrexit and for us to be an open and tolerant nation again.
Exactly right. As ever it is important we realize that #brexit is not in fact about Europe. It is a far right extremist takeover and they are intent on burning the country we love.  #FBPE

#CANZUK is not a #Brexiteer idea. Sure, it finds favour with a lot of pro-#Brexit folks and they have their own reasons. However, you can and, in my view, should support a free trade and movement area across Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the U.K. if you voted #Remain...
Dominic Lawson correctly points out that #Brexit is being led by Remainers.We have a PM who doesn't believe in Brexit, we need a full-on Brexit Tory leadership challenge, not another general election.

One of many problems of #Brexit is that it diverts attention and resources away from other issues in the UK.The vicious combination of a need for financing new Brexit-related projects with a forecasted drop of tax revenue will make it harder to fund our diminishing police force.

Oh believe you me  Jacob rees Mogg cares not.  That someone who acts like a malevolent Planter's Mr Peanut can actually be a political force, tells you that the class system is alive and at its destructive best, in Britain. #Brexit 
But why a deal? Either you are in or you are out. UK was IN with all the OUTS it wanted, but now wants to be OUT with all the INS. It does not work this way. A true out is fantastically detrimental to the UK. Which is why there are no benefits in #brexit. 
No you have allowed this non issue to dominate negotiations. No one is going to enforce a "hard border" even under WTO Brexit but the EU try to use it as an excuse to nix every good suggestion we haveCall their bluff and get on with a Canada style deal!#StandUp4Brexit #Brexit

It’s hard to believe that a senior politician is so ill informed about Ireland + the politics of the #Brexit Irish border issue that he could make comments like these. We have left “the troubles” behind us, through the sincere efforts of many, + we intend on keeping it that way. 
EU citizens! More young people flock to the banner. Clearly you can see literally everyone has changed their minds about #Brexit. 
Rifles pointed in their windows, watch towers, barbed wire, detentions, mass delays across a 500km border with 208 crossings? This man is dangerously ignorant #GFA #brexit 
WATCH: Little Gary’s #Brexit story (#Leave voter) "As soon as we voted Brexit, my fish prices went up 25%...We're gonna be so much worse off...So many more people now understand...Put it back to us!"[Do you feel embarrassed you've changed your mind?] No!
The division of the population into 'the people' and the others is a classic totalitarian tactic which dehumanises those who oppose the leaders. It is the rulers, of course, who decide who are the people, and who are their enemies.  #PeoplesVote #brexit
Well said Owen 1) Cameron won a majority promising a referendum2) The referendum was the biggest vote in British history3) At GE2017, 85% of the votes were for pro-#Brexit parties4) The people know the Chequers white paper does not deliver on three key Brexit pledges 
It's a sad fact that the poor and vulnerable will neither survive #Brexit nor a neo liberal centrist government inside the EU.
Today I have transferred my business operations headquarters to Berlin, out of London, to retain our EU domains. The UK is clearly now closed for European based business. I'm not as I love all my fellow Europe based clients, hence the move.@nickreeves9876 #brexit @danieldneill1
It is staggering, but also depressingly predictable, that some Brexiters are, in one and the same breath, claiming to support #brexit democracy while trying to suppress a #PeoplesVote by brandishing the threat of mob violence. This is how fascists use referendums. #StopBrexit
Final results of the #Brexit -o-meter just in (we’ve run out of stickers). Pretty conclusive. The good people of #Porty want an #independent #Scotland in #Europe - happy #BigBeachBusk
One thing we have gathered from the good people of Droitwich is that they no longer have confidence in #brexit They don't trust the politicians and it is time for a #PeoplesVote .The days most pleasing thing was the number of re-thinking Leavers we encountered. #thetideisturning
Does anyone else think that all the noise about a no deal #Brexit is smoke & mirrors to make us feel happy about any deal actually made? I don’t want a bloody deal, I want a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain
This is devastating and needs to be widely heard. Any time #Brexit advocates face someone with real world knowledge & experience they’re rapidly reduced to incoherent sloganeering. It’s also terrifying. (h/t @campbellclaret)
A great turn out for today's #PeoplesVoteNE rally in #Newcastle.All over the UK, including here in the North East, the British people are demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal.For more information, or to join the campaign, visit .

On to our last roll of #BollockstoBrexit stickers at #ReadingFestival! 20,000 stickers handed out. People were queuing up for them and signing the #PeoplesVote people. Good to see young people taking their futures into their own hands! With @OpenBritainRead #brexit 
The good folk of #Portobello have spoken at the #BigBeachBusk - overwhelmingly for #independent #ScotlandinEurope over #Brexit Britain 
#Brexit has a tipping point. We are almost there. Don’t give up. Don’t get off the #Remain side of the see saw. We can only do this together. United, knowing we are on the right side of history and democracy. Have a fab weekend #FBPE peeps#SaturdayMorning #BankHolidayWeekend
Out in #Brixton this morning talking to people about #Brexit and #PeoplesVote. Passersby overwhelmingly in favour of having a say on the deal and stopping Brexit. @Another_Europe
The entire trade argument is a red herring. #Brexit is not about a trade deal. It’s about who makes the laws we have to live by. Trade is a smokescreen for the consolidation of unaccountable political power and the disenfranchisement of the nuisance formerly known as the voter.
Intellectual heavyweight and lead Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg Vs Intellectual non participant #Brexit#Moggmentum

"Get ten Leave voters and ask them all individually what Brexit looks like to them and you will get twenty different answers."This @RemainerNow explains why he changed his views on #Brexit and now supports a #PeoplesVote.
Looking at #Brexit, we see 3 priorities:1) staying together as EU272) agreeing on fair deal with the #UK3) getting prepared for the inevitable changes Brexit will bring.All of this is possible. We will spare no effort.@WeyandSabine @GermanyonBrexit
NOTE to Trolls.I am NOT interested in discussing what the Labour Leader may or may not have said in the dim & distant past.I AM interested in exposing & challenging the TORY record on Domestic Policy & their incompetent handling of #Brexit#JustSoAsYouKnow
SIR – No 10’s No-Deal briefing papers have been produced by civil servants who for past 45 years have worked obediently to commands of Brussels.No wonder the documents focus on perils of leaving the EU, with little focus on the benefits for UK to derive. - Telegraph#Brexit #EU
When Gardiner and McDonnell say that a #PeoplesVote risks violence, they saying to the far-right "Step up your threats, step up your violence, they are working, and can get you what you want". That is the politics of fascist mob rule. #brexit
2) #Brexit was an oversold idea, based on lies. It's foundations are in division, fear & extreme nationalism.  Any possible positives are trivial in comparison. Even for those who say "it's not about immigration" well, it's mostly about immigration.So there's no good Brexit
Parliamentary sovereignty is at risk because #Brexit has given power to the executive. The withdrawal act is setting precedent as the enabling act did in 30s Germany.Parliament has to remain sovereign or we face dictatorship. 
@Jacob_Rees_Mogg is offering @theresa_may & the @Conservatives a genuine get out of jail free with the alternative of a Super Canada #Brexit FTA + Ask  yourself why she's not bitten his hand off, b/c Mrs May has no intention of Leaving but bouncing back at the earliest possiblity

A lot of Dutch can speak 4+ languages fluently... Dutch, German, French, English plus maybe Russian, Italian or Spanish. The EU is a very different place when you can communicate effectively with people from so many other countries and cultures. #Brexit
Sorry, “I can’t go, we’ve friends coming round”, or “my dog’s got a birthday party”, just don’t cut it! If you are worried about leaving the #EU, you need to make your voice heard. Get out and march! Save the date. 20 October.  #Brexit #PeoplesVote
A no deal #Brexit is a disaster in waiting for #NHS !The 37 million items of medicine imported from the EU,for example, would face 44 new checks,requirements and controls. #Nightmare

Is it me or has the #Remain cause grown exponentially whilst the #Brexit one deflates by the day? It's now only the Govt, the Opposition & an army of fakes sustaining it & preventing its collapse.They've nothing new to offer to justify this #BrexitShambles.#FinalSay #StopBrexit
We shld remember the Labour Party was also whipped to back Govt A50 line w/o due diligence so the charge of negligence can be laid on both main parties albeit more on the Govt.I regret it's taken so long for the media to take #Brexit seriously & challenge the BS. Great Thread
Update: @BrexitBetrayal, captured at the top of this thread as a Mr. "John Johnson" - yet with Cyrillic in "his"profile - is now an unattractive woman. #Diversity #Brexit 
McDonnell backs claim that a #PeoplesVote risks social unrest.  So the Labour view is that mob rule should trump democracy. This is the politics of fascist thuggery. #brexit #StopBrexit
Debate turns to #Brexit, as it invariably does, but @ajcdeane nails a massive point about the WTO.We must shore up our position with the WTO & start talking to them. We may not wish for #NoDealBrexit but we MUST prepare for it.#SkyPapers

The key themes behind Britain's advice in the case of a 'no-deal' #Brexit: More red tape for firms, more expensive holidays for consumers and difficulty accessing UK banks for EU-based citizens 
An accident waiting to happen. Can’t wait for more safety standards to be abandon after #Brexit. Living in UK after April 2019 will be like playing Russian roulette every single day! I’m so excited (not)  
Trashing the pound hasn't helped to attract EU workers for farms or anything else.Nor has making EU workers feel unwelcome in our xenophobic country. If #Brexit happens the Brexiteers might have to step back even further than they're hoping: to those days on slavery.#Newsnight

I'm not having it that the UK would be short of sperm donors in the event of a Hard #Brexit. Millions of wankers voted for it.
I say regularly that #brexit is a cross party issue & partisan politics must be put aside.I'm followed by people of all parties & none. #RemainerNow folk come from all parties & none. I will celebrate any MP opposing brexit & criticise those not.So this is good to see.
This  is Massively, Massively Important!!A legal Challenge against the PM and #Brexit - main gist of argument: TM invoked #Article50 alone and against British constitutional law.Thanks @A50Challenge keep up the good work
Hello@Jacob_Rees_MoggYour job is not to make stacks of from a No deal crash and burn #BrexitYour job is to do what is best for your constituency, country and UK.Now, as the Australians say, do your fucking job.
Oh. Isn’t that the same argument that Barry Gardiner and john McDonnell were just using. Civil unrest if we don’t push through #Brexit. How interesting that #Trump and Brexit are cut from the same cloth. And it sure as hell isnt #democracy. We need to #StandUp2Brexit & Putin

BREAKING: Labour has announced that in the event of a no deal #Brexit, another vote could be implemented in an obvious attempt to overrun Brexit.Disrespect 17,4 million people and expect no repercussions? I don't f**king think so.
Maybe @DominicRaab's rather sweaty performance yesterday when he laid out the many thousands of extra UK Civil Servants that will be hired as a result of #Brexit reflects his embarrassment that he was so wrong. Could be the first of many mea culpas.

Oh dear. More "economic forecasts" from HM Treasury - this time on "no deal" #Brexit. Take with pinch of salt. Remember the last one in 2016: #Brexitvote would lead to recession & 500,000 increase in unemployment.
#Brexit: It is “not realistic” to believe the UK can begin trading under World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules the day after Brexit in March, the head of the intergovernmental group has said.

Seeing as #BBCBias has already admitted twice that it is editorial policy to support govt on #Brexit, this is laughable. Or is it an attempt to contain the damage?  #Today has already lost 800,000 listeners. Or it might just be fake news. Who knows? Try #channel4news instead
Yesterday, we released the first batch of Technical Notices to let businesses and citizens know how to prepare for the unlikely event of a no deal #Brexit.

Talking up the chances of “no deal” is a political strategy to lower expectations for what will be an inadequate #Brexit deal—and it’s working. Me on @Brexit

No Deal Brexiters like Rees-Mogg claim UK can go straight to WTO terms. But:WTO chief, Roberto Azevêdo says it's unrealistic for the UK to start trading on WTO rules immediately after #Brexit, as it would be tricky to reach 100% agreement between members before March.
So UK govt already flagging that Oct deadline for Withdrawal Agmt is unlikely to be met.Regardless of domestic concerns, UK govt is confident it can use time pressure as a tactic.Just 1 of the ways UK & EU differ re: the fundamentals of #Brexit process.

At this rate Jason you might actually singlehanded stop #Brexit. #factsmatter
I get the impression that almost everything the people in Britain blame the EU for is actually something where the UK govt should take the blame. Many of my British friends and contacts blame issues on the EU that actually do not exist in France, Germany, Netherlands #Brexit
I recommend you for a slot on @BBCr4today . Dear @bbcnickrobinson get this chap on your show. He’ll explain to you the ins and outs of why #Brexit is very bad news indeed.
Here’s another reason why #Brexit is madness. My ⁦@AerLingus⁩ flight was cancelled and I have to wait 4 hours for the next flight. But thanks to the EU the airline must give me a food voucher & compensation of 200+ euros. If we leave the EU passengers will lose those rights
“Ouch! That fucking hurts.”said the slug who voted for salt.#Brexit #Trump pic.twitter.com/CBNY0vVUs2
A 'no deal' #Brexit would mean that Scottish produce couldn't be sold under the #EU organic label anymore and it could be 9 months before a replacement UK system is in place. Staying in the Single Market & Customs Union would give certainty to consumers and farmers in Scotland.
After #Brexit we will be altering road signs to show the wrong directions to confuse any foreigners here after #Brexit as thier sat navs won't work because we won't have access to Galileo.#NoDealBrexit #NoDealSurvival #BrexitReality

"I am absolutely clear that the UK will be better off outside of the EU in any scenario in the long-term but I recognise the risks in the short term." -Dominic Raab.People who voted Leave were always aware of this as well.So May should get on with delivering a real #Brexit! 
Never a day goes by when somebody doesn't whine at me about Vote Leave's conduct during the referendum. "Vote Leave cheated!" they demand. It's such a frightful bore. If Vote Leave had been competent, we'd have won by a bigger margin. #Brexit 
A smart move by @thomasbrake UK definately needs a #peoplesvote #finalsay referendum with option to #exitfrombrexitMy concern is Corbyn has a track record of avoiding cooperation across party lines, he's very tribal. A case in point was the 2016 #Brexit referendum.

Risks of stockpiling food. This is not the #Brexit anyone voted for. We need a #PeoplesVote to give the public control of the final #brexit deal 
#Brexit will affect every single person living on this island.  So why is Jeremy Corbyn blethering about Israel? #Priorities
May's fury as Chancellor warns no-deal #Brexit could wipe TEN PER CENT off UK's national income - just hours after Dominic Raab dismissed 'wild' scare stories and said it would not impact consumers 
So within mins of nervous #Brexit sec “no deal” package being finessed as nothing to worry about, Chancellor is promoting the reality of the car crash it will bring. Split screen nightmares from the same party at the same time #FBPE #PeoplesChoice
#Labour clears the way for new #referendum if parliament rejects Theresa May's #Brexit deal:

"Buster, what did you do to stop #Brexit?"  
READ: Poll shows over half of Tory voters don't expect a good #Brexit deal: 
It is this simple...• Anybody who "respects the result" is supporting a gang of crooks.• Anybody who claims leaving is the "will of the people" is a liar.• Anybody who will not admit #Brexit will make us worse off is crazy.I'm tired of being ruled by crazy, lying crooks. 
It's so important to have a common view of the basic facts so that conversations have a firm basis. It's fine to disagree, but not based on misinformation.   The idea behind  is to help people get to the bottom of #Brexit issues.
Dear Remoaners,1. We voted to leave the EU, not just bits of it.2. We are laughing at your increasingly bizarre scare stories 3. Paying a bit extra for holidays and credit cards is a price we are happy to pay for our independence.Got it?#Brexit
Bad news for #Brexit Britain! The UK faces a sperm shortage. Cut off from cheap migrant labour from the EU, the population will fall. Lack of workers will mean lower productivity and a collapse in GDP. And that's before we even get to the fruit picking.
Is anyone going to cross-reference this to the DUP snubbing a north/south #Brexit forum to look at these type of issues back in 2016?This chaos is very much the DUP's chosen path, it's not just the Tories.
Well this is deeply diappointing. I can't find a #Brexit scare story this morning. I guess I will have to make one up.
UK's no-deal #Brexit plans warn of partial access to #Horizon2020. Government note says no deal means the #UK loses access to European Research Council (@ERC_Research) grants, Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (@MSCActions) and the SME instrument (@H2020SME). 
Our generation relies on the expertise of others more than any before. All aspects of our lives depend on it. Our phones, our laptops... i.e. all aspects.So we know, if almost all the experts in an area say something is bad, if you ignore them, you fuck up our future.#Brexit
Perhaps you could let us all know what you think of the EU exemption that allows for the no stun slaughter of animals in the U.K. in a cruel and painful, slow-bleed death manner . Roll on #Brexit 
I’ve done just that Sarah. One was 35% up on exports since #Brexit vote and delighted. Business owned by Hungarian/French family who were v strong remainers. Messsge was, get on with it. 
‘Nonsense!’ Brexiteer MP completely dismantles Chuka Umunna tariff claims. John Whittingdale shuts down Umunna as the arch-Remainer claimed a no deal #Brexit would increase prices of European products on British supermarkets shelves.
How do politicians who whipped up fears of untold millions of Turks and Syrians coming our way have the bare-faced nerve to call legitimate worries about #Brexit, which has already caused fall in pound, exodus of nurses and doctors and businesses, Project Fear?
Leavers keep telling us they want a 'no deal' #Brexit and for the UK to trade on WTO rules - why do they want our trade to be governed by unelected bureaucrats in Geneva? 
"he is not a Conservative and he supports a rival political party" I'm puzzled by this. How is 'Conservative' defined here? @andywigmore & @Arron_banks support Tory policy (ie #Brexit). I've been a member for 30yrs, and know members who have voted for @UKIP. It's a broad church.
Ireland will not be “rowing back” on positions we have outlined. Our position has been consistent, informed, respectful but also firm in our efforts to protect the island of Ireland and UK/Irish relationship through #Brexit. We continue to work for a managed, sensible outcome.

We must not allow the Remainers to betray the people, great piece from KATE HOEY   #Brexit @KateHoeyMP
Conservative MPs are right to be furious at Hammond for predicting that a no-deal #Brexit could mean a 7.7% hit to GDP over the next 15 yearsAs Rees-Mogg says "The Treasury is desperate to stop Brexit"Notice the absence of criticism from Theresa May
Govt’s #Brexit papers reveal: huge costs; red tape; big hit on pharma, financial services, farming, travellers, truckers, etc; loss of billions of research funds hitting our unis; no solution on Irish border; reduced workers’ rights. No wonder calls for a #PeoplesVote are growing
Don't faint, comrades. I'm going to praise #r4today.......for busting some of the myths and Brexiters' lies about trading on WTO terms after #Brexit. Not before time. The facts have always been there,
Tories fighting like rats in a sack as the British public turns against #Brexit - ordinary people must be given the final say!  
There is an obligation for UK to pay £39 Bn #brexit divorce settlement. If we don’t honour this we will never be trusted again. Why would anyone enter into any future trade deal with a country that can’t be trusted? 
All we have to ask ourselves is - if the government is incapable of securing a #brexit deal how on earth could we expect them to be prepared for a no-deal Britain?

At my sports training this evening in Berlin.The coach - whose job is as a building engineer, and who I’ve not seen in a while - asks me about #Brexit.“Are they really making emergency plans to stockpile medicines?”“Yes”Response: the most woeful shake of the head.
Is anyone surprised? @PhilipHammondUK has been trying to undo #Brexit for ages. 
So Raab’s bizarre claim about UK being better off under  any #Brexit scenario has already been demolished -by his Tory Cabinet colleague , the Chancellor.   The tragic farce continues, with all of us the victims… 
One of the most striking bits of government advice published today on #brexit is the advice to businesses trading with Ireland:  “ask the Irish government”! @BBCNews#brexitchaos#BrexitShambles
The LadyBird book of #Brexit regrets with someone who looks remarkably like @DominicRaab
Brexiteers will always put #Brexit above party allegiance and work within the parameters presented to achieve it, as proven in the referendum. And especially so when it's being perceived as a total betrayal of the democratic process.
Well my @twitter handle made  the @BBCNews tonight . That’s all my daughter said after my #Brexit chat , love my kids glad #Brexit doesn’t mean much to her now , but this could be a  life changing time for my three children in the future. Lets hope for a good deal.#farming
Tory Remainers fear new members will elect new leader: @jackbuckby —  | #UK #Brexit #politics
The thing is this... there’s some important #Brexit stuff we need to talk about tomorrow. But I know many of you will be thinking about the BH weekend and the weather and traffic and BBQs and having a couple of beers. So we’ll do our best to cover that too. @bbc5live 6am
For over 4 decades most of the people behind the "People's Vote" argued that the public couldn't possibly be trusted with a vote on the EU. Now they've lost they want to keep voting until we give them the result they want.We're leaving. You can have a rematch in 2057#brexit 
The figures don't even address administrative & bureaucratic duplication needed for all EU agencies and it's documented that UK has prospered more as result of EU than any other MS ....#Brexit economic suicide
British doctors have hit back at @Nigel_Farage’s claims that they are scaremongering, arguing they have a duty to be honest with the people about the “real dangers” of a no-deal #Brexit.
People of the UK. We are being sacrificed at the altar of ultra conservatism.#Brexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE
@BBCNews please invite @JasonJHunter to enlighten you on the economic disasters of #Brexit! If you are not sure, have a listen here:Former trade negotiator to Hong Kong Jason Hunter debunks Brexit...
I waited avidly today ... for a first glimpse of the government's #brexit papers !I was so disappointed.Not ONE of them was titled "Your brexit guide to health, wealth & happiness"or"A list of tangible brexit benefits"or"How brexit will benefit you"or"The ERG Plan" pic.twitter.com/JFsBBKDdgv
Now with added Chair.Pleased to announce that responsibility for chairing this event next Friday will be in the capable hands of Jim Fitzpatrick of @BBCnireland.Sign up now to nab one of the few remaining places!@QPolAtQueens @UKandEU #Brexit #Borders
Oh. Labour has alternative Brexit plan, Gardiner’s article in The Guardian says.I read it.Not a single mention of the Irish border.And a “new, strong, single market deal with the EU”.Good luck with that as #Brexit is 220 days away!
Dad says we have to stockpile 6 months worth of #Brexit medicine...goodness knows where we'll store 600 tinnies of beer and 8 bottles of whisky.........
Do you think we will be better off outside the European Union? #pubpolitics #brexit #Ceredigion #Pembrokeshire #Carmarthenshire #Wales
Did you vote leave? Did you think it would bring economic prosperity to the UK?Well read the Chancellor's summary of what a 'no deal' #brexit, the goal of some, will mean!If this is not what you voted for, speak out as a #remainernow & join the growing welcoming community.
OK Scotland:#Indyref2 is not happening because Scotland voted to stay in the UK, and as #GERS shows, the whole idea is absurd.#Brexit is happening in some form, the UK voted for it.So 'leaders':Let us hear your proposals on enterprise, education, health, housing and jobs. 
If you weren’t scared by the prospect of a no-deal Brexit before, you sure as hell should be now - The Independent. Why would we do this? #brexit #madness
David Davis: “Under ANY circumstance we’re going to be better off outside #EUBut I do still think proposal from Chequers, which I argued against very firmly, will NOT meet the undertakings we got from people.And that’s the fundamental problem.”#Brexit
It's amazing how DMA Design predicted #brexit all those years ago. 
The LADYBIRD BOOK of LEAVE CAMPAIGN LAWBREAKING.Part of the 'Understanding #Brexit' series.#LadybirdBrexit #FBPE
So many bad aspects of #Brexit it is hard to know where to start. Drop in £, growth stagnation, NHS staff crisis, all this before we leave. Why does Corbyn deny this? Lab leaders response to today's Govt no-deal scenario typically tepid & pathetic #FBPE
Hi @WalkerWorcester We see your constituency voted to leave. We're intrigued to know if you'll join the growing number of MPs who are going to #StandUp4Brexit & reject the #ChequersPlan (which is'nt #Brexit) when you return to parliament?We'd love your support. 
I see my local paper is reporting a dire shortage of care workers in Hertfordshire as a direct result of #BrexitSo, #Brexiteers, #leavers & #tory trolls: where are you?The elderly need their bums wiping & they're looking to YOU!This is what you voted for..innit?#nodealbrexit
Today the #Brexit Technical Notices were released, some escaped, you don't need to read them, here is a summary.#NoDealBrexit
Anybody ever heard of a couple divorcing who ended up with "No deal"? They might hate each other but always have to come with SOME arrangement over sharing children, maintenance payments, property division etc. #brexit
WATCH: @ChukaUmunna makes it clear that fears of no deal are project reality. The public need a #finalsay and #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal 
WATCH: A no-deal #Brexit would be 'disastrous for Scotland' and 'should not even be contemplated', @Feorlean tells @STVNews More  
Today seems a timely moment to retweet this exchange with @DominicRaab from 2016 in which he challenged my very gentle suggestion that #Brexit would require more civil servants and bureaucracy.... 
Chris Southworth(Chamber of Commerce) - I don't know a single company that has spoken to me in the last 2 years that thinks #brexit is a good idea. Adding on a % of cost for companies is the difference between a factory been built in the UK or being built in Germany.#FBPE
When it comes down to it.UK citizens should not be forced to stay in a political union (sold to us as a trading bloc) simply to make the paperwork easier for big business.Up to them to sort themselves out & prepare for #Brexit, we aren't employees.They've had 2 years.
For businesses who have planned for the #Brexit scenarios, there won’t be many surprises in today’s no-deal government papers. For those who haven't, it's time to act: 
The “no-deal” #brexit nightmares that the government admits to - and remember, some #brexiter MPs actually want that! (via @InFactsOrg ):
Dominic Raab Stars as the wireless Operator on the Brexitannic  #Brexit @DominicRaab
I've started so I'll finish!John Redwood: People can’t understand the delay: Govt, get on with it!If #EU doesn’t want FTA we can trade perfectly well under WTO rules.We know exactly how WTO works because that’s how we do bulk of our trade today!#Brexit
No deal would be a catastrophe for our country as today’s documents  prove & a responsible Govt would now make it clear it is not an option. British business must make public its private pleas for a customs union & membership of EFTA #Brexit deal. Time is running out #courage
Why Wait, Leave Now!'UK would be a net Winner of order £650 Billion under WTO rules.If we Leave Now we advance benefits of Leaving & we do not pay £39 Billion as we haven’t done a deal.Leaving under WTO rules is the way we should go.'#Brexit #Leave #EU
Hi @JohnStevensonMP We see your constituency voted overwhelmingly for leave. We wondered if you'll pledge to #StandUp4Brexit & reject the #ChequersPlan (which is not #Brexit) when you return to parliament?We'd love to have you on board with those MPs who have pledged already 
Whats truly amazing here.  The ENTIRE EU commission bureaucracy only employs 30k people for the WHOLE of the EU.  Raabs now suggesting hiring 18k people for #Brexit ALONE! -JUST for the UK.  I can almost feel the savings from red tape cutting already! 
#NoDealBrexit? No problem.Theresa May and Dominic Raab have the whole thing sorted.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
.@thomasbrake has warned that healthcare could be left “beholden to pharmaceutical companies” as the no-deal Brexit papers reveal drug companies - not hospitals, GPs or community pharmacies - have been asked to stockpile medicines. #FinalSay #ExitFromBrexit #Brexit #NoDealBrexit
Today’s Phil Hammond letter repeats January Treasury estimate of cost of ‘no deal’ #Brexit of £80bn/year.Big diff btw finding this extra £1.6bn a week and giving £350m a week to NHS.£1.95 bn a week (!!!!!) = difference btw Voteleave promise & potential reality of ‘no deal’. 
Heavily Leave-voting North East is now split 50/50 on #Brexit. Surely a game changer in Labour heartlands for @jeremycorbyn and his team?
#Orkney Lamb & #Arbroath Smokies are just two of the #Scottish Foods that are protected under the EU's protected food scheme. Find out how this might be affected by #Brexit with our new SPICe briefing at: 
WATCH: @f_grovewhite: "No deal emerging in this way is the product of @theresa_may botched #Brexit deal". We need a #PeoplesVote to give the public the #finalsay
So #Brexit is going to be a "thousand times worse" (see tweet below). Why are we even considering this insanity? #StopBrexit now.
Brexit means bureaucrats?  Dominic Raab confirmed today 7,000 civil servants now working on Brexit, another 9,000 being recruited. 300 border guards in place, another 1000 being hired. #Brexit @itvnews
If "no deal" #Brexit (misnomer for trade under WTO rules) happens, the fall-out seems more than containable. And we could save £39bn.  
There was me worrying about #trade, the #economy, #jobs, the democratic deficit to Scotland, the rights to free movement and security cooperation, when all along it was about...... sandwiches #Brexit #BrexitShambles #Brexitsandwiches
Britain is preparing to airlift in medicines with a short shelf life if London cannot strike a #Brexit deal with the EU, the government says  #NoDealBrexit
Why pretend it will work?Why enforce a non-Binding fiasco?Why lose Control?Why make us Poorer?Why Remove our Rights?Why ignore the real maj opinion?Why give up the Best Possible Deal?Why Wreck GFA?Why never promise a Better Deal?Why deny a #PeoplesVote?Why #Brexit?Why?
Guidance released by the Government today for a ‘no-deal’ #Brexit confirms the fears of the medical profession; it is clear to us that the impact of Brexit on patients, the health workforce, services and the nation’s health will be catastrophic...
Latest @YouGov @thetimes poll. In hindsight #Brexit right 41 (-2); wrong 47 (+2). Fwork 20-21.8. Biggest wrong lead since May. 
2016 - "There will be no downside to #Brexit, only a considerable upside"2018 - "There should still be enough food left to make sandwiches" 
As I was saying, no deal is not a viable option. #Brexit 
Good to speak to @JackWDart of @InspireEUorg about #Brexit, the inept #Conservatives in government & our weak opposition #Labour.
The #Tories have abandoned small businesses. They already find it more onerous than big businesses to comply with regulations and will be least able to cope with a cliff-edge #Brexit which piles on extra levels of bureaucracy. 
Dear Jacob. At least Chequers is a basis for a negotiation and has got us round the table. What is your proposal to make #Brexit work without chaos and hardship? You have not come up with any workable solutions for Irish border, integrated supply chains and jobs 
The #establishment strives to control the population. #Brexit demonstrated that at least 17.4 million people are capable of independent thought & are not willing to be controlled. The State does not like it & will do everything in their power to regain control! #StandUp4Brexit
We’re heading for a General Election. .@UKLabour need to be ready with an enhanced manifesto and their inspirational vision for Britain. Change is coming and it might be sooner than we think.Nasty, lying, ruinous @CONservatives are done for. #Brexit #NoDeal #NoDealBrexit
Big change for hauliers in #Brexit no deal. Every haulier moving goods between UK and EU will be responsible for making Safety and Security Declarations. This will include all hauliers moving goods, including vans.  more details and links -  Way too late.
WATCH: Luke voted leave in 2016 but is now demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal because he sees the affect that #Brexit has had on the NHS where he works. If you voted leave but now demand a #PeoplesVote, get in touch with @RemainerNow
Caller @JasonJHunter to #LBC a former trade negotiator simply outlining the legal implications of #Brexit Public reaction “this has gone on too long, we’re tired of it!” FFS these are your livelihoods, wake up this stuff is really important! #Brexit
Govt no-deal #Brexit scenario papers show why we should not be leaving the EU at all. Bit like shooting yourselves in the foot & making a shopping list of all the shoes that you now can’t wear #FBPE #PeoplesVote
Great job. They do beg the very obvious questions:1. Are we sure that we want to do this?2. Has anyone, anywhere thought of an upside to #Brexit (frankly blue passports don't really cut it).#PeoplesVote
This is childish stuff: Leaving the EU is a policy of the UK, not us. Here’s what to do: stop this nonsense flirting with the economic disaster of a no deal and use the coming weeks to negotiate the sensible #brexit deal that is within reach!  via @rte
“It is not too late to save #Brexit ...We must try now, because we will not get another chance to get it right” @BorisJohnson - Ask your #MP to #StandUp4Brexit and reject the #Chequers TURD! You can find their email address here: 
Why do the media hyper-ventilate over the #ProjectFear lies about what could happen after #Brexit?EU wil be £8,000,000,000 a year WORSE off with WTO tariffs but the media never mention that.They broadcast a heavy gruel of anti -Brexit propaganda day after day.
Read the Brexit-related guidance for companies prepared by #EMA and the European Commission:  #Brexit @EU_Health
The possibility of a Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn is close behind #Brexit as a perceived threat to business, according to a poll of UK executives published on Thursday 
As it becomes increasingly clear that #Brexit can't deliver the "exact same benefits" as EU membership, and as the government begins the stockpiling of food and medicine ahead of the deadline, confidence in the government to secure a good outcome is plummeting.  
A lot to read, but highlights of the #TechnicalNotices thus far: UK Government advice to businesses to 'put steps in place to renegotiate commercial terms' to account for new import/export relationship. Gov essentially saying: we couldn't get a deal for you, you try! #Brexit 
Confused about #Brexit? No need to be: we tell you all you need to know 
Scotland is facing a "no deal #Brexit nightmare" - Constitutional Relations Secretary @Feorlean responds to the @GOVUK technical notices published today: 
1/3Buried deep in #Brexit technical notes is Govt’s plan to scrap future European Works Councils if there's No Deal. Leaving British workers at a disadvantage compared to their EU colleagues by preventing them from negotiating with management about pay & terms and conditions.
Today we’ve published the first batch in a series of Technical Notices informing citizens and businesses on how to prepare for the unlikely event of a no deal #Brexit
Hi @PaulMaynardUK We see your constituency voted overwhelmingly for leave. We wondered if you will pledge to #StandUp4Brexit & reject the #ChequersPlan (which is not #Brexit) when you return to parliament?We'd love to have you on board with those MPs who have pledged already 
Keir Starmer is a principled, progressive MP who wants the best outcome for the working people of our country. Now we need to campaign to ensure that every Labour MP votes against the Tory deal #Brexit #StopBrexit #peoplesvote

NO Deal #brexit.  Time to face this.  Every deal UK has to trade or fly or do anything across borders is currently done thro EU.  #Leave with NO DEAL & UK cannot do any of those things. UK doesn't get to keep them.  Nothing "reverts".  IT ALL STOPS  There is more..... #FBPE 1/2

.@DominicRaab on @SkyNews says extra regulatory requirements needed for exporters in event of no deal. #Brexit was sold as allowing us to be a rule maker. This wasn't the #Brexit anyone voted for #PeoplesVote
UK data protection & #Brexit. A quick analysis:Soft Brexit = Mutual recognition & role for @ICOnews in OSSSemi-soft Brexit = Adequacy after transition at the latestSemi-hard Brexit = Adequacy in 6yrs+ timeHard Brexit = Contracts/SCC needed for data imports bybiz
Whether we have a #NoDealBrexit or not, we still need to protect & restore our wildlife & environment. This is why we need a strong & ambitious new Environment Act, no matter what happens with #Brexit Here’s my @wwf_uk blog on that
Brexit Secretary @DominicRaab is making jokes about reports of sandwich shortages in a #nodeal #Brexit - l’ve spoken to many people who won’t find any Brexit no deal gags funny at all. 
The Future's Bright, the Future's Outside EUEconomists report 90% of UK future economic growth is going to come from outside EU with or without a deal.EU needs us More than we need them.EU don't want to lose lucrative UK market & Govt know this.#Brexit
Well said, @JakeBerry: “You are on very dangerous territory if you start from the premise that the voters were wrong or didn’t know what they were doing.” #NorthernPowerhouse #EUreferendum #Brexit 
Great to hear @Keir_Starmer say that all options remain on the table when May's Chequers plan falls apart - a popular vote on any #Brexit deal is the right way to go! 
Colleague just asked me "what is #brexit?" When I asked her if she voted in the Referendum, she said, "yes I voted leave, that's what everyone on social media was saying" I just had to explain what it was and what we are risking, she apologised and said "we're mad" #remainernow
Listen matey, I’ve met several Leavers on this holiday alone who didn’t vote for your destructive #Brexit & are appalled that people like you &Barry are invoking the ‘will of the people’ in their name. So let’s not get all proprietary over the term democrat, eh? #peoplesvote
People of Sunderland change their mind on #Brexit. More support for a #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal: 
The best chance #Brexit ever had was if grown-up politicians who strongly supported it from all parties worked together to come up with the best possible plan. The fact that this hasn’t happened shows how hopeless our tribal system of politics is in tackling such complex problems
So #Brexit voters wanted immigrants OUT of the country?Too late they realize many of their work mates, doctors, nurses, field workers, cleaners and owners of the corner shops are the people they wanted out.Get ready to do all the work WE did. #Nodealbrexit #leavers #racists
Dear @Keir_StarmerThank you for saying that all options, including a #PeoplesVote, should be on the table if Parliament disapproves any final #Brexit deal.People on the streets in #Cornwall, and throughout the UK, are saying clearly that they want a #FinalSay.#r4today
It is an illusion to believe the borders will remain open after a no deal #Brexit. Unilateral action by UK to let goods and people travel freely will end in Calais and other EU ports and airports where EU immigration and customs officers will be waiting 
Keir Starmer crystal clear on #r4today that if parliament votes down Theresa May’s #brexit deal then ‘all options should be on the table’ including a referendum on the deal #peoplesvote #stopBrexit
. @Keir_Starmer sets out @UKLabour’s position after recent confusion: #Labour is keeping open the option of a #Referendum if Commons rejects #brexit deal 
More bad news for #Brexit Britain! We in the EU hold the copyright for the nasty photos you see on fag packets. We will cunningly withhold these after Brexit. Britons will then will smoke more. They will become ill, productivity and GDP will drop. Ha ha!
I'm noticing a rash of Corbynite faithful appearing on my TL accusing me of attacking 'him' (read in whispered tones). I am attacking his position on #Brexit. You should be more concerned what that is doing to @UKLabour, he can take the flak, if not then he shouldn't be leader.
It beggars belief that we have reached this point as a country on #Brexit and it is down to a complete failure of political leadership. Good democracy unites, it doesn't divide. It is about making good decisions together. This process fails on every measure.
Sad day. Our 80 year old, nearest English neighbours, who were the first Brits we met over here, are moving back to the UK today. They've been driven out by the uncertainty of #Brexit and continuing health care coverage.
The people will certainly get another vote on #Brexit. It’s called a general election and I am very much looking forward to it. Happy to debate with you any time @Jacob_Rees_Mogg
Remember folks, the party that brought you 'No Deal is Better than a Bad Deal' are preparing you for a 'No Deal' so they can deliver a 'Bad Deal' & you will gladly accept it as 'Anything is Better than a No Deal'Personally I am sticking with 'No #Brexit is Better than Any Deal'

Govt to publish No Deal post Brexit advice #NoDealBrexit #brexit 
Keir Starmer tells @BBCr4today that if parliament votes down Theresa May’s #brexit deal then ‘all options should be on the table’ -that includes a ‘people’s vote’ ie a referendum. very different from Barry Gardiner’s denunciation of the whole idea of a new referendum
Special investigation: Britain has nothing to fear and everything to gain from leaving the EU without a deal and must seize the economic opportunity it presents, say leading economists and MPs @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @patel4witham @CharlieElphicke @MarcusFysh #Brexit 
"Why does UK pay so much and get so little back?" Superb #Brexit summary of how UK is the poor relation from massive EU £410 BILLION fund: 
And after that Channel 4 interview, Corbyn's last shred of credibility is gone. Labour need a new leader, one with integrity & courage. We need an opposition that opposes #Brexit and has some hope of preventing the appalling damage it would do. 
Govt to release report on quality of optics that birders will be expected to muddle through with post-#Brexit.

What a passive aggressive man. This is NO leader. Sorry. He’s having a go about the stories of asylum seekers not being heard, then pushing through #Brexit which utterly shafts every asylum seeker and immigrant going forward. What a disgrace he is and I make no apologies 
A reminder that there is NO #Brexit scenario which is good for the UKWe need a #PeoplesVote
Don't worry David. CLP motions calling for a #PeoplesVote are coming in all the time. We are sure the party leadership will not want to suppress a #Brexit debate at #Lab18. Even if they did, we are equally sure the number of motions and strength of feeling  mean they can't.
After two years of #Brexit negotiations that @LiamFox promised would be “easiest thing in human history”, his Government are now warning we may need to stockpile food, hoard medicines and turn the M20 into a giant lorry park. No wonder more & more are demanding a #PeoplesVote!

.@LiamFox must know his vision for #Brexit Britain is delusional, but is too pig-headed to admit he was wrong.  
I listened to one interview on @BBCr4today last week & the presenter Justin was told by the interviewee that she was here to discuss trade post #Brexit & told him to stop fighting the referendum, he must've mentioned the words disaster or disastrous 20 times, it was embarrassing.
Michael Cohen's lawyer says that he will be spilling *all* the beans on Donald Trump, including his knowledge of collusion with Russia. And it's a hill of beans.Sooner or later, the full truth about Trump's pals the #Brexit crooks will also be emerging.
These #Brexit ‘Don’t Panic’ Memos from Ministers telling everyone to brace themselves for self-inflicted damage....How about instead we let the public have a #PeoplesVote final say on this? And if we want to call off this whole mess, we can do so. Nothing is irreversible yet!

Sick and tired of hearing that #peoplesvote is undemocratic. There was an advisory referendum and the govt listened and has been working on a deal. The public being asked what it thinks of the deal  and whether it still wants to go ahead with #Brexit is the epitome of democracy.

Labour front bench illogical arguments against #PeoplesVote highlighted by today's @TheSun which shows  why so many of their supporters are leaving. Corbyn happier to agree with Murdoch & Jacob RM than confront reality that #Brexit hurts the poor & needy. Sad.
“Quietly somewhere there was a coup d’etat going on” @cmackinlay to the Brexit Select CommitteeThe whole British public has been misled. The #ChequersPlan simply doesn’t deliver #BrexitWould you be willing to support our campaign, Craig and pledge to #StandUp4Brexit?
Corbyn is shamelessly lying when he claims a Labour government would ensure living standards are not damaged by #Brexit. And if he fails to sack Gardiner we'll know he's set on denying the British people a democratic #PeoplesVote. #StopBrexit

Not sure Monsieur Barnier gets the idea of negotiating. It’s not the responsibility of the UK to cave to the wants and wishes of the European Council on Brexit. It’s precisely that reason the UK voted to leave! We don’t want to be told what to do anymore! #Brexit 
Utter drivel! Using the EFTA Secretariat’s official statistics, a study found that between 2000 and 2013, Norway applied 4,724 EU legal instruments. Over the same period, the EU itself adopted 52,183 legal instruments. That’s not 75% cent; it’s 9%! #Brexit #EFTA
Trump & #Brexit are part of one & the same thing. And we need to get that message out to the public. Brexit is absolutely not British or patriotic. It's Trump-Murdoch-Koch-Mercer-Bannon-ERG-Farage-fascists-nationalists-Putin. It's Kleptonationalism.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

So the new narrative from some folk in the @UKLabour is that a #PeoplesVote could bring about a right wing backlash. What the hell do they think #Brexit already is.
EU citizens! Millions of people are fleeing the far-right UK. Such is the scale of this modern day exodus that #Brexit Britain only had +282,000 in net migration last year. Jack booted Nazis strolling down the highstreet have caused mass panic. Who will be left to pick the fruit? 
Stopping #Brexit is more urgent for me. We can bring down the Tories later. If Brexit happens, it will take a generation or two (or three) to fix.
Ten pages worth reading on #brexit from ⁦@AndrewDuffEU⁩  - Shorter: Chequers lives, even FCA too, but will need more ECJ oversight. “Trust us” won’t fly. EU will extend transition but not A50. U.K. rejection = no deal. Rather glosses over Irish Q.

It's ironic that with regard to #Brexit the Labour Party cannot acknowledge the basic truth that just because a lot of people voted for something that doesn't make it a good thing. It has a shining example of the same problem as its leader.

The @peoplesvote_uk is not about a ‘second referendum’ in the sense of contradicting the first. It’s about giving people a vote on the final deal. Why is anybody afraid of that? Is @UKLabour about democracy or not? Will we defy the Tory rush to a right wing #Brexit?

#honestpollWho do you trust more to be honest about the impact of #brexit on the #NHS?
Raab, May's tea boy and t*rd polisher, still believes a #Brexit deal is possible - but as most Brits know 1) Chequers is not Brexit2) The EU will demand even more concessions before they give us a deal and 3) All the capitulations to date have been committed by ReMayner May 
In other words, you and your boss @theresa_may are preparing to comprehensively sell out the UK and betray #Brexit - in order to secure the best interests of the EU. 
Slip of the tongue by Barry, surely! Civil disobedience is much more likely if a costly, economically-damaging,  job-destroying #brexit, that bears no resemblance to what was promised, is forced on the British people without them being allowed to have a say on it. 
Dear @UKLabour, Judas only denied Jesus 3 times. If you're not 100% behind Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn & his vision for a post #Brexit Britain & don't want a new Centrist party, then you really need to step up your game. It's that or a Tory hard #Brexit & govt supported by the DUP 
#Barnier-The European Union will not abandon its founding principles in order to facilitate a #Brexit deal with the UK, The UK is leaving the European Union.Not the other way around"One of the reasons for division is that gov't does not make this clear.
This is very depressing.  There is absolutely no doubt from the evidence that #Brexit will leave every part of these Islands worse off. No version of #Brexit , fromwhatever party, can be anything but damaging.    That is simply a fact. 
If, as a Corbyn supporter you're defending this (and some people are) I suggest you take a good look at yourself.If this straightforward, honest man can't answer a straightforward honest question on #Brexit, what use is he? 
Hi @EddieHughes4WN,We're sad that we haven't heard from you about joining the 17 other MPs who have pledged to #StandUp4Brexit & reject the #ChequersPlan.We're grassroots & we think that #Chequers is not #Brexit. We would love to have you on board.Please let us know.

#Brexit is like playing Russian roulette with the country. The first two chambers were empty. Now time is running out and the Brexit advocates are happy just to carry on pulling the trigger regardless of the acute danger facing us 
I'm not a Conservative. I've never voted for the Tories, and am unlikely to in the future. But having said that, I fully agree with #C4PV. I support anyone who wants a #PeoplesVote.#Brexit is bigger than party politics.

Theresa May has missed & ignored the whole point of the referendum It was a vote for ‘Independence’ & ‘Sovereignty’Chequers is neither of these Working men & women have said no to the elites. This is going to destroy the Conservatives#LeaveMeansLeave #Brexit @Conservatives
First of all, Nigel has NO idea about #Brexit or what it’s doing to our great country. But this is why I question why we give him the power to influence? You see, Farage’s main weakness comes from his ignorance. The man is unwilling to understand the truth and is blind to facts. 
One of the most important lessons in medicine, and all safely conscious industries, is that it’s vital to admit and learn from error and failure, and it’s important to change your mind according to the evidence. If #Brexit now looks like doing more harm than good, why do it?
But...if the majority  vote #Leave again (which is very likely). Isn't that ok?We'll all be better informed. It's a referendum. They aren't written in stone and brought down from the mountaintop. I don't understand #Labour.#Brexit

Just a reminder, a minority voted for #Brexit without knowing the complexities or any potential disasters.There are 46 million voters in the UK so the #Brexit minority do not have the final say over the majority in a functional democracy unless we're no longer a democracy.

Doctors repeat warning of no  deal #Brexit being “potentially catastrophic” for the NHS, after Farage attacked them. People are entitled to their own views but not their own facts. What is the price for Brexit that people are willing to pay?  
Its seems to be increasingly likely that a Second Referendum/ #peoplesvote is going to happen. If so, this referendum needs to be based on factual information!In any ref.we need to allow 16+17 year olds to vote as it will affect us most. #votesat16 #Brexit

The EIU's Europe team has constructed an index measuring EU member states' positions on the core issues related to #Brexit, as defined by the UK government in its Chequers plan 
If the Commons is deadlocked on #Brexit - it is -and there is no consensus on how to leave the EU (given Brexit as it was sold by Boris & co is undeliverable), the only option is for the people to decide what happens next. It’s called democracy and it did not end in June 2016. /2

Dear @BarryGardiner,It's deeply disappointing to hear you regurgitating the propaganda of Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg.A #PeoplesVote is not a re-run of the 2016 referendum. It's a vote on the actual #Brexit deal (or lack of one).#r4today @_Britain4Europe @peoplesvote_uk

The government is to issue 80+ no deal papers this week. I predict they'll show that after #Brexit the UK be accepting present and future EU regulations across all areas of public administration, without any ability to shape them. That is not Independence. That is not Brexit.

Hi @ALewerMBE,I have a feeling that you are pro #Brexit & like us, think that the #ChequersPlan does not deliver the Brexit that we were promised.Will you pledge to #StandUp4Brexit & join the other MPs who have pledged their support?It would be great to have you on board.
Read about the risks of a no deal #Brexit and why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal 
“Everybody knows that the dice are loadedEverybody rolls with their fingers crossedEverybody knows that the war is overEverybody knows the good guys lostEverybody knows the fight was fixedThe poor stay poor, the rich get richThat's how it goes”[Leonard Cohen] #Brexit 
Theresa May will allow 3 million EU migrants to STAY in UK in event of no-deal #BrexitWhat about reciprocity for UK citizens in the EU27, Mrs May?TM once again behaves more like a President of the European Commission than the Prime Minister of the UK
Remember that feeling when the #ChequersPlan was first announced?@OwenPaterson was first off the blocks to convey how clearly it would not deliver the #Brexit that we voted for, or were promised at Lancaster House or in our manifesto Will you pledge to #StandUp4Brexit Owen?
Why won't Nigel Farage ever admit #Brexit poses risks to the United Kingdom, its industries, its businesses, its people and its partners on multiple levels and have a sensible discussion about them?#AskNigel

Guess #Leavers are genuinely looking forward to sitting in a shivering ring round rusty petrol drums in which they can burn rubbish, eating turnips and singing patriotic songs. I am disgusted with the xenophobic ranting that has characterised their vile #brexit campaign. #fbpe
1st day in my new job! Looking forward to continuing this important channel of communication. Happy to work with @MichelBarnier and his team TF50 @EU_Commission on #Brexit who have our full support. Next important juncture will be EC in October.

Believe strongly that if Twitter & Facebook lived up to their promises & purged every fake account #Brexit would stop tomorrow & #Remain would win this hands down. It's all #Brexiters have to offer..fakes, delusionists & charlatans & lies.#PeoplesVote & a #FinalSay to prove it.

#Brexit is so terrible it is causing EU citizens to have a mental breakdown. This is not funny, it is a serious condition. Symptoms include always wanting to do everything twice and anxiety over food prices, particularly cheese. 
#brexit is about Corporate Totalitarianism. Under CT rule workers have no rights. The corporations can make you work longer for no raise. If you complain you'll be fired. With no job, you'll starve. No welfare. Forced to work in the picking fields. That's what the #ERG want.#FBPE
Big Businesses like FTSE250 SuperDry gain from onerous EU regulationsthat prevent smaller businesses competing with them.No wonder they're in bed with the EUand its founders want Britain to be shackled to EU rule,how else can they smother startups and innovation?#Brexit 
UK manufacturing, in recession due to #Brexit, has dropped to 9% of UK economy & will fall to 5% post-Brexit when big employers relocate to EU... We have slipped to 9th place in the world but dont worry - still ahead of Indonesia... not really a "win"... 
My advice to Remainers? Keep talking down to #Brexit voters. We’ll lap it up because we’re ever so ‘umble, m’lord, and we’re all as thick as treacle.
#Brexit is such an important issue that we need to keep voting until we get it wrong.
Superdry, the clothes made for 28p an hour. What moral authority they wield... #brexit #Superdry
I want a third #Brexit referendum, and a fourth. We should have one every year. No, every month. We have to be allowed to change our minds or it’s not democracy.
Now that everyone can see #Brexit is a cock-up, and people have been equipped with the facts, Theresa May must get a grip and rebuild trust in her Government. The best way to do this is to start acting like a public servant, not a dictator!#PeoplesVote pic.twitter.com/Wm9ZtL08n2

Yes big money is perverting our politics. It bought #Brexit. 
The reality of a ‘no deal’ #Brexit is not in the public interest and this poll by @Plaid_Cymru shows the public would reject it. Deal or no deal there are few left claiming that our nation would be richer as a result of Brexit. #EUWithdrawalBill #nodealbrexit 
Also important not to lose sight of reality in brandishing threats of no-deal. EU 27 have a larger population and GDP than USA. It’s them not us that have the 54 free trade deals, the air services agreements etc. The EU will take #Brexit in their stride. The impact will be on us.

I voted Remain in the #EURef and will not support any pro #Brexit party. In my view, Brexit is tainted by lies, cheating, and foreign meddling.

WowJacob Rees-Mogg just one month before the referendum was saying to the select committee that UK could have a “Norway deal” with EU.& yet now is trying to force a “no deal” #brexit on Brits as one true brexit that we all voted for. 
The EU are obviously worried that a truly global Britain will create a situation where we will not only undermine their Single Market but more importantly bring in to question their protectionist regime.Oh well We voted to Leave, not Leave with restrictive caveats.#Brexit 
Obviously as a maj of members & voters back #Remain. To win Corbyn must gain non Labour votes; unlikely while he denies a #PeoplesVote & #StopBrexit option.Corbynites just don't get that #Remainers R more committed to stopping #Brexit than electing him. 
IF there is a GE the #remain vote goes ONLY to remain parties. Not soft Brexit or fudges. You fooled us once but not again. So who wants our votes? There are millions of us. We are the makers of Kings. But we are no ones fools. #PeoplesVote #brexit 
On @BBCRadio4 Westminster HourInterviewer "Can you make your #Brexit case in another language?"Conservative former minister "Certainly not, i'm afraid... LATIN! I could take a stab at Latin. I've got a very poor french O level."Yup these are the people trashing our country
Nonsense! The EU would simply be applying their rules to a 3rd country as laid down in EU law. You want a no-deal. If it happens you will be responsible for the consequences. #PeoplesVote #brexit 
Dear @Jacob_Rees_Mogg the money he has donated is earmarked purely to commission polling. So why are you so worried? If #brexit truly was the #willofthepeople his money would actually help brexit happen!Is the reason you are so upset is that polls will show brexit is dying?
So are you going to ask for an annulment of the 2016 result which was largely bought with Arron Banks' millions and the money of tax-dodging billionaire #Brexit press barons.
You might want to think about looking for a new party Sourby. 17.4 million people DID vote for #HardBrexit (= #Brexit), either with a straightforward trade deal negotiated with the EU, or without. Don't presume to arrogantly tell us what we did or didn't vote for. 
You would not seek to destroy a country unless you had something to gain from it. Now look at those behind the Leave campaign. This isn't about what's best for the country. #brexit is about what is best for them. They don't care about the country or the people of this nation
We'll all need to be growing our own food post #Brexit. Thanks Jeremy.
This week we find out quite how disastrous gvt think no-deal #Brexit will be. No deal = disaster. Chequers Brexit = disaster. Only way out is a #PeoplesVote#OFOC
When I discuss #Brexit with leavers, they are not much bothered by the #Brexit dividend. Many voted out of principle. They did not wish for the nation to be governed by a foreign power. The dream of national self-determination freed India, why not Britain too?
We want THE Real Brexit we voted forWe urge Mrs May to read alternative proposal to her Fake #BrexitWe believe UK will be better off outside EUWe will be far stronger when we can truly govern ourselves after March 2019We are not fearful of independence
Someone’s getting worried! This is the post of a desperate man. You know the tide has turned and people have realised #brexit is a terrible idea. Sorry Moggy. The game is up. Brexit will be stopped. Your only chance is to settle for an EEA/CU deal.
Ford has issued a #Brexit warning to British politicians that it will take “whatever action is needed” to protect its business.The ominous words came after the company blamed uncertainty over Brexit for a colossal £760m drop in its European earnings in 2017.- The Independent
Catching up re chatter that Scotland must save rUK from itself on #Brexit. However, unless People’s Vote respects outcome where Scotland again votes Remain, what’s the point? If England again votes Leave, in ‘UK-wide’ PV, we’re still stuffed. Indy puts choice in Scotland’s hands!
Farage 1) May "would never let a WTO #Brexit happen"2) The government's no deal preparations are a sham 3) "Is this a genuine change of heart by the Government? No! I’ll tell you why they are doing it and that's Boris Johnson"@angelneptustar

Winston Churchill in seeking to end the curse of rabid nationalism in Europe, was a passionate advocate of a United States of Europe, and in the early 1960s, after the UK had lost its empire, he supported UK entry into the EEC (leave lie debunked). #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE

No it’s disgusting that #Brexit braggers can’t see (and don’t care) about reality it hurts people and fractured our alliances.  And NI faces the stress of troubles and all YOU do is defend your position by attacking remainers who CARE. Shameful! 
Lies.Electoral fraud.Lies.Disenfranchisement of highly affected potential voters.Lies.Data harvesting.Lies.#Brexit sold as all things to all men.Lies.And finally, I’ll never respect #Brexit - it’s an elitist coup for tax avoiders propped up by ignorance.
#Chequers isn’t a #Brexit for the people thoughIt doesn’t deliver what we were promised in the manifesto or @theresa_may’s Lancaster House speechPlease write to your MP and ask them to pledge to #StandUp4Brexit like these MPs have...
Britain's military has provided 25% of Europe's total defence force, and has led the way with Galileo (GPS project).And what does the EU do? It decides to kick Britain out of the Galileo project.These are our 'European friends and partners'?#Brexit 
I am so ashamed that my MSP (who I certainly didn't vote for) is such a hypocrite. No #indyref2 "because because", but goes on about 2nd #Brexit vote. That same hypocrisy is why he calls himself a LGBT ally on his Twitter bio but never publicly criticised Tim Farron's homophobia. 
Once the duplicity of May and the #EU is exposed your chance of being elected will be over. The pitiful handling of #Brexit is no accident and we can see it is being done to frustrate the process to ensure we stay.
EU citizens are being *made* to pay £65 each for settled status (free pre #Brexit)Oooooh.... I got my calculator out, that's a lot of money for the government 's coffers. @The3Million are a nice cash cow to them.
Hello #PeoplesVote halfwits,We’ve had the people’s voteRemember the EU Referendum in June 2016? When the government spent £9m sending us a Remain leaflet & we still voted #Brexit?Remember? That was your chance. We voted LeaveTaNormal people who respect democracy
Tories need to get a new leader who will deliver the #Brexit that 17.4m of us voted forIf they can't get it thro Parliament, Tories need to de-select all their traitor MPs & call an election so they can get it through in the new ParliamentWe will not accept the #BrexitBetrayal
Hi @AndrewRosindell,We have an feeling that you’re pro #Brexit. We wondered if you would join the growing number of MPs to #StandUp4Brexit and join our grassroots campaign to reject the #ChequersPlan It would be great if you joined us. We’d love a video from you too 
As polls are conflicted on whether people are changing their minds over #BrexitWhat outcome are you hoping for?     for biggest sample possiblePlease VOTE & *RETWEET* this poll                   Thank you!
An overwhelming 62 per cent say they have not changed their minds on #Brexit Those who have are mostly Remainers who would now vote Leave.Many people are deeply sceptical about the tedious stumbling blocks that have bogged down the process.#BrexitNow
I find it unsettling how the liberal media normalises  Anna Soubry who has destroyed her constituency through austerity. The line between #Brexit and austerity is straight and leads to the heart of Tory ideology. 
You're forgetting Scotland voted strongly remain & that Scottish nationalism is strongly internationalist & pro EU. Whereas England voted to leave & Labour currently seems to be in favour of #Brexit "for jobs"; so if anything, parallels between Lab & Brexiters are what's obvious.

Hi Nigel,We agree. That is why we formed #StandUp4Brexit. We believe that the #ChequersPlan does not deliver #Brexit and should be rejected.MPs like @SteveBakerHW and @patel4witham have pledged their support to our grassroots campaign. It would be great if you did too
Fascinating analysis of what the recent ⁦@BestForBritain polling reveals about #Brexit attitudes in the north. One nugget: “West Yorkshire’s seats now break 13-9 for Remain”. Thanks to Northern Umbrella for this. Look up your MP & write to them now! 
“AN UNEASY PARTNERSHIP OF UNEQUALS - How the EU isn’t what it seems”  Another great #Brexit summary from the Brexit Facts4EU team:   A 'must read' for a Sunday!
The EU is incapable of negotiating a beneficial #Brexit for both itself a federal bloc & a sovereign UK for fear of setting a precedent, it craves power not a deal. The sooner @theresa_may realises this the better Nation-state sovereignty is considered far right within EU circles
The biggest shock from #Brexit win for the perverted part of liberal left who took over Britain after Blair and his New Labour seized power in 1997 was that despite their efforts and control over media, education and world of entertainment they still couldn't influence the vote.

Lord Adonis - Nigel Farage never left politics.. you can't turn on the telly without him being there & he has his own radio show. The reason why Farage is now campaigning again is because he knows there is going to be a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit. #FBPE #StopBrexit @Andrew_Adonis
The tide of terror that swept parliament is Back!The #BREXIT Starring Nigel Farage. 
Here’s the problem of #Brexit, Brits who voted for it thought they were voting to leave Westminster and Parliament, not the nice countries where they go for sun and vacations. Oopps!
READ: Superdry co-founder supporting a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal: 
100% correct.We'd need the powerhouse of #TheOfficialOpposition.But they're not on the field re: #Brexit.We're going to watch #BorisJohnson be appointed PM, too.
#Brexit means...lots more top UK civil servants. What a waste of public money and effort... for national suicide@peoplesvote_uk #FBPE
I'll thinl you'll find that the promise of an in/out referendum on our membership of the EU was an essential part of our 2015 win. If we don't honour it it will lead to inevitable defeat at the next election.#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
Already has man, the country is now majority remain because people are realizing who is behind #brexit & what it's really about. U know who Steve Bannon is? You know what anarcho capitalism is? It's about trashing the country and buying it up. Guess what brexit is? Trash & grab
The people's army of Kent  fighting for Brexit & a better Britain in Dartford today. #UKIP #dartford #brexit 
This #Brexit  And isn’t the timing interesting with Farage going out on the road again? Do not underestimate this. It’s is coordinated, powerful, planned and there is collusion from the far right at every level. We need to #StandUp2Brexit like never before 
We need to remind ourselves & others of a few TRUTHS:Johnson fronted Vote Leave ~ found GUILTY of fraudMogg has moved all his funds to Dublin Farage is  liar, a racist and a Trump fanALL met with Steve 'call me a white supremacist & anti-semite' Bannon#fbpe #brexit 
First you fan the flames, then you sound the warning bell. @bbcnews has really played a truly appalling role in the collapse in reporting standards. #Brexit is the child of the BBC and represents a massive failure in its core mission to educate, inform and defend the public.
Farage on fire"The fish rots from the head down. May tells us #Brexit means Brexit but does the absolute oppositeYou need someone who leads a country to believe in what they are doingShe doesn't believe in BrexitShe doesn't believe in Britain"
Great work by @NE4EU today in Darlington.The mood is shifting in the North East. Today, we also went door to door with our local campaigners in #Newcastle. We had a really positive response with the majority of people supporting our calls for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. 
Two big announcements:1: A major union representing British steelworkers has thrown its weight behind our calls for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal.2: @Independent have teamed up with the @peoplesvote_uk campaign for our huge march on Oct 20.
Ian McEwan, asked which living person he most despises:"The lying, ideological Brexiters, a moneyed elite of cynical populists, who are trying to drive us towards a calamitous exit from the EU."Couldn't agree more.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
RT if you think @BrookesTimes sums #Brexit up in this.#BrexitShambles #ExitfromBrexit
Losing the European Arrest Warrant and limiting information-sharing arrangements will only make it harder to bring criminals to justice and put our country’s security at risk. It is not too late to rethink and exit from this #Brexit disaster to maintain our security.
These circumstances have been created by the #Brexit you support and the Hate-spewing charlatans you fail to challenge.  YOU and the @bbc Brexit propaganda machine are significantly culpable for the rise in hate crimes
The legal consequences of no deal will make M20 a lorry park. The inability and, in some cases, refusal, of our elected representatives to engage with the consequences of #Brexit casts serious doubts on their fitness to occupy those privileged roles. 
We're already discussing following them around in a red-mini bus with "HAD TO DOWNSIZE DUE TO #BREXIT" would do the trick  we've already got our Boris impersonator #FauxBoJo and #EUsupergirl to defeat him in a mock battle  sorted!
Take away all the 'is he, isn't he antisemitic', 'did he, didn't he lay a wreath', 'was he, wasn't he an IRA sympathiser' and you still have 'Corbyn, wants #Brexit' and 'Corbyn does not support a #PeoplesVote'. That's reason enough for me not to support him or @UKLabour.
They say Remainers are the elite. £16.7m of the £24.4m spent by the Brexit campaign came from just 10 men, with a combined wealth in excess of £11.5 billion. #LeaveLies#StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
This is absolutely flipping brilliant. The whole country should be made to watch it @JasonJHunter is absolutely epic FACTS MATTER#brexit #madness
When people are willing to sacrifice an opportunity at full sovereignty and economic prosperity because they want to be an exchange student more easily then you know there is something wrong.#Brexit #Remain
#Brexit in one picture 
THE UK has approached the #Brexit negotiations “as a supplicant” despite being in a much stronger position than the EU, according to this professor of International Economic Law He is rightIt is time for the British government to get off its knees 
Whilst country slides towards unwanted #Brexit TM touring UK to sell a Chequers deal to party faithful that EU will reject anyway. Pointless exercise in futility by a time expired leader
.@jeremycorbyn must stop living in a world of ‘alternative facts’ where #Brexit will be a bonanza for British business -- he ought to wake up and heed the warnings that Brexit is likely to weaken public finances, leaving jobs and public services under threat.
Nigel Farage - "I’ve had enough of their lies, deceit and treachery. The time has come to teach them a lesson - one that they will never forget. “Theresa the appeaser has produced ideas that are a cowardly sell-out. Now is the time for action." #Brexit 
Its been clear to me for 6 months that #EFTA/EEA is the right approach to deliver a sensible pro-prosperity Soft #Brexit transition that will safeguard jobs & opportunity.  If you haven’t yet - come and join us: follow @EFTA4UK 
#Brexit Nigel Farage  coming back join Leave Means  Leave group. Help sort out Theresa May’s Chequers Betrayal. 17 million voted leave this is not BREXIT what Theresa May is telling us. Nigel Farage a politician,  with balls of  steel fighting for  and a proper BREXIT for us. 
It is now patently clear that the promises and the assurances made by the #Leave campaign were never deliverable, so why on earth is the government pressing on with the bankrupt #Brexit project. The lives of millions will be negatively impacted, nobody wins, everybody loses.
Nigel Farage is due to “go on the road” with the Leave campaign again. A battlebus is involved. But what will it say this time? #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #Brexit #VoteLeave
Online shopping could be more of a headache after #Brexit@InFactsOrg
Join us today in Festival Square, Edinburgh at 2 where we will be rallying for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. #PeoplesVoteScot
Hi @Mike_Fabricant We know that you're pro #Brexit. How about you support our #StandUp4Brexit campaign to reject the #chequersplan? We're grassroots & have pledges of support from the likes of @patel4witham @andreajenkyns @bbradleymp & others.We'd love to have you onboard
Nigel Farage says he is going "back on the road" to campaign against the PM's #Brexit plan 
Another BBC journalist (& Chancellor of Uni of Kent) spreading more disinformation. #Brexit doesn't stop students taking German A-Level, nor does it "take away the right" to study in Germany. @EUErasmusPlus is open to non-EU countries. If Turks may study in there, why not Brits?
@CGreenUK Chris is sound and a conviction MP who is committed to #Brexit. Great to hear he is on board with the @StandUp4Brexit campaign.
This finance boss slams May's "Remainer coup" which resulted in the #ChequersPlan"It's not going to be a good deal. The government are trying to spin it that it is delivering a good #Brexit but, come on, nobody really believes it any longer"Spot on!
No the EU is, terrible to see HMG resorting to this #Brexit spin 
The EU is a political construct, rather than an economic one, and will pursue its dog-in-the-manger approach no matter what:  #Brexit
EU Demands MORE cash from Germany!Brussels facing €10 Billion financial blackhole in EU budget after Britain’s contribution to EU coffers runs dry.Britain has paid way too much over past 45 years.So Glad we're Leaving EU.Enjoy your EUBye!#Brexit #EU
Tomorrow’s anti-Brexit street stalls in West Yorkshire:#Leeds, Briggate, 12.30#Keighley, bus station, 13.00#Morley, Town Hall, 12.00 (organised by Leeds Left Against #Brexit)Our movement is expanding. Together we will #stopbrexit!
I see all the people claiming that nurses are not joining the #NHS because of #brexit that is untrue. A language test requirement was introduced for EU nurses before they can get a job with the #NHS and that is the reason.
Chequers is NOT a good deal.Govt trying to spin it that it's delivering #BrexitBut nobody really believes in it any longer!When the chips are down they will vote against this deal.That means Theresa May will have to resign & probably Boris becomes PM.
Dear friends, the march against #Brexit is going to be the biggest march in the history of the country. You can feel it. This is no longer a march against #brexit. This is a march against fascism, a march against dictatorship. The people of Great Britain will not be silent. #FBPE
1/ BREXIT: The EU have already done a study showing how the UK could rejoin EFTA and remain a member of the EEA, with safeguards for immigration controls: #BREXIT #Efta

Great to see Welsh Labour leadership candidate @vaughangething say this is #NotMyBrexit and backs a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit seal.  
Scientists have calculated that when #Brexit dies the sheer quantity of people dancing on it's grave will create enough energy to change the Earths axial tilt by 2°. Might mean a couple of extra weeks of Summer. Another compelling reason to #StopBrexitSaveBritain 
THREAD. Please RT the hell out of this from @juniordrblog , & show @Nigel_Farage what really constitutes a “disgrace” #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #Brexit #fridayfeeling
This Foreign Secretary seems as deluded as the last one - #Brexit will damage everyone in , and every part of, these Islands.  The figures are irrefutable. Pretending otherwise and seeking to blame #EU for the damage is either ignorance or deception.
75% of #Leave voters back New Party for Clean Break from #EUVoters “deeply disappointed by response of main parties to clear democratic instruction.British party political system bereft of ideas, baffled by democracy & bankrupt on accountability"#Brexit
Hi @timloughton You may have seen our grassroots #StandUp4Brexit campaign where we are asking MPs to to support rejection of the #ChequersPlan because #Chequers is not #Brexit.Will you join the growing number of MPs like @patel4witham who have pledged to back our campaign? 
As @Jon_Danzig writes in his blog today: ‘There is no pie. There is no cake. There is no #Brexit dividend. There is no Brexit that can work. It’s all built on sand. Has this sunk in yet?’ Please share. 
Andy Davey on the #MI6 #Brexit spying story; Boy! They must have stolen some really useful information from the #EU team to have enabled the UK team to be in such a...er...strong negotiating position – political cartoon gallery in Putney 
Delighted to hear the UK would "survive & prosper" if "no deal" #Brexit. Government must clarify its readiness for "no deal", to settle uncertainty.   
#Cornwall's MPs are meant to represent their constituents' interests.If you're one of the *many* in Cornwall who feel that #Brexit is a threat to our livelihoods and wellbeing, please let your MP know how you feel and demand to know what they intend to do about it!#PeoplesVote
Dear #FBPE, I have a good idea. Please RT if you agree.The UK should have a hard "no deal" #Brexit for about 2 weeks in mid October.A temporary Brexit will give both the UK & EU a chance to see what they need to do to prepare, and the UK population gets a taste of "control".
#Brexit: Whilst exports to the #US totalled £100bn last year, that is dwarfed by the £235.8 billion exported to the #EU.- Read the latest and share this story with friends.
"It's not too late to save Brexit." @BorisJohnson is right, but we need to fight. #Brexit #ChuckChequers

Lawyers for Britain: a volunteer group of lawyers, legal academics, retired judges & constitutional specialists, working constructively to make sure the #Brexit process is carried out in the best interests of the UK. Please give them support.
There comes a point where stupidity crosses the line into wickedness. The wilful refusal on the Tory right to confront the realities of #Brexit is the most astonishingly dishonest deed I have seen in my lifetime.
Disability has had an eternity of subjugation, incarceration & exploitation, ALL washed from history or ignored. Society doesn’t talk about disability in the holocaust, Disability in #brexit , how politics effects Disability, disability in history full stop....the stories matter pic.twitter.com/TkVrQte6yw
Another once-great media title @TIME has fallen for the BS of identity politics & liberalism as the only route. 1. reader rightly complains about use of “mansplainers” 2. Anti #Brexit Project Fear propaganda projected as truth to global audience  
Liam Fox’s Department for International Trade is paying external consultants £14,000 per day for a crash course in handling trade disputes to prepare for #Brexit.That’s £2.6m in total which could have been spent on e.g. the NHS. #PeoplesVote please.
Smart people are now pointing out the nature of the EU's belligerent and self harming strategy #Brexit 
We pledge our support to the @StandUp4Brexit campaign. It is vital that we deliver the #Brexit the country voted for. Take action as outlined below - let your MP know your views! #StandUp4Brexit
#DumpChequers  I agree with Brussels!"We've got to Dump it & get on with a Canada-style trade deal.Whatever happens now we have to accept this is not an amicable divorce.We need a Clean Break from #EU & cannot go back on our decision to #Leave"#Brexit
It struck me that Jeremy Hunt's latest tweet backtracking on his @itvnews interview on a no-deal #Brexit, was actually quite Trumpy. Here's five reasons why... 
Sweden needs a vote on EU membership, says nationalist politician  #brexit 
It looks like Jeremy Hunt has been got at by Rees-Mogg/Johnson/Gove/Fox/Farage/Patel etc, all of a sudden he's saying we'll prosper with a No Deal #Brexit, we are governed by the worst Parliamentarians in our history, they lie/smear and still ppl believe them, #PeoplesVote rqd.
Battle for BritainNone of us imagined 2 years on we would have to refight The Battle.We never dreamt we would have to attack some desperate Chequers proposal.PM trying to sell thin gruel to #Brexit voters as if it were some sort of delicacy.It's a Con!
South-West's problem in a single slide:- 85% of our MPs are Tory- 80% of our MPs are maleSeeing as the data shows it's women who, once they realise #Brexit is a crock of unicorn, are smart enough to change minds (while men tend to 'stick to their guns'), that's a handicap. 
For years, people in #Cornwall have lobbied Westminster to upgrade our rail system.The Cornwall Capacity Enabling Scheme is delivering significant improvements this year - thanks to EU support.What chance Westminster will reverse years of neglect post-#Brexit?#PeoplesVote
We have a very substantial trade surplus with rest of world (non EU countries) which is growing significantly.  Shows you don’t need to be in a political union with countries to trade successfully! #Brexit 
If there really is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING, no scenario or consequence, that will make the Govt rethink #Brexit, then surely they are in dereliction of their sworn duty of care to always act in the best interests of their constituents and their country?
Join the People’s Vote campaign tomorrow (Saturday) at a rally in Edinburgh’s Festival Square!Momentum is building… as a new poll reveals Scotland backs a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal.  We hope to see you there! 
Hi @nigelmp,We don't know if you have seen us yet, but we have a feeling that you will agree with our #StandUp4Brexit campaign to reject the #ChequersPlan in favour of the #Brexit we were promised.We would love to see you join the growing list of MPs who have pledged support. 
LEADING #Brexit campaigners warn the next six months will be "a Battle for Britain”They add: "Cabinet #Brexiteers are trying to sell thin gruel to Brexit voters as if it were some sort of delicacy"I'm up for the fight. Fellow Brexiteers, are you?
It is awfully good of those people over at @peoplesvote_uk to remind everyone that the majority of the British public want us to honour the referendum and just get on with Brexit. Cheers guys!#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
"This White paper has not needed age to turn yellow... It is not something I would vote for nor is it what the British people voted for." Please RT if you agree with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg MP. #ChuckChequers #Brexit 
My latest views on the rising alt-right tide and #Brexit! 
No, these are responsible people trying to plan to safeguard patients in case of post #Brexit problems in the NHS (widely predicted). Who should we believe - them or a know nothing like you? 
EXCLUSIVE: Can Remainer MPs please tell us why Single Market is so essential, when UK is biggest loser in EU28?  #Brexit summary here:  (From EU data yesterday.)
At this point, anyone who says no deal has no serious impact is simply lying to you. With this much information in the public domain ignorance is a choice. #Brexit
Friday August 17, 2018. Good morning. This is your daily reminder that it is now 88 days since my last interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation.#bbcbias #brexit #darkmoney #indyref2
Now we are down to name-calling, and still no safe or sensible plan. Is it a #disgrace NHS doctors like me are terrified of the impact of a No Deal #Brexit on our patients?  /thread 
Are you a #Brexiter who voted in good faith for #Brexit, hoping for a better life for you and your family, and don't see why so many people now want a #PeoplesVote?  Let's revisit the things #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw and @LeaveEUOfficial told you back then.  1/n
Exactly. So Jeremy, please can you tell us why you are backing this absolute sellout called the #ChequersPlan? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. It is not the #Brexit that we were promised at Lancaster House. #Chequers is NOT Brexit#StandUp4Brexit
Why do presenters like Sarah Smith still not understand that Barnier doesn't act independently? He negotiates in accordance with instructions from the leaders of the 27 countries. #r4today #Brexit
Hey there @Lee4NED We have a feeling that you will #StandUp4Brexit. We wondered if you will join the growing number of MPs and back our grassroots campaign to reject the #ChequersPlan and deliver the #Brexit that we were promised? It would be great to have you on board. 
Theresa May addresses #Brexit deal and attempts to make her position clear on #Scotref
Sorry What the FUCK is being relaunched? You’re supposed to be in the final stages of the detail in the negotiations. Why doesn’t the Govt just come clean and tell the truth. #brexit can’t be done without HUGE damage.  
The majority of Tory MPs will be realising that #Brexit is one almighty fuck-up, and they might well decide that a #PeoplesVote is a convenient escape route. If they do that, Labour will be exposed as an ineffectual fence-sitting party.
And of course these particular Corbynistas are wrong about the facts. Labour has shown that when it is willing and it is joined by Tory defectors it can force the government into desperately close Commons votes on #Brexit.
It's not that Corbyn can't oppose #Brexit - it's that he doesn't want to. And Labour have lost my vote as a result.#PeoplesVote
Ayo (@mcDarke) is a #remainernow who has been outspoken for some time. Here's his quite superb video for #PeoplesVote campaign explaining how #Brexit is not shaping up like he envisaged (eg like Norway) & now he sees what we have to lose &  that Brexit is not will of the people! 
Call me cynical but Deborah's only priorty is the hospitality trade that relies heavily on a cheap imported labour force, whereas #Brexit will provide lower house prices & higher wages.Deborah could start investing in apprenticeships to add some authenticity to her hospitality. 
I am sick & tired of Corbyn supporters whining that Labour can't oppose the government on #Brexit. If Labour can't oppose a bitterly divided minority government pursuing an utterly bankrupt policy then Labour should dissolve itself and let others do the opposing.#FBPE
Amazingly all the talk of a "no deal" Brexit has spurred on the EU to actually engage with talks. And then Hunt comes out this nonsense that harms our choice of a smooth deal. Stop talking us down!#StandUp4Brexit #Brexit 
45 YEARS OF #PEACE is THE most important reason to fight #Brexit And it is FIRST on our list of #24ReasonstoRemain Our continent and its citizens is stronger and safer thanks to the #EU#WeAreEurope #StopBrexit
Do you ever worry that  remainers might be half right about 25% of project fear which will be  more than enough to make it #Brexit a  disaster and assuredly see the entire country turn on you
"The next six months will be nothing less than a battle for Britain." Great to hear that @LeaveMnsLeaveare relaunching the #Brexit campaign up and down our country. We will deliver what people voted for.
Govt technical notes on the effects of a No Deal #Brexit will be released from next week.Here are the areas covered, reported by @alexGspence& @AlbertoNardelli (How long does it takes to scroll the list?):Air servicesAnimal breedingAviation safetyAviation security...
If Jeremy Hunt doesn't believe no deal is better than a bad deal, then he is unfit to be Foreign Secretary. We need Cabinet ministers who respect the will of the British people and Believe in Britain - not Project Fear pessimists! #StandUp4Brexit #Brexit 
Good News - Brussels says Brexit will NOT be discussed at EU summit!There is Nothing to Discuss!We are Leaving 29th March 2019...EU are the weakest link - Goodbye!#Brexit #Leave #EU
When someone went back in time to try and stop Brexit who saved you Nigel? The NHS #brexit 
Big factor in my #Brexit vote was to reclaim the rule of  law from the ECHR who always seems to be on the side of the criminal.I hope tomorrows #FGM trial delivers an equally historic verdict as the #culturalchildsexabuse cases & recent #forcedmarriage trial#ZeroTolerance
Remainer Hunt, like ReMayner May - 1) Does not believe in #Brexit2) Issues idle No-Deal threats that he clearly does not mean, and 3) Wants to keep the UK tied as closely to the EU as possible#BrexitBetrayal#StandUp4Brexit#ChuckChequers
In the event of no withdrawal agreement should #Brexit be stopped? If you vote yes please also sign my petition.   
"#Brexit is good for British businesses"RT after you Vote.
Fantastic to see @CommunityUnion representing tens of thousands of people from steel workers to the self-employed backing @peoplesvote_uk on #Brexit today - and explaining why trade unionists should have no problem in seeking vote on a negotiated deal 
Majority of Leave voters just don’t buy this Fear propaganda. Nothing to fear with #Brexit on WTO terms. That’s no hard or soft or any flavor. It’s just #Brexit.
Brexit is the only way to repair our zombie politics.#Brexit 
Has Hunt told Johnson and Rees-Mogg? Seeing as they are trying to bring about a messy hard #Brexit it would be interesting to know whether Hunt thinks the two of them are betraying the national interest
Jeremy Hunt on ITV News just admitted that a messy Hard #Brexit would be a mistake that the UK would regret for generationsA MISTAKE THAT THE UK WOULD REGRET FOR GENERATIONS
No. She. Has. Not. Guess. What? People. Who. Don't. Live. In. The. EU. Also. Move. To. Germany! I am pro remain and proud European but this is getting silly. I remember when all my Brit friends would blame the EU for everything, now they blame #Brexit! lol #PeoplesVote

Two club chairmen claim #Brexit could be "hugely damaging" to English football.Find out more  
Despairing high priest of #Brexit now scraping the bottom of the barrel by dismissing UK medical professionals as a "disgrace". Guess they didn't put you back together again after that air crash, Monsieur Farage. 
This is not normal politics, this is a tiny elite minority wanting to inflict massive suffering on the British people so they can engage in disaster capitalist profiteering & slash the taxes and regulations that eat into their profits.#Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
German Foreign Office: We're turning EU into defence union.“We remain convinced that we need more and not less Europe.”No thanks! #Brexit 
‘Trust ME to deliver #Brexit’ Boris Johnson is to push a pro-Brexit agenda at the Tory conference As Boris said previously, "It's not to late to save Brexit"#StandUp4Brexit#ChuckChequers
What makes me laugh at leavers is that they think they understand how the economy works and call anything that doesn't fit their agenda project fear. Don't listen to the experts, leavers know best! If #brexit is so great, why are pro-brexit supporters moving away?
More and more we hear about how the EU don't want the UK to diverge from its rules and "gain a competitive advantage". That's the point! Sticking to Brussels rules puts us at a disadvantage. We NEED to diverge!#brexit #StandUp4Brexit
Are you a big football fan?Did you vote for #brexit in 2016 #euref?When doing so did you consider it would likely make it far harder for UK clubs to sign top players?Well that is #BrexitReality Annoyed? Why not become a #remainernow?#PeoplesVote
Two chairmen say #brexit "threatens to have a hugely damaging effect on football clubs across the country"Full story 
Great thread, but here's the problem: #Brexit Ultras are supported by the likes of @Telegraph to spout this propaganda. 50% of UK electorate can't be bothered & many more believe IDS & Co. No challenge from @BBC etc. A nation of zombies stumbling towards the cliff-edge.
Chris Grayling admits that Theresa May's #Brexit plans are 'not easy to sell' to the public That's an understatement!So why is he, a supposed #Brexiteer, still supporting this shambles?Time to #ChuckChequers#StandUp4Brexit
Leaver or remainer - if you read one thread on #Brexit today, make it this one:Clear, precise, factual, devastating.Brexit may be possible.“No deal Brexit”, though, is insane. 
Becoming a third country: A major challenge for the UK? Read latest #Brexit analysis by @BrigidLaffan here:

To avoid defeat at Labour Party Conference, Jeremy Corbyn is considering an option for delegates to support a motion for a second referendum, but only in “exceptional circumstances”. FFS. We are already in exceptional circumstances.#PeoplesVote #Brexit
Outrageous and typical of Brextremists like Steve Baker - running away and telling others to do the same - the British people won't be hoodwinked and that is why more and more want a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal 
Please vote for your #Brexit preference and Retweet for a wide distribution.#FBPE #PeoplesVote
Well colour me shocked....“The #EU demands more cash from Germany as Merkel is forced to find £10BN to plug the #Brexit blackhole”So, they need our money. Why aren’t we telling them what we want? So many questions....#StandUp4Brexit
.@BrexitStewart, former aide to @DavidDavisMP, has urged @theresa_may to come clean on her post #Brexit plans amidst fears that she will “capitulate” on ending free movement.What’s wrong with the Lancaster House vision? #StandUp4Brexit
"WHY AREN’T WE ALREADY OUT?" Read some shocking #Brexit facts about the Civil Service Remainers in charge: 
So #Brexit negotiations begin today.: We have proposals for you - the Chequers Deal!: Have you read @MichelBarnier’s op ed? The 4 freedoms are indivisible, and your Ireland border plans unworkable.: . But we need a deal!: Think  a bit harder.
Tory campaign group Conservative Voice warns that a THIRD of its followers would vote for UKIP if there was a General Election tomorrow“The #ChequersPlan is not the #Brexit the majority voted for and it’s time for action” 
This really begs the question as to where this 'new' money will be conjured up from after the 'no deal' #Brexit Corbyn & co are bent on delivering. It will wreck UK, & our health, education & social care systems will implode when FoM ends. But hey, call me 'picky' ...  
I'm absolutely no fan of Corbyn, but what is going on in the BBC regarding Corbyn & Brexit is is seriously distorting the democratic process. As for the right-wing press, Murdoch & Dacre should be locked up for the immense damage they've done. #StopBrexit #Brexit 
Labour is edging towards a reversal of #BrexitDamn well ought to be but with Corbyn in charge I'm not convinced.Any #BrexitShambles will now favour the Far Right...ironic the Far Left now sees this whereas the Labour leadership refuse to. #PeoplesVote
Full details here - why did EU heed British request not to publish damning #Brexit assessments? And what does that says about chances of EU accepting #chequers plan? My latest.
EXC: EU agreed not to publish killer economic assessments of U.K. “Single Market for goods” #brexit plan. My latest.  
#Brexit is such a mess, its hard right duplicitous initiators palpably out of their depth and the consequences of No deal so awesome that a recoil is accelerating. In the strangest of twists Johnson, Rees-Mogg, Farage & co are persuading Britain to value the EU - and kill Toryism
This house that was built on a cliff in Torquay. Bought in a blind auction and months later, the house ended up on the beach below.#Brexit is much the same, we bought the house thinking it’d be great, and now we’re hurtling towards the cliff edge. It doesn’t need to be this way 
And if the UK has done this?It’ll erode trust a bit further, but beyond that it’s no big deal. It’s not as if the UK has any response anyway, is it?#brexit 
Your “top customer” is exactly that! As a business, we’re not prevented from trading with others. Current trade agreements don’t prevent my business from trading with Australia etc. Economic illiterates and their #Brexit fantasy ARE about to harm trade with “top customer”.
Thread. We really are being led down a blind alley by the Government with this #Brexit shit show. Only a #PeoplesVote with a #FinalSayForAll can get us out of this mess.
Per polls,68% of those who voted Tory in the last election said to be Leavers. 66% of Leavers reject May's Chequers surrender. Imagine how much of a self-mutilating bubble-dweller you must be to lead your party down the path of electoral ruin?#Brexit 
Aberdeen South Tory ⁦@RossThomson_MP⁩  has ignored his constituents wishes &  joined the hard #Brexit Brigade  Gove, Johnson & Rees Mog.He has become a self serving MP, bringing hardship to Aberdeen!                -You Just Can’t Trust a Tory- 
Is it not time for a collective resolve of cool calm appraisal? Scotland is a rational nation. Let us get out of this very British bedlam #Brexit 
#Brexit will cost me a lot more, it could cost me my right to remain here amongst my family and friends or more than 30 years. 
I was at a @CECANational conference a year or so ago when #FailingGrayling was telling the audience what an opportunity #Brexit would be for UK #construction contractors as they could go off and conquer the US market. No, really...

WATCH: @charlievg77 voted to leave in 2016 but is now demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal because of the new information we have had over the past 2 years which shows the impact of #Brexit: 
Oh dear, looks like the pro- #brexit elite have had another rug pulled from under them. They can’t even suggest WTO arrangements that’ll satisfy our non-EU trading partners. The only way out of this mess is a #peoplesvote #FinalSay referendum leading to an #ExitFromBrexit
Please don't stop campaigning for a #ExitFromBrexit, #PeoplesVote & #FinalSayForAll. Let us unite and fight this shambolic disastrous #Brexit.RT to spread this important message.

Young voter?  Despite billions thrown at the problem by the EU, as a young person you're 49.6% more likely to be unemployed in the Eurozone than in the UK.  #Brexit facts for young voters: 
This is of course what #Brexit was always about: removing all our rights - employment, food and environmental standards - so there are no barriers to making profit for the few. 
#Leavers, imagine waking up one morning to find that the inhabitants of the next village had had a vote on your future. They'd decided that you may, or may not be able to stay in your home. You'd have to ask permission to stay and nothing was certain. That is what #Brexit is.
Theresa May and the EU hope to dupe the voters with their next #Brexit fudge We are not stupid thoughThe public weren't fooled by the #ChequersPlan They won't be taken in by May's next (inevitable) #Brexit capitulation#StandUp4Brexit via @Telegraph

Nice spot on the @Telegraph's hope for an "English Reformation" style #Brexit  by @JimMFelton and @EuropeanBriton
Any #Brexit will make the UK a poorer and less civilised society and help to break up the UK. So that's what you stand for Keir - a poorer, less civilised England, on its own outside the EU. That's monstrous. Just monstrous.
Orwell also observed something else that would apply particularly well to this wealthy noble Lord and his  blustering , bullying pursuit of #Brexit “Man serves the interests of no creature except himself” ( it’s from “Animal Farm” )

.@LadyMuckStyle's mum here is one of so many in her generation who voted leave due to concerns that the NHS needed a funding boost & who were persuaded by @BorisJohnson & co that's what #brexit would bring. Like so many others she's realised the brexit lies & is #Remainernow. 
Remainer Hunt is wrongWe need a change in approach by the UK government, i.e. - 1) Ditching May's #ChequersPlan which is not #Brexit2) Replacing May and her negotiating team with committed #Brexiteers3) Ending scaremongering about No Deal Brexit

Most citizens living abroad, but when we give a referendum to vote on how we relate to the countries they live in...  we deny them a voice.That's #Brexit that's how we Brits work.
With huge internal divisions in the @Conservatives , how can we know that they are focused on delivering what the country needs regarding #Brexit? We must demand better, including the opportunity for the people to have the final say on the deal, and the chance to #ExitFromBrexit

Britain’s massive financial contributions to EU budget have been based on size of our economy. What EU have failed to recognise  is we have much larger debts than most other EU countries and paying the interest on those debts is a big burden currently £52 billion a year. #Brexit 
Multiple sources now reporting that the UK govt so fears a £ collapse in the coming months with a potential no deal #brexit that its shifting its OWN funds out of £ and onto €s.Think about that for a minute...
Lowest unemployment figures for 43 years and productivity up ... It's that pesky #Brexit effect again

Cornwall voted leave but this brexitometer in Newquay (which supports previous polling) indicates the mood in the area has changed over #brexit and it continues to become even more #remainernow Good work @cornwall4eu
#Brexit was marketed as the promised land & sold to those whose fears & prejudices were manipulated. The Leave campaign broke the law in order to win; the whole referendum was corrupt in nature. To respect the result is to disrespect democracy.The UK must have a #PeoplesVote.
Tory #Brexiteers plan to challenge Theresa May directly before the party conference by publishing their own “positive” blueprint for #Brexit based on a Canadian-style free trade agreementIt is expected to have the backing of 60 to 80 Conservative MPs
This is a decent graph showing how public opinion has changed since 2016 on #Brexit. Most MPs know that #brexit is not in UKs best interests but were not oppposing it due to supposed #willofthepeople. Now it's clear #brexit is not wanted by majority they must now stand up! 
“But you’re ruining our future” cry young Remainers.  We show them some #Brexit facts.  99.5% of students don't do any study in the EU, for example. Read:

When a respected and experienced EU negotiator who is directly involved in the #Brexit negotiations tweets this, the UK side (esp business) needs to take notice. 
Good news for British workers. Lower immigration from the EU means wages are increasing. #Brexit is benefiting the UK even before it happens! 
Even E. Anglia...the heart of Brexitland has changed its mind on #Brexit.Only Autocrats would ignore this shift & still deny the Ppl their #FinalSayForAll.#PeoplesVote NOWwith a #Remain option.May & Corbyn don't you dare delay it until it's to late.
People are exhausted. No one asked for this and no one expected to be catapulted into Twitter land visibility. Im in awe of all the #FBPE and #remain counts who every day fight #Brexit. We are all different but ultimately united. Group hug and huge respect to all. Thank you x
Why is this so difficult @theresa_may?1) Sort #Brexit, tell EU we're walking if they don't act like adults.2) Implement boundary changes.3) Implement Voter ID & regulate Postal Voting.4) Reform Welfare.5) Drastically cut Corporation Tax.Conservatism gives you wiings.

Hi @nigelmp,We have a feeling that you are pro #Brexit but we were wondering if you will be backing our #StandUp4Brexit campaign and reject the #ChequersPlan?Lots of MPs have pledged their support. It would be fantastic to have your backing too.
Hi there @Royston_Smith We have tweeted you a few times to ask if you will #StandUp4Brexit and reject the #ChequersPlan. We’re upset that we have not heard from you.Please can you let us know if you will back our campaign and tell us if you will respect the #Brexit vote?

Corbyn mired in anti-Semite history which is destroying his flimsy image as affable, people's champion. He should look at Labour's own polls and allow free vote on #Brexit at party conference. That would show real leadership & courage. Not holding my breath #PeoplesVote
Is @ChukaUmunna being pushed towards a decisive move?I’m not alone in thinking now’s the time for Chuka & other like-minded Lab!MPs, & rational moderates in Conservatives to call a halt to propping up increasingly  racist parties, that are hell bent on the madness of #Brexit 
Tory MP: “Conservative HQ has completely lost the plot.It’s like being asked to sign your own political death warrant!Public have given their verdict on Chequers proposals & more they find out about them the less they are going to like them!"#Brexit #EU

The @EIB has invested over £4 billion in Scottish infrastructure since 2008. That’s another reason Scotland should stay in the Single Market and Customs Union after #Brexit.

UK universities are already losing EU funding ahead of #Brexit. British researchers have received €11.4bn from EU funding scheme Horizon 2020 since it began in 2014. But since February last year, we have lost out on an estimated €136m. Another reason for a #PeoplesVote

THERESA May is now reportedly planning to keep Britain under EU rules for an even longer transition period after #BrexitIt is becoming clearer by the day that we will never leave the EU while May is the Prime Minister#MayMustGo#StandUp4Brexit
EU citizens! This is terrible news for the UK. Far-right #Brexit racism has driven away all the migrants. As a result employers are having to pay higher wages to British workers. This will cripple the UK economy. And it's all self-inflicted. A warning.
Very insulting of Phillip Lee to call the majority of Party members "Brextremists". A desire to leave the EU is what the majority of members want. Either he should accept that or go the same way as Sophie and join the Lib Dems!#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit

The facts about #Brexit have most certainly changed over the past two years and I’ve now changed my mind about that too. When once I quietly accepted a democratic vote to make Brexit happen, I don’t any more. 
largest riddle of #Brexit: why do progressives want to remain a member of a union that has been a machine for privatization, free trade and austerity, in short: of neoliberalization? I sincerely do not get it...
I Hope #Brexit gets sorted out quickly. Sick of people moaning wanting to stay in the EU. I voted remain but there was a democratic vote and remain lost. Time to get positive, make the change and start rebuilding the country! #NoTimeForMoaners

Tony Blair - The Labour Party has been taken over by the very far left & they're traditionally eurosceptics but on the other hand the party as a whole is definitely PRO-EU.. so I don't think they'd help facilitate #brexit.. if they did that would profoundly split the party.

Let's be honest with ourselves those that talk about a new centrist political party want it formed not to stop #Brexit but Corbyn as they hope it would lead to Theresa May winning the next election and causing a leadership review in the Labour Party.
The liberal elite will never understand why so many people voted for #Brexit. For too long people have been sneered at for loving our country & believing that we can prosper beyond the EU borders. I love our Country, our Queen, our people & truly believe in Global Britain. 
#Brexit is not normal politics. It is part of a transatlantic war against democracy led by a tax & regulation hating faction of the super-rich allied with Putin & the far-right. If this kleptonationalist axis wins, democracy in any meaningful sense will cease to exist.  #FBPE

EU citizens! Everyone has changed their minds about #Brexit. This is why pro-EU parties like the Liberal Democrats did so well in local elections and are surging in the polls, while UKIP's vote is declining.
The BoE has ploughed billions of the Treasury’s foreign currency reserves into euros since the #Brexit referendum, in an apparent vote of confidence in the EUSo it's not just JRM getting cash out of the UK before #Brexit day.
The new analysis suggests there are now 341 seats with majority Remain support, up from 229 seats at the referendum – a complete reversal of 2016, when 403 constituencies backed Leave  #brexit

Good piece by @jon_trickett on the rising alt-right tide - #Brexit is their project too and it must be defeated!  
Thank you @RhonddaBryant for sharing this  Don't know who made it but well done whoever you are - it's great!! #Brexit #BrexitShambles #PeoplesVote #BorisJohnson
To not implement the result of referenda will not only produce a complete collapse in trust with the electorate, but the demise of the political party responsible as we know it.#Brexit 
**VOTE & RETWEET POLL**How do you think #Brexit will affect #UK Businesses?
#ChequersPlan #brexitIf the Tories don't sort her out, they're toast.Are you listening, @Conservatives?The UK is not yours to do with as you wish.
Informed consent to #Brexit can only happen once people know the final deal, if any & have clear information about the risks as well as any benefits. Grossly irresponsible for Govt to proceed without informed consent & would bear full blame for the consequences
GAVIN ESLER: Why I’ve changed my mind on #Brexit and why it must be stopped: 
To proceed with #Brexit without a #PeoplesVote would be like a surgeon carrying out an amputation having sought their patient’s consent 2 years beforehand without either of them knowing whether they were going to lose a few toes or their whole leg.
In 1975 young people voted en masse for "Yes" to stay in the Common Market. In 2016 those 20 and 30 something pro Europeans had become the 60 and 70 year olds who turned out in droves to vote leave.People become more Eurosceptic as they grow older!#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
For the first half of 2018, Britain registered faster growth than France. And than Italy and Japan. And perhaps matched Canada and Germany. Which means Britain is in (joint) second place in the G7 for economic growth after the US. Did someone say #Brexit Armageddon? 
Opinion in #BuryStEdmunds shifting even more to a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal...... 
Second poll..Labour leadership challenge..Which one? #Labour #Brexit #Corbyn
He has nailed nothing. And you have just shown yourself to be an(other) uncritical partisan @bbc journalist #pluscachange #Brexit
Can a #Leaver explain in what way the UK's sovereignty will change the lives of the ordinary UK family after March 2019? I keep reading they voted for #Brexit because they wanted to get back sovereignty, so I wondered how they'll be materially better off next year.Thanks
Look at this great deal - we give them billions of gallons of clean fresh water and in return they give us millions of tons of radioactive mud! @WelshGovernment has some brilliant negotiators. Maybe we should put them in charge of #Brexit. We'd get an ace trade deal. #indywales
Significant that over 600,000 people have already signed the @Independent's #FinalSay Petition for a People's Vote on the actual #Brexit deal. You can add your name here:…
Warnings from Amazon, that “civil unrest” faces the UK within weeks of a no-deal #Brexit, must not be ignored by the Govt. Warnings of this nature are deeply worrying for the public when it comes to the future of the economy.

A big thank you to @Femi_Sorry from @OFOCBrexit for hosting today's sold out #PeoplesVoteSW rally at the amazing Colton Hall in #Bristol today. Hundreds of people filled the venue to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal.See you all in #Edinburgh next week.
Chair of @Bristol4Europe, @SamHickmott, tells a sold out #PeoplesVoteSW rally in #Bristol that we must have a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal, and we must also start listening to those who have differing opinions to us so that we can bring this country together. 
"If you are a member of momentum or of @UKLabour, go and speak to them, go and speak to your MP, and make your voices heard at the top of the party" says Stephen Doughty MP, as he calls for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit at today's sold out #PeoplesVoteSW rally in #Bristol.
Most popular? It's the only way out now. If a maj still want to accept a #Brexit that leaves us Poorer & Removes Rights then I guess at least it will Confirm it but if a maj now wants to#Revoke #Remain #Reform then MPs must now vote to #StopBrexit.#FBPE
Why I left the @Conservatives& joined the @LibDems via @LibDemPress & @LibDems. Their ideologically driven disastrous #Brexit & lurch to the right led me to leave them. Conscience comes before one's own ambitions...
John Redwood: Have advised Govt NOT to sign a 1-sided EU Withdrawal Agreement unsuitable for UK.The long complex document written for #EU benefit to lock UK into continuing financial & legal obligations is NOT appropriate to an independent country#Brexit
Trump & #Brexit unleashed a Domino Effect.More countries are now returning to the Normal.Italy is the now another country which restores the Traditinal Family and the Two Gender Society.Yaaay! 
Good news. @Theresa_May has promised to “deliver on the will of the British people”. Today, the ‘will of the British people’ is NOT to go ahead with #Brexit. Are you listening, Prime Minister? Join the discussion on Facebook at  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Our Bristol rally venue is filling. People from across the South West are demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal #PeoplesVoteSW
One after another, those who made promises on #Brexit are jumping ship – leaving in their wake a chaotic Brexit process that will cost jobs in Scotland. 
OH LOOK, Ruth has resurfaced to take a pop at Scottish teachers.Now that you're back, Ruth, can we talk about #Brexit, #DarkMoney, and #islamophobia in your party?
I say it again, I welcome anyone who is against #brexit no matter what their political colour. We may have our differences but on this we are united against a common foe, an attempt by a small group of well financed hard right wingers who want to take control of our country #FBPE
BREXIT: Anti-Brexit protesters to take to the streets of Bristol today  /#EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
Johnson and Rees-Mogg are now clearly following Bannon's advice to appeal to the basest sentiments of Tory supporters. Are we to believe that being guided by an American fascist agitator is patriotic? #PeoplesVote #BREXIT

Today we are rallying in Bristol to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Sign our petition now:  #PeoplesVoteSW
For anyone following @carolecadwalla or @J_amesp the electoral, financial and data crimes around #Trump #Brexit and Russian influence have been obvious for 18 months.And yet British media has ignored or minimised them. Why is that? They knew. The evidence is glaring.
.@jeremycorbyn must stop living in a world of ‘alternative facts’ where #Brexit will be a bonanza for British business; he ought to wake up and heed the warnings from experts that Brexit is likely to weaken public finances, leaving jobs and public services under threat.
One HUGE problem with @theresa_may's Chequers Proposal is that it's contrary to Article III of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade i.e. WTO Law.It's also violently inconsistent with EU Law.But apart from that things look promising for the Chequers Proposal on #Brexit.
. @DanielJHannan blames Labour & Remainers for #Brexit not going the way he wants. That's what Brexit has been about from the start, blaming someone else, anyone else, for your failures. Accept it Dan, you failed, you are to blame.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
Hey @UKLabour, it isn't just yourselves you're letting down. You're letting us down as well; the people deserve much better than this. We deserve an opposition that opposes, especially one that opposes the insanity of #Brexit. Please support #FinalSay; most of your members do.
“Can the Prime Minister inform the house at what point it was decided that #Brexit means Remain” @andreajenkyns#Chequers is not BrexitAsk your MP to #StandUp4Brexit alongside Andrea, @patel4witham, @bbradleymp, @mariacaulfield & @HenrySmithUK & more
The #Remain campaign was lost by an arrogant PM who failed to understand his policies had peed off much of the country. The #Brexit negotiations are being lost by an arrogant PM who fails to understand how the EU works. What a bloody shambles#PeoplesVote
But she knew it was overwhelmingly in our National Interest to be sitting at the table..& over 40 years the UK carved out a special place with the BEST POSSIBLE DEAL which if #Brexit goes ahead we lose to become supplicant to the US, China &/or the EU27..& anyone else.#FinalSay
Things to worry about: a summary of the main no-deal #brexit problems that have emerged over the last few weeks has been compiled by @InFactsOrg.
I often come accross tweets from #Brexit accounts bemoaning the fact that #Remain ers don’t “Get behind it”Out of interest, what do the Brexiters do to “Get behind it”and how’s that working out so far? 
The last of our clips... thanks everyone who has taken the time to look at them! Now lets stop #Brexit 
The #Brexit zealots are in charge, they are now the establishment of our country. They control government and through their billionaire tax dodging offshore media moguls they control the vast majority of the press. We #Remainers are the insurgents!
Yes, Brexit IS worth it. #Brexit 
Ruth Lea is moron. She advocating severing all formal trade relations with the EU (worth *£270bn* a year) to save £39bn over two years. What an absolute spanner. #Brexit
Correction: "no deal" #Brexit under tried & tested WTO rules, without £39bn payment to EU really quite popular! 
My 12 year old and his friend are trying to arrange a school walk out in the U.K. for students over the age of 11 who feel #Brexit will have a negative impact on their future - September 24th!
Loving this. Pro-European ConcreteCows @concretecows4EU deserve a follow imo. #Brexit is Udder chaos@ConcreteCows  Cows for a #PeoplesVote
This @LiamFox was negotiated by the EU. Your lies and those of your fellow Brextremists have grossly perverted #Brexit democracy. Make no mistake the day will come when justice is done and you and they will face long prison sentences for your attack on our democracy.#StopBrexit
What a travesty of human rights #Brexit has brought. No EU rights for UK citizens, no certainty, no fairness. It is the greatest shame the UK has ever suffered@peoplesvote_uk #FBPE
Let’s make sure no-one gets away with claiming there isn’t time for a #peoplesvote referendum, to get us out of the deep #Brexit hole we’re in.Where there’s a will there’s a way. 
Labour have a problem.It's called Corbyn.Corbyn wants #Brexit.Labour's supporters largely don't.Labour needs to listen to it's supporters.Or it will find itself without any.#Newsnight
Correct, and after two years of whining and moaning remainers have still not put forward any positive vision or reason to stay in the EU. #brexit 
Hi @SimonClarkeMPWe’re really pleased that you’re going to #StandUp4Brexit & reject the #ChequersPlanWe would really like an “I am standing up for #Brexit because” video from you to tell people why you are backing our campaign.@bbradleymp & @HenrySmithUK have  done one 
HSBC to move 7 offices with up to 1,000 jobs from London to  Paris. Jobs lost, taxes lost, jobs supported by the spending of those employees lost. The result of Tory cowards being intimidated by an alliance of greed and bigotry.  #Brexit #PeoplesVote
#ChequersPlan #brexit Rather well said. 
This is a total killer point! Hats off to @DeborahMeaden for drawing attention to the FACT that SMEs, and businesses in general, are the UK's lifeblood. Without them on board, we're dead in the water! Of course they hate #Brexit. Why? It's a business killer!

PROOF that BREXIT is MORE IMPORTANT than Good Friday Agreement or NI's journey building peace to Theresa May !!! Disgusting comments from UK Government and shame on the DUP for aiding and abetting this utterly pathetic feckless excuse of a govt #Brexit #BrexitShambles
No..I agree but I think it is at the root of #Brexit. We do need a plan to tackle that and instead we waste huge resource and focus on Brexit...its pretty heartbreaking. 
Can I hear from an Industry ( and therefore jobs) that is not concerned and in fact is embracing #Brexit I did ask yesterday but didn't get a response. I am genuinely interested for balance..and Id like some good news!!!
Oh dear, I've been blocked by the Pompey Tories for asking why there is no #brexit plan for container lorry parking at Portsmouth port.Shows how much they care about their constituents @PennyMordaunt@SuellaBraverman
I admire & respect @DeborahMeaden so much 4speaking up, really on behalf others, because she’s financially secureSo many R self serving but more R speaking out now. #Brexit dominates my thinking BUT wonder how so many #Leave politicians just don’t care
Thanks to @HenrySmithUK for this great video pledging his support for #StandUp4Brexit, and his reasons whyWe need more MPs like Henry, who are prepared to stand up against the #ChequersPlan in order to ensure that the #Brexit we were promised is delivered 
On #Brexit , Britain’s youth, looking to their future, want to #Remain in the EU...

Chancellor suggests economy with #Brexit Chequers settlement would grow much as if stayed in the #EU. Ironically, this says it all. No clean #Brexit economic boost!

#NIESR suggests GDP growth could be 0.5% in 2018Q3, after 0.4% in 2018Q2. Economy holding up well, despite #Brexit negotiations "difficulties". 
Control of our borders begins at the border before entry and not after admittance and 3 months later, policing of such a moronic #CBI proposal has already proven politically sensitive and disastrous.#Brexit
"We can harden #Brexit after we leave the European Union, says Deputy Chairman of the #Conservative Party"There we have it. They want us to accept the #ChequersPlan knowing it fails to meet what was promised. It is time to #StandUp4Brexit
Emma  (not on twitter) voted leave thinking it would lead to a boost in cash for public services like the NHS. But like so many leave voters she has realised #brexit will mean the opposite & is a #RemainerNowEmma also came to HOL in April (see reply)
Dear People of #NorthAntrimYou cld change the course of #Brexit! I know they've made it difficult, but please get yourselves along to 1 of the 3 centres where you can sign a petition to recall your expenses-fiddling DUP MP, then vote in an anti-#Brexit MP

Behold the awful price of #Brexit. I warned you. Oh, how I warned you. But you laughed. Mocked. Me, a top EU politician. Called it "project fear." To quote the far-right Farage, "You're not laughing now, are you?"

To young people who are too disillusioned to take part in politics, I'd say, you might want to ignore politics, but politics won't ignore you. If you don't take part then those whose ideas and values you detest will mould the society that surrounds you.#PeoplesVote #Brexit

Just for a brief moment, me and a Butterbeer, and all is right with the world. Just for a brief moment though. Then it's back to the reality that #Brexit makes as much sense as a Gammon and Elderflower sorbet. A #PeoplesVote makes much more sense.
A motion to support a #PeoplesVote at the @UKLabour party conference next month must not and cannot be derailed by the #Brexit supporting minority in our party. #Brexit is a Tory made catastrophe supported by dark money from the alt right. The membership will not be betrayed. 
If the @Conservatives get rid of @BorisJohnson it will 100% be the end of the party. They have no idea how out of touch they are with their own voters. The Westminster bubble is real. Have no doubt this is a witch hunt to out a popular #Brexiteer #Brexit

How an entity so comprehensively dedicated to intransigence and bureaucratic pettifogging can possibly hope to deal with the hugely expanded workload necessitated by a hard #Brexit is beyond me. They simply won't cope, and any UK citizens wanting visas should beware.
How about my friends who got bullied at school on a daily basis simply because they were white ? Unfortunately your level of ignorance is the reason @realDonaldTrump and #brexit happened . Get out from your safe space and go and see the world for how it really is .

To the front of me at the Café is a German family having ice creams, to my right, a French family are ordering their drinks and food, to the left, a Dutch family having crèpes and beers. I love it. Why would anyone in their right mind object to this familial Eurpoanism? #Brexit
Apparently after years of complaining about lots of  EU laws the telegraph now claims the EU is lawless #brexit 
READ: @DancingTheMind is speaking at our #PeoplesVoteSW rally on Saturday. As an NHS Dr she has already seen how damaging #brexit has already been and thinks a #PeoplesVote on the final deal is vital:
The pound in our pockets is worth 10% less than four months ago. Thank you #Brexit - and let’s hope it never happens@peoplesvote_uk #FBPE
Are you talking about this deal  , the one between the EU and Taiwan, a part of which the UK will no longer be if we #Brexit with no deal, like you want? Will you people not stop lying until the country is in ruins? 
We need a #brexit inquiry that also can lead to prosecution for malfeasance or treason.    
Up until now, #Brexit has been a bit of a bully and we've all had to cower before it, but with revelations that this "advisory" Ref was only won by lying, cheating & lawbreaking, the validity of its advice is questionable. It's time to take a stand and #StandUp2BrexitNonsense!
Another thing we’ll drop out of if we go ahead with #Brexit ... 
WATCH: @HughNorris7 voted to leave in 2016 but is now demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal because he now sees the positives of our #EU membership:
First letters to party members. Then EU makes a new offer. Then Downing St chooses to stoke the Boris row. Anecdotal yes, but watch the #brexit pea very carefully. This could be a moment of danger for leavers. #MayMustGoNow #Standup4Brexit
This tweet really breaks my heart; it is at the heart of #Brexit. #Brexit means not "mixing with foreigners". As a German, I feel a huge Third Reich component at the core of this disaster that many Brits can not, will not or do not want to see. #Brexit is dangerous on all levels.
#Brexit is a totally unnecessary, self-imposed, self-harming crisis. We, the UK, don't *have* to do it. @Conservatives @UKLabour, read @chrisgreybrexit 's Blog. #StopBrexit #Remainer #RemainerNow @peoplesvote_uk @OFOCBrexit @FFSake_ , let's take over the slogan #TakeBackControl !

Example real-life consequence of #Brexit outside the EEA: all UK-based trademark attorneys cease to be allowed to represent clients (incl. U.K.) at the EUIPO for EU trademarks + get kicked off the register of professional representatives. Standard application of EU law, 30/03/19 
Of course, a no-deal #Brexit is an inferior outcome to a free trade agreement with the EU. But over-exaggeration and fear-mongering does not help to secure a deal.

The #Brexit vote was procured using the race card. Boris and his ilk knew how to leverage it and tapped into a deep seated fear amongst a sufficient minority to swing the result. He's now using it to grab headlines and get himself into No. 10. He's a vile self interested worm.
Dragons Den star & business leader @DuncanBannatyne voted leave, and whilst it's not clear whether he is a fully fledged #RemainerNow, he has come out publically for the need for the country to consider the #brexit issue again.Respect to you Duncan, it's ok to change your mind!

Absolutely agree & evidence to both @CommonsHealth inquiries on #Brexit & health was compelling. Damage from hard Brexit is about far more than WTO rules

Dear @theresa_may, Thanks for your letter restating the claim that the #ChequersPlan will deliver the #Brexit we the United Kingdom voted for. The problem I have is it is at odds with any reading of the white paper which clearly hands vast swathes of power and control to the EU.

Very convincing lies weren't they? But that's what they were, lies. I will not support a vote achieved by cheating and breaking the law. They are shit scared of a #PeoplesVote because they know you have seen through their lies and now know their #Brexit dream is your nightmare. 
There's something *great* about #Brexit.Yes, really! It's the only #BrexitBenefit there is. Namely:We can #StopBrexit. We don't have to go through with it. We can hang on to the deal we have. Don't sit on the big red bus of lies. Pull the emergency brake! #PeoplesVote #Stay

The ‘Leader’ of her Majesty’s official Opposition is living in a world of ‘alternative facts’ in which #Brexit will boost British business. With his inaction and silence he is laying the path for an entirely chaotic Brexit that puts public finances at risk.

This must be repeated over and over by those who oppose #Brexit, and especially oppose No Deal Brexit.There. Is. Another. Way.The UK could request to extend the Article 50 period! 
Unfortunately many people still fail to grasp that no government could make a good job of #Brexit. When a project is founded on lies and delusions it will inevitably result in failure no matter who is in charge. #Peoplesvote #StopBrexit
I've been struck by this article on how lack of EU carers forcing women to care for elderly people after #Brexit is a feature, not a bug of Brexit. Brexit is the project on putting people in their place. 1/

Boris is not perfect but he is the best hope with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg as  his chief EU Negotiator.If they can't get the #Brexit we voted for through Parliament they would have to call an election.#Brexit candidates would win in a landslideWe would then get the Brexit we voted for 
In the last 48 hours this lovely thing has helped me travel seamlessly from UK - France - Germany - Austria to work with @mdlgrenoble @SbgFestival and musicians from        #WorkingInTheEU @WeAreTheMU  Will this be possible post #Brexit ? 
Sophie In't Veld(Dutch MEP) - Why aren't UK politicians being honest with people that there is no such thing as a successful #brexit as it will always hurt & it's going to hurt lots of people but it will primarily hurt people in the UK. #StopBrexit #FBPE
The arrogance and intransigence of the European Commission during the Brexit negotiations has exposed the EU's true nature to many previously naive Remain voters.  #Brexit
Delighted to see @DefraGovUK agrees with @RSPCA_official on need for stand alone sentencing Bill introduced quickly.  Concerned we are running out of time on sentience -   less than 8 months before #brexit

This makes me so angry and frustrated ..why is nobody doing anything about it ?? Maybe because it affects the working class, people turn  blind eye or just don't care!! @WFBenefitsNews @BENEFITS_NEWS @Kevin_Maguire @Peston @Corbynator2 #angry #Brexit
The Remainiacs really don't want to let the sandwich thing go; they must honestly believe they're changing minds with this rubbish. Reminder: Britain invented the sandwich in 1762 when it was actively at war with most of Europe; #Brexit won't stop us putting food in bread. 
I like Nicola Sturgeon, she's a brave, principled politician, she has the balls to defend her nation from a hard/no deal tory #Brexit which will smash the union, i believe she is our secret weapon in the battle for #PeoplesVote, she'll tell Mrs. May straight what no deal means.
The Prime Minister ( or at least the advance press release for her visit to Edinburgh today) says #Brexit can lead to a “brighter future” for Scotland & the UK.  You are of course welcome to Scotland PM but that statement simply isn’t true.  #Brexit is a backward looking mistake
.@NicolaSturgeon will meet Theresa May in Edinburgh today and will challenge her to set out her #Brexit back up plan. Read the First Minister's comments in full.

Great to see @mattforde rallying the troops to get a #peoplesvote at the end of the #Brexit process - more and more people are getting involved @peoplesvote_uk
Jamie Foster: So Vince Cable wants to form a new anti Brexit party? Oddly there is already a centrist party that opposes Brexit. It is called the Lib Dems. Does Cable think so little of his own party? They must be furious. #csm #Libdems #brexit 
So @LiamFox thinks it’s all somebody else’s fault. Funny because I thought he said a post #Brexit deal with the EU would be the easiest trade deal in history. 
Charlie's a #remainernow I have shared many times before. Here is stating that he's now so against #brexit he will only vote for parties offering a #PeoplesVote. Moderate conservatives voters like Charlie are abandoning the party in droves, and will continue to do so over #brexit 
Croatia's President, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović says she believes EU - UK negotiations over #Brexit are 'not progressing smoothly' - adding that she respects the UK's decision to leave the EU. 
People who voted #Brexit were told the UK would have access to the tariff-free EU market, would get £350 million per week more for the NHS and would be better off. No deal means no access, a crippling of NHS and disastrous economic impact. Brexit voters have been conned. pic.twitter.com/hb6wm2dR4W

Hereis a list of anti-#Brexit MPs insisting a criminal case be brought  against the Vote Leave campaign. A very remain biased Electoral Commission has already conducted a fruitless  investigation. These MPs are selfish, ideological zealots who only want democracy over-turned. 
In April the snow was blamed for the poor performance of the UK economy, in the spring the royal wedding was tipped to give us a boost, now its the sun causing problems and in the autumn it will be the wrong kind of leaves.Can’t be #brexit though ...

What obtuse polemic!We were on our uppers, crippled financially by WW2 owing millions to USA in war loans and a massive rebuilding program due to war damage.The empire was unsustainable. We begged to join the Common Market and our country stabilized after we joined.#Brexit
You know the very wealthy will be absolutley fine with #brexit If that's you. Good luck to you.If not then join the fight. #FBPE
The annual cost to the UK being in the EU is £8.1B. Whereas the size of the annual subvention to Northern Ireland is a whopping £9.2B.Never mind #Brexit the Uk could doubling its savings by facilitating a border poll and a United Ireland. #borderpoll #BrexitShambles
So few? & 2 key names missing...the Prime Minister of the Country & the Leader of the Opposition...I wonder why that would be?Thank U all who still have a desire to preserve our democratic process.#Brexit has been invalidated in so many ways...only a #PeoplesVote can sort it.
This is why Boris Johnson is the right man to lead the Tory Party, and the country, and to negotiate #BrexitHe says things that 80% of British People agree with which the Left Wing Media think are outrageous!@BorisJohnson @Conservatives #bantheburka

I don't believe that Boris Johnson is racist per se.I believe he thinks he is superior to everyone. He comes from a group who have been taught this. They believe it is their birthright to rule. #Brexit #FBPE
The biggest 'direct threat' to your 'type of journalism', Yasmin, comes not from #Brexit, but from the fact that it's boring, predictable, and piss-poor. 
Did you discuss the recently signed EU Japan trade deal. That's how the big boys do it.  #brexit #brexitshambles #StopBrexit #DissolveTheUnion #Indyref2
When you're looking for that one justification for #Brexit that surpasses all others, however great & numerous, and that makes any even remotely-possible, minor problem pale into insignificance.(H/T @darrengrimes_ )
To be clear. I'm Tory & I'm a member.Tories stand for liberty. We're a broadchurch. Being a member doesn't mean you have to sacrifice your principles & views & agree with things when you don't.I'll campaign again when this #Brexit mess is fixed.#ChequersMeansCorbyn
Dear Great Britain. Now would be a good time to stop wasting energy and resources on your vanity project called #Brexit and appreciate there are other, more important and far more urgent issues at stake. The international community needs your help! 
Many regular followers will be very familiar with #remainernow @jdlarwood from his previous videos and his article in the @Independent but here he is with a further video for @peoplesvote_uk clearly setting out why he changed his mind on #Brexit & why we need a #FinalSay 
#Brexit voters FURIOUS with May's Chequers Sellout moving to #Ukip “Lots of working class, disillusioned voters that look at Chequers & think ‘well that is not really the kind of Brexit that I thought I was going to get after the referendum in 2016’.”#EU
As we are collecting bare faced, brass necked, blatant and dangerous lies of sociopathic #Tories...... feast your eyes on the latest offering by Daniel '#Brexit is my life's work' Hannan.Feel free to share widely..... 
20 years of British media lies about the EU chronicled and explained. This is just a small taste of the UK's two decades of fake news.Is it any wonder people voted for #Brexit? 
So, I agreed to be interviewed on my #Brexit views and spoke to @alexGspence about it and this is the write up.Please do share and RT#ChequersMeansCorbyn#MAYMUSTGO#BrexitNowOrNever
You missed the sentiment of my tweet. It is not holidaying in Europe that we shall miss after #Brexit but travelling & trading across borders & sharing of another’s land as if it were our own, without constraint or judgement. Openness brings progress, development & tolerance.
#Brexiters: Nobody blames you for making a choice you thought would help your family. #Brexit leaders now tell us you voted for austerity for decades, and to ravage our industry with no EU deal.The country was conned.Be angry. You can still help. Demand a #PeoplesVote.
A Brexiteer has his last ever piece of cake before #Brexit. After you leave there will be no more. The EU will withhold flour, eggs and cream. 
Holiday prices forecast to rise by 31% due to #Brexit

Why should the right-wing press & politicians care about the poor, the left-behind, immigration, jobs & wages & disadvantaged regions? The answer is they don't. All they care about is slashing the taxes & regulations that eat into their profits.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit

.@LiamFox has eaten his words that #Brexit would be 'easy'. Im worried that the final deal might be a very bad deal, or it won't be the deal that people wanted when they voted in 2016That's why there should be a #PeoplesVote so everyone can have their voices heard, not just MPs
Industrial scale lying, tolerance of electoral law-breaking, rage at the Article 50 court case, attacks on the civil service and electoral commission and intolerance of opposition to #Brexit. The same tactics as Trump, a transatlantic assault on democracy.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
There is so much anger and so many lies about #Brexit, but there is one thing that I am completely clear on, and that is that at the 2016 referendum Nobody Voted To Be Poorer... 
UK, ORB poll: Approval on how the government is handling BrexitApprove: 24% (-5)Disapprove: 76% (+5)#Brexit #EuropeanUnion
It is a poor reflection on the UK today that the police have to be urged to investigate electoral malpractice. #Brexit #ElectoralFraud2016
An extension to the Article 50 timeframe could only be described as a total betrayal of #Brexit & only serve Remainiacs in their twisted ideological quest for yet another vote, in short an establishment stitch upWould like to know @Jacob_Rees_Mogg & @BorisJohnson thoughts...
A #PeoplesVote is more popular than ever. Many are asking what it will look like. That depends on Parliament and how #Brexit turns out. In the meantime, here's a fascinating article about how the way a vote is counted can change the result.
Support for Mrs May's handling of Brexit falls to record low.Only 22% of British voters approve of Theresa May's handling of Brexit.Mrs May is facing a leadership challenge if she continues with her plans to keep UK following EU rules & laws.#Brexit #EU
Lord Adonis - We should get out of this #brexit mess by having a #PeoplesVote.. so the people can have their say on what ever hopeless deal May negotiates as against the tangible & real benefits we have being in the EU.. protecting our trade/jobs/incomes.#FBPE @Andrew_Adonis
96% of passers by at last week's Stewartry Show in #CastleDouglas believe #Brexit is going badly/will be bad for Scotland/will be bad for agriculture.72% believe Scottish independence is a better option for Scotland.  
Volunteers at the SNP stall at last week's Stewartry Show asked passers by to give their verdict on Brexit. Here are the results! #Brexit #Scotland #Galloway
Hamilton Dashboard shows Russian bots joining in on the #resignwatson hashtag? Why would that be?1. Putin loves division. It weakens us2. @tom_watson is the most senior Labour Party figure to question Russian influence on #Brexit and Arron Banks' embassy links Don't be duped 
After Cameron unleashed the Beast that is #Brexit & exited rapidlyWe ended up with a Prime Minister by *default*The other candidates either bottled it or were *knifed* by Gove.So it's hardly surprising that she's a prisoner of the Ultra RW.Competition is biding it's time.

That darn #Brexit, eh?
Report says women may have to give up work to look after elderly relatives unless #EU care workers given priority after #Brexit 
Theresa May is foolishly banning the eating of dog meat in the UK. How shortsighted. What else does she expect people to eat after #Brexit?
Unicorns, mermaids and dragons are a myth. #Brexit is an undeliverable lie. There is no upside, there is no dividend.There must be a full disclosure on what Brexit will mean and then a #PeoplesVote
After #Brexit all the women of the UK will be enslaved. There will be mass unemployment and no jobs. But women will have to quit those nonexistent jobs to fill care roles. All the men will be out committing far right deeds while under the spell of Farage.
Theresa May is 'confident' she can secure a good #Brexit dealThat confidence is not shared by the vast majority of BritsThe only way now that such confidence could be restored is if the Tories were to ditch May and ChuckChequers 
This man should not be in front of a camera but in front of a tribunal with a whole bunch of others, accounting for what he/they did to the UK. #Brexit
Sad reflection of the #BBC that it takes a @SkyNews journalist to clearly spell out the facts about #brexit in a way that the @BBC no longer dares...

A significant number of Con MPs have forgotten the manifesto they were elected on in 2017, but only some of them are actively campaigning against it.The only way to secure a #Brexit deal is to get behind the UK & stop batting for the EU.#CountryBeforeEUDrunkards
It’s only Monday so I don’t want to dive TOO head first into the whole politics thing but 1) If only there was another 50% of the population that could help care for their parents2) are we all still convinced that this whole #Brexit thing is a good idea?

The escalating political & press preparations to blame the EU make it ever clearer that this government wants to drive Britain off the no-deal cliff. Criminals willing to inflict massive suffering on the British people to get themselves a tax haven. #PeoplesVote #Brexit
Here's a list of ALL the countries we currently trade with. If #nodealbrexit happens, on Day One of the Brave Brexit Britain, not a single one of these countries will trade with us w/out a separate deal. Which takes time to arrange.Do the maths!!!  #brexit. 
Everybody knows that the #Tories are responsible for #Brexit. Nevertheless conservative woman Laura Perrins has the brutality to harshly attack groups and movements like #FBPE that want Britain to remain in the European Union.#FBPE #FollowBackProEU

#Brexit: EU making 'massive miscalculation' if it thinks UK won't walk away without deal, David Davis warns 
@RedHotSquirrel has long provided a very well informed and optimistic commentary on #Brexit on Twitter.Now he and associates have launched a new political party to better articulate and promote their vision.@TimePartyUK is worthy of your attention:
There is only ONE reason #TreasonMay wants to avoid a 'No Deal' #Brexit whilst at the same time pushing hard to get us to accept a rotten deal which would keep us tied to Brussels and unable to compete economically - it is to save the EU from financial meltdown. Traitor. 
BREAKING: after Brexit men won't have parents and older people won't have sons who could take care of them.(More broadly--the entire healthcare and elder care scenario post-#Brexit will be a societal disaster if the predictions in this memo come to fruition) 
.@PolishEmbassyUK  We will not tolerate hate attacks on members of #Polish community in UK fuelled by uncertainty about #brexit or anything else and we will respond as in #Edinburgh with powerful community statement from that we stand united.
It’s Monday.And the standard of the UK #Brexit ‘debate’ is sinking to ever new depths. Ministers are now flailing around blaming individual EU countries and the EU Commission for failing to offer a workable plan. Predictable, but so depressing.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
For over 2 years now I've been arguing that a change of policy on #Brexit would make it much more likely that Labour would actually win the next election. But it's increasingly clear that Corbyn and his gang shouldn't be anywhere near the levers of power.  We are so fucked.
Join @UKLabour to secure a future for all our children. Black British citizens should be concerned, racism is on the rise and European history teaches us when western economies go down, racism always goes up. #Brexit and austerity will see the full bloom of British fascism. 
Brexiteer @bernardjenkin now relying on “informal assurances” to avoid the chaos of ‘no deal’ #Brexit...Let me informally assure him, he will be held FULLY responsible for the mess he and @BorisJohnson @michaelgove are leading this country into.#youbrakeityoupayforit
#r4today Curiously, @bbcnickrobinson focuses on Dutch pig farmers being impacted by a No Deal #Brexit, but conveniently forgets that there are 860,000 jobs in the UK motor industry at far greater risk... 
A "check point" on the Sweden and Norway border. Both countries in Schengen just like the UK and ROI having a Common Travel Area. It has not led to war or hardship. No one even mentions it because a few lorry checks are not an issue. N Ireland border will be the same#Brexit

So Bernard Jenkin refuses to engage in debate on matters relating to #Brexit.Interesting attitude.Is that ice you’re skating on getting a little too thin, Mr Jenkin?#R4Today
Services make up about 80% of the economy and the contraction in output in the last month highlights the growing concern about the impact that #Brexit will have.We need a #peoplesvote
& editorial meetings where "alternative takes are frowned on". #Brexit and #Trump are diffrent sides to the same phenomenon.. an attack by unscrupulous liars on liberal democracy & its values. This is the biggest test for the BBC since WW2, & so far it's not going well. 12/12
When you apply Balance to people like this, & to subjects like #Brexit, #climatechange #Holocaust Denial, etc, you don't get balanced reporting, you get a confused "He said this, but she said that" narrative that gives false equivalence to a pack of lies and the Truth...  8/12
4 main turning points in my rejection of the BBC.1. Hideous bias in #indyref2. Nigel Lawson as a climate change "expert"3. Refusing to cover Cambridge Analytica and Brexit protests4. More attention to Zimbabwe than #brexit vote rigging25 years it took me to wake up. Awful
Carney right to be concerned about consequences of no-deal #Brexit. This week’s Economist makes good point about likely acrimoniousness of no deal, which wld aggravate negative impact - UK, Ireland wld be hit worst, by a large margin. 
The whole #ChequersPlan saga + the sidelining of @DavidDavisMP have proved we can't trust her. If the @Conservatives fail to replace her with someone capable of delivering full #Brexit, that would mean we can't trust them as a Party. This is their mess + they must fix it. *Soon*.

Women will have to give up work to look after parents unless EU care workers are given priority after #Brexit
Holy shit this manic feud in @UKLabour is unbelievable. The Tories are on the way to damaging our country for generations with their mad #Brexit and we can't put out a unified statement on anti-Semitism that we can all get behind. Nuts!!  Fight the Tories not each other!

I am really angry. May needs to just go. Brexit must stop. Brexit is mad. The tide has turned and our politicians are not listening. Sack the lot! If we had a referendum (advisory of course - then it is above the law!!!) We would be staying in the EU. #Brexit #StopBrexit
The chairman of @theresa_may’s constituency claims not to have seen a revolt over the #ChequersPlan. Where is the revolt he asks.  Maybe you should show him.If you do one thing for #Brexit. RT this & reply to tell @MCA_Tories your views.#BrexitNowOrNever #ChequersMeansCorbyn
Well done @PimlicoPlumbers for this #brexit banner on their premises - which is visible from train lines.Many #remainernow will surely agree with the sentiment (Ps. makes me glad I used them to put in a new boiler for me last summer when I still lived in london.)
I wrote to my local MP - a #Brexit ultra, to raise my concerns about SMEs who supply Airbus in the constituency. He never replied. If I had money though, I could get access to him via the IEA. It's crooked like that. And you're telling me this is a democracy?
Report reveals that a “no deal” #Brexit could cost the 27 EU member states £500 billion in trade tariffs and extra contributionsRees-Mogg adds: "It would be an enormous act of self-harm for the European Commission to insist on a punishment #Brexit”
One thing I'd like to find out is whether Remainers think of #Brexit as a mainly British phenomenon, or as part of a transatlatic kleptocratic project aided by Putin to replace democracy with kleptocracy.#FBPE #StopBrexit

@PennyMordaunt "The oldest, most stable and most successful country in Europe has a duty to remind a European Union barely 50 years old that Government is servant, and not master, of the people" #Brexit 
With the @Conservatives having huge internal divisions, how can we know that they are focused on delivering what the country needs regarding #Brexit? We must demand better, including the opportunity for the people to have the final say on deal and #ExitFromBrexit

We have now sold over half of the tickets for the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference in #Leeds on 8 September - Creating a Vision of a New Britain Without #Brexit! There are now just 3 days left to buy tickets at the special "Early Bird" price of £10.
Thank you @lauraforshrews! Great to see another @UKLabour PPC support a #PeoplesVote.#Labour voters, members, candidates and MPs can change the course of the country, #Brexit is not inevitable.

Since I buy more from my local Tesco than they buy from me, I figured they need me more than I need them. So, I demanded a 20% discount, free day-old bakery products and to use their baby changing room as my office. I was barred. I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS WENT WRONG. #Brexit

OK brexists. You don't give a fuck if #Brexit means that millions of your own people lose their jobs if people can't feed their kids or if the sick die cos they can't get imported medication so why should I give a fuck about your will
This fact based analysis of #Brexit causes is so good in that it shatters Remainer myths that it needs retweeting

Hard to argue with this. Why May must stop the #Brexit clock. #BrexitShambles #PeopleVote
1. This is going to sound a bit preachy but I'm going to roll with it anyway. The Tory Brexiters have pulled a fast one. They have shifted to goalposts and now propagandists are spinning the narrative that any deal is a betrayal of #Brexit. These people are professional liars.

I ran some very big polls on Facebook a little while back and the result went the way of leave. However, I’ve been asked to run that same poll on twitter. So here it is: SAKE QUESION - 2 YEARS ON - REMAIN OR LEAVE? Vote then retweet. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Theresa May still thinks she can secure a good #BrexitoutcomeThe BEST she hopes to achieve is a mangled version of her widely discredited #ChequersPlanThe Tories urgently need to get rid of TM as her vision for the UK is truly the worse of all worlds
The @BBC is once again providing an uncritical platform for fascists. The BBC is colluding in the far-right kleptonationalist war against our democracy. A massive clear-out is needed, and fast.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #Brexit
No deal! #brexit 
Rather than cancelling police leave due to unrest that will be caused by a catastrophic why not just cancel #brexit itself?Given the fact the country is #RemainerNow anyway it makes political sense. 
Never in the field of British history will so many have been so willing to let themselves be so comprehensively shafted by so few. Leavers cheering on a no-deal #Brexit.

Remainiacs are ultimately advocating a vote that never elects, referenda that's never implemented and a society living under the pretence of a democracy.#Brexit#WTO
Please do me the personal favour of retweeting this thread on the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. The more people grasp this very simple premise the fewer times I have to repeat myself and the less likely I am to throttle somebody.#Brexit 
Liam Fox says no deal Brexit “now most likely outcome”. No one voted for food shortages, social unrest and chaos at our ports and airports. Remember that this is a choice. There is still time to say no to #Brexit #StopBrexit
 UK: In case you did not know it yet! Referendum on #Brexit, selected by religious affiliation. The usual suspects very far ahead! 
Very good reminder that equivalence is not at all equivalent to EU single market in #Brexit
Here's Nat, she did not vote in the 2016 #euref as she found the campaigns so poor, she was confused & couldnt decipher the best way to go. Now she sees the reality of #brexit she's a #RemainerNow & is desperate for a #PeoplesVote!@nat_orwell84 welcome to #remainernow club.
Sunday Times story shows Dee Forbes, RTÉ DG is so close to Denis O'Brien & Lesley Buckley that INM can ask her to find a job for a nuisance editor. Small wonder RTE current affairs didn’t cover Lowry Tapes and did soft David Murphy doc on DO'B. #marian #brexit @deeforbes_dee @rte
More #Brexit fear mongering? Nope sober analysis from those who have to police this island. Those in the UK who trivialize the border & the #GFA do so out of ignorance or malevolence
If you fancy a laugh & need a bit of cheering up this #SundayMorning then tune into @Nigel_Farage on @LBC - listening to his desperate whining about #Brexit & putting forward his nonsensical arguments really drives home how weak the #Leave side is & how #BrexitIsDead 
Since the MOMENT Theresa May triggered Article 50, we have been told  that no deal is better than a bad deal.Day in, day out. Now we are being told, that a ‘no deal’ option doesn’t actually exist.Leavers, are you FINALLY seeing the sheer lies? #Brexit
A no-deal #Brexit would be a massive crime against the British people orchestrated by a far-right clique willing tell any lie and inflict any amount of suffering on the British people in order to get themselves a #BrexitTaxHaven. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote

Oh VERY dearie me !#LiamFox - you know who I mean - the Disgraced Former Defence Secretary !He said a  #Brexit trade deal would be *the easiest in history*Now thinks UK will probably leave without.
Brexit is going into its final textbook phase. As predicted, when the non-existing plan fails, brexiteers will blame the EU for the failure because they are sticking to the same message they had since before the vote.  #brexit
Police urged to investigate #VoteLeave law-breaking in #brexit #referendum :

Juncker and Barnier have made me rethink my Remain vote #Brexit 
This is one of the most persuasive arguments I have heard in favour of thinking again before we finally leave the EU. Michael Morpurgo puts the case in its historical context and he puts it clearly.  #Brexit
So sick of this nonsense. Am no Royalist but beginning to think UK would be better with Absolute Monarchy rather than current bullshit dictatorship of ToryUKIP #Brexit Cult.
The  Labour MP Peter Shore along with Tony Benn and Barbara Castle realised the dangers of giving up British sovereignty in 1975. Their courage & vision is what we must remember and honour today. Their messages just as powerful and relevant today. #Brexit 
Why do Remainers insist that Britain needs a deal with the EU or else? The EU is falling apart, kept afloat by an illegal injection of tens of billions into its markets by the ECB, and its economy is mismanaged and benefits only Germany. Walking away is a great option. #Brexit
This is the report on the @SkyNews #brexit poll  that came out on Monday. It’s worth 3 minutes of your time.It shows much disillusionment with brexit and that it’s not the ‘will of the people’ as many leave voters & anstainers have become #RemainerNow
The Observer calls for a significant delay to #brexit, to allow more time to think and refresh. But we know by now that our politicians can’t come up with an answer in any amount of time. We need a #peoplesvote on the way forward. #fbpe
#BREXIT CAN BE DECLARED VOID: The allegations of overspending and corruption surrounding #VoteLeave’s campaign are a good enough reason to declare the #EUReferendum void, argues constitutional law expert, Dr Ewan McGaughey (@ewanmcg). Link to article: 
Only 10% think Govt doing good job on #Brexit.A majority say Brexit will be bad for UK.People want a 3-way #PeoplesVote by 50% to 40% margin.In that case, “Stay in EU” would win by 48% v 13% v 27%...then on 2nd prefs:59% (stay in)41% (crash-out)
I can’t help thinking this is the same 52%#Brexit 
Here is Raj, he voted leave as was persuaded by those advocating #brexit that it offered a great global future with new trade deals with the world whilst keeping EU links,. He's now realised that is false and is another #RemainerNow Fantastic @RajRuia, let's get a #PeoplesVote
Politicians claiming no deal is an option are lying to the public and business. No deal would be a catastrophe and they know it.Time for May, Fox, Raab et al to shut up and either sort out a proper deal or exit from #Brexit. Those are the only options.
UK Trade Secretary Liam Fox days "no deal" most likely #Brexit outcome for UK, blames @EU_Commission's “theological obsession” with #EU rules  /via @thetimes​↓A combination of ignorance, wishful thinking and bluff.
There is another word for “no-deal” #brexit- brexit(ie. what people voted for) 
The good: Germany is better prepared for No Deal than UK isThe (very) bad: that they’re even planning to do this is scary #brexit 
It‘s now a 60% CHANCE that UK will crash out of EU with NO DEAL after #Brexit ... says UK Trade Minister Liam Fox (who described EU Trade Deal as being ‘one of the easiest in human history’)Failure at first hurdle/Trade deal doesn’t bode well for future deals#DissolvetheUnion
BREXIT: Paul O’Grady so disgusted at Brexit risk to NHS he'd rip Nigel Farage to shreds / #Brexit #PeoplesVote #NHS
The absolute nonsense spouted by Christina on #SkyPapers tonight was astounding.The #Brexit fearmongering trotted out, one lie after another, many already publicly debunked.Her disdain for Leave voters is shocking too.A 'paper review'? I think not.
It's official.Germany the latest country to ramp up its customs staff to deal with #Brexit. By 900 staff. So far that's all UKs major trading partners in EU who have increased their customs officials.Except the UK.The country most affected. 
It's not a very cultural response but #Brexit really is gripping my shit. There really isn't a solitary fucking benefit to come out of Brexit is there? Don't fucking quote your pathetic respect the will of the people neither, it won't wash. Brexit is a fucking dumb thing to do. 
The British Pound is even more worthless than the Euro. I predict post-#Brexit, UK will need an IMF bailout (again) within 5 years.
Claims of post-#Brexit border chaos are just intended to frighten MPs into accepting the disastrous #ChequersPlan#ChequersMeansCorbyn
Tories in civil war Labour in civil war UK going down the #Brexit tubes. Scotland time to go!
Instead of Labour blaming Tories and Tories blaming Labour, doesn’t it make sense for both sides to blame the colonial US companies taking over the NHS and stealing everything they can get their hands on during this #Brexit political deadlock? 
Can all these Blairites “thinking about”, “on the point of” leaving @UKLabour over #Brexit #Corbyn #UncleTomCobleyAndAll but who energetically supported the slaughter of the Iraq War without a scintilla of “shame” just fuck-off already?
Just about sums up why we needed to leave in the first place. #Brexit 
This could be the pessimist in me but is all this talk of the EU being unhappy with @theresa_may ‘s chequers deal just a performance so that they can ‘reluctantly’ accept it and give the illusion that the UK got a win.While in reality the plan was designed for EU ? #brexit

..and it took the #Beeb just 20 seconds from starting the piece on Mark Carney's #Brexit warning to broadcast the words "Project Fear". It's not just the IDS false equivalence that's the problem, it's BBC's knee-jerk pro-Brexiting that reveals licence fee blackmailing by the Govt 
The most frightening and demoralising aspect of current debate on #Brexit is that there are people in this country who appear to have greater loyalty some liars and cheats than to looking after the best interests of country and citizens.I find that incomprehensible and disturbing

We need to fight back against #Brexit in the UK because it’s a fascist takeover 
It's too late for Corbyn now. He's left it too late to speak out against anti-Semitism. He's left it too late to change his mind on #Brexit. Just as the Lib Dems were tainted by coalition, he is now tainted by his inaction & ineptitude. Labour need a new leader.
The #Brexit vote had nothing to do with right wing propaganda and everything to do with democratic sovereignty. It’s something that we have a long history of, fought numerous wars for & value very highly in the UKWe understand that you’re not overly bothered, that’s fine 
Brexiteers lash 'deeply irresponsible' Bank of England Governor for being the 'high priest of project fear' after he sinks the pound with warning about 'uncomfortably high' risk of no deal  #Brexit

What is this the head of the ERG back in 2011 calling for a double referendum on #brexit with the second once we know terms? So some kind of #PeoplesVote may work? Sure @jacob_rees_mogg would want this Retweeted widely as he is a 'democrat'.#RemainerNow #StopBrexit
'No-deal' is a term used by remainiacs to alarm the population, no-deal is in fact a deal that ensures we Leave under World Trade Organisation terms, WTO is a deal in itself which the EU already operates under for all its trade outside the EU, as do we the UK.#WTO#Brexit
As a Latin scholar, I’m shocked that @Jacob_Rees_Mogg would say two referendums when calling for a measured and pragmatic approach to #brexit  Surely the correct term is referenda when using the plural.  Still, it’s good to know he’s firmly behind the call for a @peoplesvote_uk
If there were good, solid arguments for Britain to stay in the EU, wouldn’t Remainers be making that case instead of dreaming up increasingly laughable and easily debunked scare stories?  #Brexit
We are fighting to stop #Brexit, but not for the status quo. We need to #Remain in the EU, but we need reform and renewal as well. The @Andrew_Adonis & @williamnhutton book makes the case brilliantly. 
Remainiacs like @Anna_Soubry and @ChukaUmunna are a threat to democracy. They have no respect whatsoever for a vote as they refuse to honour the vote taken. There should be no more talk of referenda until at the very least the first vote has been implemented.#Brexit
Politics in the UK are a mess.Corbyn - crap. Enables Antisemitism and doesn't care.May - crap. Loves the EU, screwing over the electorate on #Brexit and doesn't care.Both have no credibility and cannot be trusted.Somebody, please sort this mess out. 
PICTURED: At last, a question we can all get behind… #Brexit 
Hey @campbellclaret I rejigged this old meme for you and brought it up to date. You can threaten us and try to continue to scare us but it will not work. There will be no second referendum. We voted to leave the #EU and we are leaving. #Brexit #ProjectFear

I am a North - South commuter. It’s just a drive or train ride and a pretty nice one at that. I will never consent to it being anything else. I will resist any ‘border’ by all legal and peaceful means. I am the many, the #brexit and border lovers are the few.

May did not take a single #Brexiteer to the Macron meeting - not even @DominicRaabLlewellyn was Cameron's chief of staff Remainer Barwell in 2016 said #Brexit was the "politics of hate and division"And we know all about May and Robbins 
I don’t think many understand the significance of the BOE raising interest rates at a time of austerity, uncertainty & unsustainable private debt.It’s so daft it has to be political. Specially as Carney then warned about the effects of #Brexit.He’s contributing to them.
With every single report on #Brexit, with every single editorial decision made, @BBCNews sinks lower & lower in the country's estimation. This is no longer about incompetence. This is deliberate & systematic bias. And it seems to be coming from the very top.

This is demonstrably untrue. You can check yourself on the EU treaties office database.  #Brexit

Its quite tragic but I've started to switch off from #Brexit . Simply because some of the stuff I read and hear is that utterly ridiculous & pathetic. Its just constant now & also so toxic.All I see is am enormous opportunity being wasted & national humiliation. So very sad
You have moved two investment funds to Dublin because of your fears of the havoc #Brexit will wreak on the UK. Janus-faced, aren't you?
If Britain leaves the EU on WTO terms this does not in fact amount to no deal. WTO is a deal, the one most countires use in international trade. We should go for that, save ourselves the £40bn, and get Britain out of the EU as soon as possible. #Brexit 
Brussles is increasingly terrified of a no deal #Brexit. They would lose the 40 billion they desperately need and British success would pose a mortal threat to the EU project. They're now ramping up Project Fear to new extremes. 
Where is your evidence of politically motivated forecasting from the BoE? You claim to champion British democracy yet everything you do and says proves you are hell bent on destroying the independent bodies that aim to uphold it. #Brexit

EU single market is “their problem, not ours!”"It's very hard to imagine how we could be worse off with all the threats being thrown at us by EU.To me threats smacks of blackmail & I think this is reason why I & so many people voted to Leave #EU”#Brexit
Mr Carney warned of possible recession if #Brexit vote. That was Project Fear Mark 1. We now have Project Fear Mark 2. 
Miranda: Let's get something clear, I am against Brexit but people such as yourself who paint it to be something akin to Pol Pot's "Year Zero" are as dangerous as  Jacob Rees Mogg. #Brexit 
The wheels on the red bus go round & round. Brexiter misleading half-truths regarding no deal continue.WTO may be feasible but it's devastating, deeply undesirable and only part of the story.No deal adds food shortages, £ devaluation, job losses, no flights to EU etc.#Brexit 
"It's not rocket science" to come up with an aviation agreement with the EU for after #Brexit - says British Airways chief Willie Walsh,dismissing remoaner scaremongering over #WTOBrexit.Indeed, it's not rocket science, it's plane common sense?

A no deal #Brexit will destroy the British fishing insustry. No point catching all your own fish if you've lost your prime export markets.
I find this @Telegraph story today the most bewildering story of #Brexit vs  #NHS yet. Will Brexit solve staff shortages? @SteveBarclay says yes. The facts say otherwise. /thread.
This SUPERB letter appeared in our local paper @hertsad today.I recommend EVERYBODY adapts it and emails/sends to their own MP.We HAVE to counter the #Leave campaign lies, the growing influence of #ReesMogg & his fascists and together stop a #nodealbrexit #brexit #stopbrexit
Why the @TSSAunion trade union is backing a referendum on the actual #Brexit deal, as explained by its General Secretary Manuel Cortes  @Manuel_TSSA :
Damning new study reveals that the withdrawal of welfare in poor areas allowed the Vote Leave campaign to “exploit” underlying worries about EU immigration and claims that billions were being spent on Brussels rather than at home in Britain  #Brexit
Since euref BBC editorial policy has been to uphold the result and to give a largely uncritical platform to #Brexit supporters. With rabid nationalism now gaining the upper hand, it is now facilitating the far right. Don‘t they read their own guidelines? Shameful

Mark Carney claims "no deal" #Brexit "highly undesirable", presumably favouring disastrous Chequers proposals. But a case of "wolf, wolf" - few will listen. 
No amount of snapping and yapping by John Humphrys could suppress Mark Carney's message that a No Deal #Brexit would be a disaster for Britain and that the chance of this happening is "uncomfortably high".Carney is no sensationalist.His message is calm & clear.Hear it Britain.
We live in a crazy world. Sky news covers the reality of #Brexit impact statements while the BBC buries it. BBC Today gives an unchallenged platform to Yaxley Lennon's odious far right campaign, the Sun tells us the truth How did the BBC move to the right of Murdoch? 
This is rubbish, faster post-grad courses already exist for those who have relevant degrees. It’s not a #Brexit dividend to have worse training for doctors fgs. What planet are these straw clutchers on? 
If you don't bother to vote you have no right to complain. But the fact Anna is that despite Remain outspending Leave by 2:1 and the full machinery of Government behind them they were only able to convince 16 million out of 46 to stay in the EU. #brexit
Your daily reminder @vote_leave broke the law and cheated during the #Brexit referendum. Meanwhile Leave EU appear to have been illegally funded from overseas. 
.@MichelBarnier sets out EU’s negotiating stance on #brexit with admirable clarity: via @EU_Commission
Oh yea. That’s right. Great idea. Let’s have doctors operating on patients after a couple of weeks training. On the job training for doctors. That’s what #Brexit will bring you. (Oh. And please could you reference the piece of #EU legislation which mandates 5 years’ training?)
The NFU(National Farmers Union) says a no deal #Brexit will be armageddon for UK farming. If we want to continue to see British soft fruit on our supermarket shelves continued access to migrant labour is crucial.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Young people are likely to be the most affected by #Brexit. They should be leading the push for a #PeoplesVote to take control of their futures:
By "Brexit reality" you mean "load of scaremongering BS about the UK starving to death with STDs and no petrol". And by "People's Vote" you mean "second referendum where you hope the plebs will do what you tell them this time". Reality my backside#brexit
Wow quite an intervention from Bank of England Governor Mark Carney on #R4Today saying the likelihood of a no deal #Brexit is currently "uncomfortably high" and a "highly undesirable" prospect. @Euronews
If you voted #Brexit, you may not have realised it would embolden fascists & racists everywhere. Since 2016, we've seen them crawl out of the woodwork & start to poison the UK, Europe & the USA. If you hate #racism & #fascism, it's time to fight back & call for a #PeoplesVote.
Fancy some holiday reading on the details of the #Brexitchaos, sector by sector, issue by issue?Then try my #Brexit Briefings:
Barnier again rejects the UK's #Brexit proposal, warning it poses a threat to the future of the EU's single marketIt is time now for May to stop being stubborn and to offer David Davis's alternative plan or to say No Deal via @MailOnline
Apart from Cameron disappearing into the sunset, all the reasons you voted for #Brexit will still be there, most of the reasons will get even worse. You'll gain nothing tangible, you'll lose like we all will. You've been played by the Brexeratti. Don't let them win, #PeoplesVote
The number of new EU nurses coming to Britain has gone from over 1000 per month (prior to the EU referendum) to almost 0 (since the EU referendum).The NHS now has a shortfall of 40,000 nurses, costing almost £1.5bn a year on temporary nurses to plug the rota gaps.#Brexit 
Gove was part of Vote Leave's #Brexit dream-team that promised us sunlit uplands, an "as good as now" EU deal & 'control'.But in reality #Brexit is a nightmare, harming those who voted for it most, trashing UK's standing & diminishing control.Gove's response? #BlindBrexitNO!
Just remove the term 'no deal' from the title & you cover all versions of this #BrexitShambles...There is only one type of #Brexit that has any hope of working in the National Interest & that's #StopBrexit.Utter Madness#PeoplesVote #Remain

#WeAreCorbyn gives me the creeps - we've seen enough echoes of the genocidal nationalism of the 20th century, now it's an echo of the genocidal leader-worship. Both extreme nationalism and leader-worship ares signs of a society in crisis. These are deeply troubling times.#Brexit
Fantastic and great to see Pro-Brexit Health Minister @SteveBarclay defending the benefits of #Brexit. Doctors could qualify more quickly after Brexit to solve staff shortages, minister says 
Interest raises because of #Brexit apparently,  Lady on @itvnews saying her mortgage is £15 a month more expensive and now she might loose her house  Over 15 quid a month? A take away or bottle of wine less a month will do it and I can you like your grub so don't lie.

Coming on for 30 years ago Gwyn Alf Williams memorably asked “When was Wales?”  Entirely appropriate now to ask “When was Britain?”  and in so doing to expose the myth making at the heart of the current #Brexit malaise 
Have to say that #TraceyUllman must have seen into the future when doing this sketch on @theresa_may’s indecision and playing both sides on #Brexit, not the mention a challenge to her leadership!#ChequersMeansCorbyn
He has considerable foresight. He made sure he was elected as an MP in order to maximise his influence on a no deal #Brexit. Once he gets his way he'll just disappear into his privileged lifestyle and count his amassing fortune, and say 'screw-you to his constituents. #Remain
I voted #Remain.I voted for @JeremyCorbyn in the 2nd Leadership Election AFTER the #Brexit ref.I voted Labour in the GE AFTER the #Brexit ref.I would vote Labour again tomorrow. Brexit belongs entirely to the Tories.I stand with Jeremy Corbyn!#WeAreCorbyn
Ali has hit the nail squarely on the head. Corbyn’s “let May cock it up and then take over” strategy is exactly the same as Johnson’s, Mogg’s & every other #Brexit extremist. If Brexit happens they will be at each other like rats in a barrel. It can be stopped by a #PeoplesVote

Today @EU_Commission #Brexit negotiator @MichelBarnier warned, ‘Let's be frank: as the UK has decided to leave the Single Market, it can no longer be as close economically to the rest of the EU.’ This is tragic. We need closest ties to thrive. Article link 
This is the Electoral Commission responding to overwhelming evidence of criminal activity by the Remain campaign. Double standards in refusing to investigate Remain even once and doing THREE for petty offences by Leave an affront to democracy. #Brexit

More #Brexit bad news. When the UK leaves they will run out of paperclips. Once out of the customs union, the UK will be at the mercy of Trump's steel tariffs, leading to a steel shortage. This will decimate the UK service industry, which relies heavily on paperclips. 
The father of Jacob Rees-Mogg co-wrote a book called Blood in the Streets, "How to make money during an Economic crash", now if that doesn't tell you what his motivation for a hard #Brexit is nothing will, forget the comedy this man us a hard right zealot, who'll screw us all.
So leaked documents on @theresa_may's #Brexit fudge confirm what we already know, in that people movement will continue beyond #Brexit.That red line is now white. Gone. Caput. Angry? Tell your MP now.#ChequersMeansCorbyn#MayMustGo
I am always drawing the parallel with 1930s Germany. I'm Jewish: grandparents murdered at Auschwitz. If you look at the rhetoric around #Brexit etc and the MSM hatred, it's so similar. I get viciously trolled, but hey... 
The interest rate rise today should have seen the pound rise, however, with manufacturing activity slowing combined with #Brexit uncertainty for business, the pound fell further against the Euro. Further bad news for the many UK pensioners in the EU27 who are already struggling.
#Brexit & #TrumpRussia are the same scandal. The US, UK, & NATO are under attack by a foreign power with help from our own citizens.
Recent reports only consolidate just how internally divided the @Conservatives are -- this Govt cannot be trusted to do the right thing in the interests of this country when it comes to #Brexit due to its instability.
Brexit: another Dunkirk moment - What is driving our approach to Brexit is not ideological. It is simply an attempt to balance the electoral equation to stay in office. It can only fail. #Brexit

Carney says the #BankofEngland's decision assumes a smooth and orderly #Brexit. This is a pretty heroic assumption, isn't it?
Increasingly WTO option is looking desirable. The more the EU say ‘non’ to everything we put forward, the #GlobalOption with its fully understood terms, trade facilitation agreement & codified customs rules looks best. Delivers the #Brexit referendum & projects UK’s soft power. 
This is about managing change. Few lorries entering or leaving the UK through Dover routes carry non-EU goods, facilities for customs are limited and just a handful of customs agents left. Like anything, it can fixed - but it costs and takes time.  #Brexit 
The UK is not heading towards a no-deal #Brexit by accident -- our country is heading down that path because of the incompetence of this Tory Govt. But we can escape this mess. It's time the people were given the final say on the deal, and an opportunity to remain in the EU.
As Mayor, I’m urging the PM to start putting the national interest ahead of her own political interests and change course on #Brexit immediately. Staying within the Single Market and the customs union is the only way to protect jobs and growth. 
#Brexit negotiation can reach good outcome. We must solve withdrawal issues incl. Ireland/NI. EU wants new partnership w/ UK on security & w/ ambitious FTA at its heart. We can do this based on #EuCo principles: indivisibility of 4 freedoms & EU autonomy

The new #Brexit Secretary must realise that the Govt must abandon their red lines which could cause us to lose information-sharing arrangements and the European Arrest Warrant, since the loss of those puts our national security at risk.
Austerity led to the #Brexit vote in 2016. If we don't stop #Brexit now, austerity will be sharpened and prolonged. If @UKLabour is to fight austerity and change the direction of the country, we must fight for and win a #PeoplesVote

Bloody hell @faisalislam must have been on lunch when this slipped out...#Brexit will not cause UK trade 'disruption' - WTO boss - Sky News 
The political class doesn’t represent the views of the people. The Brexit vote was carried on an abuse of the democratic process and a string of lies which the gov seems unwilling to confront. If #Brexit goes ahead it will be an economic and social disaster of epic proportions.
HELLO #EUArmy GOODBYE #Brexit With the failures of mass-migration destroying Europe, there's been a rise in Nationalism, weaking the EU.So in June of 2018... 9 nations agreed to build a "Joint Military Intervention Force".WATCH & LEARN: 
Theresa May's #Brexit plan would cost £500 per person per year according to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. The so-called soft Brexit Chequers deal will leave the UK considerably weaker than the status quo. #StopBrexit #RenewBritain 
As #Brexit day comes ever nearer, I just wondered if people were now putting 'I voted for Brexit' posters in their windows. They must be so proud of all the positive outcomes that will be delivered, they must want their friends and neighbours to know what they did.
This says it all. The people who know what happening with #Brexit are leaving the UK. It’s disgusting that the people influencing these decisions will make a personal fortune while everyone else struggles 
Where is Corbyn on #Brexit? We face biggest calamity post-war & he's silent. Party increasingly seen on the doorstep as self absorbed, out of touch and anti-Semitic. They need to follow the views of members and supporters, back a #peoplesvote & stop a calamitous Brexit. #FBPE

Our security chiefs have identified Russia as the prime security threat to this country. #Brexit would be a huge victory for Putin. Your government @Jeremy_Hunt is helping him gain that victory. A government of traitors!#BrexitBetraysBritain.#PeoplesVote
What if it wasn’t Britain leaving but another member state? Would the #EU27's actions seem punitive? An interesting counterfactual by @chrisgreybrexit for @prospect_uk#BREXIT

Cllr Matthew Robinson - "I would still vote to leave if there was another vote tomorrow."I think it is important that we have the opportunity to make our own trade deals and manage our own borders and manage our own laws." #Brexit 
THE DREAM TEAM OF . .  . @BorisJohnson & @Jacob_Rees_Mogg  might happen sooner than we think!  All Brexiteers are praying for this!  #borisjohnson #boris johnson #Brexit…
The secret to stopping #Brexit is to make it personal, all the talk of bankers relocating, lorries parking on a motorway don't directly affect the average Leave voter. How many people on a low income ever buy a chicken & avocado sandwich? #Brexit, make it personal for the Leaver

EU citizens living in the UK have the right to stand as candidates and vote in local council elections - but the Govt's chaotic #Brexit is putting that right at risk. Ministers must commit to protecting it.Sign the petition: 
Boris and Co sold the country an unworkable #Brexit, one with endless advantages and no costs.It was great #marketing but Brexit reality with #food stockpiles and years of economic hardship doesn't match the #sales pitch.It time for #PeoplesVote#StopBrexit
#Brexit means surviveRemain means thriveI know, tough call right?#PeoplesVote
Why should a slide in support for #Brexit, because it is a very bad thing and not in the best interests of our country, be feared by ministers? Not supporting Brexit means a handful of Brexeratti will miss out on vast windfalls, that is all. The rest of us will lose nothing. 
A #PeoplesVote may be our last chance to stop #Brexit but that's not saying much.Given that nothing has been done about the cheating, lying, dark money and vote rigging in the last referendum - all involving Cabinet ministers - there is little chance that it won't happen again.
1. Oh no you don't @MichelBarnier @guyverhofstadt @donaldtusk ..don't  you dare sell out the majority of Brits who want to #StopBrexit & #Remain whether in the UK or in the EU. A #Brexit fudge won't be worth the paper its written on.Stop pandering to May..she has no mandate.

The EU elite have been mulling over whether there was a firmer approach they could’ve taken to stop the Brits voting for #Brexit......despite Juncker declaring at one point in the campaign that the British would face the "consequences" as "deserters"

Shock-horror! #Brexit job losses in financial services now estimated to be far fewer (5,000-13,000) than previously estimated. Over 480,000 work in the City, 38% of which in financial services.  
Whilst #ProjectFear-mongers cry over avocados ripening enroute to our shores, Brexiteers smileThis over-hyped drama is only proof of the disaster that is the Common Agricultural Policy, one of the many reasons we voted leaveBritish farmers will seize this #Brexit opportunity 
I love this from @frankcottrell_b - both in terms of its hymn to non-instrumental version of art and literature but also his appeal for us all to stop seeing fellow citizens as alien enemies post #Brexit.  Made me stop & reflect.  
May warning EU leaders that a bad #Brexit deal will hurt them too, is a bit like a doctor telling you a jab will hurt him as much as it hurts you. Plainly bollocks and the EU leaders won't fall for it.Hard or Soft, #Brexit is her choice. She has nobody else to blame.
#Brexit'ers : "MOOR IMMUGRATION MEENS MORE CRIME, INNIT !!"#Germany (who's taken more migrants per population than any other EU nations)(Gee .. maybe it's down to actual proper police funding)
So dogs are disgusting,  bacon is dirty yet shagging your 9 yr old wife and gang-banging goats is fine.Couldn't make it up.#brexit 
Terrifying. #brexit in its current form is unconstitutional and it its allowed to happen, the Gov can bring sweeping changes without parliamentary approval. The PM decided to leave the EU not parliament. It sets a precedent. 
Britain's economy has been "resilient" and would do fine with a #WTOBrexit- Lloyds Banking Group CEO, António Horta-Osório.Another body blow to remoaner hopes of #Brexit apocalypse? 
By now, based on #brexit vote, we should (according to remain)*Emergency tax increasing budget*Economy in recession*800,000 job losses*75,000 City job lossesReality*No emergency budget*Economy has not even had a single quarter of negative growth*Unemployment record low

We need to do more than tell people that #Brexit will be harmful to them personally (even though it will). We need to offer them hope & a vision of how much better Britain could be without #Brexit. Help us to build this vision.8 Sep, #Leeds. 
There is a growing temptation 'to hand the whole stinking mess back to the people’ says @MollyMEP The country is shifting towards @TheGreenParty's pragmatic position: we should have a right to vote on the reality of #Brexit#PeoplesVote
Head of drink & food fed says #Brexit is becoming a nightmare. Drug companies admit to stockpiling drugs. A crisis made in the Tory party, now ministers scuttle around EU trying to win favour but looking desperate. Only way out of this mess is to have #PeoplesVote & start again
#Brexit is the mechanism by which fascists & racists feel able to justify their shabby little existence. The UK will be a smaller, weaker, poorer, less tolerant country if we leave. Shame on anyone who doesn't support a fair, informed, democratic final say for all.#PeoplesVote
WATCH NOW: @MrsEmmaJK voted leave in the #EUReferendum but is now demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal because of the uncertainty she's experienced

READ: @theresa_may #brexit plan could cost you £500 a year. @Alison_McGovern says "the national economic situation will rob Britain of the chance to invest in decent public services." We need a #PeoplesVote on the final deal:
#Brexit has gotten so ridiculous the Government is no longer trying to prove it is capable of striking a deal with the EU to avoid national suicide, but that it is preparing for economic paralysis by stockpiling canned goods.
This tweet  demonstrates the misunderstandings in the debates over #Brexit - freedom of movement isn’t about moving across borders without showing a passport. It’s about the right to live and work in different countries. 
It was an excellent and inspiring meeting with Foreign Secretary @Jeremy_Hunt. Key issues were the #Brexit negotiations and the future UK-EU relationship. We pursue a pragmatic approach and are prepared for the different possible scenarios of #Brexit. @foreignoffice
Mark only wants to hear from people who are worried about #Brexit for his #ProjectFear2 piece.
EU citizens! Citizen Paul sums it up brilliantly. Because of #Brexit millions will die from unspecified causes. The UK will become a dictatorship somehow. The threat is real. My message to the UK is to reverse course now, before it is too late. 
Britain's net contribution to the EU budget rose by almost 9% last year, to an astounding £8.8billion:  #Brexit
Sky news doing the due diligence and providing a public service over #Brexit impact studies. Where's the public service broadcaster on this though? Still reliant on shadowy foreign funded think tanks? 
Dear Jeremy Corbyn...#Brexit's on the slide...& you are SILENT...even if it happens it will FAIL...You'll find yourself held equally responsible for this #BrexitShambles..time's running out for the UK & you.Back a #PeoplesVote NOW...give us a #FinalSay with a #Remain option.
Deputy Chairman @CllrDSimmonds joined @adamboultonSKY on @SkyNews All Out Politics this morning to discuss internal #Brexit impact assessment reports being drawn up by councils @faisalislam
Britain's EU budget bill rises by 9% to £8.8billion (and it will go up AGAIN next year even though we'll have left)  #Brexit 
Yes, #Brexit is the stupidest possible thing we could do, and is supported by the stupidest people there are. 
I've followed this story and nearly all of the critics who argue against the Welsh language are Brexit fanatics. It goes to show that, for many, #Brexit was about re-establishing Britain's supremacy. Is it any wonder that the vast majority of Welsh speakers voted #Remain?
“If our generation fails to put up a proper fight, the generation that follows us will neither forgive nor forget, as theirs will be a diminished and, quite probably, dismantled United Kingdom.”[Gina Miller]  #Brexit #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw
The utterly shameful persecution of old soldiers by the now-Fenian/PC-dominated #PSNI is a disgrace. But 90% of the blame lies with the May regime. This only mirrors her betrayal on #Brexit
If this invalid #Brexit is allowed to go ahead..these ppl & the ERG will have won. History will not look kindly on those who have helped force it upon us Theresa May & Jeremy Corbyn.You don't Appease the Far Right, you Oppose it & Deny it air.#StopBrexit & #Remain#FinalSay.
Figures suggest the public didn't know exactly what it was voting for at the #euref which is why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal

The National Institute of economic & social research says the UK will be £500 a year per person worse off under the government's post #brexit plan. The Chequers plan will leave the UK's GDP 2.5% smaller compared to a Norway style arrangement with the EU. #StopBrexit #FBPE

"PM to plead with Emmanuel Macron to ease #Brexit stance."This is pathetic.We should offer a free trade deal and walk away.With WTO tariffs the EU would be £8,000,000,000 a year WORSE off.EU would soon come running.All this supine surrender must stop.
Why is #TheresaMay warning EU leaders that #brexit poses a risk to EU jobs? We elect and pay British politicians to promote and protect British jobs. If May is truly concerned about British jobs, she would abandon #brexit. Job done. #bbcr4today #brexitreality
Yes, I can see that threatening other EU states is a good way forward to sunlit #Brexit slopes. Hike off, Theresa, we’re going to #StopBrexit because you’ve embarrassed us enough. Give us our #PeoplesVote.

The stench of #Brexit will still be hanging over the Tories like a fish-gutter's coat. They've got this far by skulduggery, cheating & showing new levels of contempt for everyone but their own. I'm only wearing an expression of surprise as an act of politeness towards them.

I am a former @UKLabour Party member. I quit last year over #Brexit - I will never vote #Labour again should Brexit happen. I see absolutely no reason why #Corbyn should carry on denying a #PeoplesVote referendum on the final deal. I'd vote Labour if he did. If not, he's useless.

Once upon a time, @UKLabour was the party of hope for progressive people.Many are now saddened by their support for #Brexit & anti-semitic nonsense.Many of their supporters are now looking for a new home. Support the @LibDems
It is also, I'm afraid, down to English exceptionalism. The dislike of foreigners. The contempt for Scots/Welsh/Irish. It's far from new & it's well documented.  It's not true (of course) for all, but it's enough for #Brexit still to be popular.

I think this should prove even more, just as the #Brexit episode did, that we really cannot trust the mainstream media at all.We have to switch that shit off.We have to NOT buy the newspapers.Any journalist that you feel is a mouth piece has to be blocked.

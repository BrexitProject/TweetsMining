An actual bridge to actual Ireland vs a 'Festival of Brexit Britain'.  And this is printed on the front page of the Sunday Times. This country has lost its sh*t big style 
Theresa May is hoping her plans for a "festival of Brexit" will quieten the discontent at Conservative party conference.  
Why do Remainers insist on telling Brexiteers what Brexit is about? Nothing to do with protectionism or nationalism. It’s about seizing the future, embracing the world and re-invigorating the UK around a modern, vibrant democracy, rather than a grey and unaccountable bureaucracy.  
the Festival of Brexit Britain sounds good  
One of the things I hate most about Brexit is how I now have to think about ‘trade deals’ the UK has with other countries. I went to art school to study painting and ended up playing bass in a band - trade deals aren’t something I’m supposed to give any thought to. 
Dad in the pub tonight...wilnae talk politics.... phfft..guy says to him nobody will be deported post Brexit...Dad mentions Windrush and how it's already happening. Dad then mentions imported food shortages..and guy says he'll eat ok as he's a chef.. Dad bangs head against wall. 
will brexit end the scottish tory resurgence? my @scotonsunday column on difficult times for ruth davidson: 
Can you remember a worse government opposed by a worse opposition? A Tory Party split over Brexit with Boris Johnson waiting in the wings up against a Labour Party hijacked by a cult of personality. Who’d be a voter? But if you absolutely had to choose, which would you vote for?  
Ladies and gentlemen Boris backing a "Brexit bridge" to Northern Ireland is not news. The @telegraph reported the idea and his backing in June. 
Oh yes that's exactly why Brexit is going so badly. It's not that the whole project makes absolutely no sense and is fuelled by nostalgia for a time and place that never existed. 
I am all for rejecting Brexit but returning to the status quo would be just as disastrous for the ordinary person as crashing out of the EU.  
The takeaway from the thread on the Canadian ETHI committee's interview with Zack Massingham is the eloquent summation of the illegal activities during the EU referendum and @CharlieAngusNDP doing what too many UK commentators don't - dismiss attempted conflation of those facts. 
“Festival of Brexit Britain”…Oh god. I can just imagine.  
Fellow historians! I’ve asked you this before, but looking at this idea of @theresa_may’s — a ”historic” festival to celebrate Brexit Britain that will undoubtedly seek to recreate a past that never existed in the first place — come join me and dare ...  
A festival of brexit ? - I have a feeling what will happen there ... it’ll be sabotaged by pro Europeans ... I’ll gladly assist  
Moscow wants this weekend’s referendum to fail, but Macedonians should vote to change their country’s name and join Europe once and for all.  
The Brexit journey has been the greatest unifying moment in British political history, despite what the BBC says.Working class Brits and privileged economic libertarians suddenly realise they have virtually the same principles.Both have traditional BRITISH values and instincts.

Morten Morland on the former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, lashing out at Theresa May’s blueprint for Brexit – political cartoon gallery in Putney  
Riders to your question, Femi  1) how could a government disenfranchise 5 million voting-age UK Citizens to give an advantage to the Leave side in the 2016 UK EU Referendum  2) How can Mrs May get away with buying the votes of 10 DUP MPs with a £ 1 billion bribe after losing a GE 
Brexit costing Britain £500m a week and rising, new report shows.And without Brexit, austerity would be over.Didn’t see that on the side of the bus.Let’s #StopBrexit, #Remain in the EU, and fund our NHS instead. 
NBC: #Catalonia's separatists throw paint at police in #Barcelona, two-days ahead of anniversary of independence referendum marred when Spanish police clashed with voters, injuring hundreds.  
The oil-rich Iraqi region of Kurdistan is struggling to rebuild its economy, a year after an ill-fated independence referendum that Baghdad deemed illegal  
In just two days alone @Scotgov has delivered a pay increase for police, put dignity into disability assessments, shown that we are building affordable houses at faster rate than UK, and more...but always glad to hear from our single issue Brexit PM  
This is a fundamental error.The EU is no foreign thing. We are part of it. It is a supranational organisation that exists to serve its members. We & other nations decided to work together for a common good.It is not a nation state. It is not foreign. It is us. We are it. 
Boris Johnson’s #Brexit plans torn apart by another Irish person  
I voted to remain in #Europe & am very anti #Brexit.BUT the public cast their vote & there shouldn't be a 2nd chance.#Democracy is a responsibility & if some #Leave voters now regret their decision, tough shit. That's what you get for believing the media & @Nigel_Farage.  
Great work from @CharlieAngusNDP, @beynate and @frankbaylis in the Canadian Parliament to investigate the role of AIQ in Brexit.British MPs and regulators like @DamianCollins, @YvetteCooperMP, @CommonsCMS, @ICOnews and @ElectoralCommUK need to watch: 
I am sorry did John Major repent, do a mea culpa over the terrible things that occurred to poor people on his watch-or is that neo liberalism thrives in this era because people have political attention deficit disorder. #Brexit  
Brexit may well spell the end of the Tories' time in power because Theresa May has shown herself to be seriously lacking in good judgement#BrexitShambles #PeoplesVote 
While the majority of Britons have been, and will increasingly be, impoverished by #Brexit, certain lead Leavers have made a fortune on currency speculation, offshore havens and lucrative Russian deals. It's a heist, a hijack and downright daylight robbery  
As I couldn't get back to the Highlands in  time for the #SNPDayofAction , I had a great time in Alloa with the teams there - thanks for the hospitality. People on their doorsteps really happy to engage on the future - and see the shoddy way Scotland has been treated over #Brexit  
‘the UK economy is already 2.5% smaller than it would have been had Remain won the referendum. Public finances have been dented by £26bn a year, more than half of the defence budget. This translates to a penalty of £500m a week, a figure that is growing.’

Thanks to @brexit_sham for podcast from the uCampaign app developer, Thomas Peters, we have DIRECT EVIDENCE #CambridgeAnalytica data was 1) Used by Vote Leave 2) Used by Trump and 3) Now deployed by the Conservative Party 
I'm a community pharmacist. I source drugs for my patients on a daily even hourly basis. Since #Brexit obtaining staff has become impossible. Many drugs are unobtainable and generic prices have surged so much it has already cost the NHS half a billion pounds 
Guys, if we work together, we can make sure everyone knows the Festival of Brexit Britain as GammonFest before Theresa May even announces it, thus making that moment even more excruciating. 
Once #Brexit is dead (very soon), then we should band together to demand a reform of our FPTP voting system. Modern society is simply too complex and nuanced for the current two-party hegemony. It's time for proportional representation and an elected upper house. 
They promised us £350 million a week for the NHS.Turns out Brexit is *already* costing us £500 million a week, compared to if Remain had won the referendum.As an NHS doctor who wants the best for her patients, I seek a #PeoplesVote.#NHSAgainstBrexit 
My first EVER political cartoon. I drew this on March 13th 2017, the day Nicola announced the Scottish parliament would legislate for an independence referendum. I genuinely did dig my YES tshirt out that day!! Love this.  @NicolaSturgeon #yes #indyref #ScotlandCan 
So the Brexit bill is a COST of £500 million per week rather than a BENEFIT of £350 million per week as stated on Leave's Lie on the Bus.That is £850 million per week worse than Leave said, Put that on a bus.  
Britain’s bill for Brexit hits £500m a week – and rising  
Great to see @ObserverUK give such prominence to @CER_EU's forthcoming research on the cost of Brexit - UK economy now 2.5% smaller than it would have been. @JohnSpringford crunched the numbers. 
May has lambasted Boris’s Brexit plan saying ‘the right deal is close’. Has she forgotten what happened in Salzburg? Or has she received secret apologies from the EU? 
1/ Have heard some argue: "The German car industry will force EU concessions to avert a No-Deal Brexit."That's a bold hypothesis. I wanted to lay out the assumptions required.Ergo, it's thread time y'all. 
A vital thread! Something we & others have looked at in the past, yet, as with other strands in the #Brexit #VoteLeave #Tory #Trump #SCL #CambridgeAnalytica #AIQ story the MSM have pretty much ignored the connection. Article below may help your research:  
Brexit doesn't have this: a grassroots movement. Journalists don't seem to know about it or pay much attention to it. Does that matter? We trust media less and less - and here are real people out talking to real people on their high streets. #BotsDontVote, #BootsNotBots. 
Peters writes extensively about his #Brexit app on Medium. Worth reading how it worked.  
Apparently Gove is pushing for a Norway style Brexit and has convinced some cabinet Brexiteers to back him. Unfortunately, as one observer puts it:’Everyone thinks he’s betrayed everyone right, left and centre so it’s hard to see how he’s going to galvanise support.’ Quite. 
#ConservativePartyConference  Tories wasting billions on Barmy, totally bonkers Brexit. 500 million smackers per week !#fbpe

Toyota threat to quit UK over euro"Waiting for a decision is really hurting us and it is time to state very clearly to the British public that we want Britain to join the single currency"January 2000#Brexit 
On tomorrow’s @Telegraph front page: As part of their pledge to #StandUp4Brexit “Dozens of senior tory grassroots members, including more than 30 Conservative Association Chairmen, warn the Prime Minister that her plan ‘doesn’t deliver the Brexit that we were promised’”#CPC18 
David Davis accuses Whitehall officials in @Telegraph of falling to have a firm enough "grip on the practicalities" of Brexit  
The B word was missing from that @BBCNews report on new jets on new aircraft carrier. In addition to cuts big reason for the lower defence spending is lower pound post Brexit which has had got defence procurement hard. 
So he thinks the answer is to promise *another* bridge, and she, having campaigned for remain, thinks the answer is a "Brexit Festival" to mark "this moment of national renewal."From now on, the only option is to laugh. They are actual chimpanzees.  
‘Tory party faces huge people’s vote for ‘disgaceful’ Brexit breach’  
Extraordinary to think that a "festival of Brexit Britain" isn't the worst idea on this front page.  
Boris Johnson couldn’t even get a bridge across the Thames - a river that already has 33.Good luck getting one to Ireland - you total feckin spoofer #Brexit 
Baby Boxes, Police Pay Increases, NHS Pay Increases, Closing the attainment gap. Mitigating horrendous Tory welfare policies. How dare @SNP have the audacity to make the lives of Scottish people better than the rest of the UK. Its treason I tell ya. #Scotref #Brexit 
Boris Johnson“Unlike the Prime Minister I campaigned for #Brexit. Unlike the Prime Minister I fought for this. I believe in it. I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016”#StandUp4Brexit 
Britain’s economy is 2.5% smaller than if we had voted Reman - & the bill for Brexit has hit £500m a week  So can we sue those fraudsters who promised the NHS an extra £350m a week? 
The big anti-Brexit march in London is now three weeks away. It could be the most important political rally in the UK in my lifetime. It’s also a wonderful opportunity to see lots of you lovely people. I can’t wait!  
So Theresa May wants a Festival of Brexit Britain...FFS. Britain has now entered the arena of the unwell.  
Theresa May wants us to be proud and have a festival of Brexit Britain  Union Jack bunting draped around a Dyson vacuum standing on a sticky floor in Wetherspoons it is then.  
Ok, Brexiters. Here’s a compromise. I’ll accept that democracy is defined as a decision that people took in a referendum on one day and one day only, never to change, if you’ll accept that that day is 5th June 1975.

Don't want to be all metro-lib about this but a "Festival of Brexit Britain" brings to mind a room full of red faced old men inspecting a replica spitfire while drinking warm beer.  
'We need a more robust approach': David Davis unleashes criticism of Brexit negotiations  
The Leave crooks had Cambridge Analytica; we’ve got these bad boys. So, what finally stopped Brexit? Sticker charts.This is genuine - I think they’re wonderful; and gloriously British.  
The referendum was won by the Leavers so it means Brexit- I can explain it to you remainers but I can't understand it for you. 
Because changing nothing can change everything. Look for our Beauty Mark on photos of models that have not been thinned, smoothed or digitally altered.    
Britain’s bill for Brexit hits £500m a week – and risingUK’s economy is already 2.5% smaller than it would have been if the country had voted to remain. So much for that £350m a week “dividend”  
Comedian Patrick Kielty slams Boris Johnson's Brexit plan 
at a time when the country needed Labour to be holding the Cons to a/c more than almost ever too - straight after the referendum & when the 1st UN report on disabled human rights' abuses was published. Anyone involved in that #Chickencoup has a lot to answer for - to everyone. 
Brexit is the biggest ever demonstration of the sunk cost fallacy. 
I think that @carolecadwalla @DamianCollins @brexit_sham @peterjukes @ICOnews needs to have a look at this thread.  It looks as if the Conservative Campaign App is insecure & is an offshoot of UCampaign.Isn’t that NationBuilder (also used by the NRA?)@J_amesp @DelvingHaylee 
So are you at last going to start whipping MP's against Brexit?Or will you continue to wring your hands whilst people get poorer by the day?You are part of the problem. Start to be part of the solution.  
Do please retweet if like me you fear what kind of country we’ll become - what kind of values we’ll have - if we don’t now abandon Brexit.

We have accepted as a country that it’s OK to break the law.  Even after Damian Collins, the Conservative MP chairing the parliamentary fake news inquiry, made clear calls for the government to say what it was doing, there’s been a deafening silence. 
I don't like using the "S" word but the "we've already voted" argument only has two explanations. Either pride matters to you more than the good of the country or you have chosen to pretend Brexit is a simple in-out despite hearing a whirlwind of technicalities for 2 years.

@xtophercook The BBC are effectively controlled by the Tory/Brexit party now, Shahmir. That much is self-evident. Their problem is, though, that there is a lot of crime in "brexit" so that it will likely now be stopped by law, even without the BBC's "journalism"

Mooo! Well done to our friends in @EuroMove_MK! We herd they were out for 4.5 hours in a town that voted 51% for Leave in 2016, and yet not one person said Brexit is going well! The people of Milton Keynes have obviously moooved on!  We must have a #PeoplesVote! #LoveMK 
2/ the app was developed by Social Political Media, the same entity behind the anti-abortion apps LoveBoth & MY8 used in the  Irish referendum on abortion,  .. but Social Political Media also developed the …. Vote Leave app, the Trump-Pence 2016 app, the French Renaissance app 
Victor Meldrew takes the piss. The#brexit special doesn’t match what was promised !  
RTÉ's Paul Cunningham was asked to explain Brexit to children for @rtenews news2day. However, his concise explanation of the issues in simple terms has found a much wider audience - it's not just children tuning in. 
The scandal of the the US dark money  funding UK think tanks. Step forward: Adam Smith Institute, Institute of Economic Affairs, Legatum Institute & Policy Exchange: all promoting a post-Brexit future of deregulation & slashing & burning social protection. 
Could some helpful Remainer please explain to me — if we have a “soft Brexit” and remain in the Single Market and the Customs Union, in what sense will we have actually left the EU?  I only ask, because I want to know. 
May demands respect from the EU, she should look 1st to her own party.Many of us are banned from @Jacob_Rees_Mogg's talk 'Respecting the Referendum' at #CPC18 & 100's of us are blocked by Tory MPs. Petitions are routinely ignored. Legitimate questions go unanswered. #StopBrexit 
Heading back to Berlin from UK in my car. Possibly for the last time. Thanks Brexit.  
Catalan separatists throw colored powder, clash with police in Barcelona ahead of referendum anniversary.  
final results from the Milton Keynes Brexitometer: NOBODY thinks Brexit is going well. not one person.  we also got pages and pages of petition signatures!!  the citizens of MK want a #PeoplesVote!!  @peoplesvote_uk @MarkLancasterMK 
How come our democracy has allowed a bunch of lying bastard politicians, backed by a handful of tax-avoiding billionaire media owners, to run amok and potentially ruin our country? #Brexit pic.twitter.com/2VohihpLWE

A children’s television programme has managed to do a better job of analysing Brexit than any of the leading Brexiteers.   
Just awful - research money & influence is already flowing away from the United Kingdom  #brexit #brexitreality via @nature 
Final results from our #PeoplesVote #Brexitometer with overwhelming opinion that Brexit is bad and we need a #FinalSay.  Many people expressed their fears for our future if we leave the EU.  We need to remain and fight for a positive future. 
wow: Michigan's referendum on a voting-rights package is ahead by a HUGE margin in new EPIC-MRA poll: 70% to 24%!Package contains automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, no-excuse absentee voting, and more. This is 1st poll I've seen.  
Brexit is already causing a drop in UK science participation, coordination and investment.(Data from: ] 
Two teams out today with Brexitometers, one in Lancaster and one in Preston. Here is the result from Preston, who says people from the north want Brexit? Pretty clear Prestonians want a #peoplesvote @peoplesvote_uk @AtStalls @CatSmithMP @markhendrickmp @johnpotterLD 
Brexit can and should be stopped  
This is probably more controversial than Brexit but it has to be the jam then cream!  
Last year the letters fell off the wall. Before Tory Conference even begins this year there is an amateur security lapse of data, no wonder Brexit is going so badly. 
Wrong!  More people would now vote leave if there is a second referendum, so losers, you better start on the third referendum. 
#ICYMI: Labour MP Stephen Pound talking sense on #Brexit  
If I don’t see the BBC cover AIQ at their Canadian Parliament hearing by tonight I’m officially losing all faith in them as a reputable news source. This is in the public interest, it involves Russian interference, Downing Street, Conservative ministers & Brexit. 
This should inspire confidence in #EU about UK data protection post #Brexit..........  
I wonder what the good folk of #nottingham think about #brexit? Let's go live to the Market Square and see how the #peoplesvote interactive #brexitometer is coping under the strain of many hundreds of opinions aka: sticky stars. 
I for one am amazed that the Tory party that’s proved itself with Brexit to be the most competent government in history should have presided over such a terrible cock-up. 
Great turnout today in Wrexham to help with our Brexitometer & talk to the people of Wrexham about Brexit & the People’s Vote. Thanks to everyone who helped & responded to the Brexitometer. @Gogs4Europe @WalesForEurope @IanCLucas @peoplesvote_hq @peoplesvote_uk 
I hope people on both the Leave and Remain side of the Brexit argument will take a minute to read this & recognise who is really funding the campaigns.Who is paying for Remain and Peoples Vote? The European Movement, Open Britain Ltd and Best for Britain 
In or around Birmingham? Want to let @theresa_may what you think about #Brexit? Then get to Victoria Square tomorrow (Sunday) from 11am & join the #StopBrexit protest. This right-wing chaos which will destroy our kids’ future has to stop. @euinbrum @WalsallAdv @birminghampost 
Our man @C4Ciaran asked the people of South Shields if they think Boris Johnson has a better plan for Brexit than Theresa May...  
SNP still out and about in Springburn. A traditional Labour heartland here, but a number of Labour voters telling us they will now be voting SNP, as they don't like  Labour's hard line on independence or vague stance on Brexit. #activesnp #ScotlandCan 
It is good getting out to speak to the public these days, the majority of people back a #PeoplesVote. It was very different a year ago when most still thought Brexit might deliver a good deal. @euromove @peoplesvote_uk @mkfm @MKLabourParty @MKLibDems @mkgreens @MKConservatives

I’m backing a public vote so that the British people get the final say on Brexit – retweet to show your support.  
'We'll implement a technological solution to address the Irish Border issue and make a success of Brexit. It's not that hard if we use technology...'  
Last year: We can’t make letters stick on a board behind the PM. This year: Give Boris Johnson a call with your views on Brexit. 
I would support almost everything in Boris Johnson's Brexit article, writes @MarcusFysh 
The only Greeks who are anti-EU are the fascist Golden Dawn. Stop using the Greek situation as an excuse for the fascist coup that is Brexit. You are not Greek but @prentoulis is so read this & stop the lies. 
No one works harder to stop this Tory Brexit than @ChrisLeslieMP. In the chamber and behind the scenes he is flat-out, finding ways through this that protects our economy for the workers who need it most. Those who vote no-confidence in him are seriously fighting the wrong battle 
Shakespeare in the age of Brexit and Trump: the play’s still the thing  
If our MP in #Richmond@ZacGoldsmith understood the meaning of democracy he would start fighting #Brexit now. His constituents are not the arch brexiteers he is @peoplesvote_uk#brexometer #PeoplesVote 
This man isn’t from London, he isn’t part of the Westminster/Brexit elite, and he is one of the ever growing leave voters demanding a #PeoplesVote.So please stop saying the @peoplesvote_uk campaign is London centric & elitist. It’s people like this you’re insulting. @FFSake_

Helping at the People’s Vote stall in #Manchester today at the results are so far looking rather conclusive... #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
So, if we don't like an election/referendum result all we have to do is shout 'Russian collusion' or 'not real democracy' & overturn it? Who gets to decide which votes are 'democratic' and which aren'tDoes the obvious problem here really pass you by?  
Come on @jeremycorbyn these are your constituents. Now that @peoplesvote_uk is part of Labour policy (if no election) you can sign up. You love a good March. Come on. Join in. Join the many who want a @peoplesvote_uk not the few who want a hard right hard Brexit

Grassroots Conservatives attack party 'intolerance' after debate on fresh Brexit referendum is obstructed  
Interesting morning talking to people in our new town centre. Regardless of view on Brexit, increasing numbers want a #FinalSay 
.@fotoole gets a neat description of Brexit from Gibraltar's economy minister, Joe Bossano  
Fantastic public support across the country for a vote on the Brexit deal. From Belfast to Thanet, Edinburgh to the Isle of Wight and Pontypridd to Norwich, the message is clear - people want to take back control of this Brexit shambles. #PeoplesVote 
Met up with 2 friends today, conversation turned to the current mess - ie Brexit. One was in total disbelief & agreement with me. One appeared to be still so ignorant that I wanted to shake her. All my facts about EU and Brexit were met with a vacant "Really?". Terrible apathy. 
#Catalonia: During a counter-demo by pro-independence protesters in downtown #Barcelona, against a fascist march to honor cops that took part in last year's referendum crackdown. @mossos attacked the demo with batons and violence. 
The Bromley Brexitometer clearly illustrates what the good people of Bromley think on this sunny Saturday afternoon. Seems most people want a @peoplesvote_uk, they think Brexit is NOT going well and that it’s NOT going to be good for our @NHS. #Bromley #Beckenham #Orpington 
The beginnings of the far right US infiltration of UK politics which led to Bannon, Mercer, #CambridgeAnalytica and #Brexit begin around here. Same shady money and transatlantic alliances (HT @NarcAware)   
Essential reading. A WTO orderly Brexit will REDUCE food prices in the UK.   
Worried about your residency status after #Brexit? Pop a postcard to Mrs May c/o the ICC Birmingham and ask her what she’ doing to protect you in a NoDeal. Be quick. A million postcards would be a story.  
Former British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said Friday that Prime Minister Theresa May's blueprint for Brexit would be a "political and economic disaster" and he refused to rule out trying to replace her.  
This from Bracknell today. Striking that these very clear results are mirrored across our country. They certainly reflect what I’m hearing in my constituency and elsewhere. We must give Britain the #FinalSay on Brexit in a new vote #PeoplesVote 
Being 'deeply unhelpful' (sic @sajidjavid ) all over the place ...#peoplesvote #brexit #FinalSay #cancersurvivor #NHS #WATON #fbpe 
Macron is another generic "progressive" globalist - very much part of the euro-elite groupthink who vomit empty virtue signalling slogans into the international domain. #Brexit is an attempt to reclaim politics for ourselves and snatch it away from the dead hand of technocracy.  
We need to work together to mobilise against a Tory Brexit and another Tory Government. Sorry to see that the message of unity that came from Jeremy Corbyn’s conference speech hasn’t been heard in Nottingham East.  
Overwhelming support for @theSNP and Scottish Independence at the doors in the Garngad this afternoon. A clear message that with the chaos of brexit looming the people want another choice #ScotlandCan #ActiveSNP 
John Major getting straight to it: a People’s Vote to get the country out of the Brexit mess.  
Don't worry about Brexit shortages, just tap into those stocks, bonds and inheritance.   
Good morning out campaigning in Corkerhill, brexit chaos certainly making many No voters switch to Yes when it comes to a future independence referendum!Also popped into local gala day at Moss Heights, great community buzz, well done to organisers!  
Sky Data poll: 56% think Brexit will be worse than expected.Majority of the public now want a #PeoplesVote with an #OptionToRemain, 50% to 39%.And #Remain would now win by a huge 10 point margin, 55% to 45%.Please RT so everyone knows. #StopBrexit.

This is madness. My friend @ChrisLeslieMP is a brilliant campaigner on Brexit & People’s Vote.  This hard left bullying alienates members and voters. It must stop.  
Don't know where the mafia, sorry, typo I mean media, get their stats from. I haven't changed my mind about Brexit, the sooner the better we get out and stand on our two feet the better. 
Why are we surprised 56% think Brexit will be worse than expected, when all the media, the political elite & Mark Carney have done for the last 28 months is talk the nation into a state of catatonic panic?

Tragic: Within a day of Ireland's abortion referendum becoming law, officials say all abortions will be funded by taxpayers.Ireland's health minister said abortion "will be free" and part of the government-run healthcare system.  
Real pleasure to meet @alexander_olly - mega star quality! And totally on the side of the angels against Brexit and for @peoplesvote_uk We discussed how  we can be #deeplyunhelpful to the Brexit elite who want Uk as tax haven. Ps he loved my shirt  
Our Brexitometer shows people of MK feel Brexit is going badly & support a #PeoplesVote! There should be a vote on any deal agreed, if it is good for the country people can support, if it fails the Leave vision of 2 years ago they can reconsider. @EuroMove @mkfm @MarkLancasterMK 
Throughout my 3 years in parliament I have always been deeply impressed by @chrisleslieMP. His forensic attacks on the Tories in the chamber always leave them reeling, and he’s playing a pivotal role in exposing the incompetence of the govt on #Brexit. 
Campaigning with @Maryhill_SNP in Springburn. Strong Indy support. People switching Labour to SNP mentioning #Brexit as reason #ActiveSNP 
With six months to go, Brexit has never looked more baffling. Here's what you need to know:  
This is hopeful. 
@ChrisLeslieMP works hard for the people he represents. Honest & principled, his leadership on Brexit and #PeoplesVote has been second to none.  Those who condemn him are not progressives; rather they represent the politics of division and hate. 
We were out with our monthly stall again this morning. We have started our campaigning for the independence referendum that is coming. Lots of positive conversations about Scotland being independent. A lot of concern about Brexit. #indyref2 #independence 
Chequers would stop a post-Brexit government pursuing a more active form of economic strategy  
SNP day of action in Montrose. Canvassing and leafleting. Resounding opposition to Brexit and support for Independence. #activeSNP #SNP #ScotlandCan 
Now there's a coincidence: all the main UK car-makers have . . . er . . . completely independently . . . made Project Fear warnings re Brexit which Remoaner Business Secretary Greg Clark just happens to agree with - on the eve of the Tory Conference. Fancy that! #StandUp4Brexit 
A Northern Irish comedian and presenter weighs into brexit.Kielty is the son of businessman John "Jack" Kielty, who was shot dead on 25 January 1988 by the Ulster Freedom Fighters  
Moderate views are being crushed out from our politics on both left and right & yet there is a complacency that ‘everything will be alright’. If we suffer the hardest No Deal Brexit followed by hard left Govt as a result, stand by for an epic crash.  
Police tweet declaring "I am tired of the SNP still going on about" a second independence referendum is posted and hastily deleted  
Really looking forward to the Tory conference and hear them explain how they have spent the last 2+ years focusing solely on #Brexit and have managed to get absolutely nowhere. Should be stirring stuff.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote 
British politics I know, but a great take down and all arguments that could be made against the American left!#Brexit #MAGA #rodliddle @KTHopkins 
George Osborne has taught Italians a lesson: the way to raise public debt (and trigger Italexit/Brexit) is to cut spending & impose austerity. They are determined not to follow his example & instead propose moderate fiscal expansion.

And, of course, the Albanian loan shark killed in the latest mafia shootout in Skopje was a supporter of Zoran Zaev and of the referendum to rename #Macedonia#Zaevistan 
Kez. I know you may not understand, but this isn't really the worst thing your party has done. Lying to Scots for 2 years to keep us shackled to WM and now having Brexit forced upon us, is far, far worse.

“No-deal Brexit would wipe out decade of GAINS from austerity, warns Philip Hammond”What GAINS?? 
Every time anyone comes out for a second referendum there's a gaggle of objectors pointing out why they have no right to speak because of such-and-such in their past. 
The disturbing reality is that if Brexit were stopped because of the threat of a resurgent IRA, the terrorists would have defeated democracy and won. As Margaret Thatcher said after the Brighton bomb, “All attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.” And so they must.  
People in Norwich think Brexit is going badly and is bad for the NHS and jobs locally and bad for our country. They want a #PeoplesVote @labourlewis

Tory MP says she would back new Brexit vote  
LISTEN: Conservative MP Heidi Allen announces her support for a People's Vote, sharing why it's fair for the British public to have a say on the final #Brexit deal  
A 2nd EU ref would never work because if remainers lost they would just demand a 3rd vote & if brexiteers lost we would argue the vote was invalid just like the 1st Brexit vote was invalidated. Democracy only works when votes are upheld, we voted to leave.  
Today marks 6 months to Brexit day. In the next 6 months Brexit will come under attack like never before from desperate remoaners saying the UK will collapse, the economy will go bankrupt & that we must delay or stop Brexit. Ignore all the scaremongering & get ready to leave EU..  
Everyone interested in Brexit should read this thread by @piris_jc and then stop talking about Chequers

Tory MP Allen backs new Brexit vote  
Campaigned for Remain, unelected as PM, promises sovereign Brexit then U-turns, calls snap election and then loses seats along with bargaining power, hands over £40bn to the EU and screws up negotiations...You'd think she'd be even less popular.  
No matter how bad Brexit may seem, each and every day we unravel a new layer of awfulness. Yesterday the #3Blokes visited the British territory of Gibraltar. "Thrown to the wolves" is…  
EEA (or thereabouts) wdnt unite the Conservative Party. "SuperCanada" wdnt either. I used to be an optimist about ppl in the party coming together to move beyond #Brexit. Maybe it's just b/c we are still in the thick of negotiations, but that optimism is fast failing. Dejecting. 
The will of the people has changed!They're now very pessimistic about Brexit, & clearly favour holding a referendum.On #Remain v #nodeal #Brexit, Remain leads 55%-45%.The case for #PeoplesVote #FinalSay leading to #ExitFromBrexit is overwhelming. 
#brexit is a nationalist project to destroy the greatest & successful experiment in Peace humanity has yet devised.There is no @UKLabour Brexit, just holding hands with @BorisJohnson & @Nigel_Farage across the dark underside of politics. Immigration is good for British Culture 
But - the point I will not surrender on is this. Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson and most of the ERG lot will not be impacted personally by Brexit. They are living in a completely different world. They are playing a political game - chess - with other people's lives and the UK itself 
Those who warn that we may come to no workable post Brexit EU trade deal might ruminate upon the fact that the UK - 'Treasure Island' - is the German Car industry's BIGGEST customer. #BrexitSHENANIGANS 
MPs could still alter successful Brexit deal, researchers find  
Strong words from ⁦@FineGael@BorisJohnson’s #brexit plan has been branded “nothing more than ignorant & irrelevant” by Ireland’s governing party. ⁦@nealerichmond⁩ says Boris is trying to “belittle the solid commitments” his government made 
Toyota UK has told the BBC a no-deal Brexit would temporarily halt output at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby. Not Project Fear - Project FACT. Still the Brextremists refuse to listen.

Both of these men are hypocrites. Major never allowed the people to have a say on the Maastricht treaty in 1992. Miliband- a former foreign secretary- was part of the last Labour government that lied to us saying that they would hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  
Huge turnout across the country already for the #PeoplesVote action day - teams in every corner of the UK talking to their local residents about the need to give us a #PeoplesVote on the Brexit deal.

So he’s changed his mind and would like another go at the decision? I know one or two other people who may feel the same way about the rest of Brexit.  
Ireland matters. Gibraltar matters. So do the 48 million people in the U.K. who did not vote for Brexit. “The EU is not responsible for your blundering - Patrick Kielty slams Boris Johnson's Brexit plan” -  
#Brexit is not about the terms of any trade deal. It’s much more important than that. But our democracy has been subordinated to the wishes of commercial corporations who want to flood this country with even cheaper labour, and whose primary duty is to their shareholders.  
Thank you also those established groups like @Facts4euOrg and @VeteransBritain who helped get our name out there. We’re just two blokes with a laptop trying to show that businesses can be and should be positive about the opportunities of Brexit!   
“We are not some minnow. We are one of the biggest EU economies, one of the biggest economies in the world.“We are not going to get on our hands and knees and crawl back cap in hand for this deal.”The Brexit Sec finally shows some no deal steel.  
6.2 yrs on...a NonBinding Ref turned into a deeply flawed #Brexit based on lies & illegalities & lost mandates in GE2017 with no public debate or CONSENT for the end game & Removal of Rights has no legitimacy save that imposed by vested Party self-interest: It cannot stand. 
This is nonsense... there is no Brexit that ‘protects the prosperity and well-being of people across the UK’ @fmwales⁩ ⁦@AMCarwyn⁩ The only good Brexit is No Brexit.That’s why we need a ⁦@peoplesvote_uk⁩ 
If labour members spend more time trying to censure MPs like @ChrisLeslieMP for having his own opinion on our relationship with Europe than challenging Boris and co for breaking it, it’s hard to argue they have Britain’s best interests at heart. Fight Brexit- not each other…  
Wouldnt that be nice if our Brexit views - you know, government and Labour Party manifesto pledges- were respected by senior politicians like Mandelson?  
Boris the Jedi !!#BorisJohnson #Boris4PM #Brexit #EU 
BREAKING: Tony Price MP, Leader of Plaid Cymru rants "We must use every means available to destroy this no deal #Brexit Remain should absolutely be on the ballot."Wales voted to LEAVE the EU. Typical ignorant Remain sc*mbag.  
I am sick of Leftie Remoaners harping on, and arguing about the Red Bus, and being lied too. For god sake these idiot's can't see how many lies their side said, crashing economy, good prices up, holidays and flights up, clothes up. These imbeciles respect Brexit Result Democracy. 
Last year's Conservative party conference was sponsored by American Sugar Refining aka Tate and Lyle - sugar is one of the great unreported issues in Brexit. And it's a scandal.  #CPC18 #ConservativePartyConference 
Thank you to all our business owners and entrepreneurs. Coverage in the Telegraph this morning and more to come this weekend! We are getting inbounds from MPs now thanks to you. They are listening. #ChuckChequers #Brexit 
Sky’s relentless anti-Brexit propaganda campaign seems to be working then. 
How many countries send in military and police to assault citizens, including the elderly, during a referendum? #spain 
''Someone lied to me and now I know it's the wrong thing to do'' This audience member, who voted leave, says she has now changed her mind and wants a second referendum #bbcqt 
TL:DR Raab blames others for inevitable consequences of UKGov’s choices. Brexit in a nut shell, or, more accurately, case. 4/4 
@skynews non stop drivel of anti brexit propoganda. The Referendum has shown us that proper journalism has died alongside democracy. 
@Eileen43Eileen Millions of working families have less than 100 quid in the bank, so, once again, the Brexit lie machine kicks in with Mogg talking fiscal loopholes with people who his party have reduced to penury. A nice archaic word for him to conjure with 
WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING? Perhaps you’ll find that the electorate will decide for you all. #PeoplesVote #Brexit  
EU chiefs are using the Irish border issue as part of plot to break up the UK as 'punishment' for Brexit  
Today you’ll spot lots of nice @peoplesvote_uk folk out campaigning to stop Brexit. Please do take the time to politely explain to them that we’ve already had a #PeoplesVote in 2016 & that this is a #LosersVote by those who don’t respect democracy. They’ll appreciate the feedback 
Can you offer an individual subscription membership please for those of us who want nothing to do with Brexit.  
Recap:We colonise Ireland.Most of the Island frees itself leaving only Northern Ireland in the UK.Violence between those loyal to us and those wanting Irish unity is stopped by the Good Friday Agreement.We vote Brexit, ruining the GFA, without giving them a second's thought?  
Toyota has no evidence that there would be major border delays if "no deal" #Brexit. So scaremongering. Moreover, Toyota should know that even under Chequers there would be a customs border as UK is leaving the Customs Unoin.  
Desperate shark-jumping from Raab here. a)The Irish border issue flows directly from Brexit and UKGov’s choice to leave the SM & CU; b) the ‘political end’ is sustaining the GFA; c) UKGov signed up to the backstop in Dec17; d) some checks already exist in Irish Sea. 1/

Kenyans! Let me tell you this FOR FREE. Kenya's problem is CORRUPTION, WASTAGE and MISMANAGEMENT period!!! This thing about referendum is ESCAPISM, IT'S A DEVIATION. Even if you have a referendum without addressing the above IT WILL BE NO WORK DONE

Good. Not only do we need to get to the bottom of this for the Referendum, but because the future of our democracy is at stake. #StopBrexit 
"There are still people who believe a no deal outcome automatically means Brexit will not happen. This is a dangerous fantasy."  - @J_amesp#NoDealBrexit#Brexit 
Most humiliating thing about Brexit is that @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is now known outside of the U.K. and is no longer our embarrassing little secret.

German TV news now saying no deal Brexit is “most likely” and that the situation in the UK is “totally crazy” with “no good options”...  
You were selected on a leave manifesto, you stood in front of the country and lied through your teeth,you now want to rerun the referendum,so it’s only right to have a vote to deselect you,don’t talk about democracy,you wouldn’t know it if it bit your face off  
56% of Britons think the outcome of Brexit will be worse than they thought when voting, against 26% who think it will be as bad as expected, and 9% who think it will be better  
Because of concerns about the food supply impact of a no deal Brexit, the UK government has appointed a Minister for Food Supplies. In effect, a Minister for stockpiling and rationing - in peacetime.Take back control everyone. 
Comfortably insulated from the Brexit they are keen to inflict on manufacturing workers.  
And here he is, Boris Johnson cycling into the sunset and refusing to answer @krishgm’s questions on NI.Scared of the Brexit detail, it seems. Something he admittedly didn’t have a handle on from within the highest ranks of the govt he served in.

Excellent thread explaining Northern Ireland & Brexit from someone who knows a thing or two about its history, politics & culture.  
Have always liked @PatricKielty ever since we were team-mates with Maradona in the game I never talk about. But I like him even more now. Go see his recent tweets to see why. Superb demolition of the Brexit elite hellbent on destroying UK and Ireland

‘Government to face legal challenge over refusal to hold Mueller-style inquiry into Brexit referendum’I may dislike US politics, but goodness knows we could use a Mueller here. There are UK politicians with their trotters up, who should be locked up.  
In 2015 @David_Cameron called an election, offering a referendum on Leaving the EU. We voted for a Referendum.2016, we held the Referendum. We voted to Leave.2017 @theresa_may called an election, with Leave as her mandate. We voted to Leave.We voted Leave 3 times #peoplesvote 
Surely Boris could have just said "I haven't done an interview with you because C4 News is so biased against Brexit that it would be pointless".  
"My view is that if Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March we will see production stops in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, managing director at Burnaston Toyota factory.Case closed.Brexit doesn´t work.#StopBrexit 
The Tories have an immobile Chancellor in a stalled government, run by a Prime Minister who is (inevitably) paralysed by Brexit. Meanwhile, the Labour Party is moving at 100mph. My column:  
I'm still shocked that the UK has appointed a Minister for Food Supplies.  That's a Minister for rationing folks.   In PEACETIME!  I'm not surprised it's needed because of Brexit but shocked nonetheless. 
‘Toyota says no-deal Brexit would stall production’I’m sick to death of these car manufacturers thinking they know more about car manufacturing than Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg. They went to Eton, FFS! 
"Official - UK is biggest loser in EU28, for EU trade"  Official EU figures confirm what Brexiteers have been saying for years. Read the pro-#Brexit Facts4EU summary here:  
Best explanation of Brexit I’ve seen so far! Makes it so simple and exposes the ignorance of so many involved in the process. Oh... and it’s KIDS TV! Thanks @mrjamesob 
‘56% of Britons think the outcome of Brexit will be worse than they thought when voting, against 26% who think it will be as bad as expected, and 9% who think it will be better.’I didn’t know that 9% of the UK population had been lobotomised. 
The people in the blue area have voted to put a border in the area where the people in the yellow area live.Brexit democracy in a nutshell.Why not just move the border between blue and yellow instead?  
Heidi Allen MP on @BBCr4today says that a new vote on Brexit is needed because Chequers has failed and the people deserve a #FinalSay on whatever deal comes back from Brussels. We are pleased that @heidiallen75 has joined the MPs who see the need for a #PeoplesVote! 
Remember, to host a BBC programme, you must be seen to be studiously impartial on political issues. Can anyone make a wild stab in the dark and guess how the first six people on this list voted on Brexit, the major issue of our time? What are the odds, eh?

ADDENDUM: I am not suggesting that Brexit is necessarily a bad idea. That's ultimately a policy preference. Rather, I'm amazed at how the leaders of Brexit have just walked away f/ it, despite huge looming costs, dumped it on others,& seem to be paying no political price for that 
Despite the Euroscepticism of the party's leadership, Labour is creeping towards a second referendum  
Read this thread by @PatricKielty if you believe in Brexit. Unless there is guarantee the Irish border remains entirely as is, peace will be lost and there’s a high chance of breaking up the UK. But hey, Brexit means Brexit

Sir John Major says that attacks on May’s leadership are entirely unacceptable. He also backs a second referendum. He is famous for taking us into the ERM from which we crashed out at a cost of billions of pounds. He also famous for his affair with cabinet colleague Edwina Currie 
Thank you @MichelBarnier - your commitment to achieving a fair and balanced #Brexit for all sides is unwavering. You continue to have Ireland’s full support now and in the future.  
Desire for a say on the Brexit deal crosses all boundaries: age, political party, region, and even Remain/Leave.The only hope we have of reconciling our country is by including it in these titanic final steps  
How come every time I read about Boris Johnson and Brexit, he offers no constructive road-map on how to do it? He seems like such a charlatan.  He's either pretending it won't be a mess, serving up imperial nostalgia, or attacking his opponents. But  /1 
Former UK prime minister Sir John Major has called for a second referendum based on 'fact not fantasy' — and also spoke on Theresa May's Brexiter attackers.  
Even the London financial sector doesn't want Brexit. It endangers their ability to do business with the EU27. A lot of banking is set to move to Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin.Johnson, of course, couldn't care less.

One issue with Sunday's referendum in Macedonia - voter rolls. As the 2011 census was aborted, the rolls we have are based on 2002. Has implications on how one calculates 50% turnout. PM Zaev can claim victory even if turnout is under the threshold. 
Outrage. Boris has openly called for cancelling of special Brexit provisions for Northern Ireland. He says Ireland is the ‘tail wagging the dog’ against Brexit. How insulting! The tail? No. We are a SOVEREIGN INDEPENDENT RESPECTED nation wishing to keep our peace, won from you. 
David Miliband and Sir John Major join forces to call for a new Brexit referendum.The former foreign secretary said the “Brexit fantasy” proposed in the 2016 referendum is no longer on offer.MPs must call a #PeoplesVote and let the public #StopBrexit. 
To all filthy cave dwelling unhelpful #Remainers, more & more people are waking up to the truth that any #Brexit deal will be a national disaster. You are my inspiration & strength to carry on. See you in London on 20th October. We deserve a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain 
Today at #UNGA, Deputy Secretary Sullivan met with Irish Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Coveney. The leaders discussed Brexit talks between the UK and the European Union, the importance of supporting Middle East peace efforts and more.  
@LiamFox is an appalling judge-see his belief that this should be the easiest deal in history, when it was as plain as could be that this could not be the case.  Same with his suggestion that there’d be 40 trade deals done by Brexit day.He, this Gov & his ERG types are to blame 
When I see a roster of discredited politicians, who normalised sleaze, lying, spin, selfishness, party-first politics and cones hotlines, lining up to tell us that we need to carry on as normal I get more and more convinced that Brexit is the right option.  
Leave EU can't handle the fact that people have wised up to the #Brexit shitfest & are changing their minds. Now they know the promises are undeliverable & that any deal is going to be a national disaster. They're shit scared of a democratic #PeoplesVote, shit scared of democracy

‘Millions of $ raised from anonymous US donors to support British rightwing thinktanks prominent in the Brexit debate...$5.6m (£4.3m) has been donated since 2008.’  
Former PM Sir John Major & former Foreign Secretary David Miliband are absolutely right - Brexit bears little resemblance to what was promised in 2016 so we need a #PeoplesVote now. End of story. Pls RT @peoplesvote_uk 
Er, No. The Tory government are ‘supposed’ to have been doing the negotiating. The fact that in 2 years, you have achieved the square root of sod all, is the reason for any Brexit ‘intransigence’.Wake up. You’ve screwed it all up!!!!! Now on your bike......... 
Ah lads, stop with the conspiracy theories and work out a #Brexit deal  
Boris' Brexit plan could topple Theresa May. It is time brexiteers used the Tory conference to publicly oppose May & her ridiculous Chequers plan. Don't let May ruin Brexit..  
FYR of Macedonia: If 50% of voters participate in the referendum and if 50%+1 of voters vote with "Yes" tomorrow, then FYR of Macedonia will become Northern Macedonia. Greece will then stop blocking the country from becoming NATO and EU member. #Macedonia #Skopje 
Of course Merkel wants Brexit Britain to fail, when the UK succeeds it is game over for the EU & she knows it because other nations will also quit..  
Boris Johnson can reverse the position he held as Foreign Secretary and his previous support for EU membership. But ordinary people can't have a #PeoplesVote. One rule for the elite, another for the rest of us. #Brexit 
Be honest, wouldn't it be hilarious if #Brexit was stopped in its insane tracks by Strabane/Lifford, Muff and @PatricKielty? 
Because Iain wrote something and said he didn’t want responses and you responded anyway because you obviously think you are somehow more learned than him and others who voted for Brexit. I voted same way as you but I’m sick of the condescending nonsense from people like you 
Hi please find the unroll here: Thread by @PatricKielty: "Dear @BorisJohnson, There is no better Brexit when it comes to the Good Friday Agreement and Northern Ireland. As you st […]" Share this if you think it's interesting.  
The EU is driving Britain towards a no-deal Brexit with its 'intransigence', @LiamFox warns 
My friend who doesn't do politics says:"Now I want another referendum. We'd vote Remain because that would put an end to this stupid mess. We'd stay in the EU & just get on with life like we used to. The EU never did us any harm but #Brexit has without even happening."#r4today

There seems to be a strong correlation between identifying as loosely Anglican and supporting Brexit, according to new research  
My Dad's dad was in Burma in WW2. He came back with a sense that "Folk are folk, the world over". He & my grandma loved traveling in Europe, esp following Leeds United. Last trip he made was to Berlin to see his half-German grandkids, in his mid-90s. He'd be horrified by Brexit.

See @BorisJohnson eviscerated in 20 tweets by @PatricKielty.One of these two men is a comedian...He's the one more politically astute than the #MemberOfParliament he is #schooling on NI politics, #Brexit and the #GFA. Well done, sir. I hope he listens.#Brexit #PeoplesVote 
I and my many Businesses are ready to get on with it once we know what it is! If by doom you mean I want people to understand the reality of Brexit. I could talk about what colour lipstick I’m wearing but that won’t change lives.  
Him and his cronies couldn’t care less. Brexit is all about tax avoidance EU laws kicking in so they want out to keep their money. The DUP will be dropped quicker than a hot potato when the time comes. 
Hundreds of independentists to spend the whole night in Plaça Sant Jaume (Barcelona) to prevent tomorrow's homage to Spain's police officers who repressed the Catalans during last year's independence referendum.  
Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter how well @PatricKielty or anyone else explains the issues/potential upset Brexit will create in NI to @BorisJohnson , it won’t sink in and he’ll continue with his blinkered, ignorant proposals and policies anyway. I just hope he never becomes PM! 
One of my biggest discoveries of Brexit is that so many politicians (I think Tory politicians in particular) just don't care at all - they really don't care.  It's actually quite upsetting and rather difficult to process. 
"Bannon and Rees-Mogg: The correlation between Brexit & white supremacy laid bare"The Creator of "Godwin's law" said calling people like Bannon a Nazi is not "Godwin's law", the guy genuinely is a full blown white supremacist Nazi, and Mogg is his mate 
With six months to go before Britain formally leaves the European Union on March 29, 2019, Brexit has never looked more baffling  
The bleeding stumps of Brexit in the unforeseen parts of the British body just keep on hemorrhaging in spite of all efforts to stem the bleeding. Tragic!  
I have lived all over the world and Boris Johnson is easily the most self serving politician I have witnessed. He is happy to betray his country and his party for self interest. In a non Brexit world he would be ignored. 
I am on the radio tomorrow morning at 10am, RTÉ1, The Business, spouting on about myself and Brexit. Listen on the @RTEplayer, freely available even in Brexitland. There might be sheep. And Jean gets a mention. 
Strange definition of "full house" that shows huge gaps in the seating. While I get that Brexit is important, perhaps you ought to have shown up at your CLP to address your local party members who are a bit miffed at your constant undermining of the Party? 
‘Just maybe Sir Keir Starmer QC will show the courage of a conviction & do something, pro-actively, to stop Brexit.’ My ⁦@TheNewEuropean⁩ column 
A man who lied to the electorate, cheated on his wife and stabbed his boss in the back has a plan for brexit..... fuck off Boris 
If you still don't understand Brexit + Northern Ireland, read @PatricKielty's twitter feed tonight. 
"Switzerland is effectively in the single market. You know that it is Boris... you KNOW that it is..."@Peston literally laughs in @BorisJohnson's face at all the holes in his dappy Brexit plan   
Yes we need Jacob Rees Mogg - Boris Johnson and the Tax dodging toffs to tell us we need to Brexit a.s.a.p before their offshore tax loopholes are closed by EU  
May is a Remainer. Chequers is a Remainer plan. It is time to hand over to someone who believes in Brexit and is prepared to deliver what we voted for.   
If brexit happens, it will go tits up. The leave voters will bay for blood. I suggest we crowd fund poster sites with nutters/liars like this country destroyer, listed on there. Handy guide of those to blame  
Major on ERG & #PeoplesVote“Its a curious proposition to say it is undemocratic to ask the people what their views are.. The position has changed since we had the referendum. People voted on what they were told at the time.. but the case that was made for Brexit was a fantasy.”  
Now we need an uprising of Deep Unhelpfulness, to cause a deeply unhelpful People’s Vote putting an end to this deeply unhelpful Brexit!  
John Curtice:"neither side in the #Brexit debate has secured any ‘momentum’ so far as the balance of public opinion is concerned – and any claims to the contrary made by protagonists on either side .. should be regarded with considerable scepticism" 
Excl: Dominic Raab accuses EU chiefs of magnifying Irish border “for political ends” and plotting to break up the UK to punish Brexit; 
Jacob Rees-Mogg says most people in the uk will be able to offset any adverse negative brexit effects with their savings, shares, bonds, inheritance and work expenses.  
14. The poll will be much closer thanks to your Brexit folly and could easily be lost by Unionists, breaking up the UK. 
13. When that poll is eventually held the Nationalists who were once content being part of a Northern Ireland within the UK and EU will vote to leave the UK to feel as Irish and European as they did before Brexit. 
12. Barely mentioned before Brexit, a border poll is now inevitable thanks to your monumental ignorance. 
11. Your Brexit lies have opened a Pandora’s box for Northern Ireland. It's one reason why the majority of people in NI voted to remain in the EU (almost as if they knew more about the fragile equilibrium of their politics than you) 
8. Thanks to your glorious Brexit vision Northern Ireland will become more divided as some form of economic border checks will become part of daily lives. 
7. Implementing the Good Friday Agreement was torturous (think Brexit with actual bombs, not metaphorical suicide vests) but we finally made peace. Yet 20 years later NI remains a divided society. 
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is leading moves in the EU to stop Britain being “seen to  succeed” from Brexit:  
Apparently Boris can change his mind about the backstop but the British people shouldn’t be able to change their mind about Brexit in another referendum. 
#CommonPeople being kept off number one by Robson & Jerome is a more savage indictment of the British people than Brexit. 
There is probably more people now that want a #brexit referendum than before the #brexit referendum. Think about it. 
Guess who has been pumping millions into the right wing think tanks that BoJo and the other Brexit clowns are using to draw up their #Brexit plans to make us Trump's lap dog? #StopBrexit

We have been thrown out of the plane, and now the Tories are promising to knit us all parachutes on the way down.Except they don't have enough wool, only have one needle each, refuse to share, and don't know how to knit.That is the state we're in with Brexit. 
That strategy of attracting Kippers seems to be working @jeremycorbyn.How about this for an idea instead? Do a job that’s true to the values of the Labour Party and fight against Brexit and the poverty it’ll cause.You never know, you may just win more than you lose.  
This shows a total failure to understand how the rest of the EU have approached Brexit from the outset. No-one is interested in humiliating the UK. That’s a Brexiteer myth. They want to preserve the integrity of the single mkt which is why they won’t accept Chequers cherrypicking  
#Brexit is a symptom of a wider malaise infesting UK politics, of 'simple solutions to complex problems' populism,  xenophobic identity politics, & English exceptionalism / nationalism.To beat this, thinking & discussing across party lines must become something more tangible.  
Was with a group of friends today in London and what's fun is, in the midst of Boris Johnson and Brexit, having Brits look at me and ask what the hell is happening in America. 
Did you know Brexit will cause absolute misery in the UK Caribbean Isle of Anguilla? Totally dependent on French St Martin & Dutch St Maarten it’s EU neighbours, for food, jobs, transport medical supplies & tourism. They will need a hard border!!!! Shameful ... 2say the least 
I've got shit from the far-right and some Corbyn supporters for this. I stand by my view though. Dealing with the mess of Brexit is more important than Labour exploiting it to try to grab power. That wouldn't solve Brexit but prolong the chaos  
Brexit negotiation has been weakly conducted on the basis that the Treasury and the Government have never really accepted that we are going to leave the EU. They are trying to negotiate a deal where you don’t really leave because they are so scared of leaving. Weak @Conservatives

Today marks #safeabortionday In the U.K. right now safe abortion is unavailable for some women. Women who live in Northern Ireland are denied access to this human right. The DUP want post Brexit NI to be exactly like the rest of the U.K.- so legislate for #freesafelegal now.

The appointment of Gisela Stuart to Wilton Park is proof HMG intends the Foreign Office to play an diminished role post Brexit. It is a growing sign of British isolationism in Foreign Affairs. Brexit has already made the UK a laughing stock around the world. This confirms it.

John Major: “the case made for brexit was - a fantasy”. Yes. It was. Thank you for your support. @JohnMajor. #PeoplesVote 
Today I founded the DUP - the Deeply Unhelpful Party, to fight Brexit with a people’s vote. The deeply helpful co-founder is @campbellclaret, whose deep antipathy to right-wing Tories & Brexiters & appeasers of Brexit is deeply legendary  
John Major speaking sense today. “What was promised by the Brexit campaign in 2016 was nothing but fantasy”.. 
John Major in South Shields.  He supports a second vote, says position has changed since Referendum and people voted based on what told at time.  Case made for Brexit “was a fantasy”. 
As @BorisJohnson says tonight, if we get the wrong Brexit deal for Britain it will be very hard to unpick later. We must get it right the first time.  
I’ve spent day being deeply unhelpful in Belfast & Derry, hearing deeply alarming stories about the impact of Brexit in jeopardising trade & maybe peace in Ireland, & gathering support for a deeply necessary people’s vote which will be deeply lethal to your deeply damaging Brexit  
If Britain is so wealthy and well situated that a no deal Brexit wouldn’t plunge us into recession, why are head teachers marching in protest at cuts, why is the NHS on its knees, why is crime rising and why are our cities struggling to manage homelessness? Asking for a nation. 
John Major say he believes many people in places like South Shields backed Brexit in 2016, because their quality of life hadn’t improved since the financial crash. Said people wanted to kick the elites. 
As an elected Member of Parliament @NickyMorgan01 is accountable to her constituents as their representative. If they decide they want a UKIP Brexit they can vote UKIP.  Her opponents should stand against her: NOT be allowed to cheat by infiltrating the Conservative Party.  
I’ve just returned from collecting Rocky’s insulin from the vets. The receptionists looked quite blank when I asked about stockpiling, then one said ‘scaremongering’.PEOPLE DON’T REALISE WHAT BREXIT MEANS - out of the EBA, EMA, Euratom ... We’re in serious trouble. 
And why wouldn't they Carole? After all, the former chairman and President of their 'parent' company, SCL, was no other than Sir Geoffrey Pattie, the former Tory minister and Defence lobbyist. Some might say the Government's refusal to investigate all this is because...well.... 
John Major tells South Shields Lecture that the case made for Brexit in 2016 was a fantasy case. The promises placed in front of voters then won’t be in whatever Brexit deal is done. Says he can’t see an intellectual argument against a second referendum. 
Boris Johnson's "Brexit plan" is a Daily Telegraph column. It's as rooted in reality as a penguin on mushrooms riding a psychedelic unicorn in the 340 at Aintree. It's as likely to happen as my upcoming marriage to Jim Davidson. He knows that.

Shaun Bailey Wins Conservative Nomination For London Mayoral Election  He backed Brexit, backs lower immigration into this country and backs tougher measures to combats London’s violent crime epidemic. That’s good enough for me! 
On his prime time BBC interview, Boris Johnson goes unchallenged as he says "the Irish issue gained in salience ... not quite deservedly." Repeat after me. Peace in Ireland is more important than this buffoon's hard Brexit ideology. 
I have assessed Boris Johnson's Brexit plan and decided it's workable if we revive the East India Company, blanket Ireland with potato blight and send opium to the heathen Chinee, as long as Rees-Mogg throws in a couple of legions. Onward and upward. 
As always @borisjohnson refuses to take responsibility for Brexit mess despite being in Cabinet himself for 2 years. Serial liars are of course bullies at heart, who never accept responsibility themselves. Certainly very unfit to be PM - ever!#newsnight #skypapers

The people who tell you that a no-deal #Brexit is nothing to fear are the same people who told you that the EU would fall over itself to give the UK everything it asked for.They were lying to you then. They’re lying to you now. 
.@andreajenkyns: "Every day I speak to people who tell me that they are frustrated with the Brexit process and this disappoints me after I saw the enthusiasm that so many people had during the referendum."  
I used to vote Tory, never again thanks to this corrupt government. I voted Labour last election tactically to try to stop the government getting power and hoping for a hung parliament. I did this to try and stop Brexit, not because I supported it. So cross me off that 80% stat 
We've debated Brexit for almost 3 years and you still haven't learned that the UK, despite being 1 of 28 EU countries, has roughly 1 out of 10 members of the EU Parliament. And leaving the EU but staying in the Single Market means you go from rule-maker to rule-taker.Seriously?

One great thing about Brexit (possibly the only one) is that ordinary people like me have doing alot of reading in the past couple of years, and we know when we’re being deceived by disgraceful people. 
Boris Johnson tells @Peston he's unsure whether Theresa May's Brexit plan is worse than staying in the European Union. More from our interview:  
Liam Fox confirms that EU membership is no bar to trading with non-EU countries (and indeed facilitates it). But Brexit will reduce trade with EU and all those countries EU has FTAs and other trade agreements with.  
The 1975 referendum was fully implemented for 40 plus years. People were told it was a common market trade deal , nothing about the Euro, EU army, flag , political integration. So how about we leave and see how goes ?

So glad @SamuelMarcLowe wrote this excellent piece. Johnson's just going round same old loop of ideas which - as the government of which he was a leading member for 2 years found - simply don't work. Johnson can campaign - for Brexit, to be PM - but he's not competent to govern.

Wasn't it @campbellclaret who said Labour would be 20% ahead if they supported a second referendum? And wasn't it Campbell who spent the last 3 years telling everyone Corbyn was useless? And wasn't it Campbell who confidently predicted Labour would be wiped out in the 2017 GE?  
My take on Boris's Brexit "plan" for the Guardian.  
Newly elected Plaid Cymru leader says he'll use 'EVERY MEANS POSSIBLE' to stop Brexit 
You want a People’s vote on a referendum that hasn’t been implemented in two years. Why not a People’s vote on you as an MP. Democracy cuts both ways and I think people should re join the @Conservatives party to make it Conservative again!

My article @Telegraph about how "Boris eloquently lays out the frustrations which many Brexiteers have felt for the last two years most notably that there is a clear lack of leadership when it comes to delivering a positive vision for Brexit. 
Isn't this the same Angela Merkel that Davis said would acquiesce to the needs of the German car and kitchen appliance industries when he was selling the Brexit con to the terminally gullible?  
Thanks for the clarification, Anna. But I’d rather you were claiming expenses for poppies than betraying your constituents & your country (and your manifesto) on Brexit.  
I started my business with a desk and two telephones from nothing. Everything I own I earned through hard work and dedication. I believe in Brexit and I believe in Britain !  
I woke up feeling so nauseous about yesterday. While I empathize greatly with survivors, I don't know that trauma and so I can't point to that for my feeling. What I can point to is a loneliness I feel among other men who refuse seeing yesterday as a referendum on our very souls. 
It comes down to identity.If you were born after 1974 then for your entire adult life, you've been a British AND EU Citizen. That is the EXACT demographic that voted Remain. Brexit is identity theft.(Yes, I know: 25% of 18-24-year-olds voted Leave and 40% of 65+s voted Remain.) 
My daughter (9) wrote arguments for and against a second referendum at school today.One of her arguments against: It would create too much work for journalists... 
Maybe this is why the Brexit debate has been so fierce and personal. Because it wasn't just a vote against Europe. It was a vote against each other. That wasn't the intention. But it is certainly the effect.

It is fear that the voters may reject Brexit – a fear of democracy – that drives the Brexiteers to claim democracy as their ally.  
Sunny South Shields on a Friday afternoon. Looking forward to tonight’s conversation with Sir John Major on “Britain, Europe and the Future of Politics”.  Brexit is so serious that on this issue the country needs people to think and discuss across party lines.

It is hard not to sometimes despair at the state of political debate in the UK, particularly about Brexit. What I'm certain about, we can do a lot better, and if we're going to have our own trade policy, we'll need to do a lot better than this.  
For UKIP to be sliding in the opinion polls at a time when Brexit is in the news everyday and the party should be thriving should be very disappointing to all involved. Obviously something isn’t quite appealing to the voters 
The Kavanaugh vote will be understood by the public as a referendum on whether men should be able to sexually assault and get away with it. And there are people on both sides of that question who are deeply invested in it. 
MPs like Guto Bebb are meant to represent their constituents but he’s too busy trying to thwart Brexit. That’s why we’re now running this ad in his constituency. Time to Make the Conservatives Conservative Again!Support us at  
“I want a second referendum because I voted leave and it’s not a ‘oops, look what I done’ – it’s a ‘oops, someone lied to me’.”  
With the Conservative Party in disarray, influential Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg informs the 1922 Committee that the key to Brexit is "highly-likely" to be found in Theresa May's stomach. Whitehall, 2018.

US offer UK inferior open skies deal post #Brexit as talks break down.I thought the UK would be in a stronger negotiating position and be better off by leaving. At least that's what the #Brexiters promised. 
New videos from the day of the referendum have been released during the last days. As of today, only 24 police officers are being investigated, despite hundreds of videos showing their brutality against pacific people.  
The #LibDems are the only party taking on the power and privilege of the #Brexit elite with their country mansions, gold bullion investments, inflated expense accounts and offshore wealth. Join us today:  
"Research knows no boundaries; science no borders. Brexit threatens this, and that point cannot be emphasised enough."  
Before the Good Friday agreement was even negotiated there wasn’t a referendum based on the promises of DUP snd Sinn Féin. No, it was negotiated and everyone in NI was sent a copy before a vote. Informed consent. Why isn’t Brexit handled this way? 
I've just read all 4500 words of @BorisJohnson's Brexit proposals. I agree with virtually every word. It's a calm, sensible approach to the situation we find ourselves in. And it's achievable. Please don't reply to this tweet unless you've read it.  
Once upon a time @Anna_Soubry claimed to believe in democracy She said she accepted the #EUref result and we should just get on with #Brexit She told us all 2nd referendum would be undemocratic #LosersVote Be a shame if she forgot about this 
27 months after referendum; 6 months before departure date; 2 days before Tory conference; and Boris finally produces his Brexit plan. Hmm. 
This tweet has attracted quite a lot of interest, so I've written today's post on my Brexit Blog on the dangers of Brexit Britain's wartime fixation. Just up:

Over 200 Youths from various counties have this afternoon visited the @Thirdwaykenya  HQs to endorse the #PunguzaMizigo referendum and to sign for the #AmendVATAct2013 petition .Punda amechoka 
But there isn't another referendum tomorrow - and with a campaign starting position of 48, leave would win by a landslide.  
Polling expert John Curtice says not all that many Leave voters would back Remain: “The outcome of any second ballot would most likely be close — just, of course, as the first one was.”Despite two years of attrition of Project Fear bollocks – we still want Brexit. #GetOnWithIt 
I'm glad people are sharing this story about the scandal of European parliament expenses, but I don't think it's a Brexit issue.Some of the EU's most thoughtful critics work inside its institutions: they want to change the EU not quit it.  
This is a real Boris Bike. If I wait here long enough am guessing I will meet Boris. Let’s see if he’ll answer questions about his big plan for Brexit  
As with xenophobia, this is about status. In the UK EU Freedom of Movement gives EU27 nationals almost equal status to UK natives. That is resented by a certain proportion of the population for whom the 'hostile environment' is the preferred model. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE 
Ever get the impression that the DUP are just wreckers? They were strong advocates of Brexit but are opposed to any possible flavour of Brexit anyone can devise. The reality is that Brexit for them is a just a way to destroy the GFA and they dont care how much damage they do.  
TL;DR: Brexit will eat its parents. So Labour should think very carefully before filing adoption papers. 9/9 
It's better for Boris but it buggers up BritainThe UK should #DemandBetter than being a pawn in a Tory power struggle & being sold illusory 'deals' on #Brexit We need a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay #Referendum leading to an #ExitFromBrexit 
Can we replace The Bank of England with a machine? They are the biggest danger facing the UK economy, not Brexit. @notayesmansecon 
I will feel sorry for Brexit voters when they suffer the economic consequences of Leaving the EU - but most of my sympathy will be for normal people 
Allowing the EU to make the running in Brexit negotiations, as well as commitment to Remain by political & civil service elites, shows the government’s lack of confidence following decades of subservience to the EU dictatorship.  
.@SPIEGELONLINE reports that leading CDU/CSU MPs are criticising the EU's hard line against the UK in Brexit negotiations. Quotes @n_roettgen, head of Foreign Affairs Committee: "You cannot lead #Brexit negotiations by continuously repeating EU dogmas." 
#Brexit is an insult to reason, logic and common sense. It openly mocks and cheapen our values. It both alienates and divides us as nation. By rejecting and blaming our friends we are becoming more and more vulnerable. 
Extract from Boris' proposal. Dead simple, and is Brexit.  
Tory divisions got us into the mess of #BrexitTory divisions mean we are heading for #nodealDifficult to think of another situation where Party was placed before Country in such disastrous way.#DemandBetter #PeoplesVote #ExitFromBrexit via @bpolitics 
You’ve no right to accuse other people of being anti-democratic. Along with 17.4m Brits, I voted in a referendum that your government promised to implement & assured us it was a once in a generation opportunity. Yet here you are trying to keep us bound by EU laws & trade policy. 
I always said it was the most disturbing aspect of the EU referendum. To legitimise the idea that fundamental rights could be taken away by referendum. Regardless of the fact that they remain overall protected by the ECHR, it is the precedent to be dangerous. 
I’m French and in the UK for 26 years. My children are British. All I want is the country to strive and prosper. If there was any sign that #Brexit was indeed good for the economy I would be the first to be in favour of it. However.... it is not.

What percentage of the country ever wanted a referendum in the first place?  Since when do we have to have a majority in favour of a vote in order to get a vote? Denying us a vote now is anti-democratic.#PeoplesVote #FinalSay 
Nicola, whether you like it or not, #Brexit is the biggest issue of the day, and would demand the full attention of any responsible Government. If you weren't too busy taking a wrecking approach to negotiations to make political capital, i'm sure you'd agree.

Hilarious fact. We know we get 30% of our food from the EU, and the challenges this may present come Brexit.Well that's an average. When our crops are harvested, we're much more self-sufficient. Other times of the year up to 70% comes from EU. Say late March/ early April. Hoorah!

Yes I voted in that 1975 referendum to join a trading block of only about 8 nations.I certainly did not vote for a political experiment run by unelected ideological bureaucrats pushing for a United States of Europe comprising of 27 nations of very different economies and cultures

.@BorisJohnson had ample time as Foreign Sec. to negotiate his Brexit fantasy. Now, with just 6 mths to go before the UK falls out of the EU, the Tories continue to kick Brexit around as a political football. This is insulting to millions of people and businesses.#StopBrexit

A desperate remainder he tried to coerce people into voting remain by instilling fear that Brexit would be a disaster & they wouldn’t be able to stop it once voted for. With a typically short political “memory” he has now forgotten all that & is desperate to overturn democracy.  
Just imagine the referendum had been between staying in the EU and no deal. Just imagine that the Government had produced its 'no deal' papers before the vote to explain the consequences.Just imagine what the vote result would have been. 
The referendum was in 2016. And the 1975 referendum was fully and completely implemented. Or did you not notice ?  
Very well put. This is a message that I’m hearing more and more. That is why we need the #informedconsent of the people before we proceed or not with #Brexit. Britain needs a #FinalSay #PeoplesVote 
9) whether for ideology or political expediency the Labour Leadership  wants to support a jobs damaging #Brexit and will work with the Tories to get it, rather than listen to the fears of the members. 
8) so what does this tell us? The Labour Leadership is taking a #Brexit position which is directly opposed to its previous one and the members clearly stated position."We want a #PeoplesVote with an option to remain" has become "we will compromise with the Tories on #Brexit" 
The EU is now openly talking about curbing press freedom. As ever, the underlying target of attacks on the mass media is the masses, who the EU believes must be stupid to have been duped into backing Brexit or Europe’s populist parties, writes Mick Hume  
Disorderly vs orderly Brexitperfectly captured by German weekly @DerSPIEGEL 
It would be totally inappropriate for John Major to call for the referendum to be overturned and rerun when he speaks with David Miliband tonight - not least because of what he said before the referendum…  
I came to France knowing no one, no work experience, spent years getting it before producing and presenting TV here. Impossible without free movementWon't happen for young GB's if only already highly qualified can apply abroadBrexit closes so many doors 
‘A second ref could really rip us apart as a country,’ he says. ‘But if it becomes a choice between no deal and a referendum, then it’s probably the lesser of the two risks.’ That only applies if remain is on the ballot paper, he adds. 
The Foreign Secretary said yesterday that a People's Vote "would fuel cynicism". That's not what he was saying in July 2016, when he explained that whether to accept the deal is a "huge decision...for the next 75 yrs" and that young people "should have a say" through a referendum  
Michael: "If Brexit is a failure your career will be over"Boris: "Don' worry. I intend to write articles in the Telegraph where I criticise the government and provide over simplified arguments about how it 'should' be done. Then claim it failed because they didn't do it my way." 
"Some people will say it's undemocratic to have a #PeoplesVote. I say it's undemocratic not too."WATCH: @ayeshahazarika is absolutely right. The only way out of the current Brexit mess is through a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. #BBCQT 
The opportunity to remove Theresa May has been and gone, the Tory Brexiteers have no backbone and will always put their career above country and Brexit, they're actually embarrassing. 
Huge honesty & bravery from this woman. Denying us a second referendum is completely anti-democratic.  FIGHT IT with all you've got; it's not just about Brexit; it's about the kind of country we are, ie whether government really respects the people. #PeoplesVote@acgrayling 
Tomorrow marks six months until the Article 50 deadline expires on March 29, 2019. But in reality we’ve probably got little over six weeks before big #Brexit decisions are made.So here are six ways to help campaign for a #PeoplesVote 
For Irish kids (and adults everywhere, especially #Westminster), here’s a super explainer on #Brexit Well played @news2dayRTE 
When you voted Brexit but are #TeamEurope for the #RyderCup 
Bloody Hell..........it's 2018 and we are talking about food shortages and ration books - due to Brexit!  Get Scotland out of this madness and dissolve the union as a matter of urgency!  
For the government to threaten to inflict immense harm on the British people via a no-deal #Brexit in order to gain a deal that would benefit a tiny tax & regulation-hating elite is a grotesque, and I would say, criminal, violation of the norms that govern British politics. 
"The economy of the West Midlands will suffer massive damage as a result of Brexit and shrink by 8% even if there is a comprehensive trade deal."  
Ireland's version of Newsround with one of the simplest and most straightforward explanations of Brexit around. lots of people in Britain could do with watching  
Brexit supporters, we were all lied to. There was no motive of doing good for the NHS or for any other public services.The motivations behind #Brexit are becoming clearer. Who profits from Brexit? Not me. Not you.I want a #PeoplesVote . 
#PunguzaMizigo referendum signature collection currently ongoing  in Thika  
The spectacle of all the Ukippy “Bad Boys of Brexit” falling over each other to congratulate Johnson on his “brilliant” plan is making my breakfast lunge ever upward. 
If “we were feeding ourselves during World War 2” then why did more than 70000 sailors die horrible deaths in the Atlantic convoys getting supplies to us? Ignorance or wilful deception are now the only things that sustain Brexit  
Kids’ TV did a Brexit explainer that’s so simple it’s brilliant 
From today's @FinancialTimes #Brexit #NoDealBrexit 
Boris Johnson absolutely right to set out in detail an alternative plan to Chequers which would respect the referendum mandate of taking back control of our laws, borders, money and trade.  
So basically, Boris Johnson’s grotesquely awful Brexit plan is to leave the EU on the 29th March 2019 and ensure that Britain becomes the only country in the world without a single trade deal and with a hard Border in Ireland - therefore tearing up the Good Friday Agreement.  
The odd thing about the Tories is they are in government but effectively in opposition - Brexit has crowded out all of the usual opportunities to try out policies and ideas. But even worse, they are so consumed by Brexit infighting they have no time or energy to even have ideas  
A positive start to the day - which is unusual when you're discussing #Brexit! Grateful to @Andrew_Adonis for making Northern Ireland a priority - a hard Brexit would be devastating for us & the @allianceparty will continue to work hard to make a #PeoplesVote a reality. 
Prominent Tories rally behind Boris Johnson's 'pivotal' Brexit plan  
I don't get @UKLabour at all. If they just came out strongly as an anti-Brexit like 85% of their membership, they'd probably be trouncing the Tories. I don't think they have any interest in being in government.  
EU quotas have allowed the French to take vast amounts of fish from UK waters, with disastrous consequences for the UK fishing industry.  #Brexit 
As I have mentioned before, recently the EU Council approved the UK negotiating on Brexit issues with EFTA States. The details of this   negotiation have now been released to the public. Here they are. A few comments. 1/x  
PRINCIPLE: Public overwhelmingly trust that @BorisJohnson believes in Brexit - unlike May or Corbyn. Leadership.  
Ireland’s children’s news programme explains Brexit.  
This is such a good explainer. It means many Irish kids are now more informed about Brexit than the British grown-ups negotiating it (Unless of course, those people are perfectly well-informed & Brexit was always just a cynical power grab by people happy to watch the world burn)  
This is so much part of the Brexit problem... if Brexiters can’t be arsed to invest and engage seriously in their own idea, why the hell should we let them muscle us out?It’s our lives they’re pissing about with.  
Theresa May accused of leading Britain into wartime-style Brexit rationing after appointing a ‘Food Minister’  
It would be cheaper for Kenya if Muigai were to resign than for us to hold a referendum. The height of arrogance is to say that 45 million people are supposed to adjust because one man cannot do what he said he could do.You adjust Mr. President. Resign, so we get someone else. 
More British business already leaving because of Brexit: “Brexit Q&A: Insurer CNA Hardy on its move to Luxembourg ” STOP THE HAEMORRHAGE NOW: STOP BREXIT. 
I’m getting bored of this line.If people want to vote on it again, for whatever reason -and a majority now do- then it’s not for Rees-Mogg & others to prevent it.That’s what democracy is. And if the public now want to ditch Brexit too, who’s to say they don’t have that right? 
FACT; WTO is close to collapse, as Trump vetoes the appointment of new judges to settle trade disputes. Trump says he wants to end the WTO. If this continues, Brexit relying on WTO rules will be impossible. The choice is, no deal or remain. 
This is more like it. A real Brexit, not the phony #ChequersPlan. We need a LEAVER leading the UK. 
40 MPs will veto Johnson's harmful 'Super Canada' plan, while 40 other MP will veto Theresa May's plans.This leads us to the scenario of having no chance to get any #Brexit plan through parliament - and that leaves no option except to call a #PeoplesVote

Hammond’s Oct29 budget (brought forward two days to avoid Halloween headlines) is apparently a dud, nothing worthwhile in it. Tories are stagnating while Labour moving at 100mph. A new leader will come after Brexit, but new thinking is needed now.   
What planet?  Her MEPs voted FOR VIKTOR ORBAN AND HIS NEO-FASCIST GOVERNMENT in the European Parliament 2 weeks ago, because she wants his support for Brexit deal. And she says this ...  
"Brexit has become a car crash. People are entitled to decide if we can still proceed with Brexit with or without a deal. Let them now make an informed decision."  
Unbelievable that independence campaigners can look at the damage being wrought by Brexit & conclude that the best response is to put the people of Scotland though a turbo-charged version of the same thing. The irrational nature of the argument is so... well Brexity. #nationalism 
How about Boris Johnson publishing a rival “plan for Brexit” on the eve of Tory conference.  
100 years since the armistice and brexiters like this man (deeply religious), would send your children and his to war. He's too old to fight.The hatred and ignorance that brexit has unearthed must be tackled with words, real democracy and the law.Never again #PeoplesVote 
The thing that still bothers me big is the fact that Tory voters would welcome Corrupt. Cheating Liar’s like Johnson & Mogg without thinking. They have both shown their Brexit plans are based on personal gain & not the county’s best interests. On top of their incompetence. #JC4PM 
Ok let’s put this to the test after last nights #bbcqt debated another #brexit referendum.If another vote was to take place, how would you vote? Would you vote Remain or Leave the EU? Please retweet this for a bigger vote 
I saw somebody tweet that if companies have to make redundancies because of Brexit, people who voted to leave should be the first to go. Many responses were that employee law would prevent that discrimination.Is that the same employee law that Brexiters want to shred?

Children’s TV in Ireland providing a Brexit explainer that effortlessly exposes the basic ignorance underpinning almost every interview conducted with the likes of Rees Mogg, Davis & Johnson. (It’s incredibly simple but, in fairness, probably a bit too complicated for Dorries)  
Just to be clear, the 2008 financial crash was a 2% hit to GDP. #Brexit is looking at least three times worse. Get ready for higher prices, lower wage growth and austerity on speed....or campaign for independence.  
Johnson's attempt to prove the hard Brexiters have a plan of their own has convinced me he doesn't understand basic concepts in the Brexit debate. 
Boris Johnson says his Brexit vision would not lead to a hard Irish border, because any checks would be carried out "away from the crossing".Hmm ... Doesn't that just mean you've moved the hard border ... in the hope that the Irish won't notice?#LeaversAreLoonies 
Brexit means...Britain sticking it up Johnny Foreigner by becoming the only country to ever vote for economic sanctions on itself.Take back control!

Billionaire Richard Branson mocks #Brexiteers for having NO SENSE, as he goes on about a second referendum He is not just disrespecting senior Leavers like Boris. He is also insulting 17.4 million by saying they have no senseTypical, sneering Remoaner 
Dear Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, in the 827 days since the referendum, the govt can only come up with No Deal, or a deal which will most likely be rejected by all. In the 182 days before 29 Mar 19, what makes you think you can come up with a deal that won't be a national disaster? 
Brexit means sovereignty.Brexit means blue passports made in France.Brexit means taking back control.Brexit means slugs voting for salt.  
Super Canada fragile Brexit exit is atrocious 
‘Leave won, we must respect a democratic vote,’ Why? I can’t think of a less democratic vote. The Brexit vote was won by an ill informed referendum, based on lies, cheating, aided by Russia. When a country is looking at emergency measures to survive post Brexit, ask yourself why? 
Boris Johnson says he has a plan for a 'better Brexit' - his actual plan is to become Prime Minister no matter how badly his Hard-Brexit manoeuvres have damaged the country. Johnson's 'better Brexit' is only better for him! #BrexitShambles 
If you cross-bred Dr Doolittle’s Pushmepullyou with a unicorn, then inbred the species until one arrived which was made of two rear ends, you would have successfully created Brexit. A shit machine, whichever way you look at it. 
I agree - Let's just remain ! Brexiters chucking plan after plan into the ring just shows what a mess they are in. This will not work. More plans make agreement less likely, not more likely.. Let's agree to STOP BREXIT.

Remember... Brexit is a positive thing. It's about engaging with the big wide world. How dare people call people who back it bigots or.... oh I give up  
Eh, does Boris think we've collectively forgotten he *was* a minister in the British Government until recently? During his time in a privileged position of power he did infinitely more harm than good.Boris Johnson can get in the bin with his "Plan for a better Brexit".

It will be only weeks ‘cause the trucking companies won’t tolerate their drivers and trucks sitting in queues and will find other markets. Damaging to UK food and industry. Brexit is madness and we can still stop it @peoplesvote_uk 
If Remainers are happy to wait 42 years for another referendum, just as Eurosceptics were made to, I have no problem with that. The losers didn’t get another referendum immediately last time. Why should it be any different this time?  
.@BorisJohnson calls @theresa_may's #Brexit plan "a moral and intellectual humiliation for this country"  
Brexit is much more complicated than Leave voters realised and could “for sure” be stopped, President Macron has said  
 At Lancaster House we were promised a “bold and ambitious” free trade deal. Instead we got Chequers. Bound to an EU rulebook, interpreted by EU judges and unable to sign new trade deals with our allies. There is still time to change course and deliver #Brexit   
Given the clarity of this Irish TV children’s programme on Brexit - thanks @rte - and how it compares with @BorisJohnson ‘s selfserving waffle - is there anyway we can get the leading Brexiteers to watch RTE News2Day so they at last begin to understand what’s going on? 
How on Earth do they think they have a mandate for rationing food? Not mentioned in either the referendum or GE17. Why would they expect that people would get behind the project under the circumstances?

Yes, but the result of the 1975 referendum (to remain in the EEC) was implemented. The result of the 2016 referendum (to leave the EU) has not yet been implemented. So it’s not *quite* the same thing, is it @Baddiel ? 
Macron again accuses us Brits of not understanding what we voted for and thinks we should vote again.He talks about a close relationship between the U.K. and France, WHAT close relationship!The EU need to remember we will not cave in like others have.We will BREXIT.  
Spoke to intelligent researcher from Sheffield uni. She said she thinks it's ''' too late' to stop Brexit. How do we inspire young people to keep fighting to stop Brexidiocy? We Need an Opposition worthy of the name 
Tory Party member quoted  in report: "If this country had a chance and an opportunity it could look after itself. In the second world war we were feeding ourselves”. It really seems perverse that this is now given in all seriousness as the great prize Brexit can deliver.  
I see the referendum campaign to destroy devolution and in full swing... with your taxes already paying for hashtags. 
#Brexit will be the end of 000's of UK businesses, and 100's of 000's of jobs that rely on UK/EU trade.Yet @Conservatives, "party for business", and @UKLabour, "party for workers", both happy to say that "we must respect" a ref result "won" by (proven) cheating.  Why? 
Still think #ProjectFear is fake?"UK appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no-deal Brexit"Yes, HMG has appointed a "Minister for Rationing" in peacetime!We need a #PeoplesVote with #remain as one of the choices to stop this madness 
Boris Johnson’s devastating analysis of how May and the Remain establishment have screwed up Brexit.  His vision for a proper Brexit both inspires and underlines how disastrous it was that he didn’t become PM in 2016.   
Britain needs to take back control - not from the EU, but from Westminster.Our "left behind" regions are the result of decades of neglect by our own government.One thing is sure: a Brexit recession will help no one. It will only feed the Westmonster.  
IT’S  A  BIT  LATE  TO  BE COMING  UP  WITH  ALTERNATIVE  BREXIT  PLANS  
.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg told the @bbcquestiontime audience that Brexit is the “real shake-up” the country needs  
It's because of people like this that we start work at 2am each morning, 7 days a week, and have done since before the Referendum.  Bless you sir, well said.Distinctive #Brexit research & news daily:  
More Brexit fantasy from Boris Johnson. EU-Canada deal took 14 years from the first discussions to implementation. Not a good model for Brexit deal to be done in next couple of months!  
Well it looks like children in Ireland are better informed about the problems of Brexit than the leading Brexiteers in the U.K. governing party - Perhaps @rtenews would consider a special programme aimed at the British Brexit Bunch. Thanks Colette  
Nothing terribly unexpected. Russia is waging a covert propaganda campaign to torpedo a referendum in Macedonia this weekend which could pave the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the EU, diplomats and analysts warned#hybridthreats #disinformation

Some estimates put Jacob Rees-Mogg's net worth at £100 million. His wife is set to inherit £50 million more. Jacob can say whatever guff he likes about sovereignty and stuff that happened in 1632 but he will not be affected by any Brexit outcome. 
My Greek/Swiss wife and I have emigrated to Holland. Happy to assist with the figures. Just spent 2.5 years being made to feel like third class citizens in my own country. Brexit Britain is a nasty place.

Brexit can only realistically end in 2 ways, 1. Remain in the EU or 2. The eventual breakup of the UK. It will just be a matter of when, not if. 
The same Gov. that told us Brexit would have no downside, the NHS was safe in their hands, made policing unsustainable, quietly granted fracking rights & told us there was no magic money tree, but magically found 1billion for the DUP etc, etc...THAT Gov?#IbelievetheHeadteachers 
What BS!! So Corbyn is of the right now I guess? So sick of the undertone to this, which is that those who support Brexit are racist. That is not true and it’s rubbish like this why many of us who voted Remain don’t want to associate with Raminers like that.

The nomination of Judge Kavanaugh has become a referendum on how to address allegations of sexual as  via @americamag 
Temperament problems, credibility problems, partisan rants & defiant refusal to clear his name w/an FBI investigation: Judge Kavanaugh‘s nomination is a referendum on how to address allegations of sexual assault. His nomination should be withdrawn. #IBelieveChristineBlaseyFord 
Sunderland Lab MP had previously written to Home Office asking them to stop settling migrants in the Brexit-leaning, historically working-class community, saying it was leading to “tensions”Lab want open door immigration but not the consequences of it. 
So all of those “project fear” predictions turned out to be accurate after all.2016: Let's give the #NHS £350m per week.2018: There won't be any cash after #Brexit so let's sell the NHS to the Americans.Is this what you voted for?#FinalSayforAll

I tried to find some coherence in what Rod LIddle was driving at in terms of making any kind of constructive statement. What I did find is there is something tragic about watching someone in the public eye drowning in his own verbal diarrhoea. 
A Catholic Jesuit magazine — Kavanaugh attended Jesuit prep school — rescinds endorsement. “In addition to being a fight over policy issues, which it already was, his nomination has also become a referendum on how to address allegations of sexual assault.”  
BBC News - Boris Johnson sets out his 'Super Canada' Brexit plan  
Jacob Rees-Mogg was on #bbcqt peddling his hard Brexit wet dream yet wasn't grilled about how many millions he and his clients & cronies would make from a hard Brexit or no-deal #FlounceOutBtexitI've asked him 16 times - but he rudely ignores me 
“Northern Ireland has so much to offer,” said Secretary of State Karen Bradley during a presentation to high-level Bureau contacts in Washington. The Secretary delivered a general update on #NorthernIreland and answered questions related to Brexit.  
There seems to be great fear in the Tory camp that Corbyn could beat them. But look at their record: a botched Brexit negotiation, failing railways, an NHS crisis, social care falling to bits,rising crime, especially violent crime, a dearth of new houses, & prisons run by inmates 
2016? Having Referendum 41 years after first one is reasonable. EEC, which we joined in 1973, had morphed into something called EU, no longer a Common Market but a Political Union. To have 2nd Referendum before clear result of 2016 Referendum is even implemented is not on. 
The money is peanuts. Equivalent to 5 months growth of German GDP. “Vast sums” myth 
Two years ago, I decided to leave my girlfriend because I felt the free flow of love between us was in some way hampering my freedom to flirt with other girls. Now I've told her I'm leaving, she doesn't seem to care and looks really happy without me. What should I do? #Brexit 
Very foolish talk. 'The best deal we can get' is infinitely worse than the one we already have. Still supporting leave now after all we know shows a staggering lack of judgement. There is only clear path back to stability and that's Remain. 
Latest: A group called “Citizens Against Sports Stadium Subsidies” has filed a referendum that could put @KCCouncil's $135 million Safeco Field spending plan on the ballot early next year. 
This is what you get when you don't challenge Leave's proven illegal activities which procured their marginal result on which the infiltrated Conservatives are attempting to hijack our country - the April fool himself, Rod Liddle ignoring facts - we're being taken for a ride. 
Mandelson says Brexit supporters are extremists who hate foreigners and other countries. Macron calls us liars. Both of them are loathed by their compatriots which seems to prove Mandelson wrong at least. Brexiteers are not called populists for nothing. The people support us. 
90% of Labour Party members would vote Remain in a second referendum.  This may explain why only 37% of the working class support the party. God bless international socialism! 
Brexit: Plan Oaf for oblivion -  this is enough, if any UK government was stupid enough to try it out, to ensure that we would leave the EU without a deal. Perhaps that is Mr Johnson's intention...  #Brexinfo.

I watched QT tonight. The clearest, calmest, most persuasive panellist was the dangerous, disconnected, Brexit extremist Jacob Rees-Mogg.The absolute state of that... bloody hell. 
Perhaps #labour should try opposing #brexit rather than supporting it?  
‘Membership comes with shared benefits that are founded on common rules and are not available to third countries. Support for the EU in the remaining member states has risen since the Brexit vote.’  
Also, I got to spend time with the Consul General of Ireland, Robert O’Driscoll @odriscor. Remarkable to see the similarities between the Irish and Utah economic successes. Talked all things Brexit and social change/peace in Ireland.   
The 1975 referendum had nothing to do w the EU which was formed in 1993 with the maastricht treaty. Neither were we given a referendum on the Lisbon treaty, bc Blair knew it wouldn’t pass.#twistinghistory 
'Brexit means Brexit!'Sure. So... does 'Cheese mean cheese'?'We voted for cheese!'Ok. What sort? Cheddar?'Cheese!'Feta?'Cheese!'Parmesan?'Cheese means cheese!'Yes, but... halloumi?'We want cheese!'Brie?'We voted for cheese!'#CheeseMeansCheese 
“The question isn’t solely about Kavanaugh’s responsibility, nor any longer primarily about his qualifications. In addition to being a fight over policy issues, which it already was, his nomination has also become a referendum on how to address allegations of sexual assault.” 
If Maybot can't get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons then there could be a majority support for a motion of no confidence in her. If she can't manage to get a support of confidence within 14 days of this happening then by law a general election WILL be held.

Boris Johnson to voters: My Brexit plan is better than Theresa May's  
Ah! So, the Tories hurtle towards a hard Brexit so UKIP collapses. Labour hint at Remaining and fall in the poll.Just underlines the fact that UKIP are just Gammon Tories and Nottingham is one of the Gammon pulse points in the UK.The East Midlands ... I despair. 
My take on Kavanaugh: Dems smeared and slimed him and have made the vote a referendum on MeToo, not a Supreme Court nominee. Disgraceful. 
45 million border crossings by vehicles each year. Just imagine the tailbacks when the DUP Tory border is erected!Brexit, a hard border and border checks will wreck havoc on people’s lives.There is one sure way to avoid all this. We need a referendum on Irish Unity. #UnityRef

Never forget that @Jacob_Rees_Mogg  is the same guy who said it will take 50 years to feel the "benefits" of brexit #bbcqt 
"...and the economy grows..."There is no version of #Brexit that is going to result in growth of the economy, Mr Rees-Mogg.None.Your own govt's assessment papers have clearly demonstrated that any form of Brexit will result in damage to the economy.  #bbcqt 
Jacob Rees-Mogg just lied about free movement immigration harming wages, even though the government report last week shows that Brexit has already lowered wages more than immigration has since 2004.#BBCqt 
Couldn’t help it, I watched Question Time. Two things became very clear. 1: No deal Brexit is going to happen! 2: Tories will be in power for a very long time regardless of what they do! Only way for Scotland to escape both is Independence NOW!!! #DissolveTheUnion 
Rees Mogg is spot onIt's the Remainers who are calling for a second referendumWe have had a referendum and a general election (where Leave supporting parties did well)We need to crack on with leaving the EU as soon as possible  
Working class brexiteers who idolise Mogg, he’s not a man of the people, he is laughing at you and taking advantage of your support. Whatever happens to the economy post Brexit he will not be affected. WAKE UP #bbcqt 
Brilliant.. Perfectly put . Extremely brave to speak out like this, especially in the current political climate. #Brexit #bbcqt 
Rees - Mogg  said with ‘authority’ only a few want to have a referendum. He obviously doesn’t get out much. Perhaps we should invite him to the #PeoplesVoteMarch #20 October. 
WATCH | "None of the people who want a second referendum voted to Leave!"Rod Liddle sums up the current political situation perfectly, hitting out at those calling for another referendum and blasting our Remain prime minister and "staggeringly useless" politicians. #BBCQT 
Like I am going to #BoycottTheGuardian the newspaper that helped break the Panama Papers, published Snowden's NSA intelligence leaks, has been like a dog with a bone on the malfeasance in the Brexit, Leave campaign. This is not a fish anyone on the left needs to fry. 
Make no mistake about Jacob Rees-Mogg: his dad co-authored a book on how to profit from economic crashes, and that is why Jacob & so many Tories are licking their lips at the vulture capitalist's wet dream that Brexit will bring #bbcqt 
Honest woman on #BBCQt - I didn't change my mind about voting Brexit because I was wrong, but because I was lied to.

Hilarious! Alleged "Leaver" in #bbcqt audience who now wants a further referendum and thinks we should probably stay! BBC up to their tricks. 
Ayesha Hazarika claims #Brexit is a right-wing cause. Anti-EU campaigners include everyone from Tony Benn, Arthur Scargill, Kate Hoey, Frank Field and Peter Shore to Norman Tebbit, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg. It has NEVER been a left-right issue #bbcqt 
''Brexit at its heart is a project of the right, for the right, by the right'' @ayeshahazrika says the only freedom of movement Jacob Rees-Mogg would support is at Downing Street #bbcqt 
Second referendum: Remain wins 52/48, Leave people call for a third referendum. 2042: We’re still voting and Jeremy Corbyn remains in his job despite losing six consecutive General Elections. Owen Jones calls for Labour to be more radical. #bbcqt 
When your argument for a 2nd referendum is based on saying older Brexit voters have died, you might want to think about how offensive that is #bbcqt 
As Jeremy Corbyn said at #Lab18"Jacob Rees-Mogg has expressed his faith in Brexit Britain by deciding to base his new investment fund in the Eurozone." #bbcqt 
Hope that London media and policy types are watching #BBCQT - there is no sudden national urge to remain. If there was a second referendum leave would win by an even bigger margin than before - all it would achieve would be to save Theresa May's career! #BBCQT

I was thinking today, isn’t it interesting that the stale, pale, male, alt-right leaders of Brexit are struggling with the concepts of informed consent and continuing consent when it comes to the “will of the people”? 
Oh, boy “A better Brexit”!...in no particular order...“A better cancer”,“A better miscarriage”,“A better tumour”,“A better betrayal”,“A better infanticide”,“A better bereavement”,“A better abortion”,“A better fratricide”,“A better racism”,...suggestions? 
Ayesha says it would be "undemocratic not to" hold a second EU referendum. She wouldn't say that about #indyref2 "democracy is not a moment in time". So true. Indyref was won on a false prospectus & it's undemocratic not to let the people have another say #bbcqt

This audience member says there has already been a 'people's vote' on Brexit - two years ago #bbcqt 
Totally agree with Rod Liddle on #bbcqt. There has been NO FAILURE of the idea of Brexit, there has been a failure of political leadership to IMPLEMENT it. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg objects to another referendum.BUT in 2015 we had a general election.So there shouldn't have been another one until 2020.But the tories held another GE in 2017.If we can have repeat GEs, why can we not have another referendum?  #bbcqt

Rod Liddle @bbcquestiontime says Labour’s vote on on the referendum at this week’s conference was a “ pragmatic and cynical decision” by the Labour Party to get votes. He’s dead right 
We've had three public votes:The 2015 election, giving us a Tory government who had pledged to hold a referendum. The 2016 referendum, in which 17.4 million people voted to Leave.The 2017 election, in which the two main parties pledged to honour the referendum.#bbcqt 
Latest piffle from the chief Brexit charlatan. Canada-style FTA interrupts supply chains for UK wide manufacturing & requires a trade border somewhere in these islands. Ditching backstop entails hard border in Ireland, disrupting lives & undermining GFA. But what does he care?

The first stage of Johnson’s Brexit plan is scrapping the backstop and writing the Withdrawal Agreement from scratch. This is nonsense. He knows that. The next, “SuperCanada,” means literally nothing. 4,000 words of complete bluster. 
Why don't the Guardian, the Trade Unions and Labour members who back a second referendum just f**k off and join the Tories... 
Will our elected representatives end up showing the world that Britain would be the only country in the Commonwealth that failed to achieve independence and they were the only representatives who sided with the foreign power rather than the nation they represent?#Brexit  
Not since the darkest days of WW2 has a govt minister been appointed to oversee food supplies. It beggars belief. Brexit is a massive dereliction of duty on the part of every politician and official involved.

For the Irish media and political establishment , Brexit is to be opposed. Not understood.  They have shown no interest in understanding the reasons why the British people voted to leave the EU. 
It seems that Jacob Rees-Mogg and his Hard Brexit lobby group the European Research Group are now running Britain. The Government accepted changes to key trade legislation put forward to them by ERG. We need to #SaveOurCountry from these greedy selfish criminals #bbcqt

Emmanuel Macron tells Bloomberg he'd welcome Britain back into the EU "for sure" if voters change their minds on Brexit

It’s a Brexit lie that the EU are to blame for uncontrolled immigration. Instead, the UK government are to blame for not implementing EU migration rules. David Cameron didn’t say this in the referendum as he would have been blaming himself & his then Home Secretary, Theresa May.  
Dear @theresa_may I watched the interview on BBC London news. I’m afraid Londoners will never be converted to Brexit. It will be the ruin of the UK and you know it. We have offered you an escape route #PeopleVote Take it!! 
I'm being #deeplyunhelpful at a fund raising dinner with @CharlesTannock tomorrow - one of the good guys. And I've unhelpfully got my 81 year old mother to wear a "Bollocks to Brexit" badge, which she loves. 
Can anyone name anything about Brexit that is in the best interests of ordinary working people, our communities and our public services, any Region in which we live, or the United Kingdom as a whole.We can't. 
At last some clarity on Brexit:  
UK business leaders told PM in US visit that #Brexit will cost £ & jobs & still she wastes time on failed Chequers plan. New minister for food distrib is Dad's Army solution from a govt which prefers a kamikaze Brexit to admitting its failure #FBPE 
You have to wonder where @UKLabour would be if only they took a strong anti Brexit pro EU  stance and also clearly supported a public vote on the final deal  including the option to remain @Labour4EU @peoplesvote_uk 
Breakthrough! Michel Barnier: "The EU is Open to A Customs Union"Jeremy Corbyn: "Labour would seek to remain in A Customs Union"Labour says it can sort out Brexit in less than six months!Tories step aside and let's get Corbyn In!#bbcqt  #marr 
Useful meeting today in Brussels with EU chief Brexit negotiator @MichelBarnier.I set out Labour’s Brexit priorities, our six tests for any deal and the need to avoid a ‘no-deal’ outcome, which would be deeply damaging to jobs and living standards in Britain and across the EU. 
Been travelling round Europe for a few weeks. Most, but not all, have been EU countries. All seem to be doing rather well!Brexit is bonkers!Also, all countries visited have been Republics, who survive perfectly well without paying for a parasitic monarchy.Back soon 
Discovered media was rigging our referendum discovered the lies of North sea Oil running out discovered how rich a country Scotland is Discovered Scotland can be independent I am proud to be part of Scotland's  official tartan army the 45%  we won't stop until independence day !  
Jacob Rees Mogg comes from a life of privilege - he doesn't speak for the general public, he just uses them as pawns in his game to further enrich himself and other privileged capitalists...No deal Brexit is being driven by him & will crash the UK for generations! #bbcqt 
So Westminster have appointed a 'Food Supplies Minister' because of the impending no deal Brexit. If you still don't support an independent Scotland, then you really are aff yer heid. Hope you're all stocking up on tinned beans and pot noodles!#indyref2 #DissolveTheUnion 
In my speech at the Conservative Party Conference I’m going to challenge Theresa May to come up with a Brexit Plan that meets my six tests:1. I2. Get3. To4. Become5. Prime6. Minister 
Amber Rudd backs a second referendum over no deal despite previously promising the opposite  
And in Scotland we have a Tory leader that is rarely available for media interviews to be held to account about the day job, but seems to have endless time to tour the country promoting a book. That self-proclaimed clout seems to be used for anything aside from tackling Brexit. 
12.5 million eligable voters did did not vote in 2016 as many did not really feel aware of the issues. Many of these now realise brexit will be a nightmare and are #remainernow.These  Liverpool cabbies are no different!Let's give them a #PeoplesVote 
I must begrudgingly acknowledge one unexpected benefit of Brexit. It's revealed how unbelievably stupid some of our MPs are...not only stupid, but so comfortable in their own stupidity that they can't be bothered to research the facts. Exhibit A. Nadine Dorries  
If you believed this you wouldn’t be supporting Viktor Orban, undermining the very rights we are seeking to secure, in order to get his anti-Semitic vote for your Brexit deal  
“I don’t think a no-deal Brexit is to be feared,” said Mr Rees-Mogg as he paid a child a ha’penny for cleaning his chimney.“However, preparations must be made, and a good domestic staff is, I believe, the key to thriving on post-Brexit Britain." 
To one millionaire anti-Brexit obsessive, scores of working class people being victimised and sacked for their political views is "the best news I've heard in ages". It's people like him that are the problem with this country, not workers voting to give the system a kick.  
The majority of voters never voted for it in the 1st place...a clear majority now want to Stop #Brexit & Remain...it simply the minority of #Brexiters in Govt & #Lexiters in Opposition who are standing in the way of a Democratic #PeoplesVote with a #Remain option.#FinalSayForAll 
New referendum: Do you want to remain on- Norway model (see footnote + appendix)- Canada model (see footnote + appendix)How can you have a referendum on a multi-option set of complexities? It'll have to be like an encyclopaedia rather than a ballot paper @MrTopple #Brexit  
The best bit is... it's the Tories and the Brexit mess that will probably deliver Scottish independence. I voted remain in the Scottish referendum AND I voted remain in EU referendum BUT why should we go down with  ship determined to sink itself? 
How Brexit and the second referendum might play in the Labour heartlands... I speak to Welsh activists via @LMDiplo 
Under EU law, after 3 months, EU migrants must be working or they can be returned to their home country. The UK doesn’t do this, nor does it register migrants as they arrive.You voted for Brexit because of uncontrolled immigration? Don't blame the EU, blame the UK Government.  
Spoke to a Dutch business event today. In addition to blanket view that Brexit was bad for UK and EU interesting view re UK/Russia. Why have we not thrown out Ambassador, intel head, oligarchs and their kids at Eton Harrow etc? Good question @Jeremy_Hunt 
I am stoped the first time from a #ukbordercontrol at #Dover and got asked rediculous question to make sure that I know that #EUCitizens are no longer welcome in #Brexit #UK. Thank you! And I thought I'm at home here. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg's hard-Brexit faction of Tory MPs,the European Research Group has been censured for using taxpayers’ money to carry out party political activity. This is in flagrant breach of rules. MPs have been funnelling their expenses into the group! #Dodgy #StopBrexit #bbcqt 
‘There’s a high possibility of a 2nd referendum’  
Politicians really do need to get on with Brexit, not delay it or try to re-fight the referendum. Amber Rudd got it right the first time.  
In last two days alone @Scotgov has delivered a pay increase for police, put dignity into disability assessments, shown that we are building affordable houses at faster rate than UK, and more...but always glad to hear from our single issue Brexit PM   
Great to meet up with @JasonJHunter and @EveryCountry in Bath this evening for a talk on Brexit and trade implications #stopbrexit  Keep up the great work guys and best wishes to Gib. 
Sajid you appear to be in one of the stages of mourning for a dead Brexit. Denial. Do you really want the Brexit shambles to be pinned on you? “I helped make Britain a poorer country” is not a winning slogan.  
Dear Labour Party - dear oh dear oh dear Labour Party - really? Behind in the polls behind this godawful bunch of Tories? You have a HUGE problem. It consists in two things: your deliberate fudging avoidance of opposing Brexit, and Corbyn.  
We don't often agree with @BarryGardiner on #Brexit, which is why his #newsnight interviewproves how far we have come."If there is no GE, we move to a #PeoplesVote with all options on the table".We want to go further & faster, but we are moving forward. 
Whilst I fully oppose brexit, and have voted labour last 15 years, I couldn’t vote for Corbyn. He is a communist in sheep’s clothing. We need a viable centralist party opposing brexit. Unfortunately the Lib Dem’s aren’t up to it either. 
The Guardian is completely out of step and may see a similar backlash as the BBC's Today show. Instead of focusing on Tory Brexit shambles (a real story), the Guardian keeps up the attack on JC at every opportunity. Shame on you!  #BoycottTheGuardian #WeAreCorbyn 
Running on a manifesto which said Labour accepted the referendum result and then seeking to overturn that referendum result might be something to do with it Sherlock  
go to the chippy for tea. order my usual. fish an chips. shock horror i found out the fish is from the indiern ocean. i like my fish from the engerlish channel an the engerlish channel only. whole house is in disarray. this isnt the brexit i voted for 
"An “urgent” £9 million order for 112 new ambulances has been placed by health chiefs amid fears none will be available after Brexit, the Evening Standard can reveal."Google translate : NHS orders 112 new ambulances. 
More Remain spin unravels - poll shows that voters are confident that they knew what they were voting for in the referendum by 2:1  
After Brexit, we may decide to do deals with some EU countries for permission to fish in our waters, but one thing is clear. The French must be banned completely.   
Jacob Rees-Mogg's financial investment firm has set up investment funds in Ireland, the EU zone. The hypocrite is driving to push the UK off a cliff while ensuring he is insulated from the effects of a No Deal Brexit! Do not trust this man! #StopBrexit #bbcqt 
EU citizen Femi draws huge crowds to the EU cause. Young people flock to him to hear the truth about the far-right coup known as #Brexit. We are all proud of you here in Brussels.  
UK doesn't want a deal, we are quite happy to leave with a No-Deal=No-Problem WTO Brexit thanks.  
I'll just leave this here. It would be "profoundly undemocratic" to not have a second referendum on the final Brexit deal:  
I remember voting in the EU referendum. When I looked at the options there wasn’t any mention of food shortages, portaloos, or issues getting the medicines people need, and there definitely wasn’t any mention of doing a Boris-shaped shit on the Good Friday Agreement. It’s a con. 
This is absolutely remarkable. Ken Clarke, a former Tory Chancellor, saying that many voted for Brexit because our economic system has left them and their communities behind. He's right.  
Am listening to the @Nigel_Farage show on LBC. He seems pretty sure that if we had a second referendum, the leave vote would be bigger. Then let's do it, so that remoaners finally shut up  
As so many French voters have changed their minds on Macron and Le Penn surely there should be an immediate re run of the French Election?That is the logic Macron is using to promote a 2nd Referendum in the UK 
What? Like Brexit? Like having the most reckless government in Westminster ever trying to bankrupt the country? Like the forced austerity ScotGov has to try to cover rather than spend on services?!May: SNP should focus on issues that matter - BBC News  
Well that’s what I voted for ......................................................EU immigration to Britain ‘could fall by 80 per cent after Brexit’  via @MailOnline 
Poll: With six months to go until #Brexit . Do you think UK will leave the #Eu? Vote and retweet for a big sample 
It’s very clear that the Establishment is determined to try and stop Brexit. The only reason that Remainer May won’t drop Chequers is because it is a remain deal. A Canada deal would be a real Brexit. That’s why they won’t go there.   
UK equities would outperform European shares by four per cent in a crash Brexit scenario, according to researchers at Deutsche Bank..  via @CityAM 
This is not good at all and a sign - as I warned in my latest  column,  that @UKLabour backtracking on #Brexit & support for a 2nd referendum would be suicidal. Keir Starmer’s speech, welcomed by some, very harmful to electoral chances HT @atvar99 cc @jeremycorbyn @seumasmilne 
A free trade deal would be a good basis for a Brexit deal as we can escape EU courts, EU laws, EU fees, open borders just like other non nations that have a trade deal with the EU. Chequers will never be acceptable..  
I applaud this school for teaching kids practical food prep skills. #vegan extremists out of order. And with a no-deal #Brexit, locally sourced rabbit pie could be back on the menu

Trafford Council voted last night to support a People’s Vote on the Final Brexit Deal. Well done to those Councillors who supported the motion & thanks to the activists who made it happen.   
“Useful talks”? You literally said you could support a "sensible" Tory Brexit deal! Let me tell you @jeremycorbyn, no #Brexit deal is sensible. The sensible option is to have a #PeoplesVote, campaign to #ExitFromBrexit so we can #Remain and #StopBrexit! 
"This interrogation of the trauma experienced by a single person feels, as it so often does, like a referendum for all," @Alex_Lily writes. 
'National day of action': Thousands of activists to take part in protest demanding fresh Brexit referendumPeople's Vote group organises 100 nationwide campaign events on eve of Conservative conference#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
BBC News - "Theresa May said the independence issue had been settled by a "clear vote" of the Scottish people"  So was #Brexit. The people of Scotland said REMAIN by an overwhelming vote. 
Apparently Theresa May is telling Nicola Sturgeon to 'get on with the day job'. I wonder who slipped her that tedious soundbite which by the way is totally disrespectful to the First Minister. Get lost Theresa.#brexit #indyref2 
With six months to go until Brexit, @Nigel_Farage asks: Do you think we’ll ever leave? #FarageOnLBC 
Labour conf showed that #Brexit is still a running sore for the party. The majority join @LibDems in understanding  the danger. Leadership continue to play games. We approach Brexit zero hour & need #PeoplesVote now #FBPE 
Tax evader Jacob Rees-Mogg thinks the UK economy will enjoy a post-Brexit boost of £135bn over 5yrs. Big problem: his economist is the discredited Patrick Minford - who is widely regarded as 'laughable' & 'flawed'. Every other model predicts HUGE losses! #BrexitShambles #bbcqt 
Brexit is an opportunity for a genuinely liberal US‑UK free trade deal  
Astonishing @theresa_may doesn’t understand if she actually owned Brexit & showed leadership she would be +10pts a head and cruising. It’s so depressing to have a Remainer PM !  
Some brilliant policy announcements at #Lab18 this week and new rules will mean better representation for #BAME & disabled members.We have made an important step forward on #Brexit. We now need to be unambiguous in our support for a #PeoplesVote

Susan Elan Jones: whether it is Theresa May’s Brexit or Jacob Rees-Mogg’s Brexit, there is a growing and legitimate fear that Brexit will be a disaster for food security and farming. ⁦@NFUtweets⁩ ⁦@susanelanjones⁩ ⁦@FUWpress⁩ 
The Health Service Journal has warned that a no-deal Brexit 'will force up price of generic drugs'Brexit is bad for the NHS and bad for the nation's health. We need a #PeoplesVote to stop this farce. 
I constantly meet business leaders aghast at how weak @CBItweets & @cbicarolyn are in resisting Brexit. After Carolyn Fairbairn’s dismal performance at Labour conference, where she said everything would be fine with Chequers & pro-Europeans should quieten down, I agree 
What irony!! I met some French businessmen today all of whom said they wished they could have a referendum so that they could vote leave 
Meanwhile #Labour leader #Corbyn does his best to achieve #Brexit by 29 March by offering to vote for May's Brexit.#Labour is conning Remainers. 
Doubt many heart surgeons voted Brexit 
.@MichelBarnier please note that Corbyn put party before Country by green lighting the disastrous Tory Brexit so he could then call an election to try to steal power. He has put half this Country through hell by not providing an opposition.  
I mention that I think it was good that someone who's business was suffering because of Brexit ( weak pound , bank reluctant to loan money) laid off his brexit voting workers first , and now whining Brexiters who's idiocy is making us all suffer , start whining , no one to blame 
DPRK will hold first democratic elections soon. Yup, sooner than expected. With or without Kim. You can call it a referendum also.My view: In next 12-18 months.#Koreas 
Brexit is a tiger, and it is coming to eat your children. Those with enough money to live in a tiger-proof habitat are fine with this. Magic Grandpa thinks only he can tame the tiger and train it to look after your children.It would make more sense to kill the tiger. 
"Why don't you call it a 2nd referendum? Why #PeoplesVote?"A 2nd referendum would be a referendum on Brexit that occurred before the end of negotiations. It would be a re-run of 2016 and arguably undemocratic.A People's Vote is an assessment of the outcome of the negotiations.  
Beyond the joy of this win, APC must do some soul-searching. They must ask tough questions.How a mere Dancer forced the party into a Rerun is a referendum on Aregbe's performance.Look at those complaints. Work on them. Osun have handed APC a second chance.#OsunDecides2018

IF The Traitorous Estalishment Tards Ignore Brexit - do you seriously tnink that would be the last of it? Every future democratic vote outcome in the future that did not go 'their' way would be over-turned. Your voice, your vote, your rights, would be - and will be - ignored. QED  
Reminder: PEOPLE DON'T WANT A SECOND REFERENDUM, THEY WANT YOU ALL TO SHUT UP AND BLOODY WELL GET ON WITH IT!  
Why the left should fight for a peoples Brexit and not for a new referendum. My latest for @IndyVoices 
They said that Britain would "divide and conquer" in the Brexit talks, that the EU27's unity would shatter, that other members would soon be flirting with exit.They were wrong. My @TheEconomist column this week is a European take on Brexit: 
Journalists: One way of checking whether a politician has put any thought into what they are saying about post-Brexit options is to ask them whether they would prefer a Canada-style, Mexico-style or Korean-style deal. 
As the government appoints a food supply minister in case of no-deal Brexit, there are concerns about his credentials:

No deal brexit is looking dead and impossible and unsupported. 
Except the British public don’t want BREXIT, it’s a Tory invention and we all know what their right wing agenda is 
Leavers have run out of arguments for Brexit because negotiations have proved the 2016 fantasy impossible.Some have started saying it's too late to change our minds. That's horse manure. We have every right to remain. Just ask the French President.  
"Economists have warned tougher border controls, import tariffs and other barriers to trade in the event of no-deal Brexit would have severe consequences for the economy..."  
Not since World War 2 have we had a food supplies minister.  What an utter fiasco a no-deal Brexit would be. 
The europhobe leaders will secretly love it if #Brexit falls apart...They won't have to face up to the consequences of their actions, and they'll be able to spend eternity doing their favourite activity: blaming the evil foreigners for their revered nation state's own failings. 
Meeting w/@jeremycorbyn and his team today. Continuing to listen to all views on #Brexit and to explain EU positions, which aim for the UK’s orderly withdrawal and to build an ambitious future partnership together. 
In fact I believe a damaging hard Brexit will actually make these problems worse. This is not the Brexit that people voted for, and young people deserve a say on their future. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote! 
We know that our country needs big fundamental change - I'm not arguing for the status quo. But #Brexit won't answer the problems our country faces - rising house prices, increased NHS waiting times and a shortage of school places. 
Over a million young people who are now old enough to vote, did not get an opportunity at the referendum. It's young people who will bear the heaviest burden of #Brexit, whatever the outcome is. #PeoplesVote 
It was brilliant to speak at the rally for a @peoplesvote_uk with @FFSake_ in #Manchester today. Young people and students overwhelming want a #PeoplesVote. #Brexit

Before the 2016 referendum there were leaflets telling us what #Leave means. Before the 2016 referendum many people did their research and gave a good thought on the matter. #Brexit is not an accident. It is not a mistake. It's a choice.#PeoplesVote is a waste of time. 
“We call on Government not to accept a no-deal Brexit that could shrink our veterinary workforce, or risk lowering the animal health and welfare standards of which the UK is so justifiably proud” - we've just published our #nodealBrexit position statement 
WE THE BRITISH PEOPLE VOTED TO LEAVE - NOT 'Leave with a deal' of any description at all on the referendum vote ballot paper. Leave or remain were the only options. SO THE MAJORITY VOTED LEAVE - no 'deal' conditions. The Government pledged to implement that outcome. SO LEAVE, NOW

Tories have broken the rules in multiple recent elections. Quite extensively. Are people calling for a re-run of 2017? Why just Brexit? 
Leave & Remain voters say they understood exactly what the issues were when they voted in the referendum.  
Think of the fun post-Brexit parlour games, though.  
This is a man who said Brexit is happening because we're too thick to see through 'lies', and who requested a higher degree of pressure in the negotiations to cause more uncertainty. He's no friend of Britain BUT has at least helped clarify that we were right to vote to leave.  
#BREAKING Macedonia president calls for voters to boycott referendum on name change, says country being asked to commit 'historical suicide'

Want to know why a #PeoplesVote is gaining ground? It's not just coz Brexit's a shambles. It's coz people are TALKING about it. It's on the media. It's an issue. That's what opposition is: airing a view in order to change opinions ... Which is what Labour failed to do for 2 years 
How much do we know about the #Brexit process and the #WithdrawalAgreement? Read our briefing for an overview of policy areas where Brexit ‘unknowns’ still exist

Today, Mogg offers ridiculous reasons and half-truths to prevent the electorate sorting out the mess politicians created; but before the EU vote he could see the logic in two referendums, what changed? He knows the marginal victory was delivered dishonestly and won't be repeated. 
Labour must not betray leave voters over Brexit - @GiselaStuart 
Honest question- who high up bar Starmer has supported Remain at this Labour conference?From what I can tell you have Corbyn, McDonnell, Thornberry, Gardiner and McCluskey all committing the party to Brexit.Why are Labour Remainers not outraged by this? 
6/ In my view the single most damaging legacy of #Brexit will not be economic, but will be the introduction of the notion of the "Will of the People" into the heart of our political culture. It will have made Britain far more vulnerable to a lurch into tyranny during a crisis. 
No-one voted for Brexit.No-one voted for it because no-one knew what it was (not even the government, as is now proven).It was a black box: a complete unknown quantity.Only now is that box being opened so we can see the horrors inside. Did anyone vote for those? 
This Tory MP was so owned it’s almost worth the price of Brexit by itself 
No shit?!?! Has she missed out on what #Brexit means ?????   
4/ Both May and Javid ground their assault on democracy and the rule of law in the "Will of the People". And in this they are following the fascist script laid down by Goebbels after a Nazi referendum victory in 1933.  
Significant intervention: Theresa May says no deal is better than a bad deal; now Amber Rudd suggests no Brexit is better than no deal. Since HMG has declared all plausible Brexit deals as bad, this is now surely the key Tory dividing line?

Some people do engage seriously with Brexit discussions, but tweets like this - from an MP - make Brexit sound like a cult. A cult with slogans from a budget advertising agency.

Any FTA, no matter how many ‘pluses’, will require some sort of border controls. This means that a 'Canada-plus' deal will leave the Irish border issue unsolved & curtail UK trade with the EU. Blog by Alan Winters & @NTamberi @uk_tpo  #Brexit 
At today's #FMQs i asked @NicolaSturgeon about the newly appointed UK Government Minister for the protection of food supplies. It's time to STOP this #Brexit madness. 
1/ This fascistic rant from Sajid Javid is deeply disturbing. He does not seem to accept, or want to accept, that we still live in a democracy in which Parliament has the right to overturn the government's policies. #PeoplesVote #Brexit

EU membership lets us sell our manufactured goods at reduced tariffs in trade deals, due to us being able to source components from across the EU whilst still complying with WTO rules of origin. After Brexit, we must source 55% of our components from UK to gain the same tariffs.  
The oft-repeated argument that a #PeoplesVote would be too divisive sets a challenge to Remainers. Do we have to send death threats to MPs & threaten mob violence in order to level the political playing-field? Is that how successful politics is to be conducted these days?#Brexit 
Contemplating organising a multi day stage race: "Brexit Ultra"It'd start on the 28th March.Route would take us far away from cities so we can observe the apocalypse from afar.Runners would be required to carry everything needed to start a new life in the wildnerness. 
Brexit is not a catastrophe that needs mitigating and the day the Govt realises it is the day of a new dawn in the negotiations- Brexit Britain is a Brighter Britain! That’s why Britain voted for it! 
In case you missed. ⁦@AmberRuddHR⁩ clear a referendum preferable to no-deal Brexit  
I'd never vote tory, ever, ever, ever, but i find myself agreeing with almost everything Ken Clarke says on #Brexit.... From the #EUWithdrawalBill through to his appearance today on #PoliticsLive, he speaks bloody sense, in contrast to the extreme Rees-Mogg/Dorries/Raab et al. 
Jeremy Corbyn in Brussels to meet EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier.Thank god the Prime Minister in waiting is getting involved. Sensible negotiations. Sensible outcome. 
A serious Opposition leader would try to thrash out formula for Brexit with @theresa_may rather than pointlessly posturing in Brussels with Barnier  the enemy within 
The EU say a no deal Brexit would still involve several minor deals e.g. flights. This is why we should no deal WTO Brexit, we avoid a brexit bill, escape the single market & customs union while minor deals on specific areas stop any problems..  
"They only cite Canada because they are white and speak English and are a nice country, the Canada deal is pretty dreadful"Naughty Ken Clarke calls out the not-so-unconscious racism which underpins a lot of the Tory terminology about #Brexit and immigration

I don’t think anyone doubts Kavanaugh did it.  This is more a referendum on whether white privileged men should be entitled to take whatever they want.  And any voice but their own should be silenced. 
The Govt says a No Deal #Brexit wouldn’t be the worst.  Perhaps not, but it includes stockpiling medicines, 17 mile tailbacks, depriving UK citizens in the EU of their pensions and the UK becoming a dumping ground for banned chemicals. I think most would prefer an #ExitFromBrexit 
Enjoy a croissant with your coffee in the morning ? Maybe some brioche ? Much of it comes from here.-only an hour from Calais .. post brexit and customs union they will become MUCH more expensive ( i just drove past )..

Emmanuel Macron has reaffirmed that he would welcome the UK staying in the EU if voters changed their minds on Brexit  
Emmanuel Macron says Britain could stay in the EU ‘for sure’ if it changes its mind on Brexit  
MUST-WATCH: French President, Emmanuel Macron, says that he would welcome back Britain in the EU.As the Brexit mess unfolds, one thing is clear - it's not too late to change our minds. That's why we're backing a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. Please RT:

You might have a point if Brexit were really going to damage the economy. But in fact older people voted Leave because of the benefits & opportunities Brexit offers their children and grandchildren.

The thing I’m looking forward to the most after Brexit is barbers becoming doctors again 
The Tories fix was reducing the public debt with austerity - but it didn't work on its own terms and in any case Brexit will wipe out their  small gains. As the world is due a recession too, the Tories' complacency is baffling  
The EU has handed a veto to Spain if the Spanish government doesn't like the Brexit deal impact on Gibraltar. Gibraltar is the elephant in the room on Brexit, but as Ken Clarke said recently, "it will make the Irish problem look like a picnic”. 
The woman @NadineDorries chose to lead our country, has appointed a Minister for food supplies.There were never any sunny uplands, there never will be any.Nadine changed her mind about her choice of PM, let us change our minds about #Brexit. 
Seriously though - we HAVE to stop Brexit.We're going to lose our farms. They'll all become insolvent in the time it takes to start exporting again, and we'll be 100% reliant on food imports.Government will have to nationalise farming just to keep the UK alive. 
We now go live to Brexit 
The farming business of Sir James Dyson, the vacuum cleaner magnate who backed Brexit, made a profit for the first time last year... thanks to EU subsidies.  
In case you thought May couldn't get more irritated by Corbyn, he is flying to Brussels to meet with Michel Barnier today to lay out Labour's plans on Brexit and explain the prickly olive branch he has offered to May.

All together now... despite Brexit. (Part 17843)  
Theresa May wants a frictionless border in Ireland but also no freedom of movement for people and no single market. Yet, quite staggeringly, she still stubbornly refuses to acknowledge that her Brexit deal criteria is completely incompatible with each other. 
"Remember the plans for a 25 mile long lorry car park and the power barges in the Irish Sea...?""Yeah, and that we would have to print their blue passports in France...""She has now said, 'let's appoint a minister in charge of food supplies, that'll show them!'..."#Brexit  
No-deal Brexit ‘could lead to NI electricity blackouts’Candlelit uplands.

Given the state of the ongoing Brexit negotiations, it may be worth revisiting Thomas Wolsey’s actions from 500 years ago.  
Friends! I too have written a letter challenging the PM's decision not to reverse Brexit!In my 49,000-page letter sent this morning, I point out the referendum was illegal, as a Leave vote was against Our EU Law!And yet, a full two hours later, I STILL haven't had a reply!

A terrifying omen for farmed animal welfare and an existential threat to human health—just another Brexit ‘dividend’   
‘Articulate the sunny uplands’ of Brexit. On the day we hear we are to have a new minister to try to avoid food shortages.  
Mike Russell has spoken to  the People's Vote campaign he said the Scottish gov will not oppose the second ref on Brexit.He stated we would want a guarantee that Scotland would not again be taken out of the EU if we vote to remain. So far no response from the Brits!

Do you think the Brexit Deal that Mrs May negotiates will resemble the campaign promises of 2016?eg Nothing about a food supplies minister in 2016The people should have a copy of the deal our government actually negotiatesWe should then have a chance to accept or reject it 
Jeremy Corbyn calls for election if MPs vote down May's Brexit deal  
Brexit: UK not rejecting global co-operation, says May

Sajid, I'm afraid this is above your pay-grade. We live in a parliamentary democracy and a #PeoplesVote is more likely to win support than any of your party's various disastrous Brexit plans.We will continue to give hope by campaigning for what is in the national interest.  
So the outcome of #Lab18- Labour might consider a #PeoplesVote but their making no promises- Labour want to transform the economy but are ignoring the reality of Brexit-Labour’s Brexit strategy still appears to be a slightly harder version of ChequersDid I miss anything?

The government has now appointed a minister to oversee food shortages - as the National Farmers Union's warns Brexit could stop exports to the EU for six months. This is not taking back control. This is an act of national self-immolation. 
Sometimes getting your child into a coat in the morning feels as hard asnegotiating Brexit. I tried to explain that the No Coat option ends uphurting everyone and angled for Canada Plus Plus. We ended up with a Chequers fudge where she takes the coat but doesn't wear it.

May’s Brexit plan is proof that if you stand in the middle of the road, you get hit by traffic from both directions. This principle-lite politician cannot answer the big political demands of our time, says @Tom_Slater_ 
Surely at this point we can concede Brexit is going disastrously.Also: appoint as many ministers as you like, you still can’t reshape supply chains in six months, especially with no money.  
I understand how politics works. Like selling snake oil. If you sound confident and keep saying that the snake oil works, some people will believe you. PS the supply disruption is commonly known as “Brexit” - and fortunately can be avoided #peoplesvote 
While Uk government says its appointing a minister for food shortages (Yep!), Brexit hard liners want a PM who will promise then cake, unicorns and ‘sunny uplands’. The anti politics of the mad house

On #27S three years ago, the "Junts per Si" ("Together for Yes") alliance, together with the far-left party CUP, won an absolute majority in #Catalonia's parliament. This victory gave them a clear mandate to form an independent Catalan state, which led to the #1O referendum.

Yet again, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is being intentionally provocative, he's fully aware that Vote Leave's marginal victory was criminally procured and that in 2017, despite @theresa_may asking the electorate for a mandate, she didn't get one, forcing her to turn to the duplicitous DUP.

Utterly unacceptable - an indictment of Toryism, & any Brexit would make it worse! @nytimesworld “Britain is facing a child poverty crisis...the number of children in poverty in Britain has jumped drastically. About a third of British minors will be poor by 2021, forecasts say.” 
FBPE people-"I've voted Labour all my life, but no more because Jeremy Corbyn backs Brexit".Errrm, no you haven't. In the majority of your timelines you slag Labour off for everything they do and say. You're LibDems!FBPE people- mwaaaaa, but Brexit.....God up above  
Oh joy. We’re getting a Food Supplies Minister for when the Food Chain collapses.Brexit’s just SUPER isn’t it?  
May says that it’s Chequers or no dealWe disagree. Given the EU have admitted that technological solutions can solve the NI border, May must move to an FTA+ position like #PlanAPlus We must deliver the Brexit promised in our manifesto#StandUp4Brexit 
@abcpoppins — care to comment about how #Brexit is impacting your farm? #Wiltshire#Devon farmers have highlighted a leak from #DEFRA. Of course it won't be the billionaire Brexiter large-farm owners who will be going bust... 
Brexit's going well then. There'll be someone in charge of preventing food riots. See? All in hand. Can it, Remoaners!  
One of the most impressive features of modern Germany is a constant effort to remember the lessons of history. That is continuing now in the face of a resurgence of far right politics. Britain might have avoided #Brexit had it ever taken a critical look at its imperialist past 
As a negotiating position, threatening a No Deal Brexit while appointing a food supplies minister seems a bit ... weak? Are we printing nostalgic ration cards along with the blue passports?   
"This is about history, not domestic interests."Britain would be welcomed back "for sure" if voters changed their mind on Brexit, France's President Emmanuel Macron says  
The odds on a no deal Brexit outcome are now at 75%.Because of lies, stubbornness and gross negligence from influential Brexiters, media and government, we are sleepwalking towards an economic catastrophe.  
The #Lab2018 clearly showed that LABOUR PARTY under the leadership of @jeremycorbyn has an alternative to Tory economics that looks after the pockets of the wealthiest at the expense of the rest of us ! Also there is an alternative to #Tory #BREXIT#JC4PM 
Sitting in Belfast on a morning when we have been told by the BBC that Brexit could lead to blackouts, with 500 days of political collapse and the border back in play measuring what is 'dramatic' is becoming complicated.  
The near unanimous Brexit motion at #Lab18 didn't resolve to compromise our position towards a Tory Brexit. Nor did Keir Starmer.Labour's position is full participation in the Single Market and application of the 6 tests. No ifs, no buts.Ministers need to tow the line.  
Brexit can and should be stopped  
Brexit is a mess. The government is a mess. Trump is a mess. And along comes @GarethRoberts3 to provide a brilliant twitter feed to get us through this mess. 
A no-deal Brexit could mean $12 billion in food and drink tariffs for Britain, raising supermarket prices, study says

Don't be fooled by the #PeoplesVote. It's a scam. We voted on Brexit and we said No. The British government must be made to understand this.  
Hi @theresa_may, I know you’ve been busy but might want to watch this. @JasonJHunter seems to know more about #Brexit than you do. Maybe give him a call?  
UK could use Brexit to avoid EU ban on antibiotics overuse in farming  
Thanks for the chance to hear Lord Adonis  last night at Shrewsbury College.  I had forgotten what it was like to hear a politician speak clearly/reflect on evidence and facts and make a v strong case for a Peoples Vote on Brexit @peoplesvote_uk @DKShrewsbury @CarolineLucas 
Can we put this seal in charge of Brexit negotiations please?  
,@jeremycorbyn on TV just now - calling for a brexit with "A" customs union, job protection either by Tories or by Labour - he is not calling for Remain. This is a betrayal of vast majority of @uklabour members, supporters and the UK as a whole. 
Accepting a #PeoplesVote is accepting that Scotland's voice does not count in the United Kingdom. We voted. We said NO to Brexit.

UK appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no-deal Brexit  
Still think #ProjectFear is fake ?"UK appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no-deal Brexit"Yup, HMG just basically appointed and minister for rationingWe need a #PeoplesVote with #remain as one of the choices to stop this madness 
We often hear MPs say " we must/we respect the referendum of 2016" Why must we" everybody knows it was based on blatant lies deceit dirty money russian influence illegal data harvesting & law breaking.. since when must we respect that? 
The National Farmers Union has warned that if a no deal Brexit happens there will be a ‘catastrophic’ wait to be approved as an EU food supplier. British farming exports will be stopped for 6 months - disastrous for the whole industry #BrexitShambles #r4today 
Amber Rudd the latest recruit to people’s voteOnly ‘sensible Brexit’ is a dead Brexit! 
I see May has appointed a Food Supplies Minister to try and ensure we don't run out of food due to Brexit.Given the track record of yer typical Brexit minister, I'm continuing to build my stockpile. 
‘Corbyn says he could support a "sensible" Tory Brexit deal. Barry Gardiner tells ITV's Peston the Labour party would "bend its red lines" if the PM did too’: So the Labour leadership plans to ignore the wishes of the vast majority of their members/voters?

Here’s the link for the Enforcement Notice way at the end in the Appendix that was just discovered. It’s for illegal data collection in UK for Brexit. AIQ is weirdest company in Canada that more Americans should know about. They work in our elections too.  
This is a very nice piece...bringing #Brexit and Paddington Bear together  
Why only six months? Food is very political and this could take a long time to fix. Even then tariff rates and non tariff barriers could make exports uneconomic.No-deal Brexit 'would stop British farming exports for six months'

PM Scott Morrison is another dud. He doesn’t even listen to his own Indigenous advisors, who like the reps at Uluru, have unequivocally said take the First Nations Voice to the people! First Nations Voice Referendum!!  
While Jeremy Corbyn was talking about protecting the disabled and vulnerable, Theresa May was telling the world we're becoming a tax haven post Brexit...#priorities 
The PM’s own Indigenous Advisory Council has urged the government to “future proof our place in this nation”- a reference to establishing the ‘Voice’ by referendum in the Constitution. Via @svfitzpatrick 
Funded by the taxpayer under threat of prosecution, look how our "State Broadcaster" sneers at the UK Working Class who dared vote for the freedom of #Brexit.Time to #SellTheBBC, let their arrogance try its luck in an open market. 
Brexit: the realisation dawns - at last the government has recognised that, all things being equal,  exports of products of animal origin will cease if we have a "no deal" Brexit – despite regulatory alignment on day one of Brexit...  #Brexinfo. 
David Lammy tweeting about Windrush and then praising Amber Rudd's Brexit stance within minutes of each other, shows the complete lack of tonal understanding. David, Amber Rudd was behind Windrush. 
It's a shame when a men with high status like you Mr. Joseph, is so poorly informed what is going on in Macedonia. Citizen's movement #Бојкотирам didn't arise without reason. We are boycotting this humiliating referendum. People from the whole political spectrum are involved.  
Emmanuel Macron is taking a tough line on Brexit – and the rest of Europe is with him.  
The PM yesterday lied to Australians just like his predecessor. His claim that an advisory voice TO parliament is a “third chamber” is sheer dishonesty that the gov’s own committee rejects. We need a new government. And we need a referendum: let the people have their say. 
Yet still there are several EU countries doing better than us...  but then Brexit Central cares not for the truth.  
Well frankly Fenella, I think that is your limitation not mine. The government has completely failed in trying to implement the 2016 referendum. Now they can only do so at great cost to the country. We didn't know this in 2016, but we do now. You want to ignore that? 
“Media can build the culture of dialogue or sow divisions, spread disinformation and encourage exclusion. The Brexit debate is the best example of that.”  
#Newsnight #BBCPapers  Here is a clear message from the vulnerable in our society, who have had years of misery - hell under Tory Gov. Now get on board to OUST the #NastyParty please - we can't go on like this! Tory Brexit will make poorer and vulnerable can't take it!  
Tánaiste & Minister for Foreign Affairs @simoncoveney speaking to a packed house @IrelandinNY about today’s Ireland, increasing our global footprint & the challenges of #Brexit.

A second referendum would lead to “a huge backlash against a political class that has lined up to derail the public’s decision to leave,” says Labour MP and former Europe Minister @CarolineFlintMP – against her party's line 
(2/2) It's not because of the SCOTUS case or the pardon issue.It is because he wants this to be a cultural war. That way it isn't a referendum on TrumpRussia. Men who feel vulnerable will overlook a few felonies to keep their culture. 
*Brexit Explained*  
Amber Rudd favours second referendum over no-deal Brexit  
100% - the past two #brexit dominated years have been tough but the UK is an amazing country that makes the EU better & stronger   
.@JasonJHunter was rocking the #bEUret look with @BathforEurope campaigners in #Trowbridge tonight. Many thanks for a fascinating (albeit terrifying) analysis of implications of a No Deal Brexit.  By the way, berets available at  
It was a pleasure having @PaulBlomfieldMP on our #Lab18 fringe event panel yesterday. Unilateral guarantees of lesser #citizensrights for EU citizens in the UK in case of no deal Brexit, though a step in the right direction, are not the solution.  
We need a public inquiry in to brexit when the dust settles. 
Given that May & the Tory Brexit cabal have dragged us to Square Minus Ten, a return to Square One & a #PeoplesVote with a #RemainOption would be a great relief. 
How I’ll celebrate when Brexit finally happens  
"A poll funded by a Brexit-backing multimillionaire has failed to find evidence of widespread support for deselecting Remain-backing Conservative MPs among their constituents." 
French President Emmanuel Macron tells us he'd welcome the UK back into the EU if voters change their minds: "For sure."  
Hard to believe that today's Trump presser won't motivate Americans to get out and vote in midterms. What you just witnessed is a referendum on the entire GOP Party. Are we fine with this? 
Michael Avenatti on prominent Republicans following Trump's lead in attacking his character and trying to make his client's accusations a referendum on him: "It’s laughable and transparent. They see me as a large threat"  
This whole 2nd Referendum on Brexit thing is a real joke. What next after that? A 3rd Referendum? Could keep going on ad infinitum. These clowns in office need to accept the will of the majority of people however screwed up that is, and get on with it. 
.@AmberRuddHR tells  she is among a group of 40 Tory Remain MPs who would vote down a Canada style Brexit deal if proposed in the House of Commons.  
The EU is planning to pass emergency rule changes to cope with a no-deal Brexit in as little as five days  
Good to see @campbellclaret ​and @NadineDorries finally seeing eye to eye on #Brexit   
You may not like it @sajidjavid, but we live in a democracy, not a dictatorship. So your fascist ranting will be mocked, ignored and remembered. #PeoplesVote #Brexit

Alliance increasingly becoming frantic extremists demanding that the democratic will of the British people is rejected & overturned because they believe that people like them- the ‘progressive elite’- know better than the pesky ‘underclass’ who dared vote for Brexit. 
Clearly significant. Brexit is a dud. And the growing realisation of that is making a People’s Vote look more and more like the sensible outcome

BREXIT: THE FINAL FURLONGAs reality lands, there are still people who believe a no deal outcome automatically means Brexit will not happen. This is a dangerous fantasy...A new article from me via ⁦@Byline_Media⁩ 
Sadly, it has been clear in credibly sourced information from Westminster from the outset that May has long planned a no deal outcomeBREXIT: THE FINAL FURLONG: 
A #PeoplesVote is fast becoming the political consensus. Expect more MPs from all parties to express similar sentiments over the coming weeks, as the bleak reality of Brexit becomes impossible to deny.  
I met a No voting Brexit voting racist woman todayWho works at a social enterprise adults with special needsI'm still gobsmacked at her lack of educationAnd her vicious racismPhyllisI shall deal with you when I've calmed down from your racist rant 
I don't want a people's vote or a second referendum. I literally couldn't give a tiny rat's bottom about all that. I want a GE and a Labour government. Nothing else matters. If you don't get that by now I can't help you and I wonder how you manage to dress yourself in the morning 
Even the most Europhile diplomats from EU countries think the idea of planes being grounded after Brexit is “ridiculous”

This is the book written by @quimforn, the Catalan Interior Minister during his 11 months of imprisonment. He led the outstanding response of the Catalan police to the terrorist attacks of August 2017 and the 1-O referendum. Now the Spanish deep state makes him pay the price.  
There is no “good #Brexit deal” .  Short of staying in there are only degrees of bad from where we are now.  
The moron that is Terry Christian is at it again.If this so called conversation ever took placeThe builder who allegedly sacked 34 builders because of lack of work picked the. 34 who had votedfor Brexit he would now be facing 34 tribunals forwrongful dismissal.Stupid man.  
It's 2018And the UK government is appointing a minister for food suppliesIn a country already ravaged by food poverty and heading for utter oblivion under BrexitWas this the future you were promised in 2014 Scotland? 
.@AmberRuddHR has effectively just said she and 40 of her colleagues will vote down a deal that delivers what the electorate voted for. To the remain MPs the options are BINO or a referendum to try one last attempt at ignoring democracy. Shameful. 
The Guardian front page, Thursday 27 September 2018: Get a good Brexit deal or face Labour veto, Corbyn tells May  
Remoaners won’t support a Canada deal simply because they don’t want Brexit to be a success.  
The British government claims a no-deal Brexit could ground flights to Europe  
Anyone who believes the Labour lies about a #peoplesvote with a remain option need go no further than this article. If Corbyn is prepared to do this deal with the Tories, this is what you'll get with Corbyn as PMDramatic offer to May to do Brexit deal  
Awful. Crunch time is bringing out true colours. If Rudd and the like are opposed to a Canada style agreement, there was never any intention to deliver Brexit.  
What got me thinking about this was the absurdity of a govt that has been making such a pig’s ear of Brexit, and zero progress, attacking the opposition for threatening to take us “back to square one”. “That’s the worst possible line of attack”, I thought. Then the penny dropped. 
Appalled by this @AmberRuddHR just another attempt by you & the rest of the Conservative back bench quisling tendency to derail #Brexit You’re not a Democrat, you’re not a Tory, you’re disgusting.  
Amber Rudd tells @itvpeston she 'absolutely' favours a second referendum over a no-deal Brexit scenario and plays down the prospects of a Canada-style deal  
Never forget that Joan Freeman not only voted against the 8th, but voted against the bill to have the referendum in the first place. Shes no Miggledy and she doesnt deserve to represent our forward thinking country. #Aras18 
Trump thinks #Brexit is in the bag -  and Britain’s already a vassal state. The new Puerto Rico.  
on  @AmberRuddHR hits the nail on the head: “I do think it would be ironic indeed if we got a people’s vote because the more Brexit-y people in my party were unable to support the Prime Minister in her negotiated settlement and then they might not even get their Brexit.” 
Took Brexitometer to @AlunCairns’ public meeting this eve.Pretty clear majority of his constituents think Brexit is disaster.60% want #PeoplesVote. V disappointed he is “passionately against [it]”.As one lady said: ppl are changing their minds now we see what #Brexit means.  
Oh so now it’s all bravado against Putin? Yet you remained silent at the fact that Russia was meddling with Brexit. In fact, you and your coworkers have been actively trying to shut the story down. The hypocrisy is unbelievable. 
Dig for victory! Or maybe stop Brexit instead #PeoplesVote 
Compare & contrast the read outs from the Trump/May bilateral meet. Team May effusive about a big US-UK trade deal. White House didn’t even mention. Rather embarrassing #Brexit #May #Trump #UNGA 
Joined @realDonaldTrump today for a bilat w/ @theresa_may at #UNGA to discuss Brexit, global economic growth, and national security.  
Don’t any remainers remember this. £9 million spent by Cameron “This is a once in a lifetime vote” “The government will implement what you decide” Seems clear to me so let’s #Brexit  
Translation:  "One thing I had to repeatedly make clear: the government wants to be FORCED INTO A SECOND REFERENDUM.  Deeply grateful to some UK figures who travel around doing shuttle diplomacy while we keep our hands clean."   
.@BarryGardiner tells me that @jeremycorbyn has shifted his red lines to offer serious Brexit compromise to @theresa_may - that Corbyn’s olive branch to her is real. See  at 10.40 on @itv 
NEW Theresa May and Donald Trump have tonight held talks about a US/UK trade deal after Brexit. A 10 Downing Street spokesman said the pair "agreed that Brexit provides a wonderful opportunity to strike a big and ambitious UK-US Free Trade Agreement". #unga2018 #Brexit 
.@AmberRuddHR tells me she would support People’s Vote to prevent no-deal Brexit. & it is pointless @theresa_may switching from Chequers to Canada-plus deal because she and at least 40 Remainy Tory MPs would vote against such a free trade agreement. See  on @itv at 10.40 
The Brexit duopoly of Labour & the Tories is wrecking the U.K they are speaking different ideologies that translate into the same regressive language . ...We need a #FinalSay referendum to #Remain  
Fucking hell. Sorry for swearing, but this deserves it.Those ideological far right Quitling bastards are not only prepared to stop planes & cancer drugs, but are ready to make us starve for Brexit. They've just appointed a Minister to protect our food supplies. God strewth! 
It really seems like we have lost the plot. People were told to vote for #Brexit so they'd be better off and have great free trade. Now they face losing all free trade, their jobs and food supplies. Does Parliament not think we should check if most ppl want this?!  
Ending Freedom of Movement is a robbery - the robbery of a basic right without precedent in modern British political history. There has been no national or parliamentary debate and no referendum vote, let alone with a supermajority which should be mandatory. #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Quite simply, the best satirical political twitter feed out there right now is the magnificent Raab C. Brexit @BrexitRaab - telling it like it is about the shambles of Brexit. Definitely worth following. 
Government so certain we will get a Brexit deal it appoints a Minister for food supply security just in case we don’t  
Please go to @NHSvBrexit because, the level of public anger, if Brexit destroys the NHS after people were told it would save it...Let's not forget: We are actually talking life and death here.

Brexit has become unnegotiable.⁦@theresa_may⁩ now has a constitutional duty to admit that truth.There is no positive outcome that is acceptable to the EU and to the UK.MPs need to hold a #PeoplesVote and campaign to #Remain. 
Brilliant, must watch: explains how Corbyn has snookered May on #Brexit. He’s put her into a position where she must choose between the country or her party. Either way she gets destroyed politically. Genius. Never play chess with Jeremy!#JC4PM 
Gone is the pretence that #Brexit is going to be anything but a complete disaster - Tory Govt want to employ a food shortage Minister  
Anti-intellectualism was a core element of totalitarian political practice. The reason then is the same now. Those who are willing to question & challenge simplistic emotionally charged propaganda have to be demonised as outsiders, as not belonging to the real people.#Brexit  
I’m sorry but I don’t hate people who voted leave. I hate liars and cheats and thieves who stole data and manipulated people to vote out. The crime is that people lost their jobs because of #Brexit not the way they voted. The criminals are sat with their money offshore 
50.2% of people voted leave in Watford in the 2016 referendum. It’s clear that their opinions have changed. We need a #PeoplesVote on the final deal! 
“We’ll have a Minister for Food Supplies”. Didn’t see that on the side of any bus during the Brexit referendum!  
If anyone on here tells you they voted remain but after what they've learned since the referendum they'd now vote leave, tell them they're full of shit. Then block them. 
Today I spoke to the Bloomberg Global Business Forum at #UNGA⁠ ⁠ about how a post-Brexit Britain will be unequivocally pro-business. 
There’s nothing democratic about Brexit. Zero, zilch, nil, nought, zip, nowt, buggar all. Undemocratic and shite. Goodnight all! 
Opening salvo on what Greece teaches us about Brexit  
A: Didn't happen B: Illegal if it did happen (it didn't)C: Construction was up 3.3% in the last quarter alone. Construction index is substantially higher than before the Brexit vote and the number of cranes in the city centres  speak for themselves.  
6,000 meat processing plants in Britain. All would have to be audited by Defra, then those inspections assessed by EC. Then their verdict would have to go before veterinary standing committee for vote. The joys of Brexit.

I think you are unaware that James stepped down from presenting Newsnight because he felt he couldn't be impartial about (I believe) Brexit. So it's possible to have an opinion *and* principles. 
you bet there will be a second referendum. You don't have the votes for a deal in the Commons 
#Lab18 #JC4PM  Anybody who says Jeremy Corbyn is not a statesman should watch todays conference speech. I am convinced if he was the PM negoitating Brexit, his thoughtful intelligence would win over Europe, and we would get a fair outcome & a good future. 
In the same way we are ‘going over a cliff’ with hard and soft Brexit. All nonsense designed to keep us in the EU by deceit  
The European Commission has come up with a new way to prevent people backing #Brexit – by curbing press freedom. They want to stop the British press encouraging ‘hatred’ of EU leaders and judges, and impose a ‘European approach’ of ‘smart regulation’.  
Finally, one thing I had to repeatedly make clear: THERE WILL BE NO SECOND REFERENDUM. Deeply unhelpful of some UK figures to travel around raising this prospect while so many working hard to land a deal. 
'The vote by the British people to leave the EU is not a rejection of international co-operation' - Theresa May tells the UN General Assembly the UK will continue to work with international allies despite Brexit.Get more on the Theresa May's speech here:  
"Determined to fully realise the opportunities of brexit" I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that if you have to hire a minister for stockpiling your food. Those opportunities disappeared a while ago 
State of Labour 2018.Seething anti-semitism? Not a problem. Contempt for 17.4m Brexit? So what? Support for terrorism ? What of it? Economic incoherence? Big deal.But somone says something hurty about Diane Abbott and..outrage!!!  
If Angela "no crisis in Germany" Merkel falls that's only going to make Napoleon strut about more on Brexit, surely? No deal rising. Meanwhile, the twittish and unpopular Macron is all over the Brits on defence. Life is full of ironies. 
Theresa May is offering the lowest Corporation Tax in the G20, which she will fund by Pension Cuts, Privatise the NHS, Rob Scotland's Oil Revenue.Having spent Scotland's Trillion, and run up 2 Trillion in Debt, she asks"trust me with #brexit."#ScotRef for #ScotlandinEurope 
That was the beauty of the GFA when it was signed: it no longer mattered who was British, Irish, or wanted to be both. All could be what they wanted to be, since we were all in the EU anyway. It would be a shame if Brexit narrowed that wider, more tolerant, more peaceful space. 
A commonly heard sentiment but very naïve. International relations aren't about 'niceness'. There are 3 global economic powers (US, EU, PRC). With Brexit we'll be outside them. So support Brexit if you want, but accept the fact that none of them are going to be "nice" to us.  
As we head towards a critical phase in Brexit talks, @bbcquestiontime could have people on to inform the public, such as experts in:• diplomacy• trade• transport• agriculture • science• healthcare• finance• educationBut no, #bbcqt gives us The Sun’s Rod Liddle. 
No withdrawal agreement can meet Labour's six tests because they're for a trade deal.No Brexit can meet Labour's six tests because of the "exact same benefits" test.Freedom of movement is one of those "exact same benefits". #c4news

The European Commission has come up with a new way to prevent people from backing Brexit – not by winning the argument, but by curbing press freedom, writes Mick Hume.  
Dennis Skinner. What a man.In one fell swoop he nails just how crucial & how beautiful a diverse NHS is. The NHS survives, & in turn *we all* survive due to this incredible diversity. We must protect it.#NHS70 #Brexit #Lab18 #LabourConference2018 
The problem is they're democratic countries, we allow referendum results to stand where there's clear proof of criminal behaviour by the side who had a marginal victory, then an unelected premier with no mandate enters into a deal with a duplicitous party to deliver a catastrophe  
Survey says 1 in 10 firms would risk bankruptcy if goods were delayed by between 10 - 30 minutes at the Irish or UK borders. #Brexit is a huge danger to economy - it must be stopped but not by Labour, apparently #PeoplesVote 
UK appoints food supplies minister amid fears of no-deal BrexitWHAT THE FUCK ARE WE DOING THIS FOR?? 
Never before has an election been overturned because the losers didn’t like the result. Every referendum the UK has held has been fully respected, Scotland/Wales got devolution after voting for it & the 1975 EU referendum was delivered in full. The brexit vote must be respected..  
Kavanaugh’s nomination has become a referendum on the basic principle of innocent until proven guilty. And it’s setting a dangerous precedent on due process. It’s not right, just, or fair. And we need your help to stop it. Act now. #ConfirmKavanaugh→  
BBG::It would be "suicidal" for the EU to give the UK a Brexit deal that seems better than remaining in the bloc, said French Finance Minister:"I'm sorry to say it so callously: There is something more important for us than the future of the UK and that's the future of the EU"

Back to “square one” would be wonderful. To return to before Brexit ref, before all the misinformation, lies,  the cheating, the Law being broken, referrals to the police. Wouldn’t that be wonderful. Sadly though @theresa_may - not even magic money trees can do that for us. 
May now has two options1) #Brexit with CU that is good for the country and solves NI problem; and would get through parliament, but will split Tories2) #Brexit that damages the UK and damages GFA, but keeps Tory party together.Guess we know which option she'll go for !! 
The key Brexit takeaways from their Conference are a) Labour now basically accept Brexit but would 'negotiate it differently' b) 2nd Referendum commitment is secondary and ambivalent. My analysis of (a) here:  and of (b) here:  
Just been out in Manchester early doors drinks , met a guy who employs 120 builders for various projects , just had to lay off 34 because of Brexit and has spicked the 34 from those he knew voted Brexit . That's the best news I've heard in ages. It's only short term pain lads 
'How bad can things get?' Wall Street chief puts Theresa May on Brexit spot  
We discussed this in our Geneva episodes of #3BlokesInAPub We can expect the death of UK agri-food sector in 18-24 months with no WA.   That's 3.5 million households livelihoods in danger.Under every Brexit model that's been run. 
An excellent opening speech this evening from @Davidstewartmsp  in his #membersbusiness debate in @ScotParl on #EURATOM and the crisis in supply of medical isotopes as a result of #Brexit .  More chaos , with disastrous consequences, from Tory @GOVUK 
Labour is a political party that is 86% for remaining in the EU and Corbyn offers to help May do #Brexit Well Labour, that is the next general election you have just lost and lost big.Unbelievable.#PeoplesVote

While Corbyn's desperate, sad Labour party have spent days wallowing in virtue signalling, refusing to call on Brexit and maneuvering for an Election, millions of people have been hard at work to make the money to pay his wages so Corbyn can raise their taxes. Ironic eh? 
Today's pay award to Scotland's police officers is a fitting reward for the difficult and dangerous job they do protecting Scots from undesirable elements in our society. #indyref2 #brexit #DissolveTheUnion 
Corbyn doesn't give a flying shit about stoppng Brexit he just wants to use the UK heading towards the precipice to aide him getting into No 10. 
No mention about immigration control or not wanting Brussels rule from Mr Corbyn's rousing speech to adoring fans today - the reasons most working class voted Brexit. Meanwhile Labour still doesn't realise Britain is paid for by investors who can walk away from the UK any time. 
Hey, @toryboypierce. Can you talk me through how it can be a 'benefit of Brexit' when it was announced before the Referendum vote?  
No disrespect to the chosen line-up, but it would be interesting to have @JasonJHunter on the show. Granted, other topics get covered outside of Brexit - which seems to be Jason's forte - but I know many people would enjoy seeing him engage with the panel and audience. 
We’ve had the vote, we voted OUT -word of the people, that should be it!People who voted OUT didn’t expect it to take this long!They just expected it to be done & get on with life.Not the end of the world because we’re going out.We’ll march on!#Brexit

May became PM by pretending to be in favor of Brexit & Corbyn will try to become PM by pretending to be against it. 
There is no room for complacency, but far fewer jobs have left the City than financial institutions warned. Business & the economy proving remarkably resilient despite the #Brexit negotiations shambles.  
I don't think a "No Deal" scenario should even be legal. This and the consequences of it were never seriously discussed by any party during the referendum. If it wasn't for Leave's "Project Fear" and Goves "We've had enough of experts" serious debate may have been possible. 
For the first time in months, people realized, there was a chance—however small—that Brexit could be stopped  
Tory Referendum Tory Brexit Tory Brexit negotiationsTory shitstorm. Eff all to do with Labour, Anna. 
Theresa May: 'No-deal' Brexit better than Canada-style one  
Shami Chakrabarti on R4 news said that she would only consider another ref. if the polling showed that 90% were in favour. Nothing about the lawbreaking, the lies or the Russian involvement. Why can't they be honest and say that they also plan to use Brexit for their own ends. 
A good point from @chakrabortty that I hadn't fully comprehended until now: you can view working class Brexit votes as an *entirely successful* attempt to send loathed elites into chaos:  
“nobody is taking back control of anything in Brexit. That defining Leave slogan has turned out to be a pathetic and monstrous joke”Good stuff as ever from @jonlis1 
Nicki controlled the entire United Kingdom to vote leave, she caused Brexit. #NickiStoppedMyBag 
Theresa May wowed her New York audience today by pledging that after Brexit the UK will have the lowest corporation tax rate in the G20. Who currently has the lowest corporation tax rate in the G20? Erm... the UK  
There's been a lot of talk in the news about Brexit recently and you've probably heard a lot of words like 'backstop' and 'Chequers' - but what does it all mean? Here's one of RTÉ's political experts @RTENewsPaulC to explain. 
No, we are not "talking up" risks of Brexit - bear in mind that scientists are evidence driven. Our worked-through views being casually dismissed without any evidence of knowledge or cogitation by dismissers is irritating -e.g.  brexit, health, climate change, pollution etc 
We must give a voice to those who were unfairly excluded from the previous referendum, and any vote must be a #FinalSayForAll. Please consider donating to the  crowdfunder so we can keep collating the stories of the disenfranchised 
The Prime Minister has said a post-Brexit Britain will have an immigration system to attract the brightest to the UK. We are taking back control of our borders. 
Great speech from Dennis and he’s absolutely right to highlight importance of immigrants to NHS, but let’s remember, Dennis campaigned for Leave and repeatedly went through the lobbies with the Tories during #Brexit votes. Like many Labour policies, an utterly confused position.  
Theresa May got a tough lesson in how Brexit is perceived from abroad  
Chancellor calls early Budget to fit round Brexit talks  
By linking defeating the government's #Brexit deal (if there is one) with a push for a General Election, Corbyn has greatly increased the pressure on potential Tory rebels to vote with the government on Brexit, so making a Tory Brexit more likely. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
As many as 10pc of UK businesses would face bankruptcy if goods were delayed by under 30 minutes as a result of Brexit trade friction, new research has claimed.Who is putting this out. A truck can be delayed by more due to traffic at Dartford or on the M25Project Fear

“#Palestine” ranked as fourth highest priority in the #UK’s Labour Party, ahead of #Brexit and #NHS. Is there any party in the world so obsessed with the affairs of another country, in particular, the only Jewish one!? The absurdity continues. #LabourAntisemitism #Lab18 
I keep hearing that Tories shouldn’t get rid of May while she is negotiating Brexit. Why not? Thatcher was negotiating in Paris when they got rid of her. Besides, the alternative is to let her continue negotiations on the  Chequers Plan. They must both go. Now. 
Has the government’s Brexit incompetence been a deliberate ploy to arrive at no solution other than no deal? Is this what they’ve been manipulating us towards all along? If so Labour has taken the bait. March 29 will be on us in a flash & a crash. People’s vote will be timed out.

Emmanuel Macron is taking a tough line on Brexit – and the rest of Europe is with him.  
There's no such thing as a good #Brexit. Most Labour members know that. Doing what is best for the country is to Remain in the EU. A few more months of this Tory debacle will prove it. 
No Brexit Deal can deliver “exactly the same benefits” as membership of single market and customs union. Neither May nor Corbyn can deliver that, nobody can. Corbyn sells unicorns pretending he can, it’s just a delusional to lure gullible people to vote for him.  
If you are so confident that #Brexit is the right thing for the #UK, you should be able to win another referendum without breaking sweat. You will easily be able to demonstrate the benefit & convince people to vote with you by an even larger majority. What are you so afraid of? 
Will the government follow the evidence - or Theresa May's prejudices? Me on the MAC report and immigration after Brexit.

The polls have shifted, more and more people want a public vote. It’s only authoritarian elites like you and @Jacob_Rees_Mogg who want to stand in the way. You don’t believe in democracy you just believe in Brexit. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg: “The Remainers who want another referendum hold democracy in contempt. They lost and they should grow up.”

One of the biggest problems in Brexit is people's idea that they are negotiating with a sovereign state, rather than a bundle of rules.

Govt's hard Brexit puts profits for multinational corporations before ensuring everyone's basic needs are met.Companies benefiting from our roads, education system and NHS must make a fair contribution.No one voted to make the UK a tax haven. We need a #PeoplesVote. 
Corbyn has manoeuvred himself into a position which will drive May mad. He is offering a Brexit deal that businesses and unions will accept but the ERG will not. It's a deal that May can't deliver and also stops her claiming that Corbyn is working against the national interest. 
“You can’t just scratch out ‘EU’ and put in ‘UK’.” Well there goes the Brexit ...

Corbyn made a welcome pledge today to net-zero carbon emissions, which the Scottish Government is resisting. But his confusion on Brexit continues. Greens know bold action's needed on both: a zero carbon economy and a clear stand against Brexit and for Scotland's future in Europe

Lord Wolfson, chief executive of Next, has said that a no deal Brexit would pose no material threat to his company. In the worst case scenario prices might rise by 0.4%. He himself openly supports Brexit which he believes could lead to an ‘economic renaissance for Britain.’ 
A general question. If the people who promised Brexit sold an undeliverable idea on the back of a bunch of lies and some good old fashioned racism in order to enrich themselves...What word do we use to describe them?

3/ Labour has a clear Brexit strategy that can destroy the Tories and and save the nation... 
There is no sweet spot. The more the #Brexit options unravel it’s clear none will benefit our country as the Govts own assessments concluded months ago That’s why more and more people are backing @peoplesvote_uk deal or no deal & with #Remain on the ballot paper. 
Translation from Corbynese to plain English: Corbyn wants Brexit to happen, if only he’s in charge. He doesn’t want people to decide.  
The Labour Conference signal failure story is good. But it's still not as good as David Cameron being delayed by signal failure for his launch of the EU Referendum Campaign, at a factory in Chippenham that produces the UK's railway signals.

'The Conservative Party is trying to hide a debate on Brexit at their conference – but Tories like me are fighting back' Simon Allison (@si_tory) - chairman of Conservatives for a People's Vote - on #InformedConsent and why we need it in the @Independent. 
Corbyn concludes that he will risk Brexit in a bid to seize the keys to No10. Use exit to trigger an election to the detriment of something that two thirds of seats he currently holds backed.. 
Disappointing that JCs speech today did not mention how destructive any kind of Brexit is to the UK.  Nor did he mention the #PeoplesVote.   It was all about a general election and making promises to the people of better times ahead. None of it feasible with Brexit. #StopBrexit 
The only Brexit deal that would retain no border, protection of rights and living standards is CU/ SM.With that, we would of course lose UK’s say after Brexit.That’s why #Lab2018 is right to leave *all* options open. It’s unlikely any Brexit can deliver what many voted for. 
Some nice ideas in Corbyn's speech, but it's not entirely clear where all the money will come from, especially if Brexit proceeds.  Circling loads of stuff in the Argos catalogue doesn't mean Santa's going to be able to bring them. 
Corbyn will only accept a Brexit deal that includes a customs union. A CU negates a fundamental benefit of Brexit, i.e. being able to freely negotiate our own trade deals, & it subjugates the UK to the EU. #PoliticsLive 
Just up, and very relevant to what Jeremy Corbyn has just said about Brexit, my piece on @ipaperviews asking what Labout really mean by negotiating a better Brexit deal:  
Corbyn offers May a way out- says he would support Brexit deal if she signs up to protecting w rights and customs union with EU. He knows she cannot accept the latter. Lab leadership laying groundwork to nullify charge they're trashing national interest when they vote against. 
I hate him. I hate his hard left student politics bollocks. I hate his brainwashed, lobotomized acolytes. I hate his fantasy-land rhetoric. I hate his moronic shadow cabinet. I hate his faux #Brexit secretary openly agitating to remain. I hate the whole fucking pig-thick shower. 
So there you have it - Corbyn would negotiate a Brexit, allowing it to happen, rather than preventing it. For that announcement he gets a standing ovation and his name chanted to the rafters. He’s still pro-Brexit #Lab18 
Corbyn says if PM can't negotiate a good deal with Brussels then she needs to "make way for a party that can and will". Which would be fine if it weren't for fact that Labour's policy on Brexit has been all over the place for more than two years. #Lab18 
Oh Corbyn then ends with Brexit cakeism. Tories should get out out way and left Labour negotiate its own unicorn deal.  
Just now @jeremycorbyn claimed Labour would respect the EU referendum result...But yesterday he backed @Keir_Starmer who said "nobody is ruling out remain" What's clear is that they would take us all back to square one on Brexit. #Lab18 #Lab2018 
Our analysis showed that opinion is shifting decisively towards Remain. Now new polling research commissioned by a Brexit group suggests opinion has shifted even further.Let's grow it further still. Learn how you can help at:  
.⁦@jeremycorbyn⁩ tells ⁦@Theresa_may⁩ there is a Brexit deal he and Labour would support. To be clear there are some in her cabinet and in Whitehall who will see what he wants as deliverable - though it would probably split Tory Party  
Corbyn on Brexit: "We will oppose the Chequers plan and leaving the EU with no deal."#Lab18 
I like to think that at the other end of this conversation is that lady from the Mars border check scene in Total Recall right now going “Two weeks. Ewehw. Two weeks. Mwaghaargh. TWO WEEKS.” #Brexit #PutinBot #Busted 
If Ed Miliband had suggested spending fifty quid on some new net curtains for Downing St he'd have been destroyed. Mark of how Brexit has removed Conservatives' armour plated austerity narrative that Corbyn can announce billions on what he likes and they can barely land a punch. 
Very good line on Brexit from Jeremy Corbyn: The Tory Brexiteers unite the politics of the 1950s with the economics of the 19th century, daydreaming about a Britannia that both rules the waves and waives the rules." #Lab18 
I’m confused. Corbyn saying the choice between Theresa May’s deal and no deal is a disaster for the UK’s economy. But didn’t John McDonnell say on Monday any referendum should be between May’s deal and no deal?!? #Lab18 
According to David Campbell-Bannerman on @BBCTalkback- the CBI and business community are lazy? And the issue of the border has been hijacked? What a load of tosh. Arrogant garbage from someone who clearly has no understanding of the situation #Brexit #NoBrexit #StopBrexit 
Here's the 'darn sight more' we now know Anna:.No deep recessionNo mass unemploymentNo house price crashNo stock market crashNo soaring inflationPS Shall we have an EU referendum every year just in case people change their minds?  
Complete sense here: May should stop Brexit now. Forget a People’s Vote. It’s clearly all too damaging and undeliverable. Voters were sold myths. It’s time to tell the truth. Problem is that not a single politician in the U.K. dare do such a thing.   
The Labour brand is being damaged by all those in my party talking of a second referendum  
In a long speech @jeremycorbyn makes a brief mention of #Brexit, the biggest issue facing Britain. He is sticking to his old meaningless platitude of a jobs first Brexit. Nothing about consulting the British people. Much to like in his speech but not this. 
.@MiamiSup pays a visit to @UnitedWayMiami to discuss the #SecureOurFuture referendum. Speaks about the importance of adequately compensating our teachers and securing our schools.  
Corbyn will call no deal a "national disaster", say that "all options are on the table" in terms of Brexit and Labour will vote against Chequers and no deal. Not one mention of immigration or any anything that respects the result.Labour has now abandoned all Brexit voters. 
Has anyone else noticed a huge renewed wave of activity on Brexit sock puppet/troll farm accounts recently, against a People’s Vote? It’s pretty encouraging that their side is so worried. 
Been out..realise Jeremy is speaking.The critical words 4 #Remainers #RemainerNow to watch out for are:"We Respect the Referendum"If they appear in any form then any #PeoplesVote will be a sham & the Leadership have no intention of a real #Remain option#FinalSayforAll #FBPE 
After 1pm: The Prime Minister @Theresa_May says it's necessary to support her #Brexit plan if you want to prevent the break-up of the United Kingdom.  Is Theresa May really the saviour of the UK? We hear from @DCBMEP @JasonJHunter and @ShankerASingham 
Has @BBCNews or @SkyNews picked up on @Jim_Cornelius exposé of @DKShrewsbury yet? We know how much they love inviting @Jacob_Rees_Mogg on to talk about cheaper food and footwear prices for the poor once outside the evil EU...we're sure he'll explain this robustly...any chance? 
Would a general election solve the Brexit crisis?RT = no, of course not - it would just add to the uncertainty and drag it out for longer. Like = Yes, of course it would. Jeremy Corbyn is our saviour and can do no wrong.#Lab2018 
Stuff the EU Court of Injustice! It has no valid judicial status other than over those who submit to it. The EU itself has no concept of justice other than Might is Right. Join us in Brexit like Hungary has threatened. The more countries that rebel, the stronger we all get.  
As if we didn't know , the reality behind Brexit , time the duped scabs and racists realised how they've been conned , although they were targeted because they weren't the brightest

EU Commissioner threatens to clamp down on the media in a chilling attack on freedom of speech:  #Brexit 
The basic truth about Labour. Tactics, whatever the cost (). It's happy to live with the corrupt 2016 Referendum vote if it gets to undermine the legitimate 2017 General Election vote.  
A number of constituencies including those held by @Anna_Soubry @heidiallen75 and (my own) Dominic Grieve were targeted by pro brexit pollster.But the results indicated that many leave voters in those constituencies are #RemainerNow with a shift towards Remain (see thread) 
Can't wait for Brexit!Everything will be just brilliant!  
Yesterday so many Labour members showed their strong support for a public vote on the Brexit deal. As Jeremy Corbyn addresses his conference, my message to him is clear: help us stop Brexit! #ExitfromBrexit #peoplesvote 
"I think, frankly, what we see is policies that would not be good for our economy, policies that would lead, as we’ve heard from others in business, to loss of jobs & probably loss of investment in the UK.” Irony Drowned. PM May (on Lab, not Brexit) 
COSY: Corbyn to meet EU’s Barnier tomorrow. Labour are now talking up Remain and won’t rule out delaying Brexit. The Remoaner Party.  
I would rather pay 19% corporation tax & be part of the #SingleMarket with all the benefits, efficiencies and lower costs that it brings, than pay 17% and go bust because of #Brexit.#nobrainer@AlunCairns 
Five million #LabourLeave voters in marginal and target seats will be looking to .@jeremycorbyn today to keep faith with them and to honour the promises he made to deliver Brexit. #Lab2018 
Big vote and lots of sharing needed If there was a general election or a second referendum do you believe you would vote differently to last time ? 
Today we call on .@jeremycorbyn to honour our 2017 manifesto in his #Lab2018 Leaders Speech. Rule out a second referendum and reaffirm our commitment to leaving the European Union. 
May pledges 'lowest rate of corporation tax in the G20'. This is the Brextremists vision of post #Brexit Britain: a race to the bottom on tax, lining the pockets of wealthy elite while starving public purse of funds for public services. #StopBrexit  
These Labour members think young people in the party do want to see a People's Vote. But should Remain be an option? #Brexit #Labourconference18 Follow the latest from the conference here:

The chances of a second Brexit referendum just got higher  
"If it’s to have a referendum, I think we would get it. If it’s to play silly buggers then I think we might not."Times columnist Matthew Parris believes that a second referendum could add extra negotiation time in the event of a no deal.  
Jeremy Corbyn is expected to meet EU's chief Brexit negotiator after Labour’s party conference ends, sources say  
What is Brexit and why is it trending? 
Good meeting w/ @EESC_President. We are working for an orderly #Brexit and a new partnership that respects the UK's sovereignty, as well as the founding principles of the EU, such as the integrity of the single market.  
Labour’s promises to respect the referendum result now lie in tatters - @BrandonLewis  
let that send alarm bells to the Labour Party the conniving lot on Brexit.Here is Skinner plotting to Field, Hoey with arch Tory Steve Baker before the HoC vote the last one before the summer recess. 3 votes dragged it over the line Stringer Field Hoey with Skinner abstaining.  
To hold a second referendum before the first one has even been implemented does not in any way respect the votes of the 17.4 million.  
This is worrying. Mrs May is doggedly pursuing #Chequers which is reviled, doesn't honour the referendum vote to leave the EU & isn't a good deal for the UK. Yet Chancellor Angela Merkel is pushing to get it locked down in October!Something very sly is going on. #StandUp4Brexit 
Some absurd figures were bandied around during #EURef about the number of finance jobs that would be lost after Brexit. And in January 2017 the London Stock Exchange suggested it would be 232,000. So how many jobs have actually left? 630. Yes, just 630... 
The true Brexit agenda is beginning to emerge - A think tank linked to Tory Brexiteers has released a report calling for lower food + environmental safety standards and opening up the NHS to American healthcare firms after Brexit as part of a US trade deal  
“In some parts of the UK, life expectancy has even decreased.”This is alarming. We already knew this was starting to happen. Years of austerity have done this to our ability to provide healthcare and Brexit will make it much worse.  
"In short, the electorate was sold a myth ... by a handful of ideologues and careerists who had no clearer idea than the voters themselves about what Brexit actually involved." This basic truth has been rendered almost unsayable, but it is at the heart of all that's followed.  
“And then she said that she cannot have a Brexit deal that has a hard border in Ireland, but then threatens to have a no deal Brexit which will create an immediate hard border in Ireland.”  
Without a Muller-style inquiry into Leave cheating we depend on legal action like this to force the PM to establish the truth. We can’t go through with a decision as far-reaching as Brexit on a flawed mandate.  
Germany's deputy finance minister urges insurers to prepare for no-deal Brexit

Brexit transition period negotiated by Theresa May could be too short to sign trade deal in, Angela Merkel warns  
Do you understand Labour’s Brexit stance? 
Friends! Absolutely bloody outstanding!Our Labour Conference - with the exception of the Far-Right Dennis Skinner - rises to its knees as Our Keir talks about the need for Our Second Remain Referendum!And this response tells us that no-one wants Brexit, apart from the people.  
"That the Church of England which was birthed in the Brexit of the English Reformation should want to surrender the nation’s sovereignty to a superstate & that its lead bishop should defend this move as “prophetic”shows how far the bishops have capitulated” 
Theresa May said yesterday (with a straight face i assume) that a GE would not be in the national interest, yet her no deal #Brexit is better than a bad deal would be.... The removal of this odious/dangerous woman and the wicked party she leads is now vital #Lab18 #PeoplesVote 
While researchers are trying to prepare for Brexit, there are signs that the UK might already be losing out on EU research funds... (1/3)  
Jacob Rees Mogg & his ERG group say they will bring down the Chequers deal at all costs. Well done to them, we fought too hard for too long for Brexit to just let May betray us..  
Calling it... There won’t be a General Election or a second referendum. Theresa May will get a deal and it will pass parliament because there is no alternative. The United Kingdom will exit the European Union in March 2019. 
If the 'will of the people' in 2015 was to elect the Tories for 5 years, why did they think it was acceptable to question the 'will of the people' by having an election in 2017, 3 years before an election was due?Yet, with Brexit, the 'will of the people' is absolute?   
No one who believes Brexit is of existential importance to the country and was a con that lacks any legitimacy should vote Labour in that general election.

BETRAYAL: Jeremy Corbyn refuses to rule out delaying Brexit. ‘All options open’. The British people made their decision: Leave.  
There is no doubt the speech made by @Keir_Starmer on #Brexit was the defining  moment of #Lab18 and @martinkettle captures the reaction in the hall perfectly.At @Remain_Labour, we are still buzzing. 
WATCH: In life, things don't always out how we thought they would....so we think again. And if #Brexit isn't turning out the way you hoped, then it's time to think again too #PeoplesVote 
The Tory government's refusal to consider extending Article 50 almost guarantees a bad deal. And a Tory bad deal makes no deal more likely. Both awful outcomes. #Brexit #Lab18 
The 'why' isn't mysterious. Our Government, or at least a sizeable chunk of it, are enamored of the idea of using the situation to push through changes to our society that they've always desired but never been able to get public support for. They're using Brexit as a Trojan Horse 
Two days, the great @JaneMayerNYer published this piece in @NewYorker & addresses the denialism about if and how Russian active measures worked. Read it & remember that the same companies & same individuals were directly involved in Brexit... 
There are only two Brexit deal options that protect our economy (by keeping us in the single market) and solve the Irish border question.1. EEA membership2. Remain in the EUAll other options will damage our economy and create a hard border in Ireland. It really is that simple. 
Theresa May and her government of chaos have spent far to long on Brexit negotiations without any progress. It’s seems May is not good at negotiating that’s why Britain has no Brexit deal. It’s time for her to go, and allow a new team to negotiate. General election now.#Lab18 
A World Trade Brexit will allow the UK to become a truly modern, competitive economy. #NoDealNoProblem 
The hardest question to answer appears to be the hardest question for the media to ask - "Mrs May, why are you ignoring the fact that the marginal victory in the EU referendum, on which you're driving the country into an abyss, was secured by Leave campaigns acting illegally?"  
Whoop whoop #Meghan can shut a car door all by herself! Give me fuckin strength. The UK is careering off a Brexit cliff edge and that’s deemed newsworthy!!!!!!! 
Just watch this to understand the Irish Border & Brexit  
#Brexit is a coup by a class of right wing political & media elites intent on accumulating capital through the fracking of any remaining common goods & rights, & enabled through classic political strategies of manufactured divisions, the architects of “austerity” softened the way

Econmic experts back @NicolaSturgeon’s call to delay #Brexit 
Please keep one thing in mind over the next few weeks - it is overwhelmingly likely that any politician who proposes to extend Article 50 is really plotting to stop Brexit altogether via the traditional Westminster deceit of kicking something into the long grass. 
One could argue that both referendum campaigns from Leave and Remain were fought on the grounds of a #WTO platform and that any divergence away from this would be a betrayal, especially under Theresa May as a leading Remainer.#Brexit 
84% of German public opinion opposed big concessions to UK over Brexit.  
The Prime Minister will recommit to cutting corporation tax from 19  per cent to 17  per cent as part of an “unequivocally pro-business” tax regime, with or without a Brexit deal.This is excellent news for wages, investment and the Treasury’s coffers!

The EU are obviously worried that a truly global Britain will create a situation where we will not only undermine their Single Market but more importantly bring in to question their protectionist regime.Oh well We voted to Leave, not Leave with restrictive caveats.#Brexit 
We were told that Britain would lose ten thousand jobs in the City if we dared to vote for Brexit. That isn't quite what has happened...When will the liars behind Project Fear apologise for their pathological dishonesty?!Support us at  
This may sound a bit arrogant, and I don't mean it to be, but when I voted remain, I looked into it myself and made the decision myself. I didn't read the press or any other scare mongerers, because they can't be trusted. We've had the referendum. We need a GE more imo  
BTW the probable foreign interference in #Brexit comes in the three forms1. Russian and US digital activists (Troll farm and Bannon)2. Russian dark money and privatisation deals3. Unknown dark money (see DUP and @openDemocracy) 
After Brexit it is time to pass legislation to prevent lying in public elections - it would be like criminal fraud: 'anyone who makes a statement that they know or suspect is untrue with the intention of deceiving the electorate is guilty of an offence.' 
With provable overspends, illegal coordination, dark ads and data misuse among BOTH Leave campaigns, AND probable foreign interference - the #Brexit vote is already the biggest blow to British democracy for a century. We need a legitimate vote on a real choice.  
Were the Labour Party members right to support the possibility of a second vote on Brexit? 
We have to drop this "respecting the result of the referendum" nonsense. How about respecting that many have changed their minds, were misled, were lied to?@BremainInSpain 
Just so i'm clear.The Corbyn wing of labour don't want a second referendum as it would be detrimental to our democracy.The same folk want a general strike to force an election.How does one square this fuckwit circle? 
The chair of @EPInstitutional committee who will steer #Brexit through the European Parliament says it's time to chuck Chequers - "It is frustrating to us that the UK has left the same unworkable arguments on the table for so long without changing them at all."  
Those calling for a Canada-style #Brexit deal are keen to ignore that an off-the-shelf deal designed for a country where 10% of its exports go to the EU is totally insufficient for a country like Wales where 60% of our exports go to the EU.#NotMyBrexit 
1) Great article on why #Brexit is insolubleWe can rail about respecting the vote, the EU being stubborn,May being incompetent etc all day long.  The fact is it cannot be negotiated successfully, and anyone who believes otherwise is mistaken#Lab18 
It also adds fresh light to why the EU would rather destroy the UK via Brexit than end this grotesque scam. If we get out easy, others follow, and their gravy train derails...  
A lie from low tax Chloe. The EU doesn't claim to have defeated the Nazis, it claims to have maintained the peace by ending the rabid nationalism that has so often brought war to Europe. Why do we let dishonest, destructive immigrants like Chloe into Britain? #Brexit #StopBrexit

Strangely enough I had many students who covered Brexit in their work - in run up to the 2016 vote. We’d look at propaganda, indoctrination, media bias. My job was to show various forms & alert them to it, in Leave & Remain campaigns. Insulting & paranoid to say we indoctrinated.

Find half an hour, sit down and WATCH THIS excellent , important analysis of where we are with Brexit  
Those of us who have said Labour and Brexit are incompatible aren't surprised by what @JasonJHunter is revealing in this thread. Brexit is of the right, by the right and for the right. No true Labour supporter would entertain this bonfire of rights, protections and freedoms.  
Good points about Lab Brexit betrayal by Tory chairman @BrandonLewis but oddly he glosses over the Brexit betrayal inherent in Chequers plan

Indeed. The issue is not instant illegality of EU27 citizens in the UK on Brexit day, but what the UK government might do to change their status next - although illegality issues might arise for @BritishInEurope depending on what Member States do. Let's stick to facts. 
“A second referendum would be a disaster for democracy. This would be the establishment telling voters they are a bunch of idiots who gave the ‘wrong’ answer and must now think again. It would be an entirely elitist and anti-democratic initiative.”Brendan O’Neill on Sky  
May promises post-Brexit UK economy that is “knowledge-rich, highly innovative, highly skilled and high quality but with low tax and smart regulation” but not apparently cliché free!  
Theresa May has pledged to use low tax & “smart regulation” to make post-Brexit Britain an economic powerhouse and the envy of Europe. That's right the envy of Europe! -  back in reality we're more likely to become the 'poor man of Europe' once again #BrexitShambles #TrickleDOwn

We can be sure that won’t happen! For any democracy to function it requires a competent, responsible and effective opposition. We don’t have one and that is a huge part of why we are in a #Brexit mess  
Looks like Ireland recovered from the ‘trauma’ of a second referendum on the Lisbon Treaty quite well.  
I don’t understand the argument that another referendum is “undemocratic”. Enough time has passed. We have had General Elections in faster turnaround. A lot can change in 2 years. Enough for a country to want to change the political ideology of those who govern it. Why not this? 
The Tory Brexit plan takes shape.Hello tax cuts. Goodbye public services, workers rights and regulations.Trumpton-on-Sea.

So, it’s NOT about Brexit, then? Take note, any Labour folk who’ve been giving Gary Barlow‘s tax adviser the benefit of the doubt.

MUST-READ: 1 in 10 UK firms face bankruptcy in the event of a no deal Brexit.A no deal Brexit wasn't on the ballot paper in 2016. Leading Leave campaigners told us we'd get a deal. This is why we're demanding a #PeoplesVote:

We warned you that the Brexit referendum was a mousetrap.Once your vote was cast, they slammed the cage door behind you.Remember they said, "We'll have a chance to review the final deal before committing to anything?" I do.But they were lying. They got your vote. End of. 
I hate that Brexit has brought people to act like spoilt brats. It’s disgusting what some of these Remain supporters are churning out. What if say, one of their grandparents voted to leave? They’re basically wishing death on their own families. Disgraceful. 
Lets RT the feck out of this. The Tory Civil War and Libertarian Coup that is Brexit has to be exposed for the massive con that it is. The vote was won by lies and mi.sinformation and the whole of Parliament knows this. Yet we are captive of some kind of helpless group madness!  
The leaked EU document also reveals Brussels' fears Britain will re-regulate her economy, becoming considerably more competitive. May has no choice but to go for the Canada option and make a success of Brexit. Support us at  
#Labour MP for #Crewe and #Nantwich Laura Smith wants trade unions to stage a General Strike - if there's no general election called before #Brexit  
Day by day, May is committing political suicide by her refusal to embrace the ERG's SuperCanada option, which was drawn up by trade expertsUnlike her #ChequersPlan which was written by trade amateur Olly RobbinsThe prize of #Brexit must be seized 
Brexit is an excuse for the richer to get richer and the poor to get poorer. Low tax, low regulation society where public services have to be bought up by private companies in order to survive. 
Davis - 2yrs being THE BREXIT MINISTER - failed, quit, didn’t come up with any workable plan let alone a 180!!!!!!!! page one (it’s the content that counts David), persuaded no-one, now moans to The Times.Sod off.  
Several times Mrs May @theresa_may has said she wants #Brexit in order to maintain the integrity of the union. Seems to me it will be her very Brexit that will ultimately see Scottish independence, Irish reunification, losing Gibraltar to Spain & Falklands to Argentina. Hmm!  
Sir Keir Starmer: " We will continue offering the public a chance to vote on Brexit, until they get it right"... 
My guess is there will be a lot of questions. I’d like to start with why, given that the Scottish Parliament has voted for it, she opposes a second independence referendum?  
Brexit. It’s all going so well part 94  
Referendum calls unstoppable, says governor Joho  via @charlesmghenyi 
Labour supporters want a #PeoplesVote with a REMAIN option. Corbyn & McDonnell don’t want either. They want “Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' “ by SEEMING to back a Brexit referendum. Keep a beady eye on them. @theguardian 
Well, there it is in a nutshell: Diane Abbott.."we do want to.respect the vote of the referendum". Except it's a lie. Really, Labour wants to ignore the reasons people voted Leave in order to pursue their own political agenda.  
Brexit is only 4432 hours away. Its comforting to know that we are ready for it. #brexit  
Why does Britain care so little for disabled and elderly people? My very personal Mail article on the caring crisis being inflamed by Brexit, as seen so frighteningly through my family prism 
To all the wet blankets that claim a #PeoplesVote is undemocratic, I'll tell what was undemocratic. Parliament passing a bill to have an advisory referendum and then the Tories hijacking it and using it as a  firm mandate. I don't care where the blame lies, it was advisory. 
If labour do not give their  unequivocal support to remain then they will never get my vote again.For me, a lifelong labour supporter this is a very sad time.#Brexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE 
This isn't news to us.Ciaran @donnyc1975 has been explaining this for quite some time.Brexit simply does not work for business. 
#CreweAndNantwichMP calling for General Strike to get rid of Tory Gov.So Lab now want to bring the UK to a standstill until Lab get what they want?First Lab betray the 17.4m who voted #Brexit.Now Lab want to replace democracy with brute force.   
Does anyone else feel like #Brexit has slaughtered normal political debate for them.With tbis spectre hanging over us I find it impossible to engage on any other issue, knowing that #Brexit will change everything. #FBPE #PeoplesVote 
France's finance minister says it would be “suicidal” to grant a Brexit deal that seems better than remaining in the EU  
Brexit border delays could bankrupt 10pc of firms, survey claims.  
This is what Brexit is all about...corporations... business... lowest rate of Corporation Tax in the G20... & talks with Donald Trump.What happened to "A country that works for everyone" ? 
I so look forward to the day when I’ll turn on the news and I won’t hear the word “Brexit”. It’ll just be a distant memory of that time we went a bit mad.

Average salary in the UK is £524 a week.So being £900 a week worse off, because of #brexit, would be a bit difficult.Dear old Chuka must have gone to the same school as Diane Abbott.Labour's figures never add up. 
The year is 2034.Those born in 2016 are now voting age.The vast majority of voters from the 2016 referendum voted Remain.And they're reading in the history books that for almost 3 years before leaving, almost everything we saw pointed to Brexit going badly...They're thinking:  
Editorial: Labour’s members have overwhelmingly spoken – we are closer to getting a Final Say on Brexit than ever  
#WageBillFromHell ;Raila Odinga must know that we don't eat politics! Kenya can't afford have two elections in 2017, handshakes in 2018, a census in 2019, referendum in 2020, change the constitution in 2021 and have a general election in 2022. 
Labour’s Brexit position = CHAOS? Really?Jacob Rees-Mogg guestimated it will take about 50 years after Brexit to get back to where we are nowTranslate: between Brexit and 50 years we will have CHAOSCHAOS is fine when you are gambling with other people lives - Agree RT  
It's been over two years and you still don't have a credible plan.  None of the Brexteers have a credible plan.  Brexit *is* at square one and always has been.  It's never moved so much as a millimetre off of square one.#BrexitShambles#FinalSayForAll 
In 2018 Third -Way Alliance party leader Dr. Ekuru Aukot has intensified his push for a referendum to reduce the number of members of parliament from the current 416 to 194 while also scrapping the position of women representative. #WageBillFromHell 
In 2016 Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has called for a referendum to reduce the number of legislators in Kenya’s Parliament.  #WageBillFromHell 
Instead of reducing, @RailaOdinga wants to add another layer of devolution called super counties and to bloat the Executive to create the post of prime minister with two deputies.We need a Wanjiku oriented referendum. #WageBillFromHell

#Kavanaugh's nomination has become a referendum on the basic principle of innocent until proven guilty, & it’s setting a dangerous precedent on due process. Tonight one women's group is projecting 'Kavanaugh is a sexual predator' on SCOTUS  #IStandWithBrett 
A thought on #portageandmain:  Sure @VoteOpenWpg may lose this referendum, but why the eff is an important decision about the future of our city being put to the masses? All experts are united that this is a good thing for the city.  Let's listen to them? Why have experts at all? 
Why don’t Kentuckians have the power of citizen-referendum like neighboring states? Missouri voters pummeled Right to Work. KY voters would put it on the ballot and do the same. I say, Power to The People! 
It is the play of a world-class business man. He knows for sure he as the UK and AUS on the hook and with Brexit and the PRC he can use the leverage to better our position. 
Brexit: the impact on aviation - there is still great uncertainty which has yet to be resolved, and no reassurance to be found in the government's latest publications. The impact of a "no deal" scenario is still being understated... ` #Brexinfo. 
As funny as this all is, the BIG SERIOUS POINT is that Liam Fox and Department for Trade has not successfully negotiated ONE SINGLE free trade agreement to continue after we leave the EU. So those South African lemons could potentially have a whopping tariff BECAUSE of Brexit.  
Given that the country was only 51.9% sure that Brexit was a good idea in 2016... Given that the plan it took the government 2 years to come up with has just been rejected, and given that those 51.9% weren't happy with it anyway...#PeoplesVote

‘Customs delays of 30 minutes 'will bankrupt 1 in 10 firms', say bossesSupply chain chiefs at 1,300 surveyed firms say firms are already stockpiling parts amid fear of no-deal Brexit.’Is this really what Brexit voters voted for in June 2016? 
Remoaners never respected democracy before, denying us a vote on every EU treaty since we joined & they never minded handing over vast powers and money to EU control. Only now do they support a 2nd vote because they lost the referendum. Sorry hypocrites, we're leaving..  
Remember when @jjhorgan promised that the question in the PR referendum would be a simple yes or no question? Well here's what the ballot looks like - #brokenpromise #NDPfail #PropRep 
Stunning excoriation of our current politicians and their abandonment and betrayal of Europe by @Davidmkeys. Damage caused to Europe by Brexit is shrugged off by most, and even revelled in by some, but as 80 years ago, an unstable Europe will harm UK too.  
Charles:  1) 5 million voting-age UK Citizens abroad were first promised a vote, then disenfranchised by the 2015 Referendum Act and 2) The 2016 UK EU leave vote has been shown by the Electoral Commission to have been procured by crime. Brexit is now simply a mockery of democracy 
The @LACA_UK Autumn Business Seminar will take place on 16 November at the Stratford Manor Hotel. The programme includes an update on childhood obesity, action from  @NSMW and a presentation on the research of potential impact of Brexit on school meals.  
Very simple - the only way Remainers could stop a hard Brexit was to vote Labour and reduce May's majority, which they did in many thousands. Obviously conditions have now changed. Labour cannot rely on that mobile vote without a much clearer PV & pro-EU line.  
Are you a #Lefty or a #Remainer worried about #Brexit?Has a democratic referendum & a general election still left you feeling cheated? Don’t worry, you are a wanker & this can help you!

Britain has laid out the potential impact of Brexit for ferrets in case no deal is reached with the EU, along with warnings on air travel, freight transport and copyrights  
My latest op-ed on why the upcoming referendum in #Macedonia will determine the country’s future for decades to come. #Russia wants nothing more than for voters to reject a historic accord with #Greece and is actively working to undermine that outcome. 
“16% of Brits favour remaining in the EU when presented with all the options. Even among those who voted Remain in 2016, just 32% support remaining today.” But our political elites know better than us mere mortals & continue to work to subvert Brexit.  
It’s alright, 100% of leave voters can’t name a single tangible, unarguable benefit that Brexit will bring.  
Some people are posting things on FB refering to the EU not remembering our losses in ww2. Yetthe UK had a 1975 referendum with an electorate that either served IN the war or lived through it in some way.. so yes.. THEY DID KNOW BEST!! Lest we forget. (Copied from fb) #FBPE

It is not patriotic to weaken our ties with our fellow European democracies. It is not patriotic to repeatedly lie to the public to get them support #Brexit. It is not patriotic to deny a #PeoplesVote when the outcome of negotiations is known.#BrexitBetraysBritain.

ScotLab oppose Indyref2. NATs say they're against the democratic right of the Scots people to decide their own future via a referendum. Eh no they're not. They supported that. We had the referendum. NATs need to respect the democratic decision of the Scottish people. 
There has been a chain of events that go right back to the Thatcher era that explain why Brexit happened. It’s set of manipulations played out by politicians and media that lead to people voting against their best interests. Please feel free to read my own thoughts on this.

Today 126 workers at George Birchall Ltd, Stoke on Trent, have lost their jobs of 30 years as the company collapses from lack of orders since Brexit. Stoke on Trent voted to Leave - go hang your heads in shame. 
Immigration, with regard to why people voted for Brexit, is actually not that complexAlmost every single study since the referendum has shown that Leavers wanted less of it  
Should there be a second referendum on leaving the EU?  
Meaning that @Keir_Starmer is a patriot aiming to prevent a destructive #Brexit harming Britain and defending the Right of British people to live work and study in 32 countries. You, on the other hand, would damage Britain, and rob Britons of that Right.#PeoplesVote 
I personally welcome the Labour Party's approach regarding Brexit, and am not surprised by the predictable screams of anguish from those, who clearly stand to gain by it. I mean 'speculators' 'shady dealers, and the nucleus of the Tory Party, and their supporters! 
Jeremy Corbyn doesn’t know his own six tests for Brexit but is asking people to trust him with Brexit.  
This is why it's a complete myth to think that there would be pitchforks if Brexit was stopped.  Most people don't care or even tune in to politics.  Politicians should keep things stable, ensure security, health, education, regulation etc - not take major risks & cause upheavals  
Today was the greatest day of my life. Hundreds of fellow Corbynistas raised our hands in unison to say NO to Brexit. Jeremy will vote down any deal May comes up with, forcing a General Election and a new Referendum. I couldn't be prouder of my party. 
Brexit has become unnegotiable. Theresa May has a constitutional duty to admit that truth  
If I had gone for a shit after brexit referendum till today I would have shown same negotiation skills with Europe as the Tories and probably achieved more productive outcome 
 “ brexit will bring you cheap clothes and shoes “ - Jacob rees mogg said this on TV I believe .. not so cheap now are they

I'm going to start on this issue you're 100%wrong! If leave voters still feel brexit is right (in spite of what they know now) then they can vote to leave again. If they've changed their minds then they deserve the chance to say so. Can't understand any aspect of your argument 
One clear trend is happening in Brexit: as Remain become more passionate, stronger and ever more inclusive, Leave get shriller and more desperate in their promises and their threats

Brexit negotiations have gone "very wrong" and Labour is leaving the option open to remain in the EU, Keir Starmer says  
There really is no good reason to not have a vote.If brexit is so good- it will winBut I think even ultra brexiters can see the writing on the wall. Brexit is utter rubbish, damaging to all & everything except for supporting tax avoidance for the #ToryElite 
Brexit has become unnegotiable. Theresa May has a constitutional duty to admit that truth  I agree with Prof Howorth on the deceit and dishonesty of the Referendum & that it is time to reconsider all options and only a #PeoplesVote can unblock the impasse. 
Astounds me that U R prepared to turn a non-Binding Ref mandatory, & enforce a #Brexit based on varied opinions of only 26.5% of the Ppl, an invalid promise of a former PM after a campaign of lies & illegalities & consider it Democratic yet call a Confirmatory Ref Undemocratic?!

I'm with Caroline and all those Leavers or Remainers of good will who now believe that UK needs informed consent on Brexit final deal through #PeoplesVote. This cuts across all traditional party lines. 
Loving @gavinesler twitter fights with the tax-dodging expense-fiddling hard-right Brexit elite  
But Labour doesn’t ‘back a second referendum.’Today’s policy is for a referendum to be a possibility; and we haven’t ‘ruled out’ there might be an option to remain. Labour people don’t get carried away; keep campaigning for firm commitment to people’s vote  
Labour policy is to renationalise railways; water etc. This would be forbidden within the EU. That is the real reason why New Labour supporters want the UK to remain within the EU and why Old Labour support BREXIT!! 
Cos it's wall to wall anti-Brexit, anti-Trump insufferable PC smugness. 
Theresa May is asked by #C4News what happens if she doesn't get a #Brexit deal through Parliament.She has no answer. Essentially, she's ready to push the country off a cliff rather than concede a #PeoplesVote. 
There are at least 3 reasons why denying us a vote would be undemocratic: (1) only when we see 'the deal' can we know what's on offer; (2) people have a right to change their minds; (3) the referendum was replete with illegality, cheating & lies.  #PeoplesVote 
Absolute scenes at #TWT2018 Socialist Campaign Group rally. @LauraSmithMP calls for general strike instead of a second referendum, to a standing ovation from MPs and crowd. Would be interested to hear those on the left calling for a #peoplesvote's response to this! 
Brexit Trollish to English DictionaryIt's happening, get over it = It is happening... isn't it? I voted remain but... = Pffff, yeah, sure you did mate Something something, youth unemployment, something = I don't know the difference between causation and correlation. 
Did Labour put their 'six tests' for a Brexit deal before the British electorate just over one year ago at the 2017 General Election? No, they most certainly did not! None of the existing Labour MPs were elected on the basis of these six tests. Labour are pulling a fast one. 
Based on a @SkyNews poll.Do you believe Jeremy Corbyn would be competent to negotiate brexit? Retweet and vote ! Taking poll requests - just reply! 
Whilst we can all pretend that the Labour cavalry can be heard preparing to charge over the hill and join the anti-Brexit fight; the reality is that the Labour cavalry are still ambling around the field of battle wittering about the state of the stage coaches. 
The Prime Minister has refused to have a public inquiry. Instead her office tried to cover it up by outing me and with the help of a network of pro hard-Brexit organisations, because it implicated so many senior officials and MPs.  
Sublime.Remember, Brexit-Loons want us reliant on this fucking bin bag of rotting offal.  
Britain's millionaires are more concerned about the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn becoming PM than anything else, according to their lawyers and tax advisers. Contingency planning for a Labour government has now surpassed any for Brexit, they say

Brexit was a good conspiracy - whilst it lasted. Now its reversal will take the Tories down, and restore British democracy 
As anyone who knocked on doors during the referendum knows, Remain support is soft, Brexit support is firm.   
Here's a mad idea - why don't we just cancel this shitshow of a psychodrama and get back to whining about the weather and passive aggressively muttering 'you're welcome' to strangers who don't say thank you, and then we'll just all be NORMAL fucked up again? #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Theresa May has said that a no-deal Brexit will be better for the UK than any Canada-style free trade agreement.Experts have said that No Deal will be utterly disastrous for the UK. PM is now taking us on a very dangerous path that will lead to maximum destruction #BrexitShambles

I was in a pub in Central London this evening. A chap in front of me ordered a pint of Fosters so I said loudly "I'm too ashamed by brexit to drink a British beer. Make mine a pint of Pravha." The whole place erupted with cheering and applause. I had several offers to pay for it. 
On C4 News ardent Remainer Jon Snow talked to ardent Remainer Zoe Williams and ardent Remainer Matthew Parris about Brexit. They all agreed that March 29th departure was now "out of the question". Why is this degree of bias tolerated on a TV news outlet? Does it break no rules? 
As Labour members are overwhelmingly pro-remain, why doesn't the party just call for Brexit to be stopped? At least this would give a clear line between Labour and Tories - in a general election which looks increasingly on the cards.   
I'm intrigued as you why she's appearing on your show. You've got a scoop getting her on. Fellow BBC'er @BBCGaryR has been trying to get her. Party say Ruth's not available for weeks to answer questions on #DarkMoney bigoted, racist MSP's, Brexit flip flopping etc  
The cabal government of the UK hasn't left the European Union, nor does it have any intention of doing so. Maybe they should take a referendum to see what the people think? #Brexit 
Labour Brexit policy:More positions than a broken compass at the North pole...#YouCantTrustLabour #Lab18 
Very much looking forward to this years #CPC18. This conference will be the #Brexit Conference! I am honoured to be speaking alongside some fantastic #Brexiteer MPs, at events for @LeaveMnsLeave @BrexitCentral @bowgroup @BrugesGroup @tfa4freedom . Together let's #StandUp4Brexit 
Me too! Thanks to listening to that pair & @acgrayling @RCorbettMEP @nick_clegg @EveryCountry & so many others i've heard at events organised by our local groups. AND the more I learn, the more conviction I have that #Brexit will be an ABSOLUTE UNMITIGATED NATIONAL DISASTER.  
.@drivet1411 here voted leave. She wanted to help the NHS which she values highly. She changed her mind soon after #EURef when she realised #brexit politicians had misled the public re additional funding. She is a #RemainerNow@drivet1412 thanks for speaking up!#PeoplesVote 
"I'm working in the national interest ... It's not in the national interest to have a general election." The Prime Minister is asked by Channel 4 News political editor Gary Gibbon what will happen if she loses the vote in Parliament on the Brexit deal.  
Labour delegates back Keir Starmer push for public vote on Brexit  
Alan is right. She is absolutely determined to push Chequers through. When that fails, is the plan to call another Referendum? What is her game plan here?  
Lady Nugee joined the rest of the Muppets on THE MUPPET SHOW IN LIVERPOOL today. She was siding with the rest of the Leftie clowns trying to scupper Brexit and get a 2nd referendum. This isn't a Conference it's an all-out attack on Democracy, this so called Party are a disgrace. 
Labour's Brexit plan: to have an illusion of a plan, not an actual plan | John Crace  
True story.After a stroke my grandad was left chair-bound and ordered never to smoke. One day grandma came homeHave you been smoking?NoThen why is your chair on fire?... It was on fire when I sat in itWe are now at the "it was on fire when I sat in it" stage of Brexit. 
May is desperate to stop a meaningful Brexit. Once you understand and accept that it all makes sense. Now, WHY is she still Leader of the Conservative party?  
Happily will also make glum reading for the Brexit ultras who want to replace our PM with the great charlatan & discount Donald. Suspect they won’t be publicising it much 
FOREIGNERS we can now confirm after 29th March 2019 it will be illegal to be a foreigner in the UK. All foreigners must report to their local deportation centre before 29th we will pay for your ticket home. Thank you for your contribution to the UK.#Brexit #NoDealBrexit 
The Tories are never going to allow a referendum on Brexit.  
This next bit gets us a #PeoplesVote and then we win that and rescue the country.We will and are putting absolutely everything into stopping Brexit and anything you can do to help us along is gratefully received. 
Analysis @lewis_goodall asks what are Labour playing at with ambiguous Brexit policy?  
PM 'No-deal' Brexit better than Canada-style one.With 'No Deal' we would trade on WTO tariffs & be £8,000,000,000 a year BETTER off.What shall we spend it on?It is the equivalent of £12.3m per year to all 650 constituencies.#HappyDays#BrexitBonus 
Please read this to understand how the UK and Brexit is seen in another country, in this case Japan, and what it means for future UK policy. At this time more than most the UK needs serious specialists like @pernilleru - thanks for sharing your experience

Britain's truck drivers are warned there may not be enough permits to travel to the EU if there's no Brexit deal  
Is anyone else as confused as I am about Labour's position on #Brexit? As far as I can see all that #Lab2018 has really confirmed [re Brexit] is that Labour is as divided as the Conservatives.Depressing and worrying.  #c4news 
Mogg & Co may moan about Labour voting down a Brexit deal if it fails the six tests, but they should realise that those tests only reflect the promises made by their Leave campaign. If you can't deliver the deal you promised; don't complain if it's rejected. #PeoplesVote 
A significant moment. @uklabour grassroots + trade unions tonight back new clear policy on #Brexit. We will oppose no deal, oppose a reckless Tory deal or blind #Brexit - we want a GE but if not possible - we need a *public vote* where #Remain is an option. @peoplesvote_uk #Lab18 
BBC News - Jeremy Corbyn: More EU talks if MPs reject Brexit deal  The assumption that EU27 would be happy to stop the clock & renegotiate an already agreed Withdrawal Agreement (which already deals satisfactorily with Art. 50 issues) is quite heroic

.@conormurphysf “Those who are hard Brexiteers now see the Good Friday Agreement as a threat to Brexit. In reality, Brexit is a threat to the agreed principles of the Good Friday Agreement and the rights it underpins.” 
If the people in power keep rerunning the vote until they get the result that they want, it will decimate people’s already weak trust in Britain’s governing institutions. A second leave/remain referendum reeks of the establishment hunkering down to defend its interests. 
Gisela Stuart seems to think that if there was another referendum voters wouldn't be free to vote leave, if that's what they still wanted. Since they would, it's hard to see any objection on the grounds of democratic principle.  
Labour backing a second referendum shows democracy is working beautifully | Zoe Williams  
Brexit means...Britain being the only country to ever vote for economic sanctions on itself. 
.@CarolineFlintMP says that the starting point for any dialogue is respect for the choice voters made about #Brexit in 2016.  The economic risks were laid out in the EURef and people made their choice. Now we have to move forward, not look for a device to overturn it. #Lab18

The biggest threat to our democracy is our own government. It has ignored the fact that the "democratic" referendum was so flawed it MUST be considered null & void. It has consistently refused, in the face of calls from significant numbers, to give us a REAL democratic say.

It's very nice of Labour to leave all Brexit options on the table, but how about choosing one and calling it a policy? 
Powerful warning from respected former Labour MP Gisela Stuart that Labour must not betray its leave supporters over Brexit - on the very day Labour confirm they will not respect the historic 2016 referendum result.  
 Message from a friend. She and her husband are planning on leaving Scotland to escape Brexit. They have a wee girl with special needs. I am so frustrated and hurt for them. Why is this happening? (Mark 13:18) 
Labour have managed to articulate no less than 5 different united front views on Brexit over the course of the past 24 hours. 
Angela Merkel has reiterated the rejection of the Chequers proposals saying the UK “can’t belong to one part of EU common market but not to the other three”. The EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has informed MEPs that #Brexit talks were “frozen”.  
1. This is a hopelessly muddled article. By what logic does Ms. Stuart conclude that giving people the right to another referendum would amount to "overturning" the first one?  Doesn't she trust them to decide for themselves?  
'Deal' was NOT on the ballot paper at the EU Referendum in 2016. The Question was 'Leave', or 'Remain'.Get it? 
Forget Brexit, we’ve got a Beluga! Whale spotted in Britain’s River Thames

German poll: “Should the EU be prepared to make big concessions in Brexit negotiations?” Not just elite opinion. Not sure UK has priced in the long-term effects of humiliation/no deal of its own decision to leave the EU. Just saying.  
Must appreciate how far Labour’s come in just 1 yr. Until last Aug not even transition period was policy, let alone customs union, and even a few weeks ago had all but ruled out people’s vote. Now Corbyn himself mentions Remain. Brexit’s not dead yet- but we’re digging its grave

Comical Keir: Labour 'United on Brexit'  
EU officials are considering whether to extend the October summit of EU leaders by a day. I'm hearing it could start on the afternoon of Wednesday 17th. EUCO President Donald Tusk has previously described it as "a moment of truth" for the Brexit process. 
Ooh,  this looks like a fun game. My turn, Hi Stewart, I'm really interested in Brexit, and clearly parliamentary expense fraud didn't stop you getting your current position. What would? Would I have to have done something really bad? 
Twitter usually reflects the complete opposite of 'national mood'. Hence its collective shock when Brexit, Trump etc happen.  
We're a one stop place for all #Brexit related news at #CPC18.It's worth noting that there's another event at the #Birmingham Midland institute on 1/10/18 which is billed as the "alternate CPC" & it will feature MPs who have pledged to #StandUp4Brexit  
Jeremy Corbyn confirms Labour won't respect the result of the referendum, breaking his manifesto pledge and taking us back to square one  
Incredible news - Labour conference just voted to reject Tory Brexit and campaign for a general election or - if an election is not possible - a public vote on the Brexit deal with an option to remain on the ballot paper. We’ve just taken a massive step to #StopToryBrexit. 
MAJOR BREAKING: A Spanish newspaper has published the videos recorded by the Spanish police during last year's Catalan referendum.  
"I will respect the decision of the party and act accordingly."Jeremy Corbyn is asked about a second referendum on Brexit and how he would vote if it were held.

Labour inches towards another referendum. My latest Brexit Blog post on the Labour Conference, just up now:  
From today's @FinancialTimes #Brexit #PeoplesVote #secondreferendum 
Why does the PM dismiss Canada Plus?Is it because it beats Chequers in every conceivable way and she doesn't want to admit that she should have gone with Canada+ from day one.Irresponsible and wrong decision. Canada+ is the way!#StandUp4Brexit #brexit 
Labour has OVERWHELMINGLY voted for the Brexit motion at #Lab18. Huge move towards securing a People's Vote on the final Brexit deal  
5. You see these people's lives aren't bargaining chips and #BrexitIsPersonal. Most of us couldn't vote in the Referendum in 2016 so you had an extra special duty of care to look after us properly.  But you wouldn't even meet us. 
Close to perfect example of the epic confidence & profound ignorance that combined to deliver Brexit. Funny but also quite chilling.  
Labour leader @JeremyCorbyn tells @bbclauraK the government would have to negotiate again with the EU, if Parliament rejects its Brexit deal. #Lab18

Big cheer at #Labconf as Brexit motion carried by show of hands, showing overwhelming backing. 
New: Labour delegates overwhelmingly back Brexit motion which includes commitment to keep option of second referendum on the table. 
Brexit motion carried - huge cheers in the conference hall #Lab18 
Do we in Scotland want a no deal Brexit or a deal that sees us take back control of our own wealth? Sitting back and waiting for another country to isolate us from the EU! Voting for @theSNP & Scottish independence will negate Brexit, a vote for anything else will ensure Brexit. 
Here at Lab Conference with Prof Michael Dougan chatting where where on Brexit.  
A 'stop this insanity' referendum would be my first choice. 
Thought I’d take the opportunity to swim down the River Thames before I’ll need a fucking visa thanks to #Brexit. #beluga #firstoceanproblems 
An incredible response and standing ovation to @Keir_Starmer in the Conference Hall today. “Nobody is ruling out remain as an option.” The Labour position could not be any more clear. Oppose damaging Tory #Brexit plan and no deal. And back a #PeoplesVote #Lab18Fantastic! 
John, if you think the spurious guff that comes out of the dark corners of Tufton street will help UK business post Brexit then you are incredibly out of touch with what business leaders have been asking for. 
Theresa May today: "If they have concerns they need to detail those concerns to us, and if they have counter-proposals let’s hear the counter-proposals, and then we can discuss those and take it forward."Here are all counter proposals summarised in a single slide.#Brexit

My turn, "Hi Stuart, I'm really interested in Brexit, can you tell me where they advertised your job at the Brexit department?  Was the interview hard? Should I practice my handshake and winking?" 
Do you think @UKLabour should back a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain? #BrexitPlease RT after you vote for a larger sample. 
Brexit has exposed the entire body. Each day an item comes away like a game of strip poker which they cannot stop. Dirty money, dirty tricks, gaping democratic deficits, corruption, deceit, prejudice, immorality, selfishness. We must find better clothes to wear afterwards. 
4. Corbyn said 'I've done everything I can'-to sort out anti-semitism 5. announced new childcare policy of extending free childcare to 2 year olds in England that would cost 4.6bn6. In tone, less categoric than Starmer about voting deal down + another referendum (no surprising) 
NEW: Corbyn accepts Starmer on Remain option in @Skynews interview ... doesn’t dispute that Brexit might not happen in March 2019, though only after Deal falling and GE push 
Labour now has 3 positions on Brexit: out (Corbyn); ref with Remain an option (Starmer); postpone & stay in EEA (Thornberry) 
NEW A Canada-style trade deal with the EU after Brexit would be worse than a ‘no deal’ because it would break up the UK, Theresa May has said. Asked whether a “no deal is better than Canada plus”, Mrs May told reporters: “I have always said that no deal is better than a bad deal" 
EU nationals who arrive in Britain after Brexit will be treated the same as those from the rest of the world  
One MP rang the police on a constituent over a disagreement about Brexit. Such is politicians’ contempt for the public, they see even the mildest criticism as ‘abusive’, says @FraserMyers 
“It’s rare for a politician...to hit the spot with something truly unexpected & powerful. But #KeirStarmer’s embrace of the possibility of remaining in the EU hit that spot unerringly.” Good! #Brexit  
1. We've just been talking to Jeremy Corbyn - interview soon on @bbcnews - he tells us...1. Labour would force govt back to Brussels if deal falls in Parly2. He won't say if he'd vote Leave or Remain in another Brexit vote3. Denied Labour wd be breaking promise to Leave voters

The Tories are mocking Labour’s Brexit ambiguity but what they really wanted was the party to back a second referendum. 
EU parliament is making life harder for UK-based financial firms to do business after Brexit—they’d need to open a unit in EU to underwrite stocks and bonds and do market-making business for clients in EU, like any other non-member country financial firm  
This Tory MP was so owned it’s almost worth the price of Brexit by itself 
I’ll ask for u as well ‘Eh, Stewart. How did you land that tasty special advisors gig at the Brexit department after you were ousted as an MP? Are such jobs available to people without crony connections’? Asking for a mate 
This was the moment the end of Tory Brexit hove into view.The end of the the Brexit sh*tshow, bestowed by the Tories on their country, is in sight.Patriots - get behind @UKLabour and wrest British democracy from the grip of  a treasonous Conservative Party. 
Women have been severely underrepresented in the Brexit debate, and yet the latest research shows they are most likely to bear the brunt of Brexit.The wonderful @ayeshahazarika MBE speaking at our launch event explains why women deserve a #PeoplesVote

If the SNP turn their mixture of Brexit policies into a clear strategy....They could denounce the growing chaos of the Brexit talks... It would be strong and coherent.  It would show that Scotland is not just standing by as the Brexit process implodes.   
The Tories’ Brexit divisions next week will make Labour’s look like a tea party. 
How dare you claim to speak for me. A vote on the final deal is not a betrayal of democracy but democracy in action.Your government has had TWO LONG YEARS to come up with a way to deliver the fairy tale Brexit that Johnson and Farage sold to the public.AND YOU CAN’T DO IT 
EU nationals who want to come to Britain after Brexit will not be given priority over other nationals. Skill sets should be the deciding factor not country of origin

'Nobody is ruling out remain' says Labour Brexit minister. Well, apart from John McDonnell who did so at least THREE TIMES on TV/radio yesterday. Come on, lads, what’s the truth?   
Poll commissioned by the lefty @HuffPostUK backfires as it reveals 52% of the British public back a clean Brexit (Canada+ or WTO); 20% would prefer to Remain; just 39% of Remainers now have staying in the EU as their first option.Let's get on with it!  
Theresa May: no Brexit deal better than a Canada-style one  
Just embarrassing. This is the man who would lock Scotland into a disastrous Brexit and he doesn’t know on what grounds.  
Nigel Farage has BRUTAL response to Tony Blair's LATEST attempt to SCUPPER Brexit. Blair caused the death of 400 of our soldiers with his illegal war. Why the hell do people give him oxygen? He should be in prison.    
At #LabConf18 immigration fringe event @hilarybennmp argues for separate #citizensrights agreement, ring fenced from from what has been already agreed in EU/UK Withdrawal Agreement, in case of no deal Brexit. "For citizens this is a very specific moral obligation" he says  
Labour’s hopes of moving debate on to domestic policy lost in. A war of words and recriminations over the party’s stance on Brexit 
The chances of a second Brexit referendum just got higher  
Good catch by @VeteransBritain .  The 'European Development Fund' also exists.  But it's an 'off-the-books' fund totalling €30.5 billion.  Not included when calculating the UK's contributions to the EU.Distinctive #Brexit research & news daily:  
Eh, Stewart. How did you land that tasty special advisors gig at the Brexit department after you were ousted as an MP? Are such jobs available to people without crony connections? 
Six months to go and the Tories still don't have concensus on their #Brexit approach.Any #Leaver claiming they knew what they were voting for should take their crystal ball and get a job as a clairvoyant in Blackpool.#PeoplesVote 
*Brexit Explained*  
I agree with your earlier statement, it's important to have a second referendum, to make sure we the people are doing the right thing and we must have an option to stay in the EU if we will be worse off. This is the only fair and democratic way forward. #FinalSay #PeoplesVote 
Another storming anti-Brexit speech - and pro #PeoplesVote at Labour Conference. “You never accept a deal that’s worse than the one you’ve already got.” 
Erm , aren't you forgetting something? the ref was won by lies, it broke electoral laws.  People don't want this crazy Brexit, its madness. Only lunatics would pursue it.But keep Farage happy and Ukip vote if you wish, that's what your party is now. Ukip2  
This is an amazing opportunity for Brexit Britain. The Anglosphere is the future. Same cultures.Same language.Same income levels.Long-standing heritage links.Oh, and best of all, the same Queen!It's a perfect combination of truly matching countries.  
Kind of amazed to see journalists pretend there is a vast gap between John McDonnell and Keir Starmer on Brexit.This isn't rocket science. Just last week McDonnell put People's Vote on the table too! They're just NOT going to endorse a Referendum rerun. Simple.

Fantastic to see @elsieortong speaking with clarity & passion at @UKLabour conference on behalf of Newark CLP, women, young people, LGBT people & many more & calling for a say on Brexit. #prouderthanproud 
Argh - my picture of next speaker is blurred. She’s 16 years old and was eloquent, fully pro-EU pro #PeoplesVote and talking about Brexit damaging rights esp minority rights.  
Feel free to abstain. After all, it is a form of protest, and the right to protest is very much a part of British democracy. While I exercise my right to protest against #Brexit, I also support your right to abstain on any #PeoplesVote. See how democracy works for both of us?  
An excellent speech to #Lab18 by @elsieortong, in support of the policy change on #Brexit and our move towards a #PeoplesVote.Elsie's message was clear, outside the EU, I don't trust the Tories to protect my rights.None of us should. #Brexit is not inevitable.

Our response to Keir Starmer's conference speech. @GiselaStuart: "The Labour leadership must be unequivocal in its opposition to a second referendum."  
This kind of media commentary is putting bellows under the BS second referendum campaign while entirely ignoring that Lab is breaking its promise to the electorate as if that's not worth talking about. Slanted commentary, not just from Beeb but all the TV broadcasters.  
Everywhere you look, Brexit seems mostly to be being pushed by a small minority who are both quite powerful and very loud. Also, typically rather unpleasant.     Why is the country being held hostage by these nasty people? Why do so many apparently normal people support them? 
Also it was an advisory referendum so people felt they had nothing to lose. Most I know who voted leave wanted to give Cameron a kick. They really didn't care about the EU. 
This girl is so on the money, I feel the same way about this horrible Brexit farce, they have taken so much from us.  
arrogant idiots Macron + Merkel threaten stability of the transatlantic alliance with their vindictive 'punishment Brexit' strategyimportant perspective here from @wrmead 
On the BBC I discussed how Labour respects the outcome of the ReferendumIf the Tories can’t get a Brexit deal that works for our economy & our society, there should be a General Election so we can have a Labour Government that brings the country together  
Brexit transition period too short unless deal on table soon, says Merkel  
Ireland had a second referendum on the Lisbon treaty and got a different result. Anyone know if that is still a source of anger or did everyone just move on? 
PS it's only betraying 26.5% of the Ppl who voted 4 several versions of #Brexit, many of whom now regret it having seen the utter mess you're making of it. To deny it is the betrayalA #PeoplesVote is the only democ way to Confirm if the Maj Will is still 2#Brexit or #Remain

Dear Labour Party,Your total lack of clarity on Brexit is quite astounding.It really is quite simple: You should call for a second EU referendum with 2 very clear choices:Remain in the EU.  v Whatever the final Brexit deal or no deal is. #LabConf2018 #PeoplesVote 
 #Catalonia : videos of spanish police last year on their way to prevent the referendum. They chant "let's get them!" we all know happened next. Look at how happy they are at the thought of inflicting racial violence. Sanchez "socialist" governent has just awarded them medals.

Country of origin - South Africa - is written on the lemons which are in your own hand (at the end of your arm).  You are either illiterate or just another massive Brexit liar. ALL the fruit behind you is non-Eu obtained under free trade agreements with all kinds of places.  
Jeez Labour try to understand.If U force a GE you alienate Tory rebelsIf U offer a Tale of Two #Brexit-s you lose millions of #Remain votes & the GE.If U give the Ppl a #PeoplesVote with a chance to #Remain & #Brexit fails, the Govt falls & #Remain votes return - its win win! 
Lots of Palestine flags waved this afternoon at #LabConf18. But some flags may be more tolerated than others.One delegate tells me he was told by a steward this morning - during the Brexit debate - to stop waving a European union flag.

Here I am with @Andrew_Adonis  in #Liverpool at #Lab18  calling for a People's Vote. His father came to the UK from Famagusta in 1959. My father came in 1964 from Larnaca. Two Cypriots fighting to stop Brexit #wecandothis

Thatcher did not support Brexit. She said in her Bruges speech thirty years ago: “And let me be quite clear. Britain does not dream of some cosy, isolated existence on the fringes of the European Community. Our destiny is in Europe, as part of the community.” 
If there is a #peoplesvote, providing an option to Remain isn't undemocratic or disrespecting the result of the referendum. It is simply allowing for the fact that some may have changed their mind and don't want now what they voted for then. 
Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer  receives rapturous applause from Labour conference when he upholds:•“Campaigning for a public vote”•"Nobody is ruling out Remain as an option"  
Another delegate says he was told by stewards this morning to put away his EU flag during the Brexit debate. Now the hall is full of Palestinian flags. "There are double standards here," he says, to a few boos. 
“86% of Labour members want a second referendum. This is a party utterly out of touch with ordinary people’s views. Labour is more posh and estranged now than it was even under Tony Blair”, says Brendan O’Neill 
Does the Labour First Minister want the option to remain on the ballot paper in a future European referendum? I'm none the wiser. #FMQs 
UK's Labour set to vote against Brexit deal, open to second referendum  
In 74 we didn't get 2nd vote!'We had the vote & it were in and out.Why do they need a next one?We had a vote in 74 when they took us in.They didn’t give us another vote.We were never offered a referendum to extend membership of the bloc.'#Brexit #EU

Take a close look at these videos. They are unpublished images of police brutality in Catalonia during the self-determination referendum on October 1.   When you have seen them, please answer this question: Is Spain a democratic state? @Europarl_EN 
But he is happy to try and over turn or block the will of the Scottish people who voted for a majority of pro-independence MSPs at Holyrood in 2016 with a manifesto pledge to hold another referendum on independence should Scotland be taken out of the EU against her will?  
While Labour having its own Brexit fandango, Mark Francois, who is an officer in the ERG, confirms on #wato that they as a group will vote against May’s deal unless she ditches Chequers approach 
We are now running a liveblog on Labour’s Brexit policy so you can stay up to date with the minute-by-minute changes  
And influential Brexiters who won the referendum with a pack of lies hold democracy in contempt.  
It is the official True Brexiter ERG policy to vote against a Chequers-based Brexit deal, ERG tells me, even if that means voting with Labour (which Starmer has confirmed it would). Mark Francois was not freelancing on WATO 
If you work in McDonalds or similar and you lie to your boss or gained that job by lying you will likely face disciplinary action, maybe even lose your job.But if you're an MP and you lie to the country, gain votes from that lie, even win a referendum.. no problem. Nothing. 
Our speakers at our press conference today were clear: we won the referendum but the fight isn't over. #ARCMarch18 on Saturday is a celebration, but it's also a promise that we'll fight for #freesafelegal abortion access for everyone - no one left behind! 
You know what’s worse than a slap in the face of democracy? A socialist giving a slap in the face to the working class who will suffer most from Brexit.  
No, Bastani's showing contempt for the majority of @UKLabour members who want a referendum. He's supporting the governing class who want brexit. Bastani can support the 1% if he wants but he has no right to dictate to Labour members.

Life expectancy in the UK has stopped improving for the first time since 1982. For men & women in Scotland & Wales, & men in Northern Ireland, it declined by more than a month. Still, at least we have #Brexit ahead of us to improve our wealth and health. 
1/ At @labourleave fringe event at #Lab18, following a question by @NicolasHatton on #citizensrights of the 3.6m EU citizens in the UK in case of no deal Brexit, MP Graham Stringer made the false claim that 85% of EU citizens already have automatic right to reside in the UK now.  
So, what *is* Labour’s policy on a second referendum? Does *anyone* actually know? WATCH this to find out...  
If Theresa May is so confident in achieving a Brexit deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from then she should have nothing to fear from putting that to the test. #Lab18 
There is no”hard line” of the European leaders on Brexit but the unchanged assertion they won’t accept undermining the single market and they won’t.  
The BBC continues to suggest that supporting Remain/ People's Vote would cost Labour. This is the truth of the matter.Labour could surge towards winning power if they backed new Brexit referendum, polls find  
Dear all who are stuck on the Jan 26 merry-go-round,Try accepting the invitation in the Uluru Statement, walk with First Nations, gain referendum enshrining a FN’s Voice,Then there’ll be an appropriate body, with the appropriate authority, to discuss an appropriate date with. 
The Labour Brexit position.  
I’ll confess that not every Conservative agrees with the party position on Brexit. But, unlike Labour, we all know what our party position actually is. Labour Conference is descending into high farce. 
Remainer elitist Keir Starmer calls for a second Brexit referendum"Labour, Liberal or Tory, it's clear that if people want Brexit then they will have to vote for UKIP at the next general election." - UKIP Leader @GerardBattenMEP 
Labour government should delay Brexit by extending the Article 50 period, says Emily Thornberry  
Ok I am offering a free holiday ,a fortnight in the Spanish sunshine if you can answer the following 2 easy questions Articulate the positive case for the union?What is the difference between Tory and Labour Brexit Policy?  
If Labour does all it can to get a referendum with an option to remain (explaining to people why Brexit isn't the answer and working cross-party), I'll be Labour forever. Otherwise they lose my vote permanently until the MPs who appeased this madness are no longer in the party. 
Keir Starmer: 'Nobody is ruling out remain' in public vote on #Brexit  
What total bollocks. The hall in Liverpool is full of proud northerners - all cheering the death of Brexit.  
WATCH: Can Labour Party conference-goers explain Labour's policy on a second referendum? @talkRADIO 
It is extraordinary how one event - the referendum - could split and destabilise both major parties to such an extent.  
Doctors, Nurses and NHS executives have made it very clear that Brexit will be incompatible with the NHS. We are now entering into the unknown and with our Nation Health Service already under strain, we have one clear question for you. The NHS or Brexit? #BrexitBreaksBritain 
"Boris Johnson clearly identifies as Winston Churchill. That's a really worrying thing."@almurray thinks politicians need to stop comparing Brexit to WW2.  
Labour’s Brexit strategy: General Election or People’s/Public Vote first?...  
I have to say I’m not an avid reader of Conservative Home. However, this piece by ⁦@NickyMorgan01⁩ is absolutely spot-on. An #EEA-based Brexit has always been the only viable option. Well done Nicky, for telling it like it is!    
Len McCluskey, leader of Unite, has told me he DOES rule out Remain as an option in a People’s Vote, but says he doesn’t think Keir Starmer is trying bounce the party on Brexit policy

One of many sorry epitaphs to Brexit debacle consuming the UK: An MP, who should know better, is shown to beeither woefully ignorant or lying about EU trade & how things will improve after Brexit. And he hasn’t even bothered to delete his ridiculous tweet.  
Labour Brexit chief Sir Keir Starmer goes off-script and dramatically open door to stopping Britain's exit from EU - Evening Standard

One year ago we were still part of Iraq.. Oh shit we still are lol#Referendum 
BREAKING -  Brexit select committee chair @hilarybennmp says UK and EU must ring-fence the existing agreement on #CitizensRights in the case of no-deal #Lab18 
Narrator: It is, of course, and always was Labour policy not to rule anything out other than a No Deal Brexit, so the whole Front Bench - including the Leadership - had to tread a careful but pragmatic path in the face of hostility from all sides. 
Better than handing out 100'000s of P45s after brexit. 
This Tory MP was so owned it’s almost worth the price of Brexit by itself 
The #LabourConference2018 has shown that the Party is both in favor of AND also against 'Remain'. It is called 'Schrödinger's Brexit' 
Jeremy Corbyn would be "incompetent" in Brexit negotiations with the EU, a majority of people think  
It's not the EU doing Brexit.  It's the UK leaving the EU.  The EU are just following the rules.  Ironically rules that the UK helped to write over the years.  Why would they change the rules to help a leaving member state? 
We're excited to announce our first event! A talk/panel featuring speakers from across the political sphere.Our speakers will outline what a successful #Brexit would look like.There's no charge for entry, just make sure you get your tickets here:  
It's already been said, but if any government was competent enough to deliver Brexit, it wouldn't.  
If he re-instates democracy by enabling us, the people, to reverse Brexit if that be our wish, then his contribution will be nothing less than historic.   Those saying we cannot be allowed a vote & must accept whatever we get, whether we want it or not, are anti-democratic.  
Watching the Brexit debate at Labour conference. With every speech we are confirming our status as a middle-class, London-centric, uber-liberal, youth-obsessed party. As I heard someone say last night, we are handing a P45 notice to every Labour MP in the north & Midlands. #Lab18 
'Nobody is ruling out Remain as an option'The moment Keir Starmer gets a standing ovation at #Lab2018 for saying Brexit could still be stopped. Read more:  
And as an aside: notice how the TV news cameras were too busy focusing on the reaction of fringe Labour Leavers to cotton on to what was happening at first? If that isn't media coverage of Brexit in a nutshell...

 We had a #PeoplesVote in 2016 It was the largest democratic exercise the UK People have ever participated in. 1,269,501 more People voted Leave than Remain 80+% of People voted for parties committed to Brexit in 2017Brexit is democracy in action. #KeepCalmAndBrexit 
So Keir Starmer leaves open the option of Remain AND an extension to Article 50He has no place being the Shadow #Brexit Secretary when he is actively subverting the 2016 referendum result#StandUp4Brexit 
As Lab leadership adopts Vicky Pollard approach to its #peoplesvote position - 'yes but no but yes but no' - latest no deal #Brexit guidance from govt is planes will need to avoid EU airspace until same people who delivered no deal in 1st place find a fix.  No wonder UK despairs 
If Referendum fails, it will not herald cataclysmic scenarios of SDSM & USA-EU. It is a propaganda b/s. Rather it will indicate shift of peoples priorities: clean crime-corruption first, integration second. It's cataclysmic only for neo-stabilocrats & their sponsors. 
It's not attacking Corbyn if you question Brexit. I question Brexit BECAUSE of the values I share with Corbyn!#Lab2018 #LabourConference2018 
What kind of Brexit would you like [place your cross in one box only]:1. "I don't understand all the faffing about why don't they just get on with it?" 2. "Corbyn done it it's all his fault" 3. "Brexit McBrexitface"   
Keir Starmer launched an unexpected Brexit zinger – and it hit the spot | Martin Kettle  
.@UKLabour ´s new Brexit ´policy’ will alienate the 17.4m who voted to leave the EU in 2016, (many in key marginal seats) without attracting the support of hardcore Remainers. It’s a worst of all worlds fudge that I fear will do great harm to the party electorally. 
Not convinced the #EU is the future I want for my kids. The UK fares better already, and we can do even more when we're independent from the EU's rules and business can flourish #Brexit #BestforBritain 
The truth @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is that the marginal victory in the 2016 referendum was obtained by the side that demonstrably broke many laws and was won by deception which you were, and still are, at the heart of whilst attempting to avoid all responsibility for this #brexitshambles 
We've got a long way to go, and there are still endless obstacles - political, technical, diplomatic, legal - to stopping Brexit. We'll need to rely on the goodwill of EU27, and keep working our arses off to sell it to the UK public. We may not even be able to avert it. 
a second referendum but you're banned from taking part if you've got a twitter account 
This must be Labour's 126th Brexit policy. Don't worry, if you're somebody that doesn't like it, there will be plenty more coming your way...... 
A year ago, those who thought Brexit could be stopped were seen by mainstream opinion as deluded. Both major parties were committed to executing Brexit. The BBC used 'when' not 'if' the UK leaves the EU as a matter of policy. Nobody had heard of a #PeoplesVote / #FinalSayForAll. 
If there is a snap GE be interesting if the @theSNP manifesto promised the end of the Union rather than faffing about with another referendum. Thoughts? 
Hmm ... So let me get this straight ...The reasons why you won the referendum all turn out to be lies, yet you insist the result must be honoured because you won the referendum?That's like saying Lance Armstrong and every other cheating athlete should get their medal back. 
Last year @Keir_Starmer said Labour must accept the result of the referendum from a “position of principle”This morning he said “nobody is ruling out remain as an option”Is it power over principles in 2018?  
UK's Labour to vote against Brexit deal, open to second referendum  
Today’s Comms Tip for #PeoplesVote campaigners:  put a human face on all discussions.Brexit is personal so let’s show how it affects people...not just fight about the WTOMake it personal, make  it local, make it realThe revolution will not be dehumanised #finalsayforall 
Also highly significant that Starmer in his speech said for first time Labour would vote against a so-called “Blind Brexit” which is a plausible direction of travel - signing a deal that doesn’t nail down future relationship  
Now that the Brexit conference debate is settled @Keir_Starmer @johnmcdonnellMP @jeremycorbyn you guys need to relax and wind down with a bit of fun Enjoy this wonderful Brexit film starring Richard Wilson and @GraceCampbell 
Campaign to call this vote on a vote on a vote Referendum ³  
The endless recursive referendum. This is just dim.  
I'm calling it: this is the beginning of the end for Brexit.  
Skwawkbox reporting the second deputy leader motion has been withdrawn over fears the contest would become a proxy war for Labour’s Brexit policy. The leadership are so desperate to deny members a say on the biggest issue of our times they daren’t hold an election #Lab18

Dear @jeremycorbyn Sir Keith Starmer is leading you up the garden path and your party to potential disaster over #Brexit robbing millions of working class people of the last chance of a #Labour government. His humiliation of @johnmcdonnellMP from the platform was extraordinary 
So: Keith Starmer says the Shadow Chancellor was “badly briefed” and “had got up early” and that’s why he “misrepresented” #Labour on #Brexit Perhaps the highly experienced People’s Chancellor can say if this characterisation is correct? @johnmcdonnellMP 
.@jeremycorbyn are you going to allow @Keir_Starmer to lose us the next general election by supporting a second referendum? 40% of our VOTERS voted leave!   #LabourConference2018

I'm not surprised you can't get your facts right, but you missed out a vital part of Keir Starmer's speech. He clearly said 'nobody is ruling out Remain as an option in a #PeoplesVote'.No wonder you are incapable of conducting Brexit negotiations, your incompetence is terrifying

Sky poll 'finds' Corbyn 'too incompetent to negotiate Brexit'. 1. The negotiator is Kier Starmer, you dummies. 2. CHRIS GRAYLING is tipped for May's jobA reminder that 68% of the population believe that polls are fake. (OK I made that up. Call it retaliation.) 
Delighted to hear that @peoplesvote_uk have got Keir Starmer to agree to a second referendum, potentially with the option of Remain [listens to crackling earpiece] which is primarily extremely helpful to Theresa May's hopes of forcing her backbenchers to not risk an election. 
"The Labour brand is being damaged by all those in my party talking of a second referendum" - great intervention by @BrendanChilton of @labourleave: 
Today’s ⁦@EveningStandard⁩ as Brexit-supporting Next boss warns about impact of Brexit no deal on his business & interview with Labour Deputy Leader Tom Watson  
This is absolutely bloody outstanding. The Labour conference rises to its feet as Kier talks about the need for a Remain option in a #peoplesvote. This response tells us where the country is at, the reality, not the bullshit trolls, polls & RW media. We want #brexit binned. #FBPE 
Labour’s position on Brexit still hopeless. An option for a people’s vote ... where there might be an option to remain ... is HOPELESS. But we’re moving in right direction &  momentum is with us. Now we need a million people on streets of London on Oct 20th, so please be there! 
“If we need to break the impasse we must campaign for a public vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option." Labour's Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer departs from his script to say Remain could be an option in any second referendum on Brexit.  
Spain has the obligation to respect the right to self-determination. Instead, it beat down the referendum and jailed 9 peaceful and innocent Catalan leaders. 7 more had to leave in exile to avoid political prosecution.  FreeCatalanPoliticalPrisoners  
Sorry but when is a vote not public, nor involving people? It’s a referendum. Whether you support it or not, “People’s vote” is a political label. Can we (the media) please grow a spine and not take instructions on nomenclature from politicians please. Here ends my ted talk. 
As I wrote in beginning of Sept, looks increasingly like #Brexit negotiations will go to the wire. Now even more so after the Salzburg Summit of Miscommunication. Concessions now only imaginable when backs well + truly up against the wall.. January anyone?  
My parents were @labour born & bred. They voted for Labour in 1945 right thru to the 90s. I voted labour myself from 74, I voted for Blair. Then came Iraq.Labour policies wrecked this Country, it's economy & reputation. Now they want to wreck Brexit..Vote Labour? Never again. 
Dear Keir Starmer,Here's some #TuesdayThoughts5 million Labour voters also voted for Brexit. Watch out.Regards,UKIPLabour, Lib Dem or Tory, if you want Brexit then you must vote for UKIP at the next general election.

Labour’s Brexit position = CHAOS  
Well this is a big moment. I hope the Conservative party will consider that they now own Brexit and every dislocation and problem it causes, unless they let the People decide.  
.@keir_starmer’s speech will go down like a cup of cold sick with the 17.4 million voters and 65% of constituencies which voted leave and won the referendum.Mr Starmer is advocating a strategy of electoral suicide.#Lab18 #LabourConference2018 
Labour are all over the place on this 2nd referendum issue. This in-out-in-out nonsense is becoming a joke, if they want to be taken seriously as a government in waiting they should probably have an agreed position on the big issue of the day.  
Judging by the reaction of the hall @Keir_Starmer is in danger of emerging as an unlikely darling of the Labour faithful. Far closer to them on Brexit than Corbyn/McDonnell 
UK's Labour increasingly likely to vote against Brexit deal: Starmer  
See a lot 'working class Labour Leave voters would never trust politics again' if there is a second Brexit vote. Strikes me as incredibly classist. I'm not necessarily in favour of 2nd vote, but idea working class voters are incapable of comprehending complexity is v reductive

Confirmed - Conservatives to uphold tainted referendum, in which a marginal victory was obtained by the side that demonstrably broke the law, to deliver a damaging low tax, small state, deregulated economy which will devastate schools, hospitals, transport networks and jobs.  
Labour have confirmed that they would take us back to square one on Brexit.@Keir_Starmer just told #Lab2018: "Nobody is ruling out Remain as an option". 
Does Labour want to share the fate of those who advocated a second referendum at the last election?  
Delighted to see Cabinet has agreed no preference for #EU citizens after #Brexit. Was always appalling that #Commonwealth citizens were treated less favourably than those from EU. 
WATCH: Shadow Brexit Secretary @Keir_Starmer receives a standing ovation as he says "nobody is ruling out remain as an option" if there's a #PeoplesVote on Brexit.  
labour's brexit position as I understand it -starmer: remain is an optionmcdonell: remain is not an optioncorbyn: I think there has to be a recognition of the rights of the Palestinian people to their own state 
"The public should be the ones, rather than politicians, to decide what is on the ballot paper."Labour MP Stella Creasy says if there's another vote on the Brexit deal, she wants the public to decide what question should be asked.  
Opens up some political space for the PM to try to coalesce her party around a “stop the second referendum” campaign... and will accuse Labour of effectively sabotaging negotiations 
Keir Starmer said it..if #Brexit deal fails 'nobody's ruling out a public vote & #Remain must be an option'.Not in approved script apparently.Standing ovation.Dennis Skinner's face a pictureNo doubt Corbyn, McDonnell, Gardiner McCluskey will do their damnedest to thwart it. 
What I love best about the chaos amongst our noisy political elite is that it was brought about by ‘the little people’ - 17.4million of us, sick of not being heard. #Standstrong for #Brexit

Sir Keir Starmer: "Nobody is ruling out Remain as an option"Shadow #Brexit Secretary receives rapturous applause from #Lab18 on prospect of second Brexit vote  
Excellent speech from @Keir_Starmer strong + clear @UKLabour will oppose no deal, blind #Brexit, + a reckless Tory #Brexit + that we want Election - but if that not possible - we will campaign for a *public vote* where #Remain an option. @LabPeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk #Lab18 
Standing ovation for Starmer after he tells Labour conference that if the PMs deal fails and she refuses a General Election: “options must include campaigning for a Public Vote and nobody is ruling out Remain as an option”.Feels like a significant moment in UK politics/ Brexit 
Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer has told the Labour conference in Liverpool "no one is ruling out 'remain' as an option" in a possible second EU referendum 
First Brexit came for the Irish border, but I didn't care because I am not Irish.Then it came for the ports, but I didn't care as I was not a lorry driver.Then it came for the planes, but I wasn't going abroad.Then I went to Tesco and there was no fucking food left. 
CONFIRMED: At #Lab2018 Shadow Brexit Secretary @Keir_Starmer has just said  “nobody is ruling out remain as an option”.Labour would take us back to square one on Brexit. 
"No deal would be a catastrophe and no government has the right to plunge our country into chaos because of their own failures" - Shadow #Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer addresses #Lab18

Brexit singularity.  
.@Keir_Starmer has today confirmed that Labour would break their promises and take us back to square one on Brexit #Lab18 #Lab2018 #LabConf18 
I have long suspected that Theresa May’s real Brexit plan is to rustle up an unworkable plan (Chequers), the EU rejects it and she walks away with no deal, blames the EU as “disrespectful bullies” and the media hail her as a Boudicca figure and tragically Brexit voters lap it up.  
Exports from the UK to Israel skyrocketed in the first six months of this year to £2.6 billion, an eyebrow-raising 75 percent increase on the eve of #Brexit.   
It would be neither rational nor righteous to respect the result of a referendum won on the back of proven lies, electoral fraud and corruption.No coincidence that the only people respecting it are either those who won or those believe respecting it is their ticket to power. 
We’ve never seen this kind of coverage for any serious Sikh issue: genocide in India, annual protest marches since 1984, referendum 2020, even the years of work of @RaviSinghKA doesn’t get front pages like this.Also this isn’t a ‘Sikh’ issue, it’s a disciplinary one.

My column in today's @guardian - why Labour should back a second referendum. Background to today's conference ding-dong...  
Piers Morgan calls out Keir Starmer for refusing to be interviewed.He has no answers on policy positions as Labour don’t know themselves. All they’re concentrating on is derailing Brexit to try & get into no.10 but with no idea how they’d run the country - except into the ground  
Here's what needs to happen.Labour supports another EU referendum.Boris takes over leadership of Conservative Party and pushes through Canada +++ or WTO tariff Brexit.Then calls General Election.Labour loses millions of core votes.   
The irony of French-made blue passports that cannot be imported to the UK because a no deal Brexit means that no trade agreement will be in place to allow the blue passports to enter the UK.  
The promises made during the referendum just don’t reflect the reality we now face and the dangers of a hard right Tory Brexit get clearer by the day.It must now be the public who have the final say on Brexit. #Lab18 
Thanks for your whataboutery response. And don’t forget a) vital US equipment purchases like F35 jets for our aircraft carriers are now hit by fall in £ and b) less £ in economy overall thanks to Brexit hit to growth = double whammy to defence budget. Jog on  
Sigh. We've already voted twice. 17.4m people voted to leave in 2016. This was then backed up by over 80% of the electorate supporting a clean, proper Brexit in the 2017 general election.  
Noise from both sides re. snap GE. Can't see it myself, Parl't is rammed with Remain MPs, they'd be throwing themselves at the mercy of frustrated Brexit voters. Strongly suspect, next GE, people will vote with the individual in mind, rather than party. 
The “betrayal” of Brexit is those who pretended they had a viable policy and then abdicated all responsibility to implement it- and continue to decline to provide any practical alternative.  
We had a great start to the campaign yesterday, but we still need your help! Please RT to all, so we can ensure @Nigel_Farage and his #brexit chaos mates don’t get free rein to spread falsehoods about the EU. #BrexitBreaksBritain 
Jeremy Corbyn would be 'incompetent' Brexit negotiator - poll  
A poll by @SkyData suggests 68% of people think Labour is not competent to negotiate Brexit while 25% think it is 
DIRE: 71% of Brits don’t think Jeremy Corbyn is competent enough to negotiate Brexit. Labour won’t even contemplate No Deal. Would leave country at the mercy of the EU!  
Can't wait for Brits to realise that the ferries and shipping is likely to be turned away from EU27 with no WA.  Pilot boats won't come out in Rotterdam, Calais etc and the Eurostar won't be allocated platforms at stations....  None of this is a surprise.  It's Brexit.

This is the core problem. Our Government is actively talking down the best way we have to exit the EU! The "all flights might stop" nonsense shows how Whitehall opposes Brexit and prefers Project Fear. ...  
Mrs Haddock is Czech and had intersting observation. Czechs are most eurosceptic nation in EU27. Originally some sneaking admiration re Brexit in Czech media. Over course of 2018 that has changed radically. UK now portrayed as out of control and on brink of disaster. 
The EU is winning with its policy of "delay, frustrate & allow no movement on the Brexit process" in order to get a 2nd referendum, as is it's normal practice when votes don't go as it wants. However, the resolve of the British people to self-determine their future is rock solid. 
Some strange alliances develop in times of turmoil - happy to see @PeoplesMomentum support @peoplesvote_uk with option to Remain - it’s the people fighting the Brexit elite folks! And @UKLabour must not help that Brexit elite get what they want. ‘Bermuda in the sky with diamonds’

Keir Starmer’s face when he’s asked to confirm Labour’s Brexit position.....  
There should be a general election if Parliament rejects any Brexit deal, says Keir Starmer, whose Labour Party will vote against it  
I *know* voting against May's deal is not the same as averting Brexit. But its a vital first step! Labour can only avert a full Brexit by being in power. Repeat: Labour can only avert Brexit while being in government.They can't magically avoid it while being in opposition 
The more I think about food and Brexit the more angry I am. It's like a ball of hot fury, incensed, apoplectic, rage.Which means I'm probably going to write about it.  
Corbyn: "The turnout in elections before 2017 among young people [in England]who had registered to vote was less than 50%."The comment from the leader of Labour, whose party condemned the 2014 Scottish referendum that saw over 90% participation, and calls that vote 'divisive'. 
Brexit negotiations have gone "very wrong" and Labour is leaving the option open to remain in the EU, Keir Starmer says

I can 100% understand Labour not wanting to frighten the horses over Brexit, as we will probably have to eat those horses after Brexit 
I used to think it was just the Tories who wanted a No-Deal Brexit to crash the UK economy. But I now realise it's exactly what Labour want as well. The government and main opposition are lunatics. 
Hang on a minute, why is @BarryGardiner not resigning from Shad Cab over Lab's 2nd referendum betrayal?  
If you are tired of listening to politicians about #Brexit , listen instead to Ian Wright  , CEO of @Foodanddrinkfed as quoted in today’s @ScotNational :   “The consequences of a no-deal Brexit for UK food and drink are starting to be felt already. The impacts will snowball,” 
Last week I wrote Labour won't support Brexit. "Corbyn is pro-Brexit, so you're being delusional," I was told by manyKeir Starmer speech today: "If May brings back a deal that fails our tests – and that looks  increasingly likely - Labour will vote against it. No ifs, no buts."

If the #Brexit agreed still has majority support, it will win a People’s Vote. If it does not have support, using a three-year-old mandate on pretty vague terms, to ram through something that is actually against the CURRENT will of the people, is the very opposite of democratic.

The world at this time may not agree with an independent #Kurdistan due to political interests but humanity prevails. @masoud_barzani referendum triggered a 93% YES vote which sets the mandate and roadmap for the future even if it is 100 years from now. #Powerful#TwitterKurds 
Basically: whatever you want our position on Brexit to be, just tell yourself that that's what it is. You'll be able to find a quote from at least one shadow minister to back it up 
Under EU law, after 3 months, EU migrants must be working, or, they can be returned to their home country. The UK doesn’t do this, nor does it register migrants as they arrive.You voted for Brexit because of uncontrolled immigration? Don't blame the EU, blame the UK Government.  
66% said they are “not interested... and just want those responsible to get on with it”Unsurprising. Brussels is trying to humiliate our country. Our PM’s £39 bn begging bowl got us nowhere. Elites are trying to thwart Brexit. Let’s just get out. Now.  
ONE THING!Thing 1: Devolution is working great! From today Senate will start holding sittings in counties at a cost of 50-60 million a day!Referendum come! 
We don't know what options would be on the ballot paper, or even if we would offer a second referendum at all, but we do know that if Theresa May brings back a deal we'll vote against it, even though we don't know what it is

After Brexit your laces will stay tied and your headphones stay untangled. It’s a matter of faith not science.  You just have to believe. 
Waking up to the news that Mo Salah won goal of the season for his strike against Everton. It's like Brexit and Trump all over again. The general public cannot be trusted. 
Sorry folks, Keir Starmer failed the opportunity to give clear answer on whether Brexit a bad thing on @BBCr4today. He did the clever lawyer job, not the political leader job 
So many of the British public agree John. There's now a great swathe of people who feel unrepresented by any political party. If there is a General Election they may waste their vote as a protest or if there is another Brexit Referendum they will not bother. What's the point?  
An informed EU referendum... Remain wins... The UK economy recovers... All this shit goes away! 
.@Keir_Starmer on #r4today says Labour position is ‘referendum if no General Election’. But he’s unable to promise Labour will push for #PeoplesVote with option to #Remain.He’s clearly doing his best, in the circs of the Labour party, but it’s all for us all still to push for 
‘We are only in this position because of the failure of the prime minister’s negotiating strategy,’ says Keir Starmer on @BBCr4today Wrong, we are in this mess because of Brexit iself, which is impossible as a policy without massive self harm 
So Labour won’t rule out a second referendum on remaining in the EU. They have no interest in listening to the 68% of voters in Walsall North who voted Leave; they’ve abandoned the people of the Black Country.

The second of Labour’s six tests that any Brexit deal must pass: “Does it deliver the ‘exact same benefits’ as we currently have as members of the SM & CU?” This would see the party voting against the Chequers proposal. And its own proposal. What a farce.

Mogg is holding the country in contempt. It was an advisory referendum not mandatory which was corrupted by CA with help from FB. The Leave campaign was illegal. The Brexit Tories told outright lies. To bully the public into accepting this corrupt referendum is outrageous

The hypocrisy of the people's army. UKIP MEPs Paul Nuttall and his girlfriend Louise Bours - still drawing massive salaries, still in line for six figure golden handshakes post Brexit and currently not doing anything at all

It better have a Remain option. Or is this another semi-assurance to keep stringing us along? “Keir Starmer: second Brexit vote could contain remain option  
Labour’s Brexit policy: 1. Anything except Remain will fail their “6 tests” 2. Vote against May 3. Demand General Election, fail 4. Demand #PeoplesVote their members voted for, yet Corbyn/McDonnell don’t want; fail 5. Then what? Back May’s deal, or no deal? It’s chaos 
FFS. @BBCr4today yet again giving another one of the architects of the #Brexit disaster - Iain Duncan Smith - large amounts of air-time. No.1: Why? And No.2: Why isn't anyone reminding Duncan Smith that, when it came to the crunch, he had NO PLAN? 
#Brexit Can we have a day without Brexit bashing please. Same bloody bores, out on TV & Radio crying everyday     . We’re leaving the EU, give it a rest. Theresa May get on with it grow a backbone, stop waving white flag to the EU. Jeremy Corbyn stop trying stop Brexit.  
Good morning from independent Denmark, where UK news consists of a footnote about Corbyn’s muddled Brexit thinking and yet another snap election. How many Danes would exchange their indy nation status for a chance to be ruled by Westminster and dragged out of Europe?  
The IEA’s Plan A+ would ensure the UK doesn’t blow the great prize of Brexit, @RadoTylecote writes for us today

The Kurdistan Independence Referendum was my proudest moment as a Kurd, to date. Despite hundreds of calls to abandon the consensus, we pushed on defiantly, in giving our nation a chance to finally express their right to self-determination.  
V few political journalists flaying Lab for breaking its promise on respecting the referendum. Surely breaking such a pledge is a big deal? 
There is mounting evidence that Russia interfered in our referendum to get Brexit and weaken Europe's resistance to Putin's expansionist plans & corruption. Our spooks must know what went on. Why is Mrs May preventing the truth coming out?  Where is UK's Robert Muller?  
Labour to vote against PM's Brexit deal, says Sir Keir StarmerGood news that Labour will not allow us to be scammed with a blind Brexit 
You want proof Labour no longer represents the working classes? 90% Party members would vote Remain - but 37% Labour voters voted Leave. And now these members set the Party’s stance on Brexit. This is rotten from the core  
So, in a no deal Brexit under WTO rules, UK would have to charge tariffs on all this fruit and veg and prices in the shops would likely increase, right? 
If you ever see a uk truck on foreign plates ( mostly NL ) it’ll probably be to get around the nightmare of permits post brexit .. there is a big increase- companies are beginning to register themselves abroad . Benefits of brexit .. 
Good morning from Liverpool! Big move by Keir Starmer at #Lab18 as he all-but confirms Labour will vote down Theresa May's Brexit deal (assuming she gets one). 
A no deal Brexit looks more and more dreadful as it becomes more and more likely  
Brexit is a total mess. And the blame lies firmly with our inept, intransigent and duplicitous Prime Minister who, through a series of mistakes, has led Britain to the point of a catastrophic no-deal Brexit.

Brexit awareness is happening.Was shown some Facebook this morning where Leave voting friends were sharing a petition asking for musicians to have a freedom of movement visa just for them.I suggested they perhaps campaigned for #PeoplesVote too Awaiting fireworks.... 
A great socialist in England gets it even if some socialists in Scotland don’t. Labour is entitled to oppose an independence referendum but not to veto.  
And what about all the Leave voters who were promised this lot, but are finding that not one single Brexit promise will be honoured? Isn’t THAT the real betrayal?  
Officially one year since the Kurdish referendum, September 25, 2017. Still no state. An unnecessary step that only took the KRG backwards. If it wasn’t for independence, what was the point? #Kurdistan lost everything & now the same failed leaders are back in Baghdad. Congrats. 
I have always said, right from the start, we have to believe 100% that #Brexit will be stopped. If there is political will, they will find a way. Your belief will spread to others, don't let a shred of doubt stand in your way... We can, must and WILL #StopBrexit! 
Today is the 1st year anniversary of the referendum for independence from #Iraq, where 93% voted in favor of an independent #Kurdistan 
UK immigration: No post-Brexit preference for EU workers, cabinet agrees  
A reminder as this Kavanaugh farce drags on: voters in Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are already voting via absentee. And Ohio early voting begins in 16 days. Do Republicans really want this election to become a referendum on Kavanaugh? 
The problem for Republicans is then, instead of turning senate races into a referendum on the court, they turn them into a referendum on Kavanaugh, personally. 
1/ Kavanaugh confirmation rapidly shifting, becoming referendum on fairness and future process.: Not fair to know these allegations well before and not share w/ GOP.  Not fair to NOT raise allegations during hearing if they were substantive; nor to raise them after if aren't. 
Major BLOW to the EU! Hungary sides with the UK and demands a FAIR Brexit deal

It wasn't "loud and clear", you moron. It was a wafer thin win in an advisory, gerrymandered referendum that was won with lies and illegal money. It achieved no supermajority, no consensus, and it's been a disaster because people like you had no plan.#PeoplesVote

Meet Daniel Kawczynski, MP for Shrewsbury. He’s a liar.He’s in Tesco when he should be in prison for knowingly and deliberately lying to us while in public office. He’s the epitome of Brexit. A fraud. Don’t be like Daniel. Have some self-respect instead.

Tony Blair should be prosecuted for war crimes. Now he is interfering in Brexit and demanding a 2nd vote to overturn our democratic decision. Blair knows everything about betraying our country: Iraq War, open borders, Lisbon Treaty, 45mins to destruction..

many of us want a Labour Government but not led by Corbyn & his cronies...you are backing people like Mcdonnell,Milne,McCluskey, Murphy who are determined that Brexit is going to happen even though it means a wrecked economy,falling tax receipts & impoverished public services  
The hypocrisy of Labour strikes again. For decades Labour denied  us an EU referendum instead signing up to more EU treaties with no public vote, opening UK borders to millions & handing over powers to Brussels. Now Brits have voted to leave Labour want to overrule our decision..  
Excl: Two thirds of Brexit voters just want to leave the EU and don’t care how - ORB poll; 
Labour chairman Ian Lavery: “We need to kill off the nationalists in Scotland and regain that great country.” Regain Scotland for who exactly and what reason? You already have our resources and install governments and Brexit against our will is that not enough damage for you? 
There was a time when an MP would be too ashamed to put his/her name to such blatant lies.Brexit, if it happens, won't mean cheaper food.It will mean ever cheaper politics.

Brexit the drinking game:Every time you come up with a viable scheme to Leave the EU have a drink.I’ve been stone cold sober for two years. 
Correct @Jacob_Rees_Mogg we do want to #StopBrexit & remain in the EU. Public opinion has changed. We see #Brexit for what it is, the destructive, crazy result of continous, bitter Tory infighting. You lot carry on squabbling but we as a country will not be taken down with you  
UKIP will be watching #Lab18 very closely tomorrow hoping delegates back a 2nd ref with an option to remain. They lost a lot of voters to Labour in #GE2017 because our policy was to respect the Referendum result. Labour backing an in/out referendum puts UKIP back on the map. 
UK PM May's ministers still fully behind her #Brexit plans: spokesman

They don’t care Suzanne because they genuinely think it’s a vote winner, because the Good Jews ( Israel Haterz) are on side and the Bad Jews ( nuanced) are part of a Cabal to bring down Corbyn. It’s pure Kafka. Did you see that in CLP vote Palestine came above Brexit &NHS . 
I think you're being generous. The Tory MP may be deluded but he's certainly telling lies. It's time to call out Brexit lies wherever we see them. 
Thanks to @IrelandEmbGB’s @AdrianGONeill for praising the work of our delegate @MartinWhelton for his Herculean efforts to ensure our language on no Irish border made it into the #Brexit composite at #Lab18.

Listening to the @UKLabour party speakers I cannot but wonder how all the pledges will be honoured while the #Brexit nemesis looms over, and will distract everything. You can do all you pledge but only if you are in government, you won't get there while you support Brexit. 
The results are in:74% of over 6333 respondents have said they'd prefer a general election over a people's vote/another referendum.After almost 40 years of Thatcher/Lib Dem/Blairism, the most important thing for Britain is the return of common sense Socialism.

Just when you think Brexit can’t get any madder there is this thread, which is perhaps the most brilliantly dispassionate reporting ever of the discovery of a parallel universe. 
Presenter: "So, Jonathan, UKIP are talking about abolishing the Assembly. There's some votes in that, isn't there?"@JonathanPlaid: "I think we should have a referendum on abolishing Westminster rule in Wales. That would be a far better referendum to have." 
Clearly, they can’t. Their incompetence is baffling - They’ll borrow money from banks but it isn’t borrowing because it’ll pay for itself and all the interest. And they want the Country to trust them to deliver #Brexit (if they can figure it out what it is beyond their stupidity)  
Not even one? Does your crystal ball let us know how many floods will happen after we Brexit?  
Right on, Brandon! Let’s stick with austerity, amateur-hour Brexit negotiations, pandering to the the money lords and wholesale privatisation (oops! Seemed to have repeated myself there). You go, boy!  Let’s go for the same ideology that caused staffing shortages in the NHS too!

Stella Creasy, Stephen Kinnock, Tom Watson, Chuka Umunna want another in/out ref. Hardly surprising given the fact they've tried to overturn our democratic decision to elect JC for 3 yrs. Jeremy, John, Len et al respect the Referendum result. I know who I stand with!#Lab18 
they just make it up and repeat it often enough knowing a lot of people will believe them regarding untruths about the EU &CAP as they are community leaders. I was shocked how they convinced many during Referendum that EU was ruining African farmers the exact opposite of reality!

Have you realised how battle-hardened we have become? Like living in a city being constantly shelled - by Brexit. We've forgotten what it was like when the government and the opposition actually spoke about policies, health, education, transport. Brexit swamps everything. Stop it 
This tweet isn't going to age well Daniel. One seriously real benefit of the whole Brexit scam has been the revelation just how appallingly ignorant, stupid, venal & corrupt our politicians are. You all treat the electorate with utter contempt.  #Disgusting 
Why are chunks of Remain making excuses for Corbyn, McDonnell and Starmer when now is a critical time to hold them to account for trying to enable Brexit?Do you want to #stopbrexit or maintain the fiction in your head that Corbyn Labour is pro EU?

Oh god this is good. #brexit  
Condescension doesn’t really suit you. But I’m used to it from #FBPE zealots. It’s the same government. Parliament voted to trigger the referendum. It voted to trigger Article 50. Since the election there have been all sorts of votes on Brexit legislation. Virtually all won. 
Welcome opposition from Labour to a blindfold Brexit - looks like an interesting speech from @Keir_Starmer tomorrow. 
It seems a lot of people need reminding the Cameron government is gone and the May government failed to win the mandate it sought for Brexit in 2017. Oh and no Parliament can bind its successor. Apart from that it’s a great observation. #peoplesvote

Daniel has it wrong way round. @Jim_Cornelius says EU FTAs mean import at 0% tariff. UK's draft brexit tariffs are same as EU, but have zero FTAs.Today = no EU tariffs 'cos of FTAsIf Brexit happens = high UK tariffs 'cos no FTAsBrexit is a protectionist racket!#peoplesVote

At today’s cabinet, there was general agreement it may be sensible as part of Brexit negotiations to offer preferential rights to work here to EU citizens (not free movement though).  Home sec @sajidjavid dissents though, I am told 
Starmer and the Labour front bench are a disgrace. Like many Tory MPs they are gutless cowards hiding away from the need to take a stand, cynically trying to keep Remainers and Leavers on board just long enough to win an election. #PeoplesVote #Brexit  
Theresa May talks about not wanting to split up her country. Funny that. The British empire were happy enough to do it to others, including my own. So let’s call it what it is: this is not the “Irish border”, this is a British border in Ireland. #brexit

I love eating so much I describe the weather by food.E.g. "what's it like outside?"Me: "Oh its definitely Stovie day"...or "Its a lasagne and salad day" Anyone else? I just love food! I won't survive a No Deal Brexit.  
In recent months a variety of Tory ministers have refused to meet with anybody but DUP MPs when they visited the north; Steve didn’t, he and Tony Lloyd took the time to engage with local community in #SouthDown so I’m not surprised he has a sharp #Brexit analysis re: Ireland  
Kate Hoey's view on this is sinister. Attacks on intellectuals for ideologically contaminating the population is characteristic of totalitarian regimes. Hoey is no totalitarian, but the #Brexit right, of which she is part, are promoting some key totalitarian themes.#PeoplesVote 
A rare stiffening of vertebrae in a Daily Record editorial, blootering Richard Leonard for "meekly accepting whatever Brexit disaster the Tories impose upon us", in his ruling-out of an indy2 ref:  
‘The Tories and Labour may want a snap election, but only a second referendum could solve the problem of Brexit’  
The thing about Brexit I find so baffling is that the Leavers do not give a shit about the country and their fellow citizens whilst Remainers care so much much about both that we are makng ourselves sick trying to stop the impending disaster. 
Just seen a poll which shows 26% of Labour voters would vote for a different party if it could stop BrexitSo let’s not go there 
That any rational political establishment would continue to contend #NoDeal was a viable or plausible option (whether to put to Plmnt or to advance in a referendum) in the national interest beggars belief. We are being led by utter fanatics. We deserve the chance to stay stop. 
'Remoaners' must wake up everyday hating themselves and this country. For once try having a belief this country will be a great success after #Brexit. You're making yourselves ill, the hate you feel inside for losing the Referendum is killing you. Chill out, and relax you cunts! 
The reason Labour are not streets ahead of the Tories in the polls is because their leadership are advocates of Brexit and most people (armed with facts) don’t want that. Labour leadership is the party’s worst enemy. 
There is no such thing as a 'jobs' BrexitThere is no such thing as a 'jobs' BrexitThere is no such thing as a 'jobs' BrexitThere is no such thing as a 'jobs' BrexitThere is no such thing as a 'jobs' BrexitThere is no such thing as a 'jobs' Brexit...

A real plan that delivers Brexit and control of our future - #PlanAPlus 
Spanish PM @sanchezcastejon today: "Independence movement does not represent a social majority in Catalonia." If he's so sure about this, why not to hold an agreed self-determination referendum? 
A Canada+ FTA is the only "Brexit model" favoured by more voters than no deal, & is twice as popular as Chequers.  
Correction. The customs union alone is not enough to avoid an Irish border. It needs single market membership too. The EU have said this all along.Don’t buy the Brexit hype: it’s a border in the Irish Sea or the customs union 
It feels totally ridiculous that after almost 20 years paying my taxes in this country I am being called a traitor because I oppose the result of a referendum in which I was denied a voice. 
Isn’t this a comforting narrative? The reason Brexit is going to shit is, apparently, not that those who led the campaign for it overreached, overpromised and had no clue or plan as to how to deliver it, but because of people like me who warned this was so and tried to stop it.  
Theresa May stubbornly & blindly sticking to Chequers. Reported that no Cabinet Minister challenged her. They are going into Conference with a policy that betrays the voters & goes against every promise on Brexit they made. 
Not on the terms of the final deal. Brexit has been voted on in the abstract, not in the detail. 2016 the question was like “would you like some lunch?”Now the question is more like “Would you like a dogshit and broken glass sandwich?”  
Labour has left us bankrupt every time they’ve been in power, so imagine their bright ideas for Brexit  
Thanks to @ClaireHanna for joining us from our sister party @SDLPlive at #LabourIrish reception and stressing the need to keep fighting for social democrat values and fighting any sort of border on the island of Ireland. #Brexit #Lab18 
We absolutely believe the will of the people should be respected, we’re just not sure that one arbitrary interpretation of the results of the 2016 ref REFLECTS the will of the people.If you’re so sure the will of the people is still for Brexit, why are you afraid to check?  
This meeting should be heaving. Brexit is supposed to be an exciting new project. A bright future. Our independence. People should be rushing to participate; to grab a sliver of credit. Instead, it’s a handful of cranky people in a tiny room.  
To hear him is to merely confirm my own experiences with teachers when my kids were at school. My son's class held a mock brexit debate/vote. When the result was to leave the 2 teachers berated  the kids (16-18) as racists and xenophobes and told them they should be ashamed!

Whilst I don’t think they are the enemy I couldn’t ever vote Tory despite what the far left thinks of me. And now they have taken over Labour, gone racist & shafted their members and supporters on Brexit I can’t in good conscious vote Labour. I like many are politically homeless. 
October 2011, Jacob Rees-Mogg told the Commons that “we could have two referendums. As it happens it might make more sense to have the second referendum after the renegotiation is completed.” We support him on a #PeoplesVote

Insisting a referendum result obtained by cheating and lies is democratic but asking for a referendum when people are better informed on what leaving the EU means is undemocratic? 
Exactly, Ireland was a negotiation between Irish people and rest of EU.  They gained opt-outs,  which ±65% of Irish accepted in the next referendum. Those Irish opt-outs are now enshrined in EU law. 
Also coming up on the programme @jamesmatesitv has the latest on Brexit plus our all female panel of Brexperts @lorrainen6 @hayward_katy @tinamckenz discuss the continuing uncertainty over the withdrawal process for businesses in NI (1/2) 
“The #LosersVote is a referendum for the few not the many” beautifully put @BrendanChilton @labourleave 
Come on Labour, get it together and push for a proper 2nd referendum. It’s the biggest issue facing the country for generations and the Labour leadership has been useless in providing an opposition to idiotic Brexit 
Packed out event tonight, standing room only! All about Labours Brexit position. I hope Westminster is listening- there is not an appetite for a second referendum! #LabourConference 
By continuing to stick so stubbornly to her widely derided Chequers sell-out, Theresa May has demonstrated how right @timothy_stanley was to write that 'The problem isn't the EU or Brexit. The problem is Theresa May's terrible leadership':  #PlanAPlus 
So he is respecting a referendum that was swung by lies and illegal funding that under the terms of the Venice Convention must be annulled !!....Brexit is a treacherous criminal conspiracy NOT "The Will of the People" !!#FBPE #StopBrexit #StopTories 
Concerns have been raised over an explosion of "red tape" post Brexit. Today I can anounce that freed from the shackles of Brussels we will be rebranding tedious bureaucracy as "red, white and blue tape".#TakingBackControl #GlobalBritain 
If you needed any more convincing who won Labour's battle of the composite motion on #Brexit here it is! Arch-Brexiter Kate Hoey declares she's 'delighted'.If you want a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay referendum leading to #ExitFromBrexit then join #LibDems#LabourConference2018 
"Cake and cherries may be delicious for the British, but they are lethal for the EU. Even a no-deal Brexit, painful though it would be for EU member states, would be better than this." This is why the UK is staring no-deal Brexit in the face.   
Another Brexit dividend: if the UK market diverges from the EU, we may stop getting certain consumer products. When I lived in Canada, many products were not available as no distributor channel existed. While selling to a market of 500m rich consumers makes sense, 60m may not. 
So we should absolutely respect the referendum vote according to vote, but calling for a general election now is okay? By that logic shouldn't we 'respect the vote' of the last one and wait for the term to end? 
Boris Backs IEA's Alternative Brexit Plan  
BREXIT UPDATE:The PM, who wanted to remain, insists we’re leaving, even though her plan to leave has been rejected by everyone.The opposition insist we’re leaving, despite that being Government policy, though they might now give the voters a say on how we leave.Clear? 186 days 
Leavers are under the impression that in 100 years time there will be a public holiday on June 23rd to commemorate the Referendum whilst children dress up as there favourite brexit characters by wearing Mogg and Farage masks and reciting the racist tenets of UKIP.  
What do you think of @UKLabour's recent #Brexit policy proposals?RT Poll after you vote for a larger sample. 
Both Labour Remain campaigners and the shadow Brexit secretary have dismissed John McDonnell's comments.  
And I'm trying not to soapbox, but lord can we stop pretending the referendum wasn't held and misogyny won? Because hi, hello, we can't fix the problem until we fucking admit is exists. Let me get offline, because I'm mad as hell and it is only Monday. 
We have a "referendum on the humanity of women" every year in America. Hell every day. And every time the answer is the same, women, especially women of color, especially Black and Native women are seen as disposable. By the state, by communities, by damned near everybody 
Ok so Brexit is about ‘taking back control’ but the reason it’s not going well is because the EU ‘isn’t coming up with alternatives’. Seriously?  
I'm lowkey fascinated (and already writing a chapter about this) but this idea that it isn't a referendum on the humanity of women until a white woman's character is impugned is irritating as hell. Hi, hello, history wants a word with y'all. 
The only Brexit analysis you need this year.   
Delingpole: Suddenly Britain’s Brexit Future Looks a Whole Lot Brighter…  
Ruth Davidson says that if Nicola Sturgeon tries to call another independence referendum she’ll her to ‘sling your hook, love’ 
Here’s a scenario.Parliament revoke article 50 without any referendum, because its best for the country, that is their fucking job and we don’t live in a plebiscite.  
Why is it ok to have a General Election 2 years after the last one when there was no cheating or overspending but not ok to have a rerun of a referendum where one side cheated, over spent, and told lies. The issue of a people's vote is not uncomplicated but it can't be dismissed  
Nothing I’m gonna love more than a big oul referendum happening in the 26cs to decide if they think I’m Irish enough to vote in the presidential elections  
You have to hand it to Keir Starmer, this is a superb exposition of how to avoid saying anything of any substance on a #PeoplesVote Entirely consistent, of course, with Labour's history of their positions on #Brexit since 2016.Labour members have been sold a #piginapoke 
It's terrifying how out of touch @ChukaUmunna is with the working class. He states that working class families will lose £900 'PER WEEK' after Brexit. How many working class families bring home that much on a weekly basis? 
Had enough of people claiming that a referendum, in which a marginal victory was obtained by the side that demonstrably broke the law, needs to be respected, and anyone speaking out against that questionable result is somehow undemocratic.  
Apparently Macron is saying he won’t attend the October summit on Brexit unless the British have already made concessions on the Irish border. Quel horreur! Roll on no deal! 
The @ComRes survey of Conservative Constituency Polling has surprising results, showing a much larger shift of opinion than anyone had anticipated. MPs who shift their position on a new referendum are not just doing the right thing, but it is also electorally beneficial to them.  
Keir Starmer out of this badly, trying to bury points of high principle in ambiguity & waffle as if this was a legal dispute and not the whole future of the country in the grip of a right-wing Tory Brexit  
Today’s @Daily_Record editorial on Richard Leonard is absolutely damning: “His position is basically that Scotland should meekly accept whatever Brexit disaster the Tories impose upon us.” 
Labour party deputy leader @tom_watson, tells @BBCLauraK that Remain could end up on a ballot paper if there was a new referendum. And, do the different parts of @UKLabour really understand each other? #Lab18 
Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab pool clip with broadcasters after Cabinet: “We had a good healthy discussion. PM made clear we’re going to keep calm and hold our nerve and press the EU on some of the criticisms they’ve made but also that they haven’t come up with any alternatives” 
No country will be as affected by #Brexit as Ireland. Bluntly, for us there is no ‘good’ version of Brexit. I hope that our many friends in @UKLabour will vocally champion Ireland’s interests, so the Good Friday Agreement is not sacrificed in the final, fraught negotiations. 
My interview on #skynews earlier today (spoiler: I mention #brexit):  
Maybe we should just have a vote on whether we should have another vote? In the spirit of democracy, double down ... #brexit 
What bollocks. We voted to LEAVE the EU because of the EU. Obama interfered in the referendum. The EU interfered in the referendum. The UK government spent our own freaking taxes interfering in the referendum. The Russians had absolutely nothing to do our decision to LEAVE.  
No one voted for a US-style regulation bonfire environmental & worker's rights torching reality when they ticked that box on 23 June 2016. This country is being dragged into a neoliberal vulture capitalist nightmare and as usual the vulnerable will suffer. Fuck Brexit.#C4News

All that time with McDonnell after a speech packed with revolutionary ideas and all we got from Snow and Crick was Brexit and anti-Semitism.  You used to be better than this, #C4News. 
I tell environmental NGOs at @serauk rally at #LAB18 there’s no such thing as a green #Brexit & it’s time for them to get off the fence on Tory #brexitshambles & support #peoplesvote & #ExitFromBrexit 
Yet more EU meddling and overreach in UK affairs, with lawyers who won't accept that they lost the referendum trying to use legal loopholes to undermine and reverse Brexit.  
Endlessly frustrated by Labour on Brexit but Pound deserves credit here. It's worrrying that I'm impressed. Sad even. Sad that simple, baseline competence on Northern Irish issues is now so unusual as to be revelatory when coming from those claiming to speak for her borders.  
Come on @johnmcdonnellMP you can’t expect us to choose between a Tory Brexit vs a UKIP-style No Deal.... fight for the Labour movement and #LetUsChangeOurMinds give the people a chance to #RejectBrexit 
.@jeremycorbyn and his cronies need to wake up.You cannot have strong public services if you trash the economy – which is what Brexit will do.It is time for @UKLabour to back us in calling for the people to have a final say on Brexit through a #PeoplesVote. 
We will never accept Brexit: a crazy, ideologically driven, impractical, criminally tainted, pointless and incoherent vanity project breaking hearts, families & our country #RejectBrexit 
Ireland's dependence on Britain for imports has declined sharply in recent year. Value of goods sourced from the the EU26 have soared, while imports from Britain have stagnated. Brexit likely to be a factor.  
@YoungLabour4FS are campaigning on behalf of people’s futures, young and old. The reality is 9/10 labour members back a Final Say on the Brexit Deal. We will not stop fighting until we get it. #RejectBrexit #LetUsChangeOurMinds 
“Blair the preacher is back again!” @Nigel_Farage lets rip at Tony Blair as the former PM claims refusing a second Brexit referendum would be “a betrayal of Britain's future”  
We have a @Conservatives party hell bent on a kamikaze #Brexit and a @UKLabour dithering against its own members wishes.#DemandBetter for the United Kingdom.Join the @LibDems today at  
Well, quite. The reason Brexit takes up so much bandwidth is that it's existential - so much else that we can or can't do follows from it. It's everything; it's whether we can end austerity, it's the safety of the NHS, it's who gets to live here and where we get to live...  
In 2003, Massachusetts became the first state to legalize same-sex marriage. This November, the state is making history again by having the first statewide referendum on transgender rights.  
The Government should be sweating now. They should be terrified of every parliamentary vote on Brexit. But the official opposition just gives them free pass after free pass. Most people in the country now back Remain but neither Labour nor Conservative will give them a say. 
So if Russian cyberattacks and #CambridgeAnalytica were decisive with #Trump, what about the 'Petri dish' for that - #Brexit? Same dark money and big data at work. It was a proof of concept. When will UK authorities investigate @DamianCollins @tom_watson 
So while Brexit is absolutely not the only game in town, if we lose that one we won't be able to afford to play some of the others we'd like to. 
Letters - Tony Blair needs to come back – he's the only one who can get us out of this mess/#EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
It'll be difficult to do that in a country that has just bankrupted itself by leaving the EU. That's what bugs me. I'm all for social justice and the reduction of inequality but it needs paying for and Brexit is going to take the money we need for it.  
#RejectBrexitA large proportion of the leave vote was a protest vote about Tory austerity. The general public had no idea about the EU's importance thanks to decades of lies from the abysmal press in this country. People see the truth now and reject brexit#PeoplesVote 
"I voted #Remain but since the #EU were so rude to Theresa May, I want to #Brexit"Is the biggest load of tosh I have ever heard! And what's more, MPs are tweeting this codswallop.Then there is nothing to fear from a #PeoplesVote with a #RemainOption#LetUsChangeOurMinds

Theresa May's Brexit negotiations summarised: "I don't wanna chip in for the weed, i don't wanna give you a cigarette for chip, I don't even wanna give you rolling paper. But let me still smoke some of that spliff, I've asked respectfully." EU: "Lol, piss off" 
Disappointing in all that has been said about Brexit at #Lab2018 no heed has been made to the Irish Border #honestbrexit 
These Brexit politicians really are incredible. The latest in their assault on reality is to claim they're being victimised by time itself!! 
This survey was taken last Friday in #Wigtown, where the local public and book festival goers gave their verdict on #Brexit and what it means for Scotland.  
Sorry, I just don't buy this "If there's a UK/EU border between NI and the Republic the IRA will bomb you again" menace. Terrorists don't determine #Brexit. As Margaret Thatcher said after the Brighton Bomb in 1984: "..all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail."  
EU citizen who lives in the UK tells panel his rights are now in doubt thanks to a Brexit vote he couldn’t take part in. #Lab2018 
Anyone clever at making memes? Want a John Lewis one saying, 'brexit. Always knowingly oversold'

‘The people’s vote is a referendum for the few not the many!’ @BrendanChilton 
Narrator: campaigning for a referendum is not, in fact, an offence under the Statute of the International Criminal Court  
In 1993, the British public were denied a referendum on the Maastricht Treaty which created the EU. In 2016 we passed our verdict on this treaty. If we'd been given a referendum back then, the EU would never have come into existence. John Major has a lot to answer for.

‘The second referendum campaign is nothing more than a P45 to Labour MPs in the Midlands and the North.’ @BrendanChilton #labourconference18 #Brexit 
Finally, some sense in the #Brexit debate from a British politician. Please @UKLabour wake up and demand a #PeoplesVote. This is beyond serious for Ireland. 
Brendan Chilton says those canpaigning for a second referendum should be dragged before international courts for attempting to overthrow a democratic vote. #Lab2018 
It was remain in my country. Are we not equal parties in this Union? That is what we were told during the independence referendum.

How does a second Brexit referendum actually happen?  
A Canada-style deal would ensure that the referendum mandate of taking back control of our laws, borders, money and trade is respected. 
I get the impression that the City of London has made its provisions and contingency plans for BREXIT - if not, it should have! Most are far more concerned about the irreparable damage a strident left wing Labour Government could inflict on the UK economy 
"British workers deserved the same rights to be crushed to death by collapsing buildings as their counterparts in Bangladesh – and that Brexit could make the whole world about 10% richer. After several decades in which everyone was at least 10% poorer." 
According to @LabourRichard, there's no support for a second independence referendum...  
I think that much of what Blair says on Brexit is right. Trouble is he's toxic and his every intervention gives the impression that the "elite" are somehow meddling. 
Caroline, we noticed this too. Apparently #citizensrights are of the highest priority to the UK Govt. Telling those affected, the 3.6m EU citizens in the UK & 1.2m @BritishInEurope, the details of what happens to their rights in case of no deal Brexit isn't by the looks.  
Despite... Brexit?  
Yeah Jim, it's pretty fucking hard to gerrymander a referendum. Maybe next time we should go for the North Antrim model and have a single polling station in Larne. 
So I just got 73 quid back for 100 Euro. #brexit 
I promised myself I wouldn't laugh when the Government finally realised the consequences of "Brexit means Brexit and we are going to make a success of it".....  1/2 
Kate Hoey says she is “very pleased” with Labour’s referendum motion fudge and “delighted” that John McDonnell has ruled out a referendum on cancelling Brexit. #Lab2018 
WATCH | Classic @Nigel_Farage response to Blair banging on about another referendum: "What an extraordinary use of the word 'betrayal'. Surely the real betrayal would be to ignore the will of 17.4 million people in the greatest democratic exercise in the history of this country!"  
Hi Theresa.Firstly, over 16 million of those who voted Remain in the referendum are being betrayed as you fail to take account of their views.Second, out of those that voted leave, many of them have changed their minds two years on. See @RemainerNow or 
Tony Blair says refusing a second Brexit referendum would be “a betrayal of Britain's future”. For goodness’ sake Tony, Leave Means Leave! #FarageOnLBC 
Labour want to take over the Brexit negotiations. . But they don’t know if they want to leave or not?  And they’re not sure if there needs to be another referendum, to decide whether we should leave....or maybe....remain ?  
God help us all.Forget magic money trees, for now we are talking Edwardian London, with Mary Poppins apparently about to swoop in to rescue the Brexit Banks family.    
Moreover, the GOP 2016’s political platform explicitly recognized Puerto Rico’s 2012 status referendum and supported statehood. Twice in the last 10 years, Puerto Ricans have supported, with their vote, equality through statehood. 
While a Presidential candidate, @realdonaldtrump said that “the will of the Puerto Rican people in any status referendum should be considered as Congress follows through on any desired change in status for #PuertoRico, including statehood.” 
Do not go gentle into this Brexit blightAll ages should clamour for a final sayRage, Vote against the No Deal. Fight!Accept not that Brexit is our wanton fateMarch, speak out and to the fiercest endDo not go gentle into this Brexit blight*Sorry Dylan T#PeoplesVote. 
It's like nobody in Labour had anticipated that someone might ask at their conference what their position on Brexit actually is: even now it still seems to be the case they are all trying to work out something to say that doesn't annoy Jeremy. 
86% of Labour Members want a #PeopelsVote.90% of those would vote Remain.Yet Corbyn and McDonnell are trying desperately to save their dream Brexit.What the fuck is wrong with these morons? 
Latest from the Government's no deal papers - flights could be grounded if we crash out the EU.This is scary - and shows how unprepared industries AND the Government are for Brexit.BUT there's a way out. Let's have a #PeoplesVote on the final deal. 
So that's it - all 'technical notes' on no-deal #Brexit published and there's nothing on citizens' rights.We've got guidance for satellites, but if you're an EU citizen living here or a Brit abroad, you're on your own.Govt's priorities are all wrong. We need a #PeoplesVote. 
Of course Brexiteers can always relax in a Radox bath and pretend they’re in the Mediterranean. They won’t have to worry about foreign food then and engage in that annoying habit of repeating themselves thinking everyone speaks English. Stop this ugly Brexit. #FBPE 
No it wasn't. The referendum was called in the hope of one political party keeping itself in power by preventing the loss of it's more extreme members.#PeoplesVote 
Jeremy Corbyn couldn’t rule out a second referendum and today Labour have decided to keep the door open to holding another vote. This approach would take Britain back to square one – betraying all those who voted in the 2016 EU referendum. #Lab2018 
#Brexit: Disruption to flights possible under no-deal, government warns

"'No deal is better than a bad deal?' Give us a break" @HilaryBennMP says UK risks no-deal #Brexit "abyss", as government publishes new contingency papers  
"The #Remainers who want another #referendum hold #democracy in contempt.  They lost and they should grow up." #JacobReesMogg says "the people who are campaigning for a #secondreferendum want to stop us leaving the #EuropeanUnion".  @ConHome #StandUp4Brexit 
We need to properly acknowledge that Brexiteers initially claimed that warnings from experts and government reports were part of project fear's lies and now claim that voters knew about the consequences of Brexit and thought it was a price worth paying. It can't be both... 
When the leader of a fascist government thanks British conservative politicians for their solidarity with their cause, you've entered the realm of Oswald Mosley.  Be very afraid Britain. #brexit  
British government confirming, it doesn’t have time to “renegotiate” permits for lorry drivers in 'no deal' Brexit report. The industry says that will cause, "complete and utter chaos" at portsWhen I said this I was accused of scaremongering! #Brexitmadness 
Until today, British Governments of every complexion led the fight against European fascists and autocrats. The spivs and snake oil salesmen who sold Brexit seem to despise those 'British values' they claimed to care so much about.  
NEWS:The European Medicines Agency has said that 39 medicines are on its Brexit watch list, meaning they could be short supply after BrexitThis isn't good enough. This can't happen. Nobody voted to put medical supplies at risk.  
All the discarded solutions to me orbit around Brexit, cold and unloved satellites gradually losing velocity, until they burn up on re-entry, false bright stars in the Border night sky, and fall to earth as smoldering, misshapen agglutinations of worthlessness. I scorn them 
Lots of anti-Brexit supporters at the Labour Party Conference still going on that the 'bus of NHS lies' was the reason a people voted to Leave. But now apparently most have changed their minds. Really? Not a single mention of open borders and mass immigration though. 
'My piece for the @Independent on the @GraceCampbell Brexit Special comedy sketch you can see here. - You wouldn’t pay for a meal that a restaurant failed to deliver, so why should Brexit be any different?'  
Our democracy is too important for political games. We need to provide voters with the information they deserve ahead of this profoundly important vote, which is why I’m challenging Premier @jjhorgan to a public debate on the #PropRep referendum. #bcpoli 
This disturbs me. Members of the two main parties flanking a man who belongs to a fringe organisation whose manifesto includes Muslim only prisons, tax cuts for the rich and the scrapping of discrimination and equality legislation.This is Brexit.#PeoplesVote#FinalSayForAll 
"This is life and death to the people of Ireland."Shadow Minister for Northern Ireland Stephen Pound MP, discussing Brexit's impact on Northern Ireland and Ireland, says as soon as you've got "uniformed officers on that border", the "peace process is finished".

An important clarification.61% of Labour constituencies voted LeaveOver 60% of working class voters voted to LeaveLabour voters overwhelmingly backed a Brexit manifesto at GEto  LEAVE the EUWe don't want your  #LosersVote 
Tory MP's are rushing to support the Brexit plan put forward by brexiteers in a major blow to May. What they need to do now is oust May from power because she is never going to give up on Chequers..  
An honour to be part of and address the #MarchForTheMany yesterday. As I said, backing a #PeoplesVote is the right for our country, right thing for our communities, and the right thing for the Labour Party. #Brexit #lab18 
Will the referendum question be on the Brexit deal. a No deal? Be under no illusion: the People’s Vote want to use it to kill Brexit stone dead 
The second referendum campaign headed by figures such as Chuka Umunna and Anna Soubry is nothing more than a direct threat to our democracy and it must be defeated.The truth is these individuals have never accepted the outcome of the referendum.  
I and fellow Remainers take little pleasure in being vindicated by the gov in this way. No satisfaction either from humiliation of Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, who said just the other day that grounded planes were a fabrication and is now proved to be either ignorant or a liar. 
Laughter is the best medicine. Otherwise the sheer stupidity of it all will make you cry... BREXIT.

The Swiss know about referenda. They cannot understand all the fuss about a #PeoplesVote. After a decision in principle in one referendum (in this case, that of 2016), it is normal there to run a second one on the terms achieved, with an option to set aside the first result.

Luckily @DiEM_25 is seting up our own "war rooms" all across Europe - and recently in the US - precisely because, as Bannon himself puts it, "Brexit, Trump, the elections here in Italy—they are all pieces of the same thing"  
The UK Govt has released yet another batch of Brexit no-deal preparedness notes. We now know what will happen to "manufacturing and marketing fertilisers if there’s no Brexit deal" - but unsurprisingly no news on the #citizensrights of the 3.6m EU citizens in the UK 
A poll of 1000 members commissioned by an anti-brexit group does not speak for the Labour membershipI along with many more members are opposed to a second vote as we want Labour to win the next GEAnd implement their socialist policies which are anthema to the neoliberal EU  
UK-EU flights would cease in event of no-deal Brexit, says government  
Nobody should have to justify how they voted in the referendum, regardless of age, education or social class, everyone of voting age had one vote & were entitled to their say... that's democracy,  whether the losers like it or not. 
Today I debated an EU civil servant who was AGAINST a 2nd referendum as he strongly opposes countries being made to vote twice.BUT he then agreed that it's the UK "making" the UK vote, not the EUAND he agreed: it's far more democratic to let people see the deal before signing. 
"Fraility thy name is woman". (Hamlet, 1600)"Confusion thy name is Labour". (Brexit, 2018) 
British government concedes it may not have enough time to renegotiate permits for lorry drivers in 'no deal' Brexit memo. This would mean, according to the industry, "complete and utter chaos" at ports  
Funny thing abt the Brexit no-deal technical papers, another batch of which was published by govt today, is that the overarching expectation is that in the event of no deal there will be, erm, a deal. Here's a bit from the paper on aviation (full thing: ) 
It seems to be easier for us today to imagine the break up of the Union, the return of the troubles in Northern Ireland, food riots during peacetime, and mass deportations of citizens than it is to imagine the end of Brexit.

I’m now backing a second referendum – Jeremy Corbyn should too | Paul Mason  
I am left more and more flabbergasted by what is going on at the top of the Labour Party. I believe it is every socialist’s duty to oppose Brexit to the bitter end. It is a right wing project, driven by mean and vicious people. How anybody on the left can facilitate it baffles me 
Latest UK government no deal Brexit notices, including air transport, lorries, bus/coach transport, pets, trade in food, vet medicines, intellectual property, chemicals, car insuranceNothing on @The3Million or @BritishInEurope 
Quote of the day from David Davis:“It’s not just the last 48 hours - it’s the last 48 minutes or the last 48 seconds in a negotiation where the pressure really comes to bear,” said the man who resigned approximately 265 days before Brexit. 
I have written an opinion piece asking why, if there is "ample evidence" that the world would benefit economically from a hard Brexit, so little made its way into today's @ShankerASingham report.

‘Somewhat suspicious, I sought to replicate parts of his analysis, using the sources he cites.... I could not duplicate his results.’ This damning piece should be cited in response to anyone who says IEA shows road to a prosperous Brexit.  
Why a second referendum pledge is vital to Labour winning any snap election. And why last night's conference fudge is not enough...  
This is a campaign I have been focusing on since entering the #Seanad & one that @sinnfeinireland has led on for many years, with groups & individuals in the North & our global diaspora. It’s a referendum we must win, for equality, for citizenship, for #APresident4All

There is plenty of authoritarianism in the European Union, especially within the European Commission, which is why the EU is trying so desperately to undermine #Brexit and the free will of the British people. Brexit is the single biggest force for freedom in Europe today.  
An important clarification.A #PeoplesVote without an option to stay in the EU would be no real choice.@UKLabour must listen to its members and the public, and deliver a meaningful vote on Brexit - with an option to remain.  
This is fascinating stuff from @xtophercook.  He tried to use the IEA's economic model to replicate the results in its Brexit report today. He couldn't, and @ShankerASingham hasn't been much help in explaining why.

Brilliant News For The Conservatives.It looks like Labour will back a second referendum after all. The one that Labour voters do not want! The one their manifesto said we would not have!!Idiots, another million votes chucked away. 
Can you believe Corbyn supporting right wing Brexiteers, while MacDonald talks of taxing the rich.They just don’t get it, the rich Brexiteers reside abroad & are untouchable. They’re loving it. It’s families, the elderly and the poor who will suffer.Stop Brexit.#FBPE #PeopleVote

Well good for you. And for my part, I think you’re out of your fucking mind and I’m gonna fight this every inch of the way. If we can’t stop Brexit, the last day of the campaign to prevent it will be the first day of the campaign to reverse it.  
The Brexit motion agreed last night is a step forward. Whether there is a Brexit deal or not, or whether Parliament approves one or not, we should listen to Labour members and voters and back a People's Vote on Brexit.  
John McDonnell has been asked 2 questions in succession about Brexit:1- Kier Starmer made “Remain” option clear - does JMcD support?2- My small business & those I know have been hurt by Brexit. Can a #PeopelsVote even be in doubt? (to applause)McDonnell’s answers below... 
Labour vs Tories on Brexit 
This, by @Brendandonn of @FedTrust, is about the best summary I've seen of the current Brexit situation:  [Experience suggests I should add that doesn't mean I agree with every single word of it, or that it covers everything that could/should be said!] 
You should practice what you preach and not open up 2 offices in Dublin to take advantage of EU rules after Brexit! I thought leave means leave Mr Rees Mogg. 
Forget the #LosersVote, implementing the referendum result is true democracy in action. Anything else is a not-so-subtle attempt to subvert British democracy - a treachery which the electorate shall never forget! Support us at

Labour saying they will keep "all options on the table"on Brexit; what a farce. You've had two years to take a stance. They make it sound like some kind of Brexit Buffet, when what we need is an Exit from Brexit and a proper #PeoplesVote with the option to Remain. 
David is right. Let us hope Momentum puts some pressure on McDonnell to accept that any referendum has to offer the people the chance of staying in the EU. @CER_EU

Having promised the undeliverable, the #Brexit politicians will now whip up the anger of their supporters that nobody has succeeded in delivering the undeliverable. They'll use emotive words like "betrayal" to hide the fact that the undeliverable was undeliverable. Simples. 
McDonnell and Starmer are giving conflicting interpretations of what the *new* Brexit motion means....but only one of them is running the Labour party 
John McDonnell just said Brexit is a mess and a #PeoplesVote “could be on the deal, or it could be wider than that.”Good.

I think we need an election before a referendum. But if we are going to have a referendum, it better have all the options on the table.  
STORY: Labour's Brexit referendum COULD include an option to remain says Keir Starmer in slapdown to John McDonnell 
Point 1:Did you vote for Hard Brexit? As in no customs union, no freedom of movement? Did everyone? Despite Leave campaigners insisting there was no chance of leaving the CU? What did you think Leave meant? Was there a consensus among Leave voters as to what it meant?

I want to know how the hell Labour think that their own Brexit will measure up to their 6 tests any better than the Tory Brexit will. Clearly no Brexit can have the "exact same benefits" as membership.  
Democracy in action is a legitimate #PeoplesVote after an advisory referendum in which one side was charged with fraud. 
Sadiq Khant and his conference speech summs the Arsehole up. He was so adamant on a people's vote or a second referendum. John McDonnell exactly the same, and just listening on LBC to Angela Eagle and Kier Starmer all want Brexit to end. These must never be allowed to take power.

Labour leadership now support Theresa May on brexit. It’s just they’ll only support her in a referendum, not in Parliament. A mess created by the cowardice of leaders who sold themselves as being unafraid to stand up for working people. 
Fed up with being ignored? Have a destructive ideology you wish to impose on the masses?Don't worry, there's a simple solution: just call it WILL OF THE PEOPLE!As if by magic, your insane project is now legitimate, and all opponents are "enemies of the people"!#Brexit  
Brexit logic. The EU is a mean, powerful bully that's also so unstable as to be months away from collapse. The UK is an underdog who somehow still holds all the cards. And the people who oppose The People are simultaneously "middle class" and "elite".  
Dude on SkyNews just said that, in his experience, “time expands massively the closer you get to a deadline” & London’s need to play “multidimensional chess” re: Brexit. So that’s how well the talks are going: they’re at the crossroads of metaphysics and science fiction. 
NEW Keir Starmer - eventually - slaps down John McDonnell after being ambushed and followed halfway round Labour conference by Michael Crick. Says no one ruled out remain being an option in a Brexit vote. Full story very soon

Sajid Javid’s immigration proposal exposes the insanity of Brexit | Simon Jenkins  
One of the reasons I cancelled my Labour membership - and there were MANY - was the shoddy way they have dealt with the Tories mishandling of the countrywide suicide pact know as Brexit.The labour conference & McDonnell has just completely vilified my decision. Absolute mess. 
Correct from @Alewin7 of @Remain_Labour Delegates didn't resolve for a Referendum motion where Brexit were the only options.Other delegates have confirmed to us it was for a #PeoplesVote with Remain on the table.@johnmcdonnellMP should correct his statements to the media. 
How is "middle" class an elite? By definition they are in the middle. The elite are at the top of the pile. Refusing to pay their taxes and forcing brexit down our throats.  
 I’m backing #PlanAPlus by @ShankerASingham , Dr @RadoTylecote and @iealondon. It’s a clear roadmap to a prosperous free trading agreement with the EU. It’s a new vision that seizes on the opportunities of Brexit. Let’s #ChuckChequers and get on with it! 
The thing that gets me about the "referendum without Remain" strategy is that it would set up a vote where Labour are officially opposed to both options (May's deal and No Deal) I'm unclear how that would do anything other than make Labour look ridiculous 
Macron 'threatens to SNUB crunch EU summit to seal Brexit deal'.If I was Theresa May I'd tell the EU that I won't attend the summit if Macon attends. 
Chuka, what we DID know in 2016 is that within 6 months of voting for Brexit there would be:A deep recessionMass unemploymentA collapse in house pricesSoaring inflationA stock market crashDespite this, 17.4 million people voted to leave.  We don't need a 2nd referendum.  
Prominent Labour Remainers are still bleating on about the economic ruin which experts say we'll face with Brexit and in the next breath congratulate themselves at the Party Conference that the nation needs a Labour Government ... which experts say will destroy our economy! Eh?

Fundamental flaw of Brexiters' thinking.The 'harder' Brexit is, the more harm it causes to the UK & its population. Threatening it as a way to exact revenge on EU27 is like threatening to punch yourself more & harder so your opponent will get more blood on their shirt.

If there is no General Election before Brexit, the referendum will be on hardest no deal or hardest no deal with chips.  
As Irish citizens, we should be allowed - as a minimum - to vote in the election for President of Ireland / Uachtaran na hÉireann.  A Referendum is being held in the south on this next year

Corbyn's position on Brexit is dishonest.His position is that Theresa May is messing up Brexit because (a) she's personally incompetent and (b) she's a Tory and right wing.In truth she's messing up Brexit because Brexit cannot be delivered without huge harm coming to Britain. 
Boris gives a strong endorsement of @iealondon's alternative Brexit plan. Brexiteers now coalescing around a focal point - will it shift the views of the Leavers still in Cabinet?  
I am actually shaking with rage after reading that Labour's "people's vote" is Tory brexit vs Labour brexit when both are the same fucking thing. WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON 
PUNDITS: Labour should find a way to come up with a coherent anti-Brexit policy.LABOUR: Democracy.PUNDITS: No, not like that. 
It is crunch time @jeremycorbyn! Accept, as the @GMB_union and most Labour supporters have, that #Brexit will be a disaster for workers. If you don’t, you will share the blame for this mess with @Theresa_May.

Most of the criticism of @iealondon @ShankerASingham Brexit work can be summarized as “we love the EU’s regulation and you should too”. 
Incredible shit to claim that the "corrosion of our political discourse" wasn't already obvious in *July 2016*, a month after a openly hugely racist referendum campaign during which an MP was shot by a neo-Nazi who believe she was a traitor to Britain. 
That would be same former Brexit minster Greg Hands who, as @openDemocracyUK revealed, arranged secretive monthly meetings with Shanker Singham, who wrote the IEA paper Hands is now trumpeting. Funny that. () 
A £40bn divorce bill, no £350m extra a week for the NHS, EU doctors and nurses leaving in droves - We didn't know these things in 2016. The public deserve a People's Vote on the Brexit deal with all options on the ballot paper, including staying in the EU.

Just to recap on Labour conference, re Brexit: as unfamiliar as this may seem, the members are sovereign. This is a democratic party. It's not decree by Shadow Cabinet via the media. They spent hours debating the composite in good faith. The members will then vote on it (Tues)> 
Uni of Birmingham at #Lab18 explaining research into how Brexit will impact regions. Professor Ortega-Argiles kicks off by saying the regions at most economic risk are the poorest (which also supported Brexit). Adds that these regions are unprepared & unrepresentated in talks.

"The great virtue of this plan is that it is deliverable," says @Jacob_Rees_Mogg at the launch of @iealondon alternative Brexit plan.  
Guess it's aimed at producing a chaotic Brexit under Tory HMG ownership & thus blamed in order to sweep a far left Labour HMG to power in 2022 unshackled by EU checks and balances. Dangerous strategy likely to backfire badly against Corbyn. 
I don't care about John Mcdonnell. I care about not letting stupid, anti-democratic & harmful policy ideas screw the country!If the public doesn't support any of types of Brexit (by at least 48%) then guess which option has the largest democratic support! 
Hmm ... So this is Labour's plan:1. Vote for a GE rather than a #PeoplesVote2. Win a GE and negotiate a new Brexit deal in less than three months (which no one will have time to ratify)3. Sit back and enjoy life just like they do in Venezuela.

Hi @OwenJones84 why has momentum failed to take position on Brexit and whether we are in same lobby as Jacob Rees Mogg but spent time on how to deselect? We all have choice about whether we create change or chaos-surely you agree we seek power for a purpose not for its own sake!  
 @MhairiBlack: The sad reality is that as shambolic and embarrassing as this Tory government is on Brexit, the Labour Party are even more shameless.

McDonnell: new #Brexit referendum should not include remain optionWell that's undermined the #PeoplesVote desire amongst Labour supporters. It's almost as if the Labour leadership are closet Tories.

Huge pity Sir Keir Starmer spent 5 hours yesterday in a private Labour conference room trying to hussle Brexit through & defeat overwhelming desire by Labour members for a people’s vote with an option to remain in the EU. Is this what you came into politics to do @Keir_Starmer 
BOOM: @BorisJohnson endorses IEA Plan A+ Brexit alternative. Says Chequers amount to “vassal state, colony status for the UK”. #ChuckChequers 
I find #Brexit offensive. #StopBrexit 
Salzburg was unfortunately "all too predictable" - former #Brexit secretary @DavidDavisMP speaks at launch of @iealondon’s alternative Brexit plan  #PlanAPlus

On Labour's stance on a second referendum, MP @BenPBradshaw tells @PaulBrandITV that John McDonnell 'can't have read the motion properly' and that there would be an option to remain in the EU#Lab2018 
Today's IEA #PlanAPlus marks the latest in a series of serious, constructive contributions (from the ERG, IFT, Cato...) to address the challenges and opportunities of #Brexit.(Remain economist: Ooh! I've found a problem with one of the footnotes...) 
I wanted more for @Remain_Labour supporters & other grassroots campaigners. But... We have a motion that effectively calls for Labour to support the EEA as a minimum, rejects the idea of a referendum solely on different forms of Brexit and increases the chances of a #PeoplesVote 
Moreover, we deleted a line which said that any public vote would be, "on the terms of Brexit". In short, we explicitly rejected the idea that any future referendum could be between two different types of Brexit. 
The second text was a step forward and formed the basis of the final motion. However, we were able to secure further concessions and move Labour policy on #Brexit firmly in the right direction. 
Victor Meldrew orders the Brexit Special .... hilarious.   
Rees-Mogg now saying ERG has ‘solved’ Northern Irish border and IEA now offers blueprint for Brexit. This is a CHARITY that has published this ,to provide Brexiters with something to point at and say ‘there is a plan’. Even when there isn’t. UK democracy in action  
So the IEA has basically produced an alternative Brexit for the ERG and Tory right. There’s a reason myself and my colleagues have focused so much on Shanker Singham and his access to government. Clearly has/had ear of many, many cabinet ministers. 
So, to summarise McDonnell interview: We accept brexit results We want a general election that we can’t force. And if we don’t get one we’ll back a people’s vote. Actually we might not have one. And if we do it will only be on how to leave not whether to leave.  
Er...this is getting confusing.....aides to Labour leader decline to rule out including Remain option in any future Brexit referendum.... 
Labour keeps second Brexit referendum on table  
Don’t worry if Brexit costs you your job, makes everything more expensive, crushes the NHS still further, or gets you or your friends deported. It’s a price John McDonnell is willing for you to pay. 
What are the achievements of Labour under Corbyn? (1) Lost an election. (2) Stirred up an almighty anti-semitism row. (3) Supported the Tories every inch of the Brexit way.- What is the point of the current Labour leadership? 
A People’s Vote on May’s Deal vs No Deal would be asking the public to play Russian Roulette with all chambers loaded. A People’s Vote must include a No Brexit option. Anything else would disenfranchise the majority who now want to stop this madness. #Lab18 #PeoplesVote 
Here's a scenario.A second referendum. Option of remaining inside EU on ballot paper. Remain wins, but on a lower turnout, or with a lower share of vote, or with fewer absolute votes than Leave achieved in first referendum.Does that settle it? 
Let me get this straight. Labour’s Brexit strategy is to try and force no-deal by voting against the Tory proposals, then try and trigger an election, fail, then have a people’s vote on whether any of the above was a good idea once we’ve run out insulin supplies? Ok then. 
I’d be surprised if 20 Tory MPs voted for a second referendum (or perhaps I’m just hoping that there wouldn’t be so many willing to colllapse all trust in their party).  
WATCH | Irony is lost on the absolute clown that is @DavidLammy. Says that not having a Remain option in his beloved "People's Vote" would be a "betrayal of Labour members" yet refuses to recognise that not delivering Brexit will be a betrayal of 17.4 million people!   
I welcome your condemnation of labour's sectarianism.Perhaps reinstating Alastair Majury without any real apology was a bad example?Might I invite a comment on the allegations against your party colleague Miles Briggs? Or perhaps #DarkMoney?Brexit? 
The #SupremeCourt decided that the government could "not implement what you decide" because this would involve Acts Of Parliament. So Parliament had to ratify the referendum decision.Which means that Parliament can undo what -it itself caused to happen.#ParliamentIsSovereign 
Our friend @GraceCampbell has made a brilliant sketch about Brexit. Please share!  
Meanwhile the leadership continues to support Brexit, which reduced the £ from €1.32 to €1.03So British businesses are now 30% cheaper to buySo foreign ownership will shoot upSo boards will be based overseasSo this policy won't applySo the "new socialism" means nothing.  
Surprise! Today's IEA report on Brexit is not fully accurate about EU trade policy...  
Plan A+: Creating a prosperous post-Brexit UK  via @iealondon 
Increasingly, I think Labour's problem on Brexit is that it has a very clear policy that it doesn't want to admit to. Which is "hope the Tories fuck the country, and the worse the fucking the better for us, and then reap the benefits of the anger afterwards". 
Why the solution to our Brexit impasse is to join EFTA – and thereby rejoin the EEA  
Given half a chance, the Tories & Labour will unite in favour of a #PeoplesVote referendum to force #Brexit through. We MUST unite to ensure that #Remain is an option. The people who bought #Brexit won’t give in easily. #RemainOption #OptionToRemain #ARealChoice 
Unite's Tony Burke says Johnson and Rees-Mogg's knowledge of manufacturing probably extends only to watching their nanny assemble an Ikea flat-pack. #Lab2018 #Brexit 
I'm not convinced using the example of a country that benefited from an agreement (as a first mover) to reduce barriers to trade with the massive regional economy on its doorstep is quite the winning hard Brexit argument they think it is ...  
A Canada style Brexit deal doesn’t resolve the Irish border issue.The only two deals that fully protect the single market & resolves the Irish border issue are EEA membership (Norway model) or retaining EU membership status.  
The Labour leadership only gives a damn about Brexit as a means to force and win an election. That's all it is. As cynical as that. 
After not one but two clarifications we’re now told that Labour is not guaranteeing a “people’s vote” if there’s no election & is not excluding a vote to Remain in the EU if there is another referendum. Hope that’s clear then ....  
Long interview @PatKennyNT in Ireland re Brexit car crash and in answer to your q Pat re where to find Victor Meldrew Brexit film I have tweeted it and it is on my blog. Thanks for posting on the channel site. I think Irish will love it 
A bit rich for @BarryGardiner to complain to @BBC about Marr spending more time quizzing Corbyn about antisemitism than Brexit when his party has spent most of the summer focusing on making British Jews feel worried about their future here. 
A huge THANKS to all those @peoplesvote_uk supporters who joined our #PVfortheMany march in #Liverpool yesterday. All of us marching are clear what we want: a #PeoplesVote on the terms of #Brexit,whether there’s a deal or not, with the option to Remain on the ballot. Nothing less  
Economists reading the @iealondon "Plan A+ Brexit" report should pay close attention to footnote 28 (page 37).  This provides the analysis behind the otherwise unsubstantiated claim that reducing regulatory distortions could increase UK GDP by 7.5% … 
This is the brexit equivalent of "my girlfriend goes to another school, you won't have heard of her"  
As it’s claimed he’d face an ‘open goal’ by backing second referendum, Jeremy Corbyn takes his chance:

hi @jk_rowling I know you support young female talent and @peoplesvote_uk Be great if you could share @GraceCampbell Victor Meldrew sketch on Brexit farce  
NEW: A frustrated @BenPBradshaw tells me John McDonnell ‘can’t have read the motion properly’. Leadership tried last night to make it a Deal/No Deal referendum, but party rejected that and decided to keep open option of Remaining in EU. 
It’s been a pattern for Labour in recent years. Get close to a good policy, see a chink of light at the end of the tunnel, and then John McDonnell comes along and snuffs it out. He really doesn’t like giving people hope. #Lab18 #Brexit

What’s also tragic is seeing pro-European Corbyn supporters, many of them young, valuing their loyalty to Corbyn over stopping Brexit. He’s creating a generation of new Eurosceptics. #VictoriaLIVE 
McDonnell: new Brexit referendum should not include remain option.Now this is a people's vote I would support.Not another divisive 2nd referendum that's a gift to the far right and destroys leave voters trust in democracy. 
Last time we let any politician write question for referendum was Cameron & we all saw how that ended-time to learn from Irish abortion campaign & let public decide what they want people’s vote on including if to include staying in EU via a citizens assembly #peoplenotpoliticians 
The other breathtaking bit of strategy is the halfarsed push for a Deal or No Deal vote only comes after a push for a General Election where the front bench have declared they would Brexit anyway. *shakes entire population by the shoulders and slaps them out of their trance* 
McDonnell proposes a second referendum with no Remain option and instead a vote on a renegotiated Brexit deal under a Labour government. It will be the same mess as the Chequers plan. The EU have clearly stated that Britain can’t just cherry pick a deal. 
An NHS in crisis, underfunded police forces, a tick-box education system, a chaotic Brexit, big corporations dodging tax.Britain deserves better. Liberal Democrats demand better. Do you? 
#Labour will respect the referendum result, as long as we stay in the #EU. Any “deal” they sign will keep us in the single market, customs union, and under jurisdiction of the #ECJ. They’re siding with the corporate establishment against their own voters. 
We now know the offer at #Lab18 conference won’t have remain on the ballot.The ‘People’s Vote’ campaign messed up. They called for a 2nd EU referendum but were not clear what options should be on a potential ballot paper.This is what happens when you have a vague strategy. 
Labour's People's Vote stitch up: Corbyn and McDonnell's attempt to kill off a second referendum is as cynical as you could imagine  
No-deal Brexit is the most likely outcome of the Salzburg summit  via @financialtimes First-rate piece. Part of the problem is that Brussels and EU27 ambassadors in London listen too much to those they find most congenial viz. arch-Remainers. 
My prediction: there will be a backbench amendment for a 2nd referendum to reverse Brexit.Voting for: SNP, Libs, 150-200 Labour Remainers, 50-100 pro-EU Tories?Voting against: PM, Cabinet, Corbyn, McDonnell, Tory and Labour Brexiteers, DUP. 300 plus?Vote will be v close.  
Amidst this chatter about another election being a so-called “People’s Vote” on Brexit, might I point out that at the 2017 People’s Vote - aka a general election - all key parties wanting to block Brexit - Lib Dems, SNP and Greens - saw their vote share FALL compared with 2015... 
Brexiteers launch alternative Brexit plan to rival Chequers #PlanAPlus 
On my way to London for discussions with @theresa_may & @sajidjavid. Time is running out to conclude a withdrawal treaty that protects the rights of EU & UK citizens affected by Brexit.  
Spotted the difference between May's "my deal or no deal" and McDonnell's "any Referendum would respect the result of the 2016 Leave Vote"? Me neither. This stuff gives fudges a bad name. 
Labour leadership “respects” the crime & lies referendum of 2016 but not its own membership. Unless the Party heaves them out Labour is dead. It is haemorrhaging support by the tanker-load because of this latest act of treachery against the supporters & the country. 
I'm a lifelong @UKLabour supporter and have never voted for any other party. I will not vote for Labour if they allow this destructive Brexit to happen. 
Labour can win election AND sort out Brexit in six months, John McDonnell claims 
.@UKLabour's Brexit fudge makes no sense. 1) reject Govt deal as it fails 6 tests (inevitable as one is impossible Govt pledge of "exact same benefits" 2) fail to get general election (inevitable as 2/3 MPs won't back one 3) offer ref between already rejected deal and no deal 
There is NO such thing as EU money!EU has NO money of it's own.#EU budget money is from nation state contributions of which UK taxpayers contribute about £10+ Billion.#Brexit will allow UK to cut out the Brussels middleman & pay subsidies direct to UK farmers & businesses etc.  
It has been suggested that in the run up to the referendum the PM as Home Secretary declined at least one application from the security services to investigate  Arron Banks and others. There needs to be an investigation; it is the time for the truth to out. 
#Lab18 No one believes anything coming out Labour Party Conference. They make it up everyday. Stop pissing about with Brexit Labour Party all the time.

- It’s not the fault of “remoaners” talking the country down”. - It’s not the fault of the EU.- It’s not the fault of immigrants. Brexit is an unworkable mess and the blame lies firmly with the ringleaders of this mess. Brexit is their fault. It’s on them.  
Attempting to negotiate while wearing a suicide vest that was forced on to you surrounded by snipers taking aim... Brexit metaphor of the year.  
Len McCluskey says new Brexit referendum must exclude any option to remain in the EU  
The UK “Single Market” is nothing other than a means to control Scotland’s economy. We can’t sell our Whisky, Oil, Beef, Lamb or services to anyone that England doesn’t do a trade deal with post Brexit. Explain how remaining in UK serves our interests? #DissolveTheUnion 
Ask yourself why the rabid right-wing press who you’ve all become deeply suspicious of are going after the one agency which has been probing the criminal mess behind Brexit...If you can’t work it out, I really can’t help you with the NCA situation. 
It would be political suicide for Corbyn to stand along side Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg to campaign for no-deal. He also can't stand with May and support her deal. So IF we have a referendum Corbyn will have to have a third option (remain) - this story will develop! 
OK, try: 37% of a gerrymandered electorate voted Leave on a fraudulent prospectus in an advisory referendum. 
We often have the parade of those few Remain advocates claiming to speak for big  businesses that want to stop Brexit. They frequently repeat themselves,  going  public to help the Remain cause. They argue more than one foolish   contradiction. 
Dear British friends,I hope #Brexit is just a passing nightmare. I know there are a lot of good people fighting for Britain to remain what it always was: a European country. Bon courage! Many Europeans support you!  
Gosh. Monumentally stupid. Pointless referendum. Insulting, really. Besides which, what would be on the ballot wouldn’t even pass Labour’s own 6 tests, which is quite bizarre.  
This is insane... it just facilitates either a nightmare Tory Brexit or an apocalyptic Tory BrexitI don’t think this will be sustainable... 
I enjoy #referenda  I’m quite good at them usually win them and predict the results better than the pollsters as @afneil knows. But they don’t settle matters. I rather think Britain has had enough referendums for a while. Better by far to reform the voting system now. #Brexit 
This is rich !Telling the EU to "respect our expats" (note GB citizens "expats" whereas EU in the UK increasingly "migrants") when she and her successive Brexit Ministers have never met or even replied to @BritishInEurope requests for meetings.Galling. 
MCDONNELL: Second referendum shouldn't include option to Remain. Any attempt to keep UK inside the EU would fatally undermine democracy. Must not happen!  
I know Corbyn is a master at mugging off the Remainers and getting them to say “thank you Jeremy”. But I suspect even he’s finally pushed it too far with this in-out-shake-it-all-about referendum farce. 
The clue is in the title that "Canada-style Brexit" is stupid.Surprise surprise, you need a different relationship with your next door neighbour than you need with the bloke 10 roads down!Especially if 20 years of peace is built on having an open border with that neighbour!! 
Utterly ridiculousA #PeoplesVote must give the public their democratic right to stay in the EU now we know more about the Brexit disaster unfolding ahead.Here’s how:  
This notion Labour can’t be honest about Brexit as they are “not in the driving seat” but can be honest about all their other policies for running the country is headspinningly absurd. 
John McDonnell“I want the Tories held to account for what they’ve done.”"Apart from eight years of austerity, their handling of Brexit has had a direct impact on the economy and people’s living standards.”“I want them held to account. I want them out.”#Lab18 
Dozens of motions were submitted to #Lab18, thousands have marched on the streets, and millions more have called for a #PeoplesVote.They did not do this to be offered a farcical referendum on No Deal or a Bad Deal. It absolutely must include the right to remain in the EU. 
It’s a fudge that smells of cowardice.Yes, it keeps options on the table, but it’s completely non-committal - and apparently the leadership had wanted to to insert that any vote is on terms of Brexit only. That would’ve never been forgiven.  
Personally I'll be voting libdem in any election. Consistently Pro EU before the ref, pro EU after the ref, anti brexit now. I welcome labour pushing for a peoples vote, but only if there's an option to remain.  
1) Thread - Corbyn, #Brexit & Labour democracy - let's just be honest, it's deadSaddened but not surprised by this reversal by Labour Leadership.Labour members overwhelmingly support a People's vote, and they have been comprehensively overridden#LabourConference2018 
"Accept this Tory Brexit or we'll stand by while the UK economy tanks."He calls that opposition? I call it blackmail.

READ IN FULL: Brexiteers Launch Alternative Brexit #PlanAPlus 
I'm just trying to imagine the sheer mindbending wonder of John McDonnell's Deal or No Deal referendum. The public being asked to choose between two things frankly no one understands, over the thundering background music of utter lies from all sides. Bring it on. 
Jim Wells just told @StephenNolan that Northern Ireland voted to remain because "a lot of nationalists did" For the millionth time, #Brexit is NOT an orange/green issue. 
It is worrying enough that May appears to have blocked investigations of Arron Banks by the Security Services & Electoral Commission after the referendum, but if she vetoed such  investigations beforehand that is very alarming indeed. Money talks. It can also buy silence.  
Labour members in favour of a #PeoplesVote & wanting to #Remain in the EU have been sold a pig in a poke.For the Labour leadership #Brexit will happen.In contrast @LibDems want a #FinalSay referendum & an #ExitFromBrexit Time for Labour MPs & members to vote with their feet. 
.@thomasbrake: “It beggars belief that McDonnell and co are spending so much time trying to trick and stitch up their own conference, rather than campaigning for an exit from Brexit...The only choice a ‘deal or no deal’ vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at."  
Fucking john McDonnell what is the fucking point of a fucking referendum on shit deal or no deal or even more effing absurdly no deal or no deal what a totally pointless fucking excercise and totally in the face of what most of the Labour movement want  
So Labour's plan to stop a hard Brexit is to hope the government collapses (unlikely), and when it collapses hope a General Election is called (unlikely), which Labour then wins (unlikely) and then negotiate a 'jobs-first Brexit' (no such thing exists). 
Yet your manifesto will "seek a mandate" to deny the Scots an independence referendum even though the Scot Govt already has an electoral mandate to action #indyref2Scots are then, an oppressed people, and it is YOU who are doing the oppressing#DissolveTheUnion #SNP 
Exclusive: Britain's largest HIV charity, along with leading experts from across the sector are raising the alarm about what Brexit could mean for HIV treatment.1/This Is What Could Happen To People With HIV If There's A No-Deal Brexit  via @PatrickStrud 
So, Labour can say goodbye to lots of potential voters who want an option to remain and hello to those who want a referendum on May deal/no deal - which is who exactly?  
The message for Remainers coming from Liverpool today is the Labour is completely untrustworthy. It will take their votes and use them to ram Brexit through.  
So if we go by what McDonnell said this morning, there would only be a referendum if Parliament votes down the deal.And it would be a deal/no-deal referendum.So in that case, would Labour campaign for…no deal? 
To be clear, ‘No Deal’ would in theory mean a Labour govt returning to the negotiating table, not crashing out. Tho difficult to see how on earth there’d be time for that. Fall of Tory govt -> general election -> Labour govt -> referendum. Would surely take us to March at least! 
Labour's John McDonnell, ahead of the party's Brexit debate, tells @bbcnickrobinson: "We've said we want a People's Vote if we can't get a general election." #r4today 
What do all these people have in common? They were the party to support a second referendum and their share of the vote fell at the last election. Does Labour really want to join them?  
Cabinet backs Canada-style Brexit deal as Hunt urges PM to drop Chequers  
Dear Leavers.You created Remainers like me:- You palpably failed to make a case for a viable EU alternative.- Instead of looking to unify, you used the majority to gloat, lie, bully & divide.- You let the Gov't misrepresent, & grossly mismanage, Brexit.It's your fault. 
I'm open to a second indyref! Actually, no, I'm not. But I won't back a second EU referendum! Wait, I will. I'll back a people's vote if that's what conference wants! Actually, no, it'll be a vote on Deal or No Deal...THISISWHYNO-ONEKNOWSWHATLABOURSTANDSFOR 
I don’t pretend to know what was in Olly Robbins’ mind when he proposed the Chequers plan. But if his intention had been to create chaos and mayhem, in order to force a re-think on Brexit, he could hardly have done better. 
So that’s clear, the @UKLabour leadership is saying the Brexit decision is irrevocable. They will deny the British people the right to change their minds now they know the facts. It’s up to conference delegates now, will they allow this to happen?  
Macron will boycott special summit to finalise Brexit on 17/18 Nov unless Britain agrees withdrawal agreement in full, Irish backstop, over next three weeks  
If the original referendum had been a choice between "leave on this crap deal, or remain?" leave would never have won. Leave only won because it was "castles in the air, or remain?" A choice between a crap deal and a catastrophic no deal is no choice at all @johnmcdonnellMP 
Listening to Corbyn followers putting party before country on Brexit is thoroughly depressing.Lemmings, who are taking the country with them. #r4today 
So John McDonnell wants people to have a choice on the future of our country and the options he wants you to be able to choose between areA Tory Brexit vs An ERG BrexitLabour opposition in action folks 
I‘ve got Shanker Singham’s “Plan A+” @iealondon paper on UK’s future trade relationship with EU, which will be backed today by Johnson, Davis, Mogg, Baker et al. And I honestly can’t see how the Brexit gulf between them and May can ever be bridged  
"I'm respecting the referendum, Betty"  
Refusing to envisage an ‘option to Remain’ is an insult to those voters who voted Leave in 2016 but have come to realise that Brexit would damage their job, their family, their rights, their future, and European values 
I am in Brussels at the moment, helping the EU to spend ~€260 million on cracking science. I cannot begin to express my resentment over the HUGE opportunities that Brexit is denying UK science and scientists. It is a complete and utter nightmare. 
Shocked - shocked! - that the Bennite anti-EU Labour leadership have betrayed the pro-EU Labour membership on a second referendum... 
Looking forward to attending the @iealondon event this morning, on which trade option will work best for the UK post-Brexit. As former Trade Policy Minister, I definitely have a view! #PlanAPlus #FreeTradeUK 
Bastia (like most places beginning with B) is fucking brilliant.Fuck Brexit, I'm Corsican. pic.twitter.com/we3VcTIoYH 
If there is indeed " no way out of Brexit under Labour" then a general election would be meaningless. Labour would not get the votes of Remainers. 
John McDonnell: a new referendum would be on the terms of Brexit. “Waiter. I accidentally ordered a turd. I’d like change my order.”“You would like your turd cooked differently?”“No. I don’t want a turd.”“Sorry, sir, I’m afraid ‘no turd’ is no longer an option.”#r4today 
We prioritise the fate of the Palestinians over #OurNHS and #Brexit, because obsessing over the one Jewish state when Assad has been slaughtering hundreds of thousands of his own people does not look weird at all.  
So Labour nudging towards Norway option while Tories sliding over to Canada option.  Hobson’s Choice #Brexit then. Not what we want @Labour4EU @Remain_Labour @Women_4_Europe and many other #Remain groups. We fight on.  
When will the penny drop? Labour leadership are not Remainers ? Never have been?  They will Brexit ? Why the mass delusion on this? 
We didn’t have a ‘people vote’ last time, we had a gerrymandered advisory referendum where a backpacker from Australia or Malta could vote but not someone like me with 30 years NI contributions under his belt nor 15-18 year olds whose future is affected by #Brexit more than any1! 
Credit where credit is due.It appears that John McDonnell has outmanoeuvred the second referendum brigade, stating that any new referendum would not include the option to Remain. Have you given up yet, Alastair Campbell? 
Labour's totally killed off a Remain/Leave referendum now. It's *instead* of a GE, and *only on the May deal*. So they take power and do Brexit anyway if she loses a ref. It's great obfusvatory politics which gives the impression of movement with zero change. 
No point in a fresh Brexit referendum if Remain is not an option. Labour's elite is betraying the party's members - and the country - in a classic stitch-up @peoplesvote_uk 
so, as suspected, Magic Grandpa & the Elves are still on the side of #Brexit.And you thought he'd 'listen to the membership'?Ha. Ha. Ha. 
Also: does this remotely respect party democracy - ie do the leadership seriously think this is what the motions submitted to the conference was asking for? And what does Labour advocate in such a referendum? It opposes no deal, but would have voted down the withdrawal agreement. 
Labour's new Brexit referendum would not offer option to remain in EU, says John McDonnell  
Let's unpack this. If Labour's position is that a possible referendum can only be "withdrawal agreement v no deal" it will offer a choice between 1) an agreement negotiated by a Tory govt and 2) a no deal outcome which Labour ran against and only some Tories/UKIP favour. Uh huh.  
Delegates spent 6 hours last night drafting Brexit motion then up pops John McDonnell to tell them it means something quite different 
Except as @tristanod has quite rightly pointed out, this isn't triangulation at all. Corbyn, McDonnell, McCluskey all *want* Brexit. They see the EU as a neoliberal evil. And somehow the mass membership of Labour, which overwhelmingly doesn't, is letting them do it in our name.  
This was exactly the point of contention in the meeting last night - when the 'terms of Brexit' were removed from the final motion 
I left labour 2 years ago, because it was obvious #corbyn and #McDonnell would enable #Brexit. #labour is lost to the left.Join #LibDems. #FinalSay 
The Russians have been engaged in a campaign of misinformation, malicious technology and dark money since before Brexit. Security services went to Theresa May before the referendum & asked to investigate Russian influence over Brexit. She declined the request... #Dodgy #r4today 
See crucial elements in composite Brexit motion to be debated by #LabConf18, proposed by GMB. On a People’s Vote, motion says “if we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options...including CAMPAIGNING for a public vote”. Big Labour shift towards referendum  
Labour seems to be offering either a general election (which they cannot call) or a referendum (which would ask the country to pick only between a bad deal or no deal). What a mess. 
So Labour must support all options remaining on the table EXCEPT a 2nd Remain-Leave referendum, says McDonnell  
We CANNOT remain part of the EU’s institutions that make a mockery of the referendum result. We WILL NOT split the UK. We WILL NOT annul the Brexit vote because they don’t like it. We CANNOT keep making sacrifices & offering solutions for the EU to reject.  
fudge update:John McDonnell initially told Today: "We don't (get general election), then yes, we will go for a People's Vote."Then he backtracked like crazy, arguing there should merely be public vote "on the deal itself" and that Labour should "respect the last referendum". 
John McDonnell on #r4today demonstrating why Labour can’t be trusted.  Already backtracking on a #PeoplesVote.  McDonnell, Corbyn and co want Brexit to destroy the economy, jobs and lives in the belief that they will be able to pick up the pieces.  Disgusting.  
To be honest, although I voted remain, I'm more scared of many more years of Tory rule, than I am about a Labour Brexit. Look at what the Tories have done to the country, and we're still in the EU  
BREAKING: John McDonnell says Labour would only offer people Deal or No Deal in a referendum. NO option to stay in EU. Which completely negates the aims of a referendum as dreamt up by @peoplesvote_hq. Massively significant - no way out of Brexit under Labour. #lab18 
John McDonnell says Remain will NOT be on ballot paper in any 2nd referendum backed by Labour. “It will be on the deal itself. We will respect the referendum” #BBCR4today 
Good job Brexit isn’t part of the same Russian destabilisation project which is endangering NATO then.  
John McDonnell on calls for a second referendum: "If we don't get a general election then yes, we will go for a People's Vote." #r4today 
BBC Wales news reports this morning broadcasting a major shift in Labour Brexit policy. As I read the motion it doesn’t commit Labour to anything apart from its cynical aim of forcing a General Election. Why would the BBC deliberately mislead the people of Wales? 
Today's News:- 'Majority of Cabinet' now supports Canada-style Brexit deal and will urge May to ditch Chequers plan - IEA prepares to publish ‘Plan A+’  this morning- Labour conference will vote on second referendum motion 
Dear @UKLabour members who want to #Remain. A GE before March 2019 may get you a Labour government but it will also get you a Labour #Brexit. You have a leadership that does not want us to have a #PeoplesVote. 
Part of what’s wrong with Britain and the British media can be explained by the fact the Croydon cat death story lasted more than one day in the news cycle and on social media, while many people still think a no deal Brexit won’t happen, can’t happen, or will be okay because jam. 
That Labour Motion in full: "If we can't immediately force a General Election then we'll promise anybody anything to get their support whilst secretly being committed to Brexit so we can leave the EU and nationalise lots of stuff." 
Bollox. Corbyn is a euro sceptic not a Brexiteer. Len is a remainer who wants a Labour govt and knows a 2nd referendum policy will cost his workers jobs because it will cost Labour a GE!  
Please tell me everyone has woken up on the right page as regards Brexit now... 
Arron Banks, the sacrifices of WW2  were made to put an end to your kind of rabid nationalism. We crushed the far-right scum in 1945. We will again. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
.@lewis_goodall heard from people at the #LeaveMeansLeave rally in Bolton and asked what's so wrong with @theresa_may's Chequers plan?Read the latest on @jeremycorbyn's plan for #Brexit here:  
So after 2 years of inaction and bickering the Tories are no nearer to agreeing what they want from #Brexit, let alone carry out meaningful negotiations - how pathetic! No wonder the UK is the laughing-stock of Europe@UnityNewsUK @mac123_m @Hepworthclare#UnfitToGovern 
John McDonnell - If we can't get a general election then we will campaign for a #PeoplesVote... he goes onto to say that labour will respect the result of the referendum. #FBPE #Lab18 
Very poor show from CBI. Biggest threat to your members is Brexit, where you have been consistently weak & hopeless. A Labour government would be much better for you than this extreme Brexit mania  
With the British government’s negotiations on the terms of Brexit in turmoil, the campaign for a “people’s vote” continues to gather traction  
Possibly unwisely, I’m going to stick my neck out and say that while @UKLabour’s Brexit motion is, as it always would be, a bit of a fudge, it is a positive move and contains some very important stuff. Important to read the whole thing though. H/T @LabPeoplesVote 1/ 
This week’s Brexit policy  
If someone proposes a Brexit solution based on a magic piece of WTO text that only they had the wit to notice and no one else, eithera) they are geniuses, nice work; orb) it's not actually the solution they say it is. 
Has Labour, a political party that claims to represent working class people, ever been more out of touch with working class people? #Brexit #Lab18 
@piersmorgan @GMB #Brexit isn't  simple but people deserve clear honest answers. That's what we're trying to do at our new website  - you might want to specifically check out the 'Leave with No Deal' PDF with many voices of experience / industries 
If there's no General Election. I have passed more meaningful bowel motions than this. It still leaves a 'mandate' for a Labour #Brexit if there is a GE. Then what?Is this what 86% of @UKLabourMembers really want? 
Ahead of the release of the latest IEA offering on trade and Brexit let's briefly talk economic studies, and why any reputable economic model will find trade deals doesn't replace a loss of trade with the EU - 1/ 
Labour's huge fudge seems to rely on the premise we have time on our side. The battle over Brexit often is concerned only with appearances. To be tough. To take back control. We need an opposition that should be engaging with & testing the substance of any Brexit at all. 
Leave mean Leave spokesman stating a #PeoplesVote would disenfranchise those who voted for #Brexit.Disenfranchise = deny a vote..like happened to c. 5m UK/EU citizens directly affected, in the EURef.All voters including #Brexiters would get a #FinalSay U ****!#Remain #FBPE 
Big Brexit day in westminster - May has to face Cabinet after Salzburg mess and IEA right wing think tank putting forward another plan (quite a lot of it is familiar stuff) 
So Corbyn wants another General Election so he can push through Brexit. No respect for Labour Party members wishes or for the people he professes to care about. Stop Brexit. #FBPE #PeoplesVote 
The Brexit commentariat is in the house!  
Final proof Labour have abandoned the working classes: they back second Brexit referendum. So what happens to 37% Labour voters who voted to Leave?   
Brexit Secretary hints we could CHUCK PM's Chequers plan for Canada-style deal  
If Labour backs a second Brexit vote, stand by – all bets could be off | Matthew d’Ancona  
Theresa May’s aides have secretly begun contingency planning for a snap election in November to save the Brexit talks and her job. Get ready for a General Election! 
It's genuinely gotten to the point where I couldn't give a shit whether there's another #Brexit referendum or not.I just want to get rid of the nasty leeching Tories and make the UK a fairer place to live.What I do know is that, in EU or out, life would be better under Labour 
So far - to be clear - Corbyn has committed to nothing on Brexit other than to make it obvious he still wants it.  
The one person who, to my surprise, has been a consistent disappointment and failure throughout the Brexit process is Keir Starmer. A lawyer who only works to instructions from his client. Not a leader in any form, alas 
These Catalans are crazy! Thousands join hands to dance a Sardana as they surround a prison where minister Dolors Bassa is unjustly held... for organizing a Referendum for God's sake! #freecatalanpoliticalprisoners #Spainstinks 
McDonnell confirms the #Labour fudge on @BBCBreakfast. "We respect the result of the #Referendum."  Only if no #GE will @uklabour call for a #PeoplesVote. A vote for Labour IS a vote for #BrexitNO, DEFINITELY NOT GOOD ENOUGH  
It is clear that Labour has opted for a general election over stopping Brexit. Despite the fact the membership overwhelmingly wants a #PeoplesVote with remain as an option it hasn’t guaranteed this.  If Labour won a GE it would negotiate a soft Brexit.  
When you hear McDonnell talk about Brexit motion last night, first thing he says is party would respect the referendum result 
Corbyn has thrown Mrs May another lifeline today with his fudge. He must be really proud of himself. Corbyn and McCluskey work together to deliver Brexit, there is no opposition.#FBPE 
So no change...no commitment...no #Remain option...more #Brexit fudge...less time left..NOT BLOODY GOOD ENOUGH!Simple Majority, Binding #PeoplesVote for a Binary #FinalSayAccept the #BrexitShambles OR#Reject #Revoke #Remain #Reform#FBPE #ABTV 
Theresa May's Brexit offer wasn't based on protecting the economy, because it wouldn't. It was based on trying not to destroy the Good Friday Agreement and not to be the PM who dismantled the UK.But something to keep in mind... If we leave without any deal, that happens anyway!! 
Brexit Paradox of the day. The Irish people want to stay in the EU for the very reasons Brexiteers want to leave: Control over our future. The diversity of our society. The value of sovereignty (which should be used confidently rather than hidden away protected from the light)

Very happy with Labour Conf. Brexit composite and everything that happened yesterday apart from two remarks,one sectarian(appalling)other conflating opposition to independence with opposition to right of Scottish people to decide(confused,wrong in principle,political gift to SNP) 
Dr Lee did stand down. He was Justice Secretary and resigned from his post over the Governments handling of Brexit. He continues to serve his constituency (which I’m a part of) in his elected position. He’s one of the few good politicians out there!! 
Britain's Labour to vote on keeping second Brexit referendum on table  
Doing @GMB from Liverpool on Labour conference on @jeremycorbyn digging a hole on so called people’s vote: a 2nd referendum 
This image highlights a truth - the old and dead voted for Brexit, while young voters are 80% in favour of the EU. Guess who's going to win.  
Canada leaves us billions poorer. Leave promised us a better deal not worse.The Brexit Elite are just liars. They bullshitted. They've been found out. Time to resign. #PeoplesVote pic.twitter.com/Y8lzIQdo8r 
So Institute of Economic Affairs trailed yet again by @BBCr4today who continue to convey the idea they are some kind of independent body. They are part of the Brexit elite and need to be challenged as politicians not commentators 
Watching #bbcbreakfast. What I realise is you can't trust them about the Labour Party or its policies. Listen to language employed. Labour are trying to convince they could be a government. Corbyn was reluctant to accept a 2nd referendum. Negative language all the time. Listen 
"We should all prepare for a no-deal Brexit. In the absence of a change of political leadership, a general election in the UK or a change of position by EU leaders, we should consider it to be the single most probable scenario."  
Up and off to @GMB to see @piersmorgan @susannareid100 with my daughter @GraceCampbell who is bringing a bit of comedy into the Brexit farce #famousandverypopularactoralert In other good news @BorisJohnson has another @Telegraph column and nobody cares 
Put Brexit talks with EU on backburner and open negotiations with rest of world, Theresa May told  
How ignorant and stupid can you get. Peace is maintained by not making the mistakes that lead to wars. The EU was a response to the folly of the post WW1 peace settlement which created the conditions that led to WW2. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit 
Theresa May as Home Secretary crippled UK security services so badly they took their eyes off ball and Russians/Far Right attacked our democracy and got an unlikely Brexit win. It succinctly explains May's refusal to redo the referendum or investigate it. 
In the midst of this in early 2016 a Foreign Office official tells the National Crime Agency to NOT investigate Arron Banks mysterious Russian millions AND NOT investigate potential Russian interference in Brexit  
Lab Dep Lder Tom Watson says "As Home Secretary Theresa May 'declined' a request from security services to investigate Russian influence ahead of the Brexit referendum + Russian agents may still be actively undermining political networks in the UK   
My FT column on why EU leaders inadvertently increased the chances of a No Deal Brexit.  
A step in the right direction for Labour with a conference motion to be voted on on Tuesday.   This states there must be a referendum on the Government's deal if there is not a General Election. There won't be, so next step a #PeoplesVote 
Lily Allen says nobody understands Brexit - unless you're Piers Morgan and 'know everything'  
I could have sworn a lot of the big corporations and billionaires were against Brexit, and that a lot of billionaires were behind Hilary, too, and that there are "vast influence networks" on both sides of the political divide, but you wouldn't guess that listening to Wendy 6/x 
I see the bitterness coming out of all you remoaners lately, but the fact of the matter is we had a referendum to decide whether to leave the EU or not, in which 30 million people voted. 17.4 million people voted to leave. Accept it.

Labour back second Brexit vote if there's no general election  
The reason GOP—the party of white men—wants to double down on Kavanaugh is that given how wisespread this rapey conduct was, if it’s disqualifying, a lot of other men they want on the bench will be disqualified. It’s a cultural referendum. 
#Democrats know that if the #Trump economy continues to improve as it has, he will win in 2020. They’re also claiming a #BlueWave in the #Midterms and that it will be a referendum against Trump. It won’t. Trump will be unaffected as long as the economy continues to roar along. 
Not actually true. Rail track was taken back into public ownership now network rail and so was East coast main line when both had failed. Europe has many nationally owned business's. After a Brexit there'd be no money to do Corbyn's renationalisation program anyway. 
Brexit: Labour conference vote wording agreed  
“on the terms of Brexit” - no mention of Remain option - WHICH 80+% OF LABOUR MEMBERS & VOTERS WANT. It’s a fudge - a trick - to give Corbyn escape routes from ANY referendum.  
Britain's Labour to vote on keeping second Brexit referendum on table  
Democrats wanted 2018 election to be a referendum: Vote Democratic if you want to reach universal healthcare coverage or Vote Republican if you want to kick 25-40 million off of healthcare. But, Republicans are really forcing it to be about Republican support for sexual assault. 
Nobody in 1985 could've predicted that the seemingly indestructible Soviet Union would never see the twenty-first century.People seem to think the UK is indestructible, but it looks increasingly likely that it'll break-up after Brexit with the way things are currently going. 
Here we have it, Labour leadership will have to be dragged kicking and screaming to a #PeoplesVote and no guarantee that they would support a Remain option on the ballot. Labour will not fight #Brexit, they will only fight for power.  
Is it just me, or is this absolute gibberish?  By definition, class is something that *divides* people.  And if the next independence referendum is "unwanted", why does the party proposing it keep winning elections so easily? 
If this text is adopted by conference Labour will have all but committed to a public vote on the Brexit deal. This is a huge step forward. The leadership must respect the clear will of party members, and the growing public clamour for a final say. #PeoplesVote #Lab18 
He has also decided that Scotland does not want or need another Referendum. Huh? SNP keep getting voted in, FM got a Triple Lock Mandate - but this, this, politician thinks he can decide Scotland doesn't need another IndyRef. HOW ARROGANT IS THAT MAN TO DECIDE FOR SCOTLAND! 
Which pretty much ends any chance of Labour ever campaigning for a second referendum.  
This was obvious from day one. But Leavers called it "Project Fear"."Ministers warn harder Brexit risks breaking up Britain." 
And what brexit was that exactly Julia ? Was it a no deal ? ... no didn’t think so ... get over it you won - now let’s have a people’s vote and put brexit out of its misery  
How on earth do you think Brexit will make your life better 
It's not everything we wanted but this is a clear step forward. Clear commitment that any public vote won't just be on the terms of Brexit. It could include an option to Remain. This is a left wing motion which backs free movement in spirit. And crucially... (1/2)  
17) this has been a calm #brexit thread, so it's not great to end on a "punchline", but the reality is Corbyn has showed far more respect for (mostly Tory) Leave Voters than the hopes & wishes of his own membersLabour is not a democracy anymore#LabourConference2018 
Brexit resolution agreed this evening is a holding position on people’s vote. I would have gone much further but this is a breakthrough in putting people’s vote to stop Brexit at heart of debate hereafter. Credit to @Remain_Labour @Manuel_TSSA @GMB_union. Onwards! 
The #Labour composite (ie single compromise text negotiated among those who had tabled resolutions to #LabConf18) motion on #Brexit , to be debated (and voted on) on Tuesday, is a significant shift towards having a public vote on the Brexit deal. Direction of movement is clear.  
Hi @NicolaSturgeon Swinney has gone on TV and said you do not support another EU referendum.Which is odd, given how many times you and your party have said that Brexit will be catastrophic to Scotland.Which does kind of imply that you're more anti-England than pro-EU. 
Here it is - the full and final version of the Brexit composite motion that  be put to Labour conference. Six hours later...  
For those in the @UKLabour compositing meeting drafting the Brexit motion, remember:86% of your members - and the majority of the public - want a #PeoplesVote on Brexit. And the majority of the public now want to #Remain.Commit to a final say, with an option to stay. 
It’s on the same level as the give peas a chance bridge on the m25 .... excellent work by Charlie to highlight brexit and the damage it will do 
Send Jacob Rees Mogg to Brussels to negotiate Brexit!  May has been far too weak & made too many concessions. May needs to be replaced..  
Worrying: @chrisinsilico described how he was helping the FBI with its investigation into Cambridge Analytica and said he’d been asked far more questions about Brexit by US authorities than by British ones.  
It is all irrelevant as it will be Teresa May who will agree to a #PeoplesVote in order to save her premiership and avoid GE18. Labours performance over Brexit is a shameful betrayal of working people, pensioners and the young. #bolloxtobrexit 
DEAL DONE - Brexit: Labour to vote on motion that would mean it 'must' back new #PeoplesVote #FinalSay referendum, if there is no election  
Labour for Corbyn and his upper middle class Islington pals. Stuff the working class which has most to lose through Brexit #fudge 
so by end of Tuesday, Labour will sound a bit more Remain friendly, and shifted policy, more symbolically than practically, to support the idea of maybe having another EU referendum - big filip to those campagining for one but it doesn't change the actual policy v much 
white smoke! - motion will be 'if we cannot get a General Election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote' - NB 'on terms of Brexit' has gone so could be in/out vote, not just on deal 
Your daily reminder that even after a #NoDealBrexit the EU still holds all the cards. It could easily block our new schedules at the WTO and drag out the issue of an FTA for as long as it likes. Simply put, Brexit doesn't mean independence. It means DEPENDENCE like never before! 
Brexiteers are never going to just give up on Brexit. Remainers can put out as much propaganda as they like, they can use project fear 2, they can even demand a 2nd vote but it won't change the fact that we voted to leave the EU in 2016..  
Brexit has exposed just how corrupt, out of touch & conniving the UK political system is. Politicians look down on Leavers, don’t respect our vote & many are anti British preferring to support EU rule over our country. They betrayed us & sold out the UK #Democracy 
Labour motion text as of 2300 - 'if we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote on the terms of Brexit' 
6) so here's the gist - the Labour membership overwhelmingly wants a proper vote on Brexit, and almost certainly an option to Remain.It may, or may not, be savvy for Labour (though I suspect it is) but that shouldn't matter.Democracy should take precedence 
5) this is the last conference before #Brexit, which *will* happen in 6 months, deal or no deal, unless an extension can be justified by a democratic event (such as a GE or a People's vote)And Labour members are very concerned, so concerned that they've raised 150 motions 
Imagine Carry On BrexitIt’s (qu)easy if you try...#CarryOnBrexit 
Labour's Brexit fudge: if the Tories botch Brexit but there's not a general election, then Labour will keep the option of "a public vote on the terms of Brexit" on the table.That is far short of what the People's Vote campaign demands.  
Anyone else got a pure riddy / beamer that they used to tell folk to vote Labour in Scotland? Never again, anti democracy and casual sectarianism with no answer to clusterfuck brexit. Why would you? 
Sounds like the #labour resolution on #brexit is going to be weaker than 2016! You know, the one that #Corbyn totally  ignored!#FBPE 
Which means the leader of one of the largest unions @unitetheunion is supporting a policy which the gov’s own figures show will result in yet more brexit job losses of minimum 1.75-2.8mUtterly contemptible @Labour4EU @DavidLammy@uklabour #peoplesvote #StopBrexitSaveBritain 
Jeffrey Donaldson seems to think that ‘almost 45%’ of people in NI (including a majority in Lagan Valley) voting for Brexit is an impressive feat ! ! #Priceless 
"#Brexit is more damaging than the financial crisis, and the damage will be more lasting." The trick Brexiters played was to channel resentment at austerity & deprivation against the EU.They'll find other scapegoats for economic collapse post-Brexit.

Right. I am no longer fucking pulling punches. So do with that what you will. #brexit makes no sense. It’s a political storm in which you need to find your ground. Michael Dougan is where you should ground yourself. As he has from 2016. Think. Open your eyes. Fight x #remain

Remember folks: these are the people who reckon they'd be able to do a better job at negotiating Brexit than the Conservative Party. They're fighting over what will be voted on re a second referendum. Ignoring a significant proportion of their own electorate.  
The NEW motion uses some wording from the Cortes version, it says...if the party can't get an election *"Labour must support all options remaining on the table including campaigning for a public vote on the terms of Brexit"* - significant change!! ...AND... 
Anyway, whatever your opinion of #bodyguard, I’m sure you’ll agree it was worth the licence fee alone in that it brought the country together and got us to stop tweeting about brexit for an hour or so a week. For that, thank you @jed_mercurio  
If Labour do not back a #PeoplesVote - and that means one with an option to Remain in the EU - the future for Labour will be as bleak as it will for Britain after Brexit. 
Tonight I've learnt there are Remainers who think Theresa May will grant them a People's Vote.They've literally convinced themselves the Tories will help them avert Brexit. I've heard some delusional shit on this site but that takes the biscuit. 
The only party I'd vote for would be any one which said:-You can't change bio sex.-Trans women are men but deserve respect & support.-Third spaces instead of gender neutral shite.Otherwise what's the point...I won't vote Labour to stop Brexit, if it means women are erased.

Brexit. Doesn't cheap migrant labour depress wages for the working class? 
England is not a colonial power to the other  nations in the United Kingdom and thus each nation within its own assemble has a right if their people choose to hold a referendum to separate from the United Kingdom  
The tide is turning, people now know the Brexit vote was propagated on lies and illegality. Don’t expect the leavers to go away, it’s now that they will get nasty. It feels awful to be found out. 
The world has changed. China is free market. The Berlin Wall is down. Mega weather events. Bitcoin. Brexit. Trump. Things happen today that didn't used to happen. Catalan independence will happen this time. Possibly this year. One thing certain not to happen: no change. 
Hi @BBCLauraK why did you call the question of a #PeoplesVote "a huge question about democracy" but you never mention the criminal cheating at the exact time there was massive spike to Leave which actually makes another referendum 'vital for democracy'? @BBCNews @CliveMyrieBBC 
All the talk tonight is about Brexit, but hard to understate quite how damaging Andy Kerr’s comment from the stage at Labour conference could be for the party. An absolute gift for their opponents, particularly in Scotland. 
This legislator lists, as part of her interests, law and legal services and has been a professor of law.And she comes out with howling nonsense like this, a gross insult to the judges and advocates general. Brexit is a universal solvent of any standards or dignity.  
My family has voted Labour since Labour was invented.Don't tell me we're traitors to the cause because we're against Brexit. 
So the (unionist) LibDems want a second vote on the 2016 referendum, yet think it’s wrong for a second independence referendum in Scotland. Talk about stinking of hypocrisy! To think I was once a LibDem councillor 2010-13 down south. #Ashamed. 
So in today’s #Lab18 they’ve managed alienate supporters of Scottish independence by saying they’d block a referendum, then the Chair of conference managed to make a derogatory swipe at Catholics by ‘joking’ he wouldn’t call a speaker who’d blessed herself. Not a good start! 
One of the most thoughtful contributions at #lab18 thus far from @PaulEmbery "if we go as a party for 2nd referendum, what message of hope does that send to scores of voters in North East Derbys, Mansfield, Amber Valley, Bolsover et al who voted Brexit?" We know better than them? 
Israel / Palestine over Brexit and the NHS. Sure. That really makes this Labour Party look serious about wanting to get out of opposition and be in charge of this country.

I knew that a second referendum on Brexit would be the twist in #Bodyguard 
Absolutely Harry. The democratically elected Scottish Parliament voted on March 29th last year by 69 votes to 59 to hold a 2nd independence referendum. How can Labour or Westminster deny us that right? You are either a democratic or not. The Parliament's will must be recognised.

Come on peeps this is vital...Jo & team have won the referral to the ECJ to consider our unilateral ability to #RevokeA50, stop #Brexit & #Remain in the EU with Rebate etc intact.Please give what you can to.the battle fundYou Country Needs You!Lets also get that #PeoplesVote 
One Brexit source who feared security services are spying on Brexiteers said they heard clicks on their phone line or scrambled noises  
My colleague @luluchops1 is bang on: 'Supporting a second referendum could do for Labour what entering government with the Tories did for the Lib Dems - destroy the party for a generation.' #Lab18 
Palestine is a higher priority for Labour members than Brexit or the NHS  
Theresa May, whilst Home Secretary, declined a request from the security services to investigate LeaveEU founder Arron Banks - who was then a Tory party contributor. The stench from Downing St is overpowering. 
How weird. I’ve been gripped by #BodyGuard for weeks but only in this episode have I realised how INCREDIBLY SHIT IT IS!!!!Shit acting.Shit lines.Shot plot.We’ve all been brainwashed.Like with Brexit or something. 
Q: Why are #FBPE frothers so spiteful towards #Brexit supporters, wishing them dead or hurt?A: Because they see us as scum, the trash of society, and themselves in their half-arsed attempt at social climbing as way above us.This is not rocket science.#Brexit is now a class war 
There’s an emergency cabinet meeting tomorrow @ 11 am - I wonder what could be on the agenda ... getting in ahead of labours vote on Tuesday to see if we’ll have a vote on the final deal ? Resign ? Cancel brexit ? .. any ideas ? 
The education referendum would help prepare our community for the challenges of the future by getting our children ready for the careers of tomorrow. Learn more at  #InvestingInStudents 
As conference decides on Brexit motions, this is why Brexit attacks Labour values. Time for a #PeoplesVote#OFOC 
#Brexit dream of independent trade is no prize at all @InFactsOrg 
Hope BBC/media do better job of analysing @iealondon's "Brexit plan" than with @Econs4FreeTrade.Start by asking:a) what *specific* regulations/protections would be removed? b) what is the estimate of impacts on trade volumes with EU?& get some real economists to critique.. 
This is leadership - actual proper leadership. Listen up Theresa May. "Nicola Sturgeon has pulled the plug on multi-million pound grants for Amazon until they pay Scottish workers the Living Wage"#indyref2 #brexit #DissolveTheUnion 
When your argument for #Brexit is so weak and pathetic, you have to resort to this level of debate, you have lost the argument. Why are you so afraid of a democratic #PeoplesVote Mr Dale? 
Trump insists that the 2018 midterms be a referendum on him. Deal!  
In another bizarre turn of events outside #lab18 Brexit composite, not enough of the compromise motions were printed, so I am sprinting around hotel lobbies finding a printer.It's going to be a hell of an evening, folks. 
If Westminster is to decide on if Scotland has another #indyref then Scotland should be the ones to give the go-ahead on a #peoplesvote.If there's another snap election then it could be the SNP who bury Brexit anyway. Oh the irony    
“How to beat a Tory Brexit”Our CEO @eloisetodd: Labour needs to take a leading role against Brexit to win this fight. At an event by @labour4europe + @PES_PSE with @Femi_Sorry @RCorbettMEP @prentoulis @mikegalsworthy on stage. 
How messed up British politics is right now: the party behind Brexit and tasked with executing it (Tories) is led by a woman who opposed Brexit (Theresa May), while the party whose members are opposed to Brexit (Labour) is led by someone who tacitly supported it (Jeremy Corbyn).  
“Nobody voted to lose their job” says Corbyn of the Europe referendum. Very true but alas because of Brexit it’s also true some Leaver voters might 
I voted Remain, but I hope Len McCluskey & many others close @jeremycorbyn allies remind Corbyn that caving to the FBPE/"People's Vote" cult would be electoral suicide. Brexit is destroying the Tories. LET IT. Do NOT be the party that tries 2 reverse brexit. #LabourConference2018 
Were it not so totally unsurprising it would be astonishing that CLPs think it more important to debate "Palestine" than Brexit.Corbyn's Labour in one... pic.twitter.com/r9BNeH53b4 
Hundreds of young Labour activists flock to newly created app to push party to back new Brexit referendum  
Len McCluskey:"New referendum must exclude any option to 'remain in EU', & should only be on Theresa May's Deal.""If the people vote against the deal, she has to resign, & there has to be a gen-election."@johnmcdonnellMP @Keir_Starmer @OwenJones84 @georgegalloway @paulmasonnews 
Maybot is frazzled, the country is being dragged down by botched Brexit and ideological austerityTime for a better, fairer government to reshape our society and our economyRT if you want a #GeneralElectionNOW#LabourConference #Lab18#JC4PM #UnfitToGovern 
So this is interesting - Young tech savvy activists who joined to back Corbyn have now set up an app to organise themselves ahead of Tuesday's crucial #Lab2018 Brexit vote and push him into backing a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay - and its attracting 100's 
Your only hope of avoiding Brexit, or at least it's worst effects, is by having Corbyn in power. May will only appease Hard Brexiteers.  
It's quite funny really, the North of England voted for #Brexit, they are now realising its a right wing hatchet job, i told my pals up there, they didn't listen to me, they do now, they didn't know about the single market or customs union, they do now #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
Why am I more angry at Labour over Brexit?Because I trusted Labour.I EXPECT the Tories to be evil and stupid. I assume it. It's the reason they exist.But Labour? That's the unkindest cut of all. 
So when the MAJORITY vote against indy in the referendum and for the union in the local, Scottish and general elections - that can be ignored?But when a MINORITY vote SNP & Green in the Holyrood election - that's a valid mandate for another indyref that can't be ignored?Eh? 
78 percent of Labour wants a second referendum. Jeremy Corbyn wants an election. A look at the party's conflicted relationship with Brexit, by @_StephenCastle 
Everyone needs to accept that people voted to leave the EU. We held a democratic referendum, people chose Brexit. It would be dangerous to overturn the results. We should be fighting for a general election, because the biggest threat we have is the greedy Tories robbing us. 
Imagine being a CLP and thinking Palestine was the issuetgat the British people needed to hearing being debated over the effects of Brexit 
Should the Labour Party Conference adopt the motion to support a People's Vote on the final deal of Brexit, with the option to remain in the EU?Vote and RT#Lab18 
I appreciate as a journalist you have your own opinions on Brexit. But those expressed in this tweet are absolutely vile.  
The Greens were one of the first to call for a People's Vote - let's not let the public forget the crucial role we've played in Brexit 
Jeremy Corbyn admits his party could back a second referendum, but Nigel Farage explains why he thinks the move will make Labour less electable. 
not sure i could go back to being around 'normal' people after all this #StopBrexit campaigning  after this, anytime i make friends with anyone who turns out to be a fellow Remainer i'll just be thinking, 'where were you when we were fighting Brexit? why weren't you helping?' 
#NigelFarage: We need to send a clear message to #Remain #MPs: If you betray #Brexit, we will never vote for you again!  #BBC #SKY #LBC @LBC @Conservatives @ConHome @labourleave @StandUp4Brexit @LeaveMnsLeave @CCHQPress @theresa_may #Tory #ConservativeParty 
We are willing to work with Brexiteers across political divides including campaign groups, twitter brexit campaign pages and Facebook to get the message out and say "we simply just want our country back" Please Retweet. #brexit   
Retweet if you think these four Dalek egg cosies would be better at negotiating #Brexit than Theresa May's Tories  
Agreed. We don’t need a choice between Brexit damage or more Brexit damage.Democracy demands that the public have the right to #StopBrexit.A #PeoplesVote must have an #OptionToRemain to be a meaningful, democratic vote. 
BBC caller - For the government to play chicken with other people's lives & livelihoods is entirely irresponsible... so a #PeoplesVote is absolutely essential.#FBPE #bbcaq #brexit  
If Corbyn says he is committed to a second Referendum *before* Theresa May's deal has been voted on, it will be a disaster.Why? Two reasons: 
I'm a strong and committed Remainer. But I also think it's a mistake to force Jeremy Corbyn to commit to a second Referendum on Brexit. Labour members shouldn't go down that road.#lab18 Here's why: 
14) But whatever the reasons, you are talking rubbish here.  And Verhofstadt is quite right to remind us of the past when ethnonationalism, racism, fascism and authoritarianism plunged Europe into war. And it’s precisely these forces that support Brexit.Ironic, isn’t it? 
No consensus yet in Labour meeting about Brexit motion - no surprise then! Can anyone remember a Labour party meeting that was shorter than expected? 
A minister has suggested there is a possibility of a fresh referendum if Theresa May's Chequers proposals are rejected in the Commons.   
October 20th is not a march to decide the flavour of Brexit - it’s a march to decide if we want to eat at a Brexit restaurant at all! Don’t let any fat-cat union leader or Brexiter tell you otherwise. But do make sure you’re there!!  
Speaking at housing policy fringe meeting. Such a relief to be discussing something that would actually improve the country - the sooner we end Brexit & tackle the housing crisis the better. I am singing praises of Attlee & his radical housing policy. Scottish govt also bold 
The people applauding Farage here are going to feel really betrayed when Brexit costs them their job and they find that Nigel has slithered off to the States on the first available flight.  
Ridiculous of Richard Leonard to pretend there's not support for another referendum. Agree with independence or not but there is support for another referendum. Leonard's lack of credible leadership is astonishing. No wonder Scottish Labour are in such crisis. 
All this talk of a referendum on the proposed Brexit arrangement being a, “betrayal”, feels rather like an adulterous man whinging that divorce seems like a breach of his marriage vows. 
Brexit: Corbyn under pressure from all sides over 'people's vote'  
Jean-Luc Mélenchon's first time at a Labour party conference in Liverpool tomorrow where he's a keynote speaker at a fringe event Interview here on Brexit, Corbyn, grassroots movements & all that's wrong with the word populism:  
No no I can top that. Family member who is rampant Brexiteer has threatened to sell up and live in France if May does not achieve a hard Brexit. Speechless!! 
This fact was kept from the UK general public during the Brexit referendum campaign. Instead, they were told UK has no control of EU immigration. A truly terrible lie. It’s scandalous. 
Labour lost because of arrogant know it all centrists refusing to accept a democratic decision. They did everything they could to overturn the leadership election and damaged us in the process. Now many of them have thrown themselves into overturning Brexit.  
4. Apparently the weaker motion being debated in brexit meeting is to have a public vote on the deal at the end of the process if there hasn't been a General Election by then 
I’ve just been listening to an “ex-pat” living in Spain who was complaining about immigrants in the UK. Peak-level Brexit. 
Roy Hattersley - A #PeoplesVote is essential... the idea it's undemocratic to consult the people, about what they want, is farcical.. this is #brexit reality... do you want to face reality or do you want something different & better.#FBPE #Lab18 
If you exclude an option to remain, a new referendum becomes pointless. A Bad Deal or No Deal is not a choice...nor does it put any pressure on the government to stop pandering to Mogg and do what's best for the country instead. #PeoplesVote 
Brexit - it is quite simple UK GOVIf you cannot deliver a deal that leaves us better off (as was promised) then you are not acting in the national interest.If you can’t act in the national interest you need ask the nation for help 
Something that has genuinely puzzled me. I'd appreciate any insight from Welsh people or anyone with insight: why did Wales vote in a majority for Brexit? It would seem obviously against that nation's interest. 
If they decide *not* to include #Remain as a voting option in a #PeoplesVote then the whole exercise will be rejected by the @peoplesvote_uk movement.The whole point of a #FinalSay referendum is for the British people to be given an opportunity to REJECT #Brexit#EndTheChaos 
.@UKLabour have just voted on what to debate tomorrow. Guess what they didn’t vote to debate?:-Brexit -NHS-Social Care-Climate Change-Local Government FundingNow guess what they did vote to debate, yes you got it:ISRAEL & PALESTINE #LabourAntisemitism 
Tom Watson claims to have been told Theresa May, then home secretary, was asked by security services to launch an investigation into Arron Banks before the referendum, but declined.One of many interesting nuggets in this... 
1. Meeting just getting underway to decide the wording of the Brexit motion that will be voted on at Labour compromise - seems v unlikely now that it will be a definitive yes to push for another referendum 
Tories are not fit to run a bath, let alone the country. They couldn’t negotiate their way our of a paper bag let alone Brexit #UnfitToGovern 
Have to admit I didn't know this. If they can't stop BREXIT they're stuffed.#quote: "Add up the debits + credits of every member state from France to Poland bar Germany + it comes to a figure LESS than Britain's EU contribution. UK's exit will be a MASSIVE budget hit to the EU." 
Race for Iraqi presidency intensifies after KDP nominates Fuad Hussein (former chief of staff to Pres Barzani). A key player in the independence referendum, Hussein as Iraqi president will be quite something & *could* kickstart a much needed new chapter in Erbil-Baghdad relations  
The "2nd Referendum" is the unstoppable story, can't see it not happening! #PeoplesVote 
Unite must exclude the McCluskey optionLen McCluskey says new Brexit referendum must exclude any option to remain in the EU  
Have we got an unquestionable mandate for a referendum on Independence? Yes.Do we need to ask Labour’s permission for that? No.Labour need to get real. 
I’m sending a clear message to my remain voting grandson today too - if he keeps fighting Brexit he’ll find himself OUT of my will. Teach him a lesson he’ll remember, 
We need to send a clear message to Remain MPs: If you betray Brexit, we will never vote for you again!  
Liverpool protest demanding 'people's vote' on Brexit piles pressure on Labour  
 So @scottishlabour MP Paul Sweeney says he won't see another Scottish #Independence Referendum in his lifetime! Does he expect to die within the next 3 years? @STVNews 
BREAKING: Sources say Labour leadership’s proposed #PeoplesVote #FinalSay motion is six pages long, but has just one sentence mentioning a fresh referendum on the end that “all options should remain on the table...including a public vote”. 
Pro-abortion George Soros is spending millions to try and stop Kavanaugh from SCOTUS.This Soros guy seems to constantly be meddling in politics.- He's spent millions to bring migrants to Europe.- He spent money to try and overturn Brexit. 
A failing, flailing, divided govt clinging desperately onto power & caught in dangerous tunnel vision, winging it as they try & convince the British public of Brexit with a faux-bravado that perfectly demonstrates the incredible fragility of the egos involved.#UnfitToGovern 
If you still support Brexit you either believed the lies or you told the lies. 
Labour need to decide what they are now, are they anti austerity, anti poverty, anti alt right, value NHS, democratic? Because Brexit is none if these things. They are either for or against Brexit. If they lose the Ukip vote its not a bad thing. #PeoplesVote 
I would go as far to say that those who are calling for second referendum are endangering Britain securing a reasonable deal. EU under such circumstances would offer worst possible settlement  to encourage voters to reverse previous decision. #Brexit 
We are not far right - just right - better than being a racist like him!BREXIT BLAST: David Lammy brands Brexiteers 'FAR RIGHT' in furious rabble-rousing speech  
As I said yesterday... Labour can kiss good bye to leave voting working class communities if they elect to try and block Brexit at their conference this week! #Lab18 #Brexit #Mansfield 
This isn’t surprising as Labour has moved away from working class voters & Brexit supporters to a party representing metropolitan middle class, comfortable off Remainer voters. The challenge for @TheBlueWaveUK leavers to capitalise on and a sad loss for the decent @labourleave 
Apparently, as I voted remain and participated in the referendum, I own the consequences. No mate. I am not responsible for the UK being an international laughing stock, leavers are  
Read the comments on this to see the brazen contempt Remainers have for older white folk who voted Brexit. “Gammon, dinosaurs, sad sacks...” it’s just spiteful, pathetic and, furthermore, the best reason to resist the #losersVote >> 
In the room for the compositing meeting on #Brexit.This is our chance to fight for a change in Labour policy, securing a commitment to a #PeoplesVote - to be voted on Tuesday.Ps - I am an experienced poker player. Tonight the stakes could not be higher. Game on.  
WATCH IN 60 SECONDS @goddersbloom: I don't give a **** how much a BMW is going to cost. I want my country back! Retweet if you want #Brexit  
If I can fuck up my mental health, lose my job, have just enough to pay a months rent & put my family’s life in danger, all that while taking on the entire Conservative establishment, as a citizen...why can’t Corbyn at least stand up & call for a 2nd referendum? A damn shame. 
If ever you needed to know how stupid Brexit is, call off the search. Proof if you needed it.

This is a historic moment for our party.We can sit back and allow the Tory government to wreck our country through Brexit.Or we can listen to our members and back a #PeoplesVote, which gives the option to remain in the EU. 
It's funny how terrified the Tory Brexit Taliban media cheerleaders are of the will of the now much better informed people. 
Wow. Is this confirmation from the Conservatives that they're happy to be an accessory after the fact that both Leave campaigns broke electoral law to secure that 2016 referendum?  
Before the Tories say Corbyn is not fit to govern, they should address their own problems:Islamophobia Homophobia Racism Xenophobia Windrush Poverty Homelessness Housing Crisis Schools Crisis Policing Crisis NHS Crisis BrexitFailed Austerity Social Care Crisis 
As @DrPhillipLeeMP has pointed out, none of the Brexit options now available to us were even remotely considered at the 2016 referendum. The only solution is to #SuspendA50 and then call a new #PeoplesVote.

I don’t know how people have gotten their heads wrapped around this, but No Deal does not mean No Brexit. Please stop. 
In Britain a second Brexit referendum is growing more likely. But it needs the help of Labour's Jeremy Corbyn  
Lab repeatedly promised to respect the referendum result and yet are now saying they may campaign for a second referendum. What a bunch of massive liars then! 
Voters back Theresa May against EU bully boys as majority still back Brexit  
I've read and re-read this by @chrisgreybrexit a couple of times. It's a terrific read if you want to know where we are on Brexit and why. "The Brexit Blog: Britain is humiliating itself" . 
Macedonia will soon hold a referendum on whether to endorse a historic accord with Greece that will pave the way for NATO membership. Despite Moscow's unrelenting propaganda campaign, Macedonians alone must decide what future they want for their country.

Corbyn didn't allow Brexit to be debated at last year's Labour party conference, says if this year's votes for a 2nd ref he'll back it but speculation is he's working furiously behind the scenes to stop party members being given a clear cut option to vote for it. #PeoplesVote 
I have two questions for @LenMcCluskey:1) What will you say, post-2022, to those people who will have lost their jobs, rights and many opportunities by then if Brexit goes ahead?2) With that in mind, why are you against a #RemainOption in a #PeoplesVote? 
Brexit: New referendum must exclude any option to remain in EU, says Len McCluskeyThe Unite general secretary said including the option to remain could push Labour voters to the Tories  
One of our brilliant activists @AbdiwaliUK explains why Labour must back a #FinalSay on Brexit and why a #PeoplesVote takes power from the hands of the few and puts it in the hands of the many  #LabourConference2018 #Lab18 
The result of the 2014 referendum represents the settled will of the Scottish people even if the Scottish people subsequently claim it doesn't. What do they know? Divisive. 
The UK “Single Market” is nothing other than a means to control Scotland’s economy. We can’t sell our Whisky, Oil, Beef, Lamb or services to anyone that England doesn’t do a trade deal with post Brexit. Explain how remaining in UK serves our interests? #DissolveTheUnion 
Unite boss @LenMcCluskey wants Labour against having a ‘remain’ question in a 2nd referendum. he knows Labour is in danger of losing many of its Leave voters 
Excellent news! #Brexit topped the prioroties ballot and will be debated at #LabourConference The movement to #StopToryBrexit is growing strong. Together we can defeat the right-wing Brexit project and win both a #PeoplesVote and a government for the many. #Lab18 
BREAKING: Labour WILL debate Brexit on the main floorBy tomorrow, we’ll know what the motion actually says 
At event called "what do Labour want from Brexit". I expected Brexiters. But only 2 voices among 150 people said that Brexit should go ahead in some form. Most knew that allowing the Brexit to hurt those with least goes against everything Labour stands for.#LabourConference2018 
It's time to take back control of Brexit.  
Amazing response at #Lab18 to #FFS supporters leafleting and speaking to attendees and delegates. It’s clear that Labour members agree that Brexit is the fight of our generation and want to stand up for young people and against the Brexit elite! #PVForthemany#PeoplesVote

From a tax on 2nd homes to workers on boards, this week Labour is building on its progressive 2017 manifesto. the Tories are failing to deliver the Brexit they promised. when an election is called, a socialist, Labour government is ready.  me on SkyNews from Labour conference.  
So it comes down to this, defeat Chequers, call a GE, vote out the Tories and Tory #Brexit, vote for Corbyn and a @UKLabour Brexit? No fucking way! We are the King Makers. The two main parties would do well to remember that.#peoplesvote with an option to #Remain 
When Ireland joined the EEC income per Head was 55% of then EU average. Today Irish income per head (GNI) is 37% higher than the United Kingdom’s. Brexit actually emphatically confirms Ireland’s voluntary choice to be part of the European Union. But thanks for thinking of us. X  
Absurd and divisive to call a pro-Remain pro-EU position ‘middle-class’. Also totally untrue: every study shows that it is the least well off in Leave areas who will be most hurt by Brexit, not the prosperous of Kensington - or even Islington  
Len McCuskey sounds more like Rees-Mogg than a friend of Labour’s. His attitudes are disgraceful and there is no place for them in a modern democracy. Stop Brexit. #FBPE 
Not sure if the original margin of 52:48 Remain was designed by @Andrew_ComRes to reflect the actual vote in those Tory constituencies at the referendum - in any event the shift of the same base , particularly the previous non voters to Remain is stark.

polling was funded by “Brexit Express” and meant to support the former Vote Leave and Conservative funder Jeremy Hosking suggestions of new pro Brexit party - appear to show in the seats held by Grieve, Allen, Soubry, Neill etc a trebling in margin of Remain support from 4 to 12% 
In these 11 Cons constituencies Comres polled 4110 voters1942 (47%) votes Remain, 1784 (43%) Leave, 283 (7%) DNVOr 52:48 Remain excl DNVBut “Referendum Voting Intention” now among the same voters in these seats 2195 (53%) Remain. 1692 (41%) Leave. 73 DK (2%)Or 56:44 Remain

When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of September 23, 2018 at 05:50PM, £1 buys 1.1118€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote 
the numbers below commissioned by ex Conservative funder pondering backing a new Brexit party appear on first notice to be concerning for the potential Tory rebels re attitude to Customs Union among Conservative voters... but... rather interestingly in the tables...  
Over 17million far right extremists voted for Brexit. Who knew.. 
So the brexit referendum is the absolute will of the people* and cannot be changed. But it’s fine and dandy to have a General Election every few months to try to claw back some semblance of authority?*provided they agree with the owner class 
Thinking more about Brexit. What happens if there is a hard Brexit which effectively partitions Ireland again.  NI has no effective govt now and 53%  of northerners favors reunification if Brexit. Will the British govt stop that? By force? What if Sinn Fein wins in the Republic?

So, honest opinion of today's #PeoplesVote march?Bad.Being at the Labour confrence a focus on said party was expected but it disturbs me how many speakers focused not on how to stop Brexit but how to use/enable it further to get Corbyn in. 
Thousands rally at Labour conference to demand party support second EU referendum  
I see remainers are falling for labour brexit lies again. They WONT have remain as an option on any peoples vote. You were all told last GE Corbyn was pro brexit then cried after you gave him your remain vote then realised what you had done. Why do you keep falling for it?

Alliances @SorchaEastwood claims NI is united in opposing Brexit. FACT CHECK - almost 45% voted FOR Brexit including clear majority here in Lagan Valley. Post referendum, number of NI parties supporting Brexit has INCREASED to include @uuponline. NO unionist party opposes Brexit!  
And there we have it. The #PeoplesVote is really just a second referendum after all. Forget the spin about giving people a say on the final deal - it is all about sore losers.  
Olly Robbins’ Brexit Gantt Chart  
Another big lie from the Brexiters. The ‘double lock’ in the EU Act 2011 would not have permitted further integration without BOTH a referendum & a new Act of Parliament. The crime&lies-infected 2016 EU referendum was pointless.  
If @scottishlabour want to keep the union together they should accept the possibility of a 2nd referendum and begin to defeat the arguments for Scottish independence.Compelling, visionary politics always beats inertia, vetoes and blocking. That’s the lesson of the last 3 years.  
Archaeologists and curators leaving UK over #Brexit fears  
“Uniting people on the basis of class” which class do you think are Yessers? The point of independence is equality for all Scots. No class, just freedom!!  An independence referendum IS wanted by almost 50% of the population. #indyref2 #deludedlabour 
Will Labour back a second referendum #sorelosersvote? Kinda yes, sorta no. The likelihood is they'll fudge something ambiguous enough to imply that FBPE types will get one, but not so clear as to infuriate the many voters who rightly view it as a con. 
Giving the people the #FinalSay does not mean a choice of either a #Labour #Brexit or a #Tory Brexit. The people must be able to vote to #ExitFromBrexit and #Remain in the #EU. A #PeoplesVote must give people this meaningful choice. #BrexitReality 
I rather think Irish EU membership makes Brexit (even) less logical, you imperialist buffoon.  
‘The Tories and Labour may want a snap election, but only a second referendum could solve the problem of Brexit’ The Labour tide is clearly flowing in the direction of a Final Say referendum. Mr Corbyn should go with it.#FinalSay #PeoplesVote 
The best @UKLabour MEPs are here in #Liverpool today to support a #PeoplesVote are you listening @jeremycorbyn?!?! The people are speaking and they demand a #FinalSay  if the #Brexit deal is no good then we should bin it! #StopBrexit @RCorbettMEP @julie4nw @JasonJHunter 
David Davis doesn't like Chequers because we'd be following EU rules without setting them.But even Nigel Farage suggested in 2016 we could have a Norway or Switzerland deal. He was proposing a solution that none of Leave Means Leave wanted, just to get Brexit over the line.16/

Huge turnout for the @peoplesvote_hq #MarchForTheMany -great speeches from @DavidLammy, @Andrew_Adonis & others. Back Labour, Stop Brexit!  
I was saying to Baron Glenscorrodale, Baron Cumnock, Baron Cardown & Baron Roulanish just the other day " is time to start uniting people on the basis of class instead of creating more division with an unwanted independence referendum." 
Hi @LenMcCluskey Many remainers voted for Labour tactically in the last GE, we wanted to remove the Tory brexit mandate. Mission accomplished.Labour were still 60 seats short. A 2nd Brexit ref must include an option to remain, or it won't fly with us.   
Using the threat of a catastrophic No Deal Brexit that would harm millions of lives and destroy the reputation of the UK as a way to prove mettle and loyalty to the will of the same people whose lives would be ruined by it. 
This is atrocious. It's time to unite people on the basis of ideas. Class has diddly-squat to do with it. Scotland's ideas on many things differ from England's, brexit being the most recent manifestation. #indyref2  isn't unwanted by me.

Thousands of People's Vote marchers shut down Liverpool city centre in show of anti-Brexit feeling. 
UKGov appears to have achieved a feat only the most psychopathic abusers manage of convincing a substantial portion of their victims that the more harmful Brexit is to them the better it is, and the more it shows they care.Shameful gaslighting assisted by a tame press. 
So many people say they’re fed up & want the Brexit farrago to end. Yes! The quickest way: junk Brexit. Any form of Brexit will drag on, poisoning our society, for years. #PeoplesVote #RemainOption 
Stark warning from @RowennaDavis at @blue_labour fringe meeting: "If Labour supports a second referendum, it might well succeed in stopping Brexit. It might even topple the government. But in the long-term it would kill our party." #lab18 
Disrespecting the referendum result does not disrespect our democracy. What does disrespect it is accepting a vote based on lies, foreign interference, breaking of electoral law, and not having any meaningful punishment.8/

Britain is humiliating itself. My latest Brexit Blog post on Salzburg, its aftermath, and its deeper roots in the Leave campaign and in the Government's entire approach to Brexit:  
Finally @Andrew_Adonis ‘The only good Brexit is a dead Brexit. Brexit means trashing Ireland, trashing jobs and trashing the prospects of the young.... We will win this argument. We will have a #PeoplesVote’ 
The only good Brexit is a dead Brexit says @Andrew_Adonis at #PVfortheMany Are you listening @UKLabour? Back #PeoplesVote#StopBrexitSaveBritain 
A gentle plea for calm on Brexit. No need for either side of debate to talk up aftermath of Salzburg. It was never going to be a significant stage in negotiation. Talk of an ambush is a fiction. Parity of respect remains crucial.  
The only good Brexit is a Dead Brexit!Wonderful from @Andrew_Adonis#BackLabourStopBrexit#peoplesvote #MarchForTheMany 
How about the UK join Ireland and make us all the United Irish Isles? England can stay out of it if they wish, because Brexit and all. :D 
At the @peoplesvote_uk #MarchForTheMany earlier. With Government #brexit negotiations in chaos, and the increasing likelihood of us crashing out with no deal, the people must be given the final say on Brexit. #peoplesvote. 
The UK’s fastest-growing financial technology company has applied for a licence in Luxembourg because of Brexit. 
14million in poverty, 5m going to a foodbank (many in work), 120k deaths due to disability benefit cuts, NHS on its knees, the utter shambles of Brexit, rampant racism/Islamphobia, Grenfell, Windrush. Believe me when I say the Tories are utterly #UnfitToGovern 
So if Labour wins an election in the rest of the UK they will block an independence referendum, even when the people of Scotland have elected parliamentary majorities for one?Way to prove why we need independence folks. 
David Davis: Think you can Bully our country, read some history books!We don’t just LOVE our countryWe BELIEVE in our countryIt's astonishing, a small islandSo powerfulSo successfulSo influentialSo affectiveSo magnificentGreat Britain!#Brexit #EU 
In summary; no matter how disastrous #Brexit is for Scotland it must be our fate to remain in the UK. Under all circumstances. The Union trumping all other considerations. Not a winning message for Scottish Labour I suspect....  
Excellent news. An EU court ruling on #Brexit. That should stop all the anti-EU feeling in the UK. 
Ignore anything this man says about not wanting another Brexit vote. He is positively craving it. Even his objections are half-hearted. Farage's desperate need to remain relevant and newsworthy trumps any loose ideological commitment he has to the fallacy of 'sovereignty'.  
It is statements like this that really make #UK’s neighbours think the country is loose of its moorings-‘Brexit makes Irish EU membership less logical’ so you want Ireland to engage in self-harm to accomodate the U.K.-get a grip.

"A people's vote for the many" - actually it's for the few isn't it, by definition - the many were the ones who won the real people's vote on June 23. #Lab18 #Brexit 
Germans are done mourning Brexit Britain. They just want to move on – and that is bad news for the UK.  
One of the key arguments from 2014 was Scotland’s democratic deficit within the UK, exemplified by Scotland voting remain - only to be taken out the EU against its democratic will. Now Labour are trying to use rUK votes to block a future independence referendum. 
On the day that Labour tells us their next manifesto will rule out a referendum on Scottish independence, we should remember the post-#IndyRef words of Robin McAlpine. 
Weird cos I've spoke to a lot of people who aren't interested in politics normally who have said what a shit storm Brexit is and what a terrible decision it is. 
#Lab18If the Labour party agree to a #PeoplesVote with an option to remain then they get my support and I would supect millions of others too. #Brexit #FBPE 
So when people talk about the terrible consequences of a "no deal Brexit", what they mean is the cancellation of all the 750+ treaties we enjoy as EU members at 11pm on 29 March 2019. Without a deal, all the benefits of those treaties are GONE, poof, just like that. 6/12 
Have had numerous messages this weekend from Constituents who voted Remain now wanting speedy withdrawal from EU due to appalling conduct of @eucopresident and his fellow unelected officials towards our PM. More and more people realising our long term interest not in EU #Brexit 
Right after the referendum, Nigel Farage got two of his kids German passports so they won’t lose out on the opportunities of the EU, opportunities that he fought to deny the rest of our children. I don’t hate many people but Nigel Farage is near the top of that list. 
DEMOCRACY: Len McCluskey says second referendum should have no option to remain. Why do you think the party wants another vote?  
In my opinion, it's for Scotland to decide if there is to be a second independence referendum not Westminster. #LabourConference2018 
So some want a General Election with:A Tory PM who is a closet Remainer driving thru a hard BrexitVsA Lab leader who is a closet Leaver now supporting a second referendum and Remain?What will that solve, exactly? 
Just imagine taking a "power to the people" banner to a rally to subvert the biggest democratic vote in British history. #Lab18 #brexit  
Liverpool. Stop Brexit. Demand a #PeopleVote #FBPE 
Noticing that, in the media, the phrase 'people's vote' is giving way to 'second referendum'. Bad optics.Keep saying 'people's vote' because it channels the spirit of 'take back control'.#PeoplesVote sounds like an opportunity.'2nd vote/referendum' sounds like a chore. 
Here’s another Labour MP being clear on Brexit.  
Lord Owen calls 2nd ref campaign "disreputable". It's not the People's Vote, it's the Loser's Vote, the public can see that, including many remainers. #Lab18 #Brexit pic.twitter.com/nJj90reXfx 
Notable fm the boards: Anon speculates FISA release may be related to Brexit negotiations.  
About to speak at the #MarchForTheMany in Liverpool. We are calling on @UKLabour to support a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. We do not have to do this. We can still stop Brexit.  
With Labour looking likely to support a 2nd ReferendumHow did you vote in the 1st referendum & How will you vote in the 2nd referendum?#Brexit #2ndReferendumPlease VOTE, & RETWEET this poll 
Labour's biggest Union backer .@LenMcCluskey announces that if there was as second referendum he would not support Remain being on the ballot paper. 
Len McCluskey says Brexit referendum should only offer  ‘deal or no deal’ choice. What a ridiculous argument! Of course a referendum has to include the option to remain! #FinalSay 
This is important because gutting workers rights and environmental protection is a big chunk of what the Tory right want from Brexit.Join up the dots, along with rumbling about a November election, and by January we could see a Prime Minister Corbyn with mandate to cancel A50. 
BUT REMAIN MUST BE AN OPTION ON THE BALLOT PAPER. The Corbyn group is already manoeuvring to concede a #PeoplesVote without Remain. “Jeremy Corbyn has said he will back giving people a final say on Brexit if Labour conference votes for it - The Independent  
Take back control from the #Brexit crooks, liars, charlatans and cheats. Take back control from the transatlantic network of opaquely funded think-tanks, right-wing politicians, democracy-hating billionaires and Trump, Mercer, Murdoch and Putin. Take back control! #PeoplesVote 
A desperate ploy by Unite’s McCluskey: seeing the inevitability of another referendum he wants to spike it by not having Remain as an option! No sir Mr McCluskey, we had enough tricks & deceit the first time round. 
I welcome Labour's opposition to a second Scottish independence referendum. Lays bare their utter disregard for 45-50% of the Scottish electorate, and exposes the fact that Tories and Labour are just two sides of the same self-serving Union Jack. #indyref2 #LabourConference2018

Dear @BBCNews It’s time to get @JasonJHunter on to national programmes, such as @BBCr4today or #bbcqt. His level of understanding of trade and the impact on the U.K. of #Brexit is light years ahead of our politicians. He’s a real expert and we need them more thanever these days.  
Labour currently describing their plans to force Scotland & Northern Ireland out of the EU against our democratic wishes & refusing us any say on the matter as "uniting" the country.I think you'll find the correct word for that is "subjugating" not "uniting".#Brexit #ScotRef 
Well-known EU tactic to insist on another referendum if 1st doesn’t give correct answer. However Brexit will or would have been delivered, Remainder elites can’t accept it. However I agree that Brexit has so far not been handled well. The UK start-point should have been no deal.  
Britain's opposition Labour backs new election over Brexit impasse  
Opposing a referendum is one thing, in no circumstances allowing one if ScotParl requests is quite another (not to mention being politically bonkers for reasons too numerous to mention! ). Corbyn certainly didn’t go beyond the first six words earlier in the week.  
.@jeremycorbyn on #Marr says Labour will back a second referendum if their conference votes for it, breaking his manifesto pledge and betraying millions of voters who voted in good faith to leave the EU #unfittogovern 
Next Saturday, Perthshire South & Kinross-shire SNP will be hosting @feorlean & @AlynSmith to discuss Brexit.  Hope to see lots of you there #Brexit  
Anyone who thinks we are going to call an election needs their head seeing to! The longer we govern, the longer the public get to see the Looney left alternative in full. Brexit is Brexit. Racist, hate-fuelled momentum Trots is the biggest threat to UK. 
‘Middle class liberal elite’ remainers. As opposed to the Eton educated, multi-millionaire, Brexit revolutionaries, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson. Salt of the Earth, those chaps.Pro-Brexit commentators really are getting desperate.  
Yes @theresa_may, you want to drive through a destructive #Brexit serving only a tiny tax and regulation hating minority, against the will of the majority. That is a monstrous and undemocratic abuse of power by a greedy and ruthless foreign-linked clique. #PeoplesVote 
Major issue with #Brexit atm is the way its incompetent handling is being used to sell the idea of overturning a democratic vote. Oh & the way the anti-democratic #IMF -controlled #EU has been repackaged as a lovely Green egalitarian Utopia only neo-nazis would want to leave. 
I don’t understand!  The average age in that room is 85.  They are leaving soon, regardless of Brexit.  
If a negotiated settlement cannot be reached, then a no-deal Brexit is not the answer  
Scotland has a mandate for another independence referendum, which was decided by the democratic will of the Scottish electorate. It is not Labour’s to give, nor will blocking it win them votes. Their appalling ignorance of Scotland is starting to look like contempt. 
He’s absolutely right. A second Referendum, with millions of £s, €s &  $s behind the Remain vote would prove to everyone that we don’t live in a democracy any more. 
When @IEBCKenya deliberately failed Okoa Kenya by creating arbitrary rules and conditions for signature verification; it was @EAukot and gang that celebrated more than Jubilee itself. Those signature verification rules now face Ekuru’s doomed referendum push. 
.@RCorbettMEP makes a fantastic point about going into Brexit blindfold. You put in an offer for a house but when the survey replays comes out regarding its shaky foundations do you stil go ahead with it. Thunderous applause from the audience #Lab18 
Farage right again.     Farage BRILLIANTLY outlines how May should negotiate with EU to solve Brexit DEADLOCK  
Have been on many post-Brexit marches and the #PeoplesVoteMarch at #lab18 is huge. 
That awkward moment when Brexit fans shout about 'democracy' but can't accept democracy gave them an 'advisory' referendum.  
There are 5 million Labour Brexit voters out there, if the party backs a second referendum it will make them less electable.  
Shortly before the referendum, Labour MP Wes Streeting declared that the EU referendum "will determine the destiny of our nation over the course of this century". The voters got it right the first time - so did he.  
The UK might just get a realistic way to stop Brexit  
Massive crowd at #PeoplesVoteMarch now through Liverpool to #Lab18 conference. As the Brexit mess worsens, more and more demanding a public say on the final deal!  
At least 5000 people are currently marching through #Liverpool for the #PVFortheMany march and rally.Members and supporters of @UKLabour have just one message at today's #PVforthemany march. They want a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal.@peoplesvote_uk 
Labour's position on 'allowing' a Scottish independence referendum flip flopping several times shows 1stly how little Scotland figures into priorities and 2ndly how hollow & flimsy any strategy they have on devolution really is. At a time when they should be offering alternative. 
If you sat down and gamed out the most disastrous start to party conference for Jeremy Corbyn, you’d struggle to do better than offering the glimpse of a second referendum, snatching it away, then topping it off with a refusal to apologise for anti-Semitism. 
I’m getting very scared about a no deal #Brexit. The only thing that is reassuring me is that it is such a catastrophic option, that it simply won’t be allowed to happen. 
If we're going to have a second referendum can one of the questions be 'When you sit down in a cinema which arm rest is yours?' 
Fantastic turnout at our #PeoplesVote March for the Many. We estimate at least 5000 braving wind and rain in Liverpool to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal #PVForTheMany #Lab18

Haven't they just said that they will oppose a second referendum even if a majority of the Scottish people mandated a Government to hold one? You're going to have to up the Scottish anti-democratic stakes now. But I seriously don't know how you can.....  
Your investment outfit opened a fund in Dublin to avoid no deal Brexit. So it seems you *don't* want to leave where your money is involved. Hypocritical much?  
Er no - that would defeat whole purpose of a people’s vote, which is to empower the people to stop Brexit if they so choose  
A second referendum would show the public that the political class holds them in contempt. #Lab18 #Brexit  
This line people are using about the Tories and Brexit - "Never interrupt your enemy when they are making a mistake" - is risible. It's people who are too dishonest to admit they're pro-Brexit dressing it up as electoral strategy. 
At #Lab18 @UKLabour is serious about re-building Britain. Making left behind towns and cities great places to live and work once more. That transformative, historic agenda requires bringing the country together, not another referendum and more division 
Friends! In an era of fake news - i.e. so-called "reality" - we saw a fake referendum result! And this was engineered by the Far Right - e.g. Kate Hoey - who claimed, ludicrously, that "17,410,742 is more than 16,141,241, you know!"Talk about the quietest invasion in history!

JACOB REES-MOGG: PM should ‘use will power to deliver’ on Brexit | Daily Mail Online  
If I understand Labour's position on Brexit as articulated this morning correctly, it is essentially: hand us the steering wheel and, with a bit of luck, we'll drive the car into the brick wall doing 69 rather than 70. 
Full debate unnecessary. The article is by Minford. His model and in particular the assumptions on which it is based are patent nonsense (EU barriers to trade must increase on hard Brexit) which demean the case for Brexit.  
Funny how the people shouting loudest for a 'people's vote' on Brexit are the same ones screaming 'bullying lefty plot' when it comes to 'the people' having a vote on MP reselection... The Pointless Endeavour Of A 'People's Vote' Over Brexit

Brilliant turnout at the March for the ManyThe only Brexit that protects our jobs, our livelihoods and our standard of living is NO Brexit.#MarchForTheMany#PeoplesVote 
Sorry, Telegraph. But the EU is NOT a religion. It is the OPPOSITE of a religion. Because unlike the cult of Brexit, the EU is based on facts, has no dogma, changes constantly, has no leader, and does not promise what it can't deliver.

Iain mate, if the majority of the population want a second referendum (as polls consistently show) by definition they are not an elite. 
Jeremy Corbyn admits his party could back a second referendum, but @Nigel_Farage explains why he thinks the move will make Labour less electable.

This is wrong. Jeremy Corbyn will NOT support holding a #PeoplesVote if the conference votes for it. In a classic fudge he will support putting the promise of a 2nd ref in the Labour election manifesto. Ultimately kicking the Brexit issue down the road until it's too late to stop  
For the Lisbon 2 referendum , the Irish people were given certain 'guarantees' on taxation and neutrality.  Unsurprisingly these ' guarantees' from the EU have proved to be worthless. 
I’d say no 2nd referendum though; just snap Tories’ spine in a general & then write “Brexit” on a tin of Quality Street, piss in it & pour it on Boris Johnson’s head. 
Neither Corbyn nor Labour have the faintest clue about how to deal with Brexit, the economy or anything else. They are bunch of the dumbest middle class commies and poly-students who never grew up. God help us if they ever get into power.  
CONFIRMED: Not only are Labour against independence, they are now against the democratic right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future via a referendum on Scottish independence.  
2016: Scottish electorate elect a pro-independence parliament 2017: SNP win majority of seats in Scotland at GE (again)Richard Leonard, 2018: "We want to make clear absolutely clear to the people of Scotland that there is no case for a second independence referendum."  
Putting aside the clear deregulation agenda of the article, this is a weird one to find the Telegraph publishing in the month before the referendum...  
Theresa May on Brexit and the Irish Border:“We must avoid a hard border in Ireland and we are so determined to avoid a hard border that we are willing to walk away from negotiations and have a no deal Brexit, which will, of course, mean an instant return to a hard border.” 
While I disagree w/ those who left Labour for Lib Dems, I am sympathetic to them as Brexit was/is a terrible idea. Happy that Labour’s newly clarified position now means they can all come back & have fun destroying UKIP-DUP-Bannon-Tory party forever. 
Corbyn would back Labour membership call for second referendum

UK Labour's Corbyn says prefers election to second Brexit referendum  
Scottish Labour opposes a second independence referendum.We need to focus on closing the divide between the richest few and the many, not the false divisions of another independence referendum.  
Labour ‘would back members’ on Brexit vote.Then let’s see that formally written into @UKLabour policy.No ifs. No buts. No fudges. No choice between two bad Brexits.A #PeoplesVote on the Brexit deal/no deal.With an #OptionToRemain and #StopBrexit. 
I see the squealer formula of [media conspiracy + (deflection x whatabouttery) / self imposed victimhood] is still alive. I expect #Marr will interrogate May about Brexit, whereas the only subject Corbyn likes to avoid even more than antisemitism is Brexit.

#Marr: If there was another referendum to either Remain or Leave the EU, how would you vote?Corbyn: Well's that's conjecture as to what the question would be. Marr: I've just given you the question. #Idiot! And to think he backs himself to get a deal from Brussels  
This morning @jeremycorbyn proved he is not fit to govern our country. He confirmed Labour would take us back to square one on Brexit, refused to apologise for the anti-Jewish racism that has engulfed the Labour party, and backed local councils breaking the law. #Lab18

Corbyn will let Brexit slide if they give him railways & water.Which is why he never wins at Monopoly. 
Looks like the Conservatives could be only main party not to back a referendum.Unless Theresa May calls for one, she could be either butchered by extreme Brexiteers, or lose the next election, or both. If she calls for one, everything changes. Go on Theresa, you know you want to. 
Richard Leonard tells the Scots, vote Labour and we will ban you from having another Independence Referendum. Well done Richard, your days as Labour leader in Scotland will end soon, you sure are a proper Dick Head. 
"Re-opening the wounds of 2016 isn't a great way of bringing a deeply divided country together."@AyoCaesar on why Labour's leadership may not favour another EU referendum.  
I don’t know how you can say people knew what they were voting for when not even the government can decide two years on. Chequers? FTA? More sovereignty? Fewer jobs? Let people decide with the blindfold off. If Brexit’s as good as you say you’ll have nothing to worry about  
*All* brexits are Tory brexits.  Born from the far right, based on regressive values, supported by a *majority* of conservatives & a *minority* of Labour.  Any possible #Brexit will damage jobs & Labour's constituency  There is no Labour #Brexit#lab18 #LabourConference2018 
This morning I spoke to @BBCNews on why we need a @peoplesvote_uk on the final Brexit deal and why I hope @UKLabour will support this with a vote at #LabourConference2018 
Richard Leonard opposes a 2nd referendum because 4 years is not a generation. Richard Leonard is open to a 2nd referendum because 2 years is... eh... and that's where he lost the place, the argument, the plot...Labour are as clear as mud, what will be their positions next week? 
This is because new post-Brexit non-tariff barriers to trade, in the absence of an agreement that entirely replicates that which exists now, would not be unlawful and would, indeed, be inevitable.  
So there you have it #inverclyde The Labour Party will deny the people of Scotland any say in their own future. The same party that will not stand united against Brexit or Trident. The same party that will not stand behind their own leader.  
To beat Brexit - now clearly the project  of the ultra libertarian, free market right- we have to integrate the arguments for a strong clever Keynesian state and active management of markets with being in the EU. See Saving Britain - and todays Observer  
Not a Tory BrexitNot a Labout BrexitNot a hard, soft or BINO Brexit.We are mobilised against any Brexit. Full stop.Listen to the cries of the #MarchForTheMany at #Lab18. We need a #PeoplesVote 
Britain’s Brexit negotiations in a nutshell.  
If Labour bows to the EU wish for a 2nd referendum they may pay a heavy price in their Labour heartlands where their support is already plummeting 
I wouldn’t be surprised if Labour adopt Second Referendum as policy. What an insult to Sunderland, Newcastle, all those Labour-leaning seats who determined the Leave result on the night. Basically they don’t want to respect your decision.  
The poll that claims 80% of Labour Party members want a so-called "People's Vote (Second EU Referendum)" was commissioned by 'the People's Vote'?Why has this hardly been mentioned by any media outlet citing it?Do things like conflicts of interest not mean anything anymore?! 
.@LeaveMnsLeave Vice Chairman @Nigel_Farage brands the EU as 'gangsters' to cheering crowds at our first Save Brexit rally in Bolton. Find tickets to our next Save Brexit rally in Birmingham here:  
Flip flop Corbyn. He stated only last week he would not oppose a second Independence referendum. Today at the Labour confrence it is anounced in there manifesto they will oppose a second referendum. The people of Scotland shall decide our future not a MP from Isslington 
Dear Brexiters,The man Theresa May has put in charge of handling your Brexit literally thinks workhouses should return to the UK and the NHS should be sold off to billionaires.Don't you care about your country?Regards,Tom#Marr 
That could be Labour’s fudge. A People’s Vote but without Remain ‘because we must respect the referendum’ 
If Brexit is abandoned and UK remains in EU, as now seems likely, and Tory govt falls, and Lab. recovers its sanity and appoints a serious leader, and Thickiteers are confined to asylums, prisons or ignored, could the UK once again become a respectable nation? After how long? 
So Labour want to step up the campaign against #indyref2 that many of their voters support. And they want to push ahead with #Brexit when Scotland voted to stay in EU. And to think they used to refer to themselves as “the people’s party”. It begs the question, which people? 
Scottish Labour leader @LabourRichard tells #bbcsp that the next Labour manifesto will rule out a referendum on Scottish independence  
This is amazing stuff from the Scottish Labour leader. Even if Scotland voted in a Scottish Government with a clear mandate to hold a referendum they would simply refuse to allow one to be held. Where on earth does this leave Scottish democracy? #sundaypolitics 
Wil Hutton spot on - Change Britain, Don’t Brexit ⁦@williamnhutton⁩ 
For those asking why we spent so much time talking to Jeremy Corbyn about anti semitism, it was unusual, but it’s the first time anyone has had the chance to put to him some of the stories that have dominated over the last few months. We also spent time on Brexit and policy #marr 
David Davis was lazy, ineffective and useless during his tenure as Brexit Minister - now Dominic Raab is doing his best to be worse... Crashing the UK out of the EU with bad faith will affect the UK economy for generations... #BrexitShambles #Marr #Ridge 
Richard Leonard wrongly states there is no case for independence referendum, completely ignoring that there is a mandate for a referendum from the Scottish people who returned a majority of MSPs to the Scottish Parliament. Time to accept reality & the democratic right of Scotland

Remainers the only parties who are against Brexit are the Lib Dems, Greens, Plaid Cymru and the SNP. Vote accordingly would be my advice. The others are offering the same Brexit with a different colour bow tied around it. They deserve what’s coming.

#Marr A disgraceful interview, solely designed to catch Corbyn outOn Brexit and antisemitismNo attempt to explore labour's exciting program for government#BBCBias 
Brexit fan #Marr feeding Dominic Raab easy questions & not challenging his answers, allowed him talk about 'Project Fear' could have thrown back at him this FT analysis showing the Remain forecasts coming true & the 'Economists for Brexit' forecasts being wildly over optimistic.  
If #LabourConference were to block #Brexit it would be worse than a crime it would be a blunder. A #KhakiElection would then follow. May for Britain #Corbyn for the #EU. The Tories would win. Bigly.

Kate Hoey MP: Labour Conference must not seek to overturn the EU referendum outcome  @KateHoeyMP 
Jeremy Corbyn has said he will back a second #Brexit referendum if it is supported by a conference of his party. A significant development, Labour finally providing an alternative voice in this debate, probably on foot of a poll showing 86% of Lab members want 2nd vote! 
Yes Frankie B. Brexit, Trump, the rise of the far right - all are symptoms. Neoliberalism,rampant inequality, secular stagnation, climate change, resource fatigue, rapid technological shifts - these are the causes. Ones @UKLabour must&will find answers for 
Conference resolved in 2016: “Unless the final settlement proves to be acceptable then the option of retaining EU membership should be retained. The final settlement should be subject to approval, through Parliament & potentially through a general election or a referendum.” 
What is the BBC agenda? Andrew Marr interviewing Corbyn this morning. 7 minutes on Brexit and the sorry state we are in. So far 10 minutes on anti Semitism and still going on! #marr 1/ 
Corybn says he is "bound by the democracy of our party" on a second referendum.It's a shame he doesn't feel bound by the democracy of Britain.  
On the idea of a second referendum, @jeremycorbyn says: “Let’s see what comes out of conference and then obviously I am bound by the democracy of our party.” #marr 
Corbyn refuses to say whether he would vote Remain or Leave in a second EU referendum. “It depends on the question”. Marr: “I’ve just given it to you” #Marr 
Then, says @LenMcCluskey, if May lost the referendum, there’d be a general election, Labour would win and be in place to negotiate a better deal. Which seems to mean that he would campaign in a referendum for No Deal. 
Marr: "How would you vote in a second referendum?"Corbyn: "That's conjecture" 
Ditto on this. We all witnessed the Russian bots pushing #Brexit and bigging up Farage etc. We know of Arron Banks' extensive and questionable Russian links. But unlike the US no UK law enforcement agency is probing Putin's impact on the EU ref  
Corbyn won’t commit to answering the million dollar question... would you vote leave or remain now if there was a referendum The man is a con artist of the highest order #Marr 
Nigel Farage - "I thought we had won the referendum and it was all over but we have got to go and fight back and fight back hard."Today the people’s army is being remobilised." #Brexit  
If Labour backs a second referendum, it'll be lucky to keep 8 or 9 million voters.The Tories would easily nab 2 million leavers from Labour and will be on 15 million.The 2nd ref is suicide.#PeoplesVote#LabourConference2018 
Brexit Secretary @DominicRaab says “No-deal won’t be the end of the world.” #marr 
But where's the analysis of the IRA/Cambridge Analytica impact on #Brexit? Non-existent because the govt refuse to force Facebook and Twitter to give up the data.  
Jeremy Corbyn will support a second Brexit referendum if party members vote for one at the Labour conference  
No10 planning a snap election might not be that mad.If Tories lose, Labour carry the can for Brexit fate & Tories can heckle from opposition benches, saving party unity.If Tories win, they can shed DUP & so do Canada deal (with NI-EU aligned).But if it’s hung again...  
Love how Dominic Raab claims more democracy on Brexit could stoke extremists when future Tory leader Boris Johnson is allowed to bait Muslim women. 
I never thought we could have a more useless, evasive and ineffectual Brexit Secretary than David Davis.Congratulations to Dominic Raab for achieving the impossible.#marr 
Right now, this is the angriest I've ever been about what's happening to my country. We should be focussing on schools, jobs, homelessness, affordable housing, NHS, public transport, the environment... Instead, Brexit ruins everything. A colossal waste of time, money & resources.

Spot on by @chrisgreybrexit - "That is the humiliation, and it has been brought upon us by Brexiters and the Brexit government – not as an inevitable consequence of Brexit, but as an inevitable consequence of the way that Brexit has been undertaken."  
You can't pick & choose which parts of the 2016 campaign people voted for. When @OFOCBrexit tours Leave-voting areas they tell us they voted for more control, a better NHS, and to be better-off.Almost all indications show that Brexit will be the opposite of what they voted for. 
Brexit may be great for people like Jacob Rees-Mogg, but not so great if you work in, say, the car industry  
.@DominicRaab can say what he likes about Salzburg and point the finger of blame at the EU for rejecting Chequers (because it is unworkable), but this Brexit calamity was so predictable. #Marr 
A GE in November would likely deliver a socialist Labour government if they back a second Brexit ref. A challenge for business in the short term, but at least there will be a better informed debate and laying out of policy-resulting in clearer mandate for in/out. @DeborahMeaden 
Think I know more about Labour than you Iain and you’re dead wrong if you think this pressure all coming from so called Met elite. It is people turning against Brexit lies, Brexit mess and Brexit elite

Jeremy Corbyn has said he will back giving people a final say on Brexit if Labour conference votes for it  
You have to laugh when Brexiteers tell people in the North of Ireland that a second Brexit referendum would be "undemocratic". Have they forgotten how Northern Ireland came into existence - and why?

#Marr We HAD the referendum; THAT was the people's vote, and we do NOT need another one.Democracy in the balance. 
83% of Labour members support a peoples vote apparently, what they don't say is that those members are by the majority from the south. Labour members in the north of England by majority will never support a 2nd referendum. #Marr 
Jeremy Corbyn will accept second EU referendum if Labour conference votes for it

Good piece by @JeremyCliffe covers the part of the Salzburg summit that UK press ignored - the rows over migration, which played into the Brexit discussion:  @Cer 
If Labour members vote for a 2nd referendum and it’s adopted as Labour policy then we will accept that.It may, or may not, be a strategic mistake to do so at this time, but at the very least it would be democratic. 
If Labour do move to a position of a public vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal. I think it should ONLY contain 2 options:1) I Accept2) I Reject, & want A50 Extended to negotiate better dealThe public should only vote to approve Theresa's deal, & not reverse the 2016 result. 1/

Today’s column on Brexit. The humiliation factor adds a dangerous new dynamic. Dedramatisation of the backstop won’t work. A referendum in Northern Ireland might work.  
People of Angus, please always remember, you sent this lady to WM to be your voice. A voice, any voice no matter what. Yet she didn't even vote in the referendum. Do you hear @theSNP benches when it comes to Scotland? You can right this wrong. 
I hear JC will reluctantly back a second EU referendum, in which case I will reluctantly resign from Labour and never vote again, as my vote will have been proved worthless, so no point. Who needs political solutions anyway! #LabourConference2018 
Prof @martinmckee on post-Salzburg landscape:"Given the failure of the politicians to find a solution, the case for a further referendum becomes compelling. This has now been backed by the BMJ, the BMA, the Royal College of Nursing, and many others." 
BETRAYAL: Labour set to back second EU referendum at Conference. As Lord Adonis said: You can't vote Labour if you are a Brexiteer.  
Jeremy Corbyn will back a new Brexit vote  
Senior @Conservatives MP @NickyMorgan01 says she does not "support a second referendum" as it is the responsibility of  MPs to "step up and sort out" a #Brexit plan otherwise democracy will be in "big trouble" #Ridge 
Hi @SophyRidgeSky no convo about the "fairness" of a second EU referendum should take place without mention of the unfairness of the first when there was a massive spike to leave at the exact time Vote Leave criminally cheated. #Ridge

This is the full & final list of CLPs that have passed a contemporary motion for #Lab18 on Brexit - the overwhelming majority of which call for the party to back a #PeoplesVoteThanks to you, we can change @UKLabour policy this week. Thanks to you, #Brexit is not inevitable   
Not entirely sure what an ‘early election’ is supposed to resolve. They’re both parties of a chaotic Brexit and both massively mistrusted throughout the whole of the UK. The winner would be the ‘ongoing electoral instability’ party.  
‘Misjudgment has been piled upon misjudgment, error upon unforced error.’ The Observer view on Theresa May’s calamitous Brexit strategy | Observer editorial  
.@jeremycorbyn says he is prepared to back second #Brexit vote if Labour members demand he do so - but admits he would prefer a general election  
Observer quotes a govt minister saying”Nobody voted Brexit to break up the UK.” Curious comment - I am aware of many who voted Brexit in order to bring a United Ireland and independent Scotland nearer.... 
Remarkably candid from Labour's Shadow Business Secretary  on #Ridge on Labour backing a second referendum:@SophyRidgeSky : "In your constituencies, places like Salford, a lot of people will think this is a bit of a betrayal of what they voted for"@RLong_Bailey "That's right" 
Big difference. We had a referendum with a published detailed plan if people voted yes.....! 
It’s time Philip Hammond and the Treasury took seriously the economic benefits of Brexit  
Just as yesterday's GMS ignored Scottish angles when discussing Brexit, today's edition did the same. Presenters/guests are clearly seduced by the 'Big UK' and its 'important' politicians, despite these being covered already by UK BBC. It's as though Scotland is too wee. 
A few opinion pieces in Sunday papers today attempting to re-run or re-fight referendum on the 8th. We had the Referendum. The people spoke. They had lot of information in advance of making their decision - including a detailed draft law. Time to get on with it and pass the law 
Andrew Rawnsley writes in The Observer that last year's Labour Conference was "not allowed to debate Brexit" yet I have a clear memory of watching a lively debate on Brexit last year. Maybe I'm suffering from False Memory Syndrome.

@SophyRidgeSky stop calling it a “people’s vote”. It’s a second referendum to overturn the vote for Brexit. 
Dear politicians,We don’t want a snap general election.We don’t want a 2nd referendum.We don’t want Chequers.We just want the Brexit we voted for. Get on with it. Yours,Leave voters 
None of the shadow ministers Labour have put up this morning are backing the idea of a second referendum. 
Tom Watson cynically misuses the clamour for a second Brexit referendum as part of the ongoing plot to weaken, isolate and replace Corbyn. Supporters of "people's vote" (a Lib Dem policy) need to be aware of that. Better to campaign to bring down Tories & force an election. 
Wait until you find out that many of them voted for Brexit...  
It's funny that Labour could probably give us a run for our money if they were only open minded about independence. They could say something like "We don't support independence but if the time comes when a clear majority demand a 2nd referendum of course we'll listen to that." > 
Still baffled that people confused by Corbyn's position on Brexit. JC voted Out in 1975. He voted against Maastricht and Lisbon. He voted against his own party to call for a referendum in 2011. And he drove the Remain campaign to gibbering fury with his sabotage of its efforts.

Momentum telling their supporters at #lab18 to not back Brexit in the priorities ballot. But to back ‘Palestine’ instead. 
Corbyn two days ago: I'm ruling out a second EU referendum, but won't rule out another independence referendum.Corbyn today: I'm ruling out a second independence referendum, but won't rule out another EU referendum. 
Corbyn backs a second referendum if Labour conf. votes for one, but most expect a motion simply “keeping it on the table”.  
Brexit is like crack for some Tories. Here’s one Tory of previous high standing now shuffling to the DUP to “thank goodness” for supplying an ever-harder fix.Just say no, kids.   
Palestine over Brexit. Amazing. It isn’t even the biggest foreign policy issue, let alone anywhere on actual voters’ priority list  
Looks like the Conservatives ( a minority Govt )could be the only main party not to back a referendum. Unless Theresa May calls for one, she could be either butchered by extreme Brexiteers, or lose the next election, or both. If she calls for one, everything could change. 
'Hard' Brexit Minister Dominic Raab wants to scrap worker's rights. He 'has long harboured ambitions to slash vital workplace protections' and called for an abolition of laws that limit how long employees can be forced to work for each week...#marr #ridge #BrexitShambles

#LPC #LabourConference “I'm hard-left, hard-remain”:grassroots bid for #Labour support for referendum on #Brexit deal

 Farage - forgetting he’s still an MEP - says he’s been ‘forced out of retirement’ to save Brexit...  
"Brexit is more damaging than the financial crisis, and the damage will be more lasting."  
May’s problem is that she’s asking for special treatment in the Trump-Orban-Salvini era and Macron’s people says he sees Brexit in that sweep. As does Commission and Berlin (though less aggressively) which makes U.K. pitch v hard. 
"Jeremy Corbyn says he WILL back demands for a second #Brexit referendum if party activists demand one at conference"  Labour and democracy just don't go well together, eh comrade?  
Brexit Minister Dominic Raab's contingency plans include a mass import of generators to ensure sufficient capacity following a No-Deal Brexit. There is an air of desparation over plans to 'keep the lights on'... #marr #ridge #BrexitShambles

This is significant. Viewing a #PeoplesVote through the prism of factions within the party must now end. The majority of young people want to have the final say on Brexit. So do the majority of Labour members. At #Lab18, we can make a big step towards giving them one. 
Earlier this year Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson announced "it is highly, highly, highly unlikely that we will be calling for a second referendum". Are his predictions as bad as the IMF's?  
Once again @BBCWeekendGMS ignoring Scottish aspects of Brexit. Why do we have “Scottish” radio? 
Theresa May’s aides have secretly begun contingency planning for a snap election in November to save the Brexit talks and her job after EU leaders rebuffed the prime minister’s Chequers plan.

Thanks for the kiss. The implied question in my tweet was not “are you swayed by phone polls?”, but rather “do you acknowledge that the will of the people may very likely have changed now we are more informed about the potential consequences of Brexit?“. 
Peter Hitchens on a no deal Brexit, Mail on Sunday  
Brexit Minister Dominic Raab thinks that a 'typical foodbank user isn't someone that is languishing in poverty'. How is he supposed to negotiate Brexit if he has no understanding of how his decisions will affect large swathes of society? #ToryShambles #marr #ridge 
When 100k + turn out to march against Brexit we get told to go away until we can wheel out 17.4 m. But 2k in conference hall in a Leave heartland  is apparently a “big” turnout.   
PRITI PATEL"We leave the EU in six months & instead of wasting time accommodating its belligerent attitude, now is the time to unite the nation, believe in Britain & let the EU know that Brexit really does mean Brexit".  
They are going to try and tell you that a People’s Vote would mean less chance of an election and so it’s best not to have one.Then they are going to vote with the ERG for a No Deal Brexit. 
All eyes on the closed door compositing meeting results today. Will conference get a binding Brexit vote or will it be a fiddle to save the Leader’s blushes like last year?  
this is genius political dissembling from Corbyn, because as things stand members at conference won’t get a binary choice on a second referendum, they’ll get a heavily fudged Brexit composite motion  
Jeremy Corbyn has supported the right of self-determination and independence for nations right across the world, but when it comes to Scotland he pledges to stand in the way and lock us in to the damage and chaos of Brexit no matter.  
Great to speak alongside @Manuel_TSSA, @Tim_Roache, @DavidLammy & @julie4nw at ‘March of the Many’ for a people’s vote at Labour conference today. Starts 12 noon, St George’s Hall Liverpool. All Labour people - be there! We can do this! Our chance to stop right-wing Tory Brexit

Brexit can definitely be stopped now. Join the battle for Britain. #FinalSay#PeoplesVote 
NEW: Labour will commit to opposing #indyref2 in next UK manifesto.Party sources claim it will give Jeremy Corbyn a mandate to refuse to give @scotgov the power to hold another referendum if Labour wins power. Announcement due at conference. More @BBCWeekendGMS 
Over the past two years it has become clear that Brexit is a conspiracy by the super-rich and powerful and that working people will suffer mostHence the astonishingly strong opposition to Brexit amongst @UKLabour members revealed this morning#PeoplesVote 
Tory Brexit Minister Dominic Raab was a member of a Facebook group, The Ultras, that states 'selling off council housing, ending free healthcare, and bringing back workhouses for debtors are policies that "have found their time to enter Britain'. The Brexit Minister! #marr #ridge 
Brexit’s purpose is to destabilise the UK and weaken the Western AllianceIt’s fomentors are UK tax avoiders naively colluding with enemy statesIt’s been abetted by second-rate UK politicians +commentators who wouldn’t otherwise achieve on merit  
Alastair Campbell put out serious disinformation propaganda about  a "big shift in support towards a second referendum". It's not true.Should he be made to publicly apologise for his "error".Alan Sugar thinks lying politicians should be jailed. I agree.  
So a European Court could rule on whether a legitimate vote on Brexit can be reversed !Is it any wonder that millions (the majority) are sick and tired of this affront to British democracy and self-determination ?The gloves are coming off @LeaveMnsLeave

Ireland is the EU. Bilateral trade deals are not an option. #brexit  
Dominic Raab doesn't understand how important the Irish border is to Brexit. When the Brexit Minister was asked if he had been to Northern Ireland, he replied "I've been to Dublin"... #TotalBrexitShambles #marr #ridge 
So Corbyn and co make a few meaningless comments about listening to membership on Brexit and people start cheering. Again.How many times have you fallen for this, Labour? Until you have a committed anti Brexit policy, nothing has changed. Don't fall for this. 
Why Ireland's Border Is Brexit's Intractable Puzzle: QuickTake  
It makes me feel angry that two former Prime Ministers and one deputy Prime Minister are so against the people's vote in the referendum that they actively collude with & receive funding from outside forces to destroy UK democracy & to undermine the government of the day.

Right that is it. I am really against Brexit now. Sunday Times — ‘Pet owners who want to take their dogs abroad will have to plan three months ahead after Brexit, according to a paper to be published by Ministers tomoro.’ Up with this SKYE will not put @wooferendum 
The EU on Brexit is clear. They want a level playing field. Single Market and Customs Union. This blocks innovation and competitivenes between nations. They don't want the UK to be economically better. They want to obstruct by environmental and other regulationsWTO only way out

#TheresaMay vows to hold nerve after #Brexit talks hit impasse  
It has now been well over two years since the Brexit vote and Britain has become a paranoid and emaciated figure on the world stage. It's like a Rube Goldberg machine for voluntary euthanasia. 
Labour leader @JeremyCorbyn will ‘reluctantly back a second #EU referendum if his party conference calls for it,’ according to an exclusive in @TheSundayMirror. Could this herald the end of #Brexit and @Theresa_May? Share @Jon_Danzig’s report. Link:  
If #LabourConference betrays #Brexit with #UKIP lurching towards race- baiting #Fascism the Tories will stage an early #KhakiElection with #May “standing up for Britain” and #Corbyn “in league with the #EU”. The Tories would win a landslide victory. And Britain a very ugly place.

Thank you @jeremycorbyn.We believe #Lab18 will vote to back a #PeoplesVote, because #Brexit is a right wing project that hits hardest those who have least.Thank you for confirming that if we win the vote, party policy will change. Democracy in action   
The defining issue? Immigration.What delivered Brexit?ImmigrationWhat’s not been progressively discussed to this day?Immigration.  
Why do the UK media push for a self-destructive "hard" or a "no-deal" Brexit? ... and why do we keep heeding them? 
"Jeremy Corbyn WILL accept second referendum if Labour conference votes for it"hey all you guys at the Labour conference, no pressure eh!!!  #PeoplesVote 
We've been watching Labour slowly moving closer and closer to another referendum proposal for many months ... presumably the party conference will be the next move ... echoing the TUC Brexit stance.  
I’ve been in Australia for three weeks now, and pretty much everyone I’ve met (a) has brought up the subject of Brexit, (b) thinks Brexit is mad, (c) thinks Theresa May is a joke, (d) thinks the UK is a laughing stock. I’m glad I agree; I’d be embarrassed to be British otherwise. 
Labour will challenge PM May on her Brexit deal, Corbyn says  
He said not a single job lost.He said we held all the cards on #BrexitSo anyone with any integrity or honesty would admit "I got it dreadfully wrong, I helped put the UK in this precarious position, I'm sorry"A chancer of course blames everyone else for his mistakes

Labour plan to trigger early election 'within days' if Theresa May’s Brexit deal is defeated in parliament  
We'll just leave the text of a resolution that was passed at the 2016 Labour conference here: 
When we've stopped Brexit we will remember those like you who mindless promoted it and lied about it, trying to mislead us.Worry about next election - you will never be elected again 
Dear @theresa_may I've always voted @Conservatives I also voted Brexit I am seeing my party crumble before my eyes yr letting the evil @jeremycorbyn get a foot on the doorstep of No 10. If this happens I'll not forgive you. Dump chequers leave the EU so I can get on with my life. 
The threat to our democracy is this whole 'leave the EU' nonsense. An advisory referendum on a undefined result, characterised by lies,denial and illegality produced a marginal result, taken as mandate to destroy UKYou take illogical bodge to Eu and are surprised when rejected? 
.@BrandonLewis: If Labour back a second referendum they will have broken their manifesto pledge and betrayed millions of people who voted in good faith to leave the EU.Labour would take us back to square one #Lab18 
Corbyn is saying he will back another referendum if members want it...meanwhile on twitter, people are still complaining that’s not good enough just goes to show people will have a problem with him regardless of what he says or does...sad really. Also don’t @ me moaning 
There was to be no government running commentary on #Brexit negotiations. So instead, here is my running commentary on #Brexit negotiation milestones:Jun 2016 Fuck all achieved Jun 2017 Fuck all achievedJun 2018 Fuck all achievedSept 2018 Fuck all achieved 
If Jack can climb down about this bullshit then Parliament can dump Brexit  
Important note to remainers. Should brexit be about to come unstuck, it is very important to their mission that they are gracious and kind and gentle.  They will harm their own mission if they are not scrupulously big hearted. 
The Prime Minister (for now) is in very very deeply serious trouble. And so is brexit. Shame. 
Labour party deputy speaks out as poll shows 86% of members want second referendum.Corbyn, 2015: ‘Labour membership will determine policy, not me... (except Brexit policy, which I will determine, as I hate the EU)’ 
On 2nd Brexit ref, Corbyn: "If conference makes a decision I will not walk away from it".But, and it's a big but, he knows #Labconf18 won't make such a decision - cos Sunday's compositing meeting will avoid any move to make PeoplesVote firm party policy. 
Big stuff this. Labour's leader and deputy leader, in separate interviews, saying that if conference votes for a second Brexit referendum, they'd back it. The only question now is - will the 1,600 delegates be given a clear choice? Or will it be "composited" into something vague?  
Tom Watson tells Corbyn: ‘We must back members on new Brexit vote’  
Corbyn and Watson's comments have built a raft of hope for a surging #PeoplesVote movement inside the Labour Party.Our party can offer escape from the path set by an ideologically deranged government intent on Brexit at any cost to the economy, workers and the environment. 
Imagine someone promised you a People’s Vote once they were elected and they tried to force that election by voting down a Brexit deal but what they got was a No Deal Brexit but you still vote for them ....guess what happens next? 
Wow. Is this confirmation from Labour that they want a 2nd referendum and won’t respect the 2016 vote?  
Defeat for #OpenSelection and victory for #Blair second #Brexit referendum spells disaster for @UKLabour #LabourConference2018 
Significant movement from Labour leadership towards second referendum  
Some BBC journalist about the Brexit negotiations "who will blink first?"For crying out loud, it is not a game of poker! 
A new #Brexit vote ?  46% against 48 %. ...was the result To have another vote ? Will cloud the issue even further !  Call an election ! 
I'm concerned about Hammond wanting to continue free movement. What bit of the referendum did he miss? 
Corbyn will back a second referendum if his conference packed to the rafters with middle-class members want him too? What a complete and utter rejection and betrayal of Labour’s loyal basis of ordinary working people.  
Poll shows 86% of Labour members want new Brexit vote  
If Labour formally back a 2nd referendum it will only serve to prove to working class communities in the midlands and the north that they have no reason to vote labour anymore. They'll lose those voters for a generation. #brexit #error #peoplesvote 
"A separate Anglo-Irish trade treaty". Extraordinary if true. David Davis spent two years as Brexit Secretary and *still* thinks that Member States can sign trade agreements. Has anyone this stupid ever before held such a key role in a UK government?

"Labour should listen to members who want a new vote." Really? What about the Labour VOTERS who voted for #Brexit? Should they be listened to as well?  
Corbyn backs second referendum if Labour wants it as he vows to oust May  I hope he follows through on this during #Lab18 #MarchForTheMany #StopBrexit 
The idea that Theresa May could call *another* early election to try and help her deal with her Brexit issues *yet again* is beyond absurd. She’s just trolling us at this point.  
if (if) no10 genuinely thinks an election they'd probably lose could be their *best* way out of Brexit situation then god only knows how bad the Brexit situation is.  
Government negotiations with the EU have failed. The lies that fed Brexit have been exposed. 86% of Labour party members now back a #PeoplesVote. Now is the right time for our party to come out in support of a referendum on the final deal. We can still stop this train wreck.

Now that Jeremy has said he will follow conference decision on Brexit, conference should focus on the future of the country & call for a people’s vote 
Here is the fundamental flaw behind Brexit thinking laid bare:They understand cooperation as a zero-sum game.  
If it's true that both @jeremycorbyn and @tom_watson are backing a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit if Labour members want it - then the political landscape has drastically changed. 
I don't want a re-referendum that asks the same question. I want a new Referendum about the negotiated terms with an option to Remain. That is not the same. 
Good luck to my fellow Remainers who are at #LabourConference2018. I am a Centrist & appreciated #libdemconference strong anti-Brexit stance, but we need to be joined by Labour, Conservative & all to stop the insanity of Brexit. There's no such thing as a Good Brexit. It's all  
That @DavidDavisMP clip on the news just now with @IsabelOakeshott lurking in the background was literally meaningless to anyone who actually understands the issues. Was he really in charge of Brexit for two years ?

A failing, flailing, divided govt clinging desperately onto power & caught in dangerous tunnel vision, winging it as they try & convince the British public of Brexit with a faux-bravado that perfectly demonstrates the incredible fragility of the egos involved. 
Many Remainers are uncomfortable with using the language of patriotism. But that is exactly the language we must use. #Brexit is a betrayal of Britain, economically, socially, politically and culturally. We must not let Brexiters get away with posing as patriots. #StopBrexit 
whatever the merits of Labour’s current Brexit position, this poll underlines the gap between “listening to the membership, unlike New Labour” and the actual reality  
Some Leavers accuse Remainers of being traitors. But if such language is to be used, then they are the traitors, colluding in selling Britain's interests to Trump & Putin, and selling assets, control & wealth to a global super-rich elite who care nothing for the UK.#Brexit #FBPE

David Miliband accuses Labour of 'dereliction of duty' over Brexit.And David is absolutely correct.Corbynites: “BLOODY BLAIRITE CENTRIST!” 
So surreal that it has to be taken as a sign from the universe. These lads are the personification of Brexit. The arrogant brashness of the former empire but looking batshit ridiculous to whoever is watching.  
Theresa May has no respect for the disenfranchised 16-17 year olds, Brits abroad for 15+ years and EU27 nationals, or the majority opposed to #Brexit. No respect for anyone except tax and regulation hating libertarian fanatics & xenophobic bigots.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote 
I think the point is that it is a clear fudge. I’m seeing lots of supporters here who want @UKLabour to back a 2nd referendum  
If you had ever bothered to understand what friction free trade entails in the 21st century, you probably wouldn't privilege theoretical autonomy over real free trade and you would go back to ignoring the EU instead of supporting #Brexit. 
What a daft idea. The Tories want the complete opposite of what Labour want from a Brexit deal. The Tories want to slash standards and regulations, Labour want to protect them. And if you ultimately want to stop Brexit, why would you want Labour to help the Tories make it happen?

That bastard Farage is out & about in Lancashire today pretending he would have accepted a 52:48 result in the other direction when he is on the record saying the precise opposite on the eve of the 2016 Referendum. 
Every time #3Blokesinapub ask another question about Brexit we find out that our Government in the UK are lying to us.  If this doesn't concern you then you don't believe in democracy, you just believe in Brexit.  
Many leave voters are now agreeing with this from Miliband "The most corrosive thing in the long term will be a Brexit on terms that were missold."As a result they have changed their mind on #brexit and are #RemainerNow We need a #finalsay #PeoplesVote

I got this thread from @joshtpm's timeline. It is a brilliant and fascinating insight into the Brexit vote. It also says a great deal about the rise of the "before anything else we are the victims" headset that has overtaken the conservative movement in the US.  
Some people and countries suggest that most Kurds regret voting in the referendum. So here's a poll to get some idea what would happen if it happened again.If you were given the chance to vote again in the Kurdistan referendum what would you vote?Please vote/share.

Nigel really missed a trick by not inviting Jacob Rees-Mogg along to tell the excited audience that the benefits of Brexit will take around 50 years to maybe turn up.  
Britain's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has urged European Union leaders to get the "tone" right in their negotiations with the UK over Brexit following a social media post by European Council President Donald Tusk

Leadership is about dealing with the issues before you and there are none bigger than Brexit.  Nothing clever or noble about looking the other way.  
Does anyone know any person that supports a second referendum that doesn’t want to vote remain? Can we all just accept that it’s about reversing the result and nothing more already . They say leave lied and then try manipulative lies to thwart democracy.

It's not the EU27 who have divided the UK. It's the referendum. It's Cameron's decision.  And really, it's simplified. The UK is divided into more than 2. The amount of divisions grow each day, the closer we get to the edge of the cliff.  
John McDonnell calls on Tories to 'move over and let us get on with' Brexit talks. "It's time for an election" 
@KateHoeyMP in traditional Labour heartlands. Brexit support amongst Labour leavers higher than ever. Hope Westminster is listening! @jeremycorbyn 
My problem with the idea that the Labour Party are playing a long, clever game with Brexit is that they've shown no sign of being able to play the long, clever game in relation in anything else at all. 
Britain is humiliating itself. My latest Brexit Blog post on Salzburg, its aftermath, and its deeper roots in the Leave campaign and in the Government's entire approach to Brexit, just up:  
With the fear of sounding like a conspiracy nut. I was trying to think what other reasons would may have to sabotage Brexit. And then I thought how many more muslims have come into our country the last 2 years. 1millon 2millon. Even at a tenner a head that's a good little earner! 
I was born on the Irish border. I want to see a sensible exit from the EU. The referendum result must be implemented. The Conservative & Labour parties reject a border in the Irish Sea. Time for Brussels to respect the constitutional & economic integrity of UK.  
16) If you're letting their motives & attitudes be hidden under a fake narrative of "austerity caused Brexit" rather than a regressive cultural backlash, then perhaps you need to take a look at yourself and ask yourself what fight are you actually fighting, and why?end  
.@BBCNews @BBCBreaking WHY has #BBC not reported on #PeoplesWalkforWildlife ? Thousands marched. Nothing on website or news. This is a MASSIVELY  important issue. Surely BBC should realise there are other things that people SHOULD be informed about, not only Brexit etc.? Shocking 
An idea: Brexit will damage the economy, our services and jobs irrespective of if Theresa May delivers it, Jeremy Corbyn delivers it or Noel Edmonds in a fez delivers it. 
Give it a rest. Your party in WM is pushing for a hard Brexit which will ruin these farmers. Quit asking the SNP to bail you out.   
Hi @DExEUgov - can you pass @DominicRaab a message: young people really, really hate Brexit. We would tell Dom ourselves, but he's blocked us & @FFSake_ - will you listen to young people?#PeoplesVote #OFOC 
WHY has #BBC not reported on the #PeoplesWalkforWildlife ? Nothing on their website. Nothing on the news. This is a massively important issue. Surely BBC should realise there are other things that people SHOULD be informed about, not only Brexit, party conferences etc?  Shocking 
15) Just being brutally honest, the argument on Brexit isn't Left vs Right, it's authoritarian vs liberal.  There's always been a group of people who need certainty & order, and "strong men" to "put things right".  They're the people on the left of this chart.  
“Brexit is a national calamity that may acutely cost thousands of vulnerable families, pensioners, students, business owners and tax payers - but let’s not hold the government to account because it’s politically expedient for us not to do so”  
Forget Brexit: Michel Houellebecq got married today, yes, in a bowler hat, with Lysis. Carla Bruni-Sarkozy was there.  
I sense a really big anti-Brexit mood  among Labour conference delegates - lots on my train - & an appetite for taking on this Tory right-wing Brexit & defeating it in a people’s vote 
Kate Hoey: "Our vote matters and we won't allow it to be stolen from us." - presumably Kate is quite comfortable with the whole referendum being stolen by the organisation she worked for? 
Britain tells EU to engage seriously on Brexit, EU demurs  
One good cold winter could reverse Brexit by the look of it.  
That stupid IRA Leftie sympathiser John McDonnell calling for a GE is he real. What cause as the idiot got as a party they have said F**K ALL on Brexit, they are also a party full of Anti-Semites, and love Hamas, and Hezbollah. Also would move us closer to the Middle-East. A FACT 
‘Snowflake’ minister Raab blocks anti-Brexit groups on Twitter after this photograph emerges Another nice stunt from @OFOCBrexit 
Let us be very clear. When blame is apportioned across the political spectrum it must capture & expose the scoundrels who have been busy as a third column destroying every attempted effort to achieve the people’s referendum: Blair; Major; Heseltine; Grieve; Clarke; Clegg; Starmer

Tell you what get Westminster to pay back the money they stole from Scottish farmers first then get Theresa May to let Scotgov know what kind of Brexit we are getting even though we don't want one at all . Then maybe we may be at a point where scotgov may let you have the plan  
Opinion: Jeremy Corbyn could find himself with an open goal if he decides to back a second referendum  
By "treating the EU with respect" does she mean agreeing to a backstop in December then reneging, her Brexit minister Raab saying we'll renege on the £39bn, or Gove saying we'll renege on anything we agree on the future framework? #BrexitLies #chequers #theresaMay 
Then the impasse is yours, the Tories. You held a referendum on something that could'nt be delivered & even "no deal" means you're complicit in a hard border in NI.There's a lesson to be learned, don't make threats unless you have the upper hand. This is not the EU's mess.  
This is it, well summed up. Don’t buy the Brexit hype: it’s a border in the Irish Sea or the customs union | Jonathan Lis  
Brexit secretary Dominic Raab has blocked two anti-Brexit groups after a photograph emerged of him with a campaigner wearing a sign saying “he has no idea what he’s doing.”  
Ordinary people didn't really understand the harm the Poll Tax would do them until the legislation was passed.Then it began to cripple whole working communities, and the nation exploded with rage.Multiply that by 100, and you're still nowhere near Brexit. 
Next weekend the fight against Brexit goes to Birmingham to Tory party conference.  
#BrexitIsPersonal I have been mulling over a recent Cakewatch episode.  If you are not already listening to @GuitarMoog and @ottocrat, you really should.  Anyway, I thought I would write a bit about why Brexit is personal to me 1/ 
Let's be clear. Corbyn and McDonnell are as fanatically committed to #Brexit as Farage and Rees-Mogg. They don't care what damage it does and they don't care what the majority of Labour members and voters want. They act as if they own Labour.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit 
Moreover they mostly look 55+, as indeed I am. With all due respect to them, Brexit is not about our future; it's about younger people's, and they don;t feel the same way. 
Peter Bone: May said only alternative to Chequers is to come out on WTO rules & I think that's what we should do now.She should also tell EU, that, by making the decision not to engage with Chequers, we will not be giving you the £39 Billion.#Brexit #EU 
 Throwback to when @JohnSwinney eviscerated the Scottish Tories over how their Brexit division is dragging the whole country down with them.

Leave Means Leave ‘mass’ rally in Bolton with Farage, Davis and Hoey barely attracts 1,000 people. In contrast hundreds of thousands have attended #Remain rallies. The British people have turned against Brexit! #PeoplesVote 
I can't see anyone in that crowd who looks as if they might benefit from Brexit. Rather a lot look as if they might need the NHS. How will they cope when it is not there, free & freely available, to meet their needs?

Utterly embarrassing. What has happened to calm, open dialogue? Why do all our politicians now speak in this defensive, arrogant manner, with a faux-bravado that simply makes them look pathetic? #marr #Brexit  
Labour keep saying that they can negotiate a better deal than the Tories for Brexit but since they've neither committed to a Customs Union or to remaining in the Single Market or have proposals for the UK/EU land border in Ireland, has anyone any clue what they actually mean?

Dear Mr @JeremyCorbyn ,As citizens of Britain from all walks of life, we urge you to come out in support of the public having a final say on #Brexit, with a vote that includes an option to stay in the EU.Sincerely,Over 60,000 Brits 
If it weren't for all my lovely UK friends, and that it's going to be a pain in the ass for Ireland too, I would thoroughly enjoy watching Brexit unfold (or not unfold? Who the fuck knows?) You couldn't make this farce up, and it runs the gamut from amusing to feckin' hilarious. 
SeriouslyYou shit on their lawn then demand that the SNP clear it up.Youre a member of the government party that caused Brexit and is in charge of the current catastrophe. How can anyone else plan when nobody else knows what deal the WM gov will or won't signJog on!  
Let’s do a poll! Do we need a second referendum on leaving EU?#Brexit RT TO SHOW THAT YOU DONT WANT A #peoplevote AND YOU JUST WANT TO GET ON WITH IT!! 
Here is the saddest part in all this Brexit embarrassment.The EU and entire world is laughing at the UK London Gov and their slapstick Brexit clusterfuck,and yet around 50% of Scots believe this is the best governance Scotland can get, it is truly sick. 
It's obvious Theresa May has provoked the EU deliberately, this was the plan all along, she wants to blame the EU for her incompetence hoping we'll rally to her cause, side with her and the ERG and demand the no deal #Brexit she's wanted all along, b/c she's a gutless coward. 
I voted Remain and later realised the mistake and changed to Pro-Brexit.Following early negotiations with the EU, it was obvious that Brexit was and is the only option for Britain and the future of it's inhabitants.I understand how the EU slave owners think, we are a commodity.

DUP cannot have veto on Brexit border deal, says Ireland  
This is one of the clearest statements of the reality of what is happening regarding #Brexit I have ever read. It should be required reading for anyone following this topic.  
The Daily Express headline:"May's Finest Hour" for her humiliating Salzburg speech perfectly encapsulates the media's treacherous role in Brexit. The "enemy within" is the UK media. 
Your government want control of all food and farming regulations for seven years, and won't reveal any changes they want to make. Your proposed deal to the EU was rejected completely and we are now facing a no deal Brexit & you've got the brass neck to ask for Scottish govts plan 
Margaret Thatcher believed firmly that Britain should leave the EU and would have wholeheartedly backed Brexit. She declared that the European Project was the greatest folly of the modern era. She had no time for Brussels bureaucrats undermining British sovereignty.  
This is madness. Under no deal Brexit  EU manufacturers would move TO the UK. No evidence for this at all. As Economists for Free Trade would say, on the contrary....  
Whenever anyone says “Brexit” I put my paw out because I think they’re saying “Biscuit” and I’d quite like one.  
When T Blair wrongly blamed France for his failure to get a second UN resolution pre Iraq the right wing papers cheered him..before they turned on him. May and her desperate team are trying to do much worse re Brexit..the right wing papers cheer stupidly.. but watch them turn.

Politicians have said "Vote this way. It'll make you rich. If you vote the other, it'll make you poor." since the dawn of democracy. Is it any surprise that after decades of empty promises, people didn't believe the warnings about Brexit? 
This article in @TheSun which shows that @theresa_may was prepared to see a border between #NorthernIreland & the #UK after all to get her #ChequersPlan accepted. Thank God for the #DUP. The #PM on the other hand can’t be trusted and must go ASAP!  #BREXIT 
DUP veto claims are substantiated by its public blocking of May in December, and by Irish govt comments on DUP today. Public denials from the party are to avoid blame for No Deal crash.  #Brexit  
Would anyone like to hear how I would do a second referendum?  I thought not. I’d ask two questions on the same ballot paper. 1. « Do you still wish the UK to leave or remain? » 2 « If a majority were to vote to leave, would you prefer A (insert soft version) or B (hard Brexit).

This is a polite and reasonable question @DominicRaab why do you block politically engaged young people. Your job as a political representative is to be an advocate for your beliefs and policies. Or it is you simply don't have any arguments in favour of #Brexit to make to them? 
The referendum result is not frustrated by a rules-based international body refusing to abandon its rules to accommodate a departing member, you mediocre Thatcher tribute act. It’s frustrated by the fact it was based on an undeliverable promise UK could make it abandon its rules.

Conservatives unveil new Brexit Bus, blue this time...  
I'll make a prediction.Now that #NoDealBrexit seems more likely, Brexit extremists will soon start demanding we leave straight away, before the end of the year. Because that way we can have "more time to make new trade deals".How do I know this? Because #LeaversAreLoonies  !!! 
I have. I do and then I make my mind up untill I hear something that changes it. Approx 3 months ago I decided... Brexit is already harming people and it will get worse. We must get say on final deal...

A Tory fantasy over Brexit was the EU needs the UK more than the UK needs the EU. Another was trade with the EU can bey replaced with agreements with other countries easily. Nearly every expert warned those ideas were silly nonsense, and nonsense they have all proved to be. 
Was worried about Brexit but now I know these guys are on board I feel confident that the country heading in the right direction.  
Hi Kirstene, can you please let us know what post Brexit Britain will look like? I guess it might help @FergusEwingMSP plan if he knew whether a deal would be in place or not, whether the army will be distributing food, whether workers will be available for farming etc. 
Can the media, politicians and random Twitter accounts please stop talking about the ‘Irish question’ in Brexit! There is NO question. We will not accept a hard border. How many times  must we say this? The ‘question’ was answered with the Good Friday Agreement. Give me strength. 
No she didn’t. The EU 27 made no deal more likely by not taking this country seriously. It’s about time that you (a) stopped trying to overturn the result of the referendum (b) showed that you believe in Britain (c) started doing your day job properly  
Says the woman who didn't vote in the EU referendum because it was 'too difficult a decision". Rank hypocrisy! 
In short, either Brexit was a disastrous overplaying of a weak hand allowing your opponent to take you to the cleaners or it was a disastrously poor management of a great hand which allowed your opponent to take you to the cleaners. Which is it? 
Dear future prime minister @BorisJohnson Had a drink with friends last night and we all agree that you should step in now as may is completely on her own with Brexit. Even all the other party's think its bollicks. You wont get a better time then this. May has failed us miserably! 
In the name of the wee man. This coming from a Tory MP It’s mind boggling and absurd to think someone’s advised her to tweet this. Lest we forget who was “too confused” to actually vote on Brexit. Who pulls her strings  
We are not asking her to overturn the result of the referendum. No single Briton has the moral authority to do that.It needs a National Vote.A people’s vote.  
It’s worth repeating that our current Brexit debacle stems directly from the tabloids and their death-grip on the Conservative Party, and it’s incredibly strange that politics pundits rarely - if ever - even mention this.

"Work together to find a solution" sounds like a great idea, until you realise that the people who Cox is demanding Labour work with are the very people who created this mess with their austerity dogma, with Cameron's referendum gamble, with Theresa May's red lines ... 
Going to #Lab18 and as angry about what Brexit is doing to our country as I am? Support the #peoplesvote motions by downloading the #TogetherAgainstBrexit app produced by @FFSake_ 
This, this and this.People are attacking Labour for not trying to stop Brexit when:- they have tried working with Tory rebels (it didn't work)- they cannot legally stop Brexit- are advocating for Single Market and Customs Union deal. 
For those who write on Brexit, speak on Brexit and defend Brexit: Macron is talking about you. No one else. YOU. This was never going to be easy. There was never to be an easy solution. So this is it: you either lied or believed the lie. Either way, history will not be kind.  
12) If this is all true, how did Labour find itself supporting this victory?  Why are you pretending its all about Austerity when Brexit will make it worse for those people? Why are you supporting a right wing anti progressive flat earth agenda?Because,unfortunately,you areend 
Socialist Party infiltrates the VA Teachers rally today. 
11) So here is the real question for Corbyn supporters.#Brexit is essentially a victory for all of the attitudes Labour supposedly stands against. It is an attack on the hopes & futures of young people & those most hit by austerityIts a movement of intolerance & division 
Those calling for a referendum from the centre and centre-right likely know that. They just can’t stand the alternative: a general election conferring a decent majority for Labour and Corbyn as PM. Politically they oppose that, but my god would they also lose face. 
I’m sure I’m not alone in thinking now’d be good time for @DMiliband to re-enter front-line politics. The UK needs his experience & clear articulation on  #brexit I’m also sure I’m not alone in thinking Labour are no longer the vehicle for him to do that. 
Britain’s system has flaws. I’ve been as critical of them as anyone. One thing it does, however, is giving mandates. The idea a referendum can stop an unfolding chaos started by a ... referendum is really stupid.We need a general election. 
Among many other unanswered questions surrounding Brexit are the implications for Irish healthcare. Will there still be cross-border provision of services with NI? Will training still be recognised? Will we be able to secure supplies of essential medicines?  
a financial times journalist describes deeply deceptive if not downright mendacious headlines as 'cracking'. And then you ask why Brexit happened? It's because Britain still does not take EU coverage seriously  
I'm not proposing that we should adopt the Euro, but it has to be noted that for ordinary people and businesses travelling and trading around Europe, the Euro and Schengen are absolutely fantastic. #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE 
Great response out and about in sunny Stirling with @StirlingCitySNP. Brexit a real issue on the doors with real anger at the Tories inflicting this chaos on us against Scotland’s democratic will.  
Naz Shah on Labour’s Brexit position... make of it what you will.  
Remember when the Brexit vote came back for leave and the first reaction from those MPs was to*checks notes*Launch an incompetent months long leadership challenge?  
6) This "austerity=brexit" is a deeply cynical ploy to excuse Labour for supporting #Brexit, and to tie one issue (albeit an important one) to anotherIt also provides the cheap shot of "well if you support Remain you support the status quo of austerity you selfish Elitist" 
They predicted France, Austria, Netherlands, Italy, Sweden would leave, and that the EU would collapse right after the Brexit vote...the endless failure of their predictions never phases them, they just go on repeating them like nothing happened. It's a cult. 
Britain is humiliating itself. My latest Brexit Blog post on Salzburg, its aftermath and its deeper roots in the Leave campaign and in the Government's entire approach to Brexit, just up:  h/t @tconnellyRTE @BEERG

Those who threaten no deal #Brexit are perfectly well aware that no deal will hurt the UK far more than the EU 27 they are betting the EU cares about its  citizens whereas they couldn't care less  if millions of jobs are lost if people go hungry or die through lack of medicine

Another excelent episode from #3BlokesInAPub #3Blokes talking about reality of Brexit. Everyone needs to see this for themselves. Thank you @JasonJHunter and @EveryCountry. 
And if, all of a sudden, she is touchy about rhetoric...perhaps she could recognise the vitriol, bile and lies that some of her (former) cabinet ministers have spewed about the EU & its members,  before, during and after the referendum...and since. All on her watch.  
Fortunately @DominicRaab real life doesn't have a block button -  @OFOCBrexit, @FFSake_, and the 82% of 18-24 year-olds that are against Brexit will see you on 20th October ;)  
It isn't “sticking to its rules” over Brexit either. It won't offer either Norway (it insists on the customs union) or Canada (it insists on hiving off Northern Ireland). It is violating its own rules to be punitive. Its hostility makes future friendship hard to imagine. 2/2 
Absurd propaganda about how the EU must “stick to its rules” over Brexit. When does it ever “stick to its rules”? Over the deficits? The bailouts? The reruns of referendums it doesn’t like? The Selmayr appointment? 1/2.. 
Soros-Backed Group Ramps up Campaign for Second Referendum, EU Court to Hear Case on Revoking Article 50   
So. Tell us, then, how are you going to get 'better' terms?  What's the magic formula? There is no version of Brexit which isn't going to cost us dearly...  
 Brexit stories.Via @MattCartoonist 
Jeremy Hunt warns EU: Don't mistake British politeness for weakness over Brexit  
I said before the referendum that votes should be weighted based on years people have left alive. Those who were 18 at the time of the referendum are having their futures trashed by Daily Mail reading suburban fascists who are dead already.  A #PeoplesVote resolves this 
Can we do away with this ridiculous and divisive myth that #Brexit is the fault of the older generation. A great many of us voted remain and are just as despairing as the young over the situation we are now in. #anyquestions 
In teaching terms I can only describe #brexit as the most disruptive student in a class of 28 voluntarily choosing to expel themselves (because they don't accept the rules) and then banging on the window outside demanding access to all facilities of the school following expulsion 
Despite only managing 4 hours of talks with the EU, Tory David Davis amassed a £100,000 bill for RAF jets to ferry him around on 22 occasions. That’s about £4,500 per flight. British Airways offer flights to Brussels from £100. Brexit is a con from start to finish. 
Now at Tescos in Shrewsbury. Please remember EU protectionist racket means inefficient EU growers preferred to other non EU Mediterranean growers,due to massive tariffs imposed by EU. This leads to you paying more for your products! No more after March 2019! #Brexit  
Isn't it odd how the very same people who insist that corporations would run away from the UK if corporation tax is raised by a few % to bring it back in line with the G7 average are the same ones who don't give a fuck about the business chaos that their Brexit farce is causing? 
Chequered history: what EU summit fallout means for Brexit camps  
Well that's true. Labour's real allies are the Tories. British nationalist, for Brexit, used to be in a formal coalition with them 2012-2014 and all sit with titles and Ermine collars together in the House of Lords.  
I've realised I'm no longer anti-Brexit, but now believe the best option for everybody is for the UK to leave the EU and join the EEA: everybody gets to keep their Four Freedoms and get on with things, but the UK no longer gets to send their Farages and worse to vote in EUParl. 
WARNING: If you’ve vocally supported Brexit in the last few months, brace yourself: ‘because the people’s anger will be terrible’ (Matthew Parris October 2016) What have Brexiters achieved since and what’s changed?  
Call me churlish, but I have only limited patience for those who proclaim they voted for Brexit but have now changed their minds for all the same reasons they dismissed as baseless before the vote and now expect a group hug. Please don’t forget: we’re in this mess because of you. 
Hi @DominicRaab. You don’t know me, but I just wanted to ask you to unblock @OFOCBrexit and @FFSake_. They are campaigning for the interests of young people whose future will be affected by your decisions as Brexit secretary. It is your duty to listen to their voices as well. 
Thanks to @ingridoliver100, @Aiannucci @mrchrisaddison @SheRa_Marley and hundreds of others for their support. It’s really simple - the man in charge of Brexit @DominicRaab has blocked @FFSake_ & @OFOCBrexit - another way of shutting out young people from debate. #PeoplesVote 
If you're blaming Brexit on the Kremlin, you're utterly delusional. Yes they're probably delighted to see the damage this mess is causing to the UK and the EU, but the real culprits are much closer to home. The Tory Brexiteers, the right-wing propaganda rags, Farage & co. 
And both parties are ignoring that this is based on a 2% majority in a non-binding referendum which broke the law TWICE , fuelled by one of the biggest disinformation campaigns so far?

Very unscientific poll of shoppers in Broadway in #Thatcham this am. No one had changed mind on #Brexit since referendum and almost no one (leavers and remainers) wanted a second referendum. Lots of comments about dreadful coverage in media 
Court of Session - Scotland - European Court to rule on whether UK can halt #Brexit. 
It should be noted that the opposition to a disastrous far-right #Brexit has been led, not by Her Majesty's opposition, but by a grassroots movement of 10s of thousands of activists, #StopBrexit #FBPE 
Your party puts its own interests ahead of the country. That much was revealed when the EU referendum was first mooted. It was unnecessary, but Cameron went ahead with it to deal with splits in your party. You reap what you sow.  
It's daft AF to say it out loud, but  ultimately Labour's Brexit strategy is the inevitable result of the fact they are too divided to shape Brexit in the Commons:  
Proud to sign this letter because no-one should win by cheating. There are international norms and standards which the U.K. referendum failed to observe #Brexit  
Does anyone seriously have any doubts as to the implications of a Brexit Britain under the Tories!! Please listen to the people with the insight and knowledge. To Scotland, we have a get out of jail card, we need to use it.  
EU Leavers have been quiet & well behaved for 2.1/2 years since The Referendum while we've watch the Remainers creating mayhem, spreading lies & fear on the media, especially the BBC.Now we're at the point of Brexit.Time for Brexiteers to mobilise and sweep the Remainers aside. 
Brexit Has Brought Britain to a Standstill - Bloomberg While the government spars with the European Union, the U.K.—as an administrative entity—has virtually stopped working.  
No, the single biggest threat to the Brexit negotiations is Brexit

LIAR #MAY!  I will not overturn  result of the Referendum!  Doing just that with #Chequers deal!  Shameful lie! @BorisJohnson. #BorisJohnson 
Neal Ascherson's essay, written just before the EU referendum, should be re-read by all.  "Isolation brings out the worst in Britain. And it never works." #Brexit 
Why on earth is what David Miliband thinks about Brexit leading the news? Don't we already know? And in any case, he holds no elected position whatever. 
Simon Coveney said getting a good deal for Ireland in the Brexit talks is being hampered by the actions of political parties  
.@thomasbrake: Corbyn and his cronies need to wake up. You cannot have strong public services if you trash the economy – which is what Brexit will do. It is time for Labour to back us in calling for the people to have a final say on Brexit through a #PeoplesVote 
Everyone seems to have memory holed the customs union vote, which basically showed that, even on a issue which is peripheral to why UK voted to leave, even when Brexit is safe...there are too many Labour Leavers for Labour to do anything in Parliament:  
McDonnell and Corbyn keep saying it's time for an election, not a second referendum. Fine. So in that election, what will their manifesto position be on a second referendum. 
A handy reminder of two reasons why Labour can't stop Brexit in a single tweet!  
Britain tells EU to engage seriously on Brexit, EU demurs  
Shadow chancellor @johnmcdonnellMP tells @PaulBrandITV it's time for an election not a second referendum as he calls on Tories to 'move over and let us get on with' Brexit talks  
Brilliant from Andrew Maxwell on The News Quiz: "It's not the Irish border, it's the British border in Ireland. The Irish border is the beach." #Brexit .@TheNewsQuiz 
The abuse of war as an excuse for patriotic chest-thumping is perhaps the most grotesque feature of the Brexit debate. The memory of the dead deserves better. 
Good to see Yorkshire ⁦@UKLabour⁩ colleagues ⁦@MaryCreaghMP⁩ ⁦@RachelReevesMP⁩ ⁦@BarrySheerman⁩ ⁦@angelasmithmp⁩ joining North East MPs in calling for a ⁦@peoplesvote_uk⁩ on the final deal #brexit  
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY SHOCKING! TORIES RESPOND TO OWN BREXIT FAILURE WITH WORKER AND ENVIRONMENT BONFIRE PLAN! WAS IT THE GOVERNMENTS END GAME ALL ALONG  
Brexit causing a massive headache for companies in the rest of Europe too....not only are we shamed in the eyes of the world but we are causing them pain as well....  
Bravo to @AndreaJenkyns for calling out @JackieDP who told her to "give it a rest" from fighting for #Brexit. Have you  forgotten how #Thurrock voted in the referendum, Jackie? We'll remind  you... 72.3% OUT! Perhaps you could learn a thing or two about #democracy from Andrea 
Yup. The Tories' Brexit performance has been lamentable.. But lying in your teeth to help spark a war that's killed hundreds of thousand of innocent people? No big deal. A contemptible hypocrite fawned on by the media.  
#Brexit is like climbing a mountain because you believe there's a land of milk and honey beyond. You spend weeks fighting off freezing winds and frostbite only to get to the top and find there's just a barren land beyond,when a sensible person would've just looked on Google earth 
Your daily reminder that all the problems associated with finding a Brexit deal disappear if we accept Freedom of Movement.But neither the Tories nor Labour are willing to do that. Because they insist on pandering to racists.#StopBrexit#PeoplesVote 
My great grandfather was a POW, when the war ended the gates were unlocked... He made it to belgium before collapsing. Our european brothers nursed him back to health and helped him home. THAT is humanity, that is admirable.The farcical pursuit of ‘more for ME’ brexit.... 
So much for leadership and compassion for all those worried and actually experiencing damage  - this is from a senior Labour Shadow Minister , posted in response to Labour’s silence during the intenisying #Brexit crisis…  
gonna stockpile milka before brexit happens and it probably becomes contraband 
"If you fight you might lose, if you don't you have already lost."Bertolt Brecht 
I'm worried about Brexit. But I'm not willing to risk the resurgence of the far-right so that I can vote on it again.Can you imagine a 52/48 Remain victory? The establishment would move on but the country wouldn't. Dark paths lie in either direction. 
This typifies why modern politics is so useless. You have to join a team, hate the enemy & dance on their graves rather than fearlessly collaborate using the best available evidence to solve the imminent crises of global warming, funding public services, pensions, poverty, Brexit  
Archaeologists and curators leaving UK over Brexit fears  
At #UKIPConf talking to @ITVWales about why the @AssemblyWales should be abolished and how this policy gives @UKIPWales a purpose after #Brexit. It’s time for the Welsh voters to be offered a referendum on the existence of the Welsh Assembly @UKIP @UKIPWales #ForTheNation 
Unlike you Alastair to confuse tactics and strategy. Not “waiting for Tories to fail” — they already have. Labours Policy resolves the border & the tariff issues that are blocking a deal. But it also respects the referendum and that’s why you don’t like it. 
A quotation that works perfectly in the context of Brexit, as long as your enemy is Britain.  
Hi @DominicRaab, we know your Brexit deal screws young people. But last time we checked, that doesn’t mean you’re allowed to ignore young people!!! Unblock @FFSake_ and @OFOCBrexit. 
"Better to lose a little national sovereignty than a son or a daughter" (1975). Worth remembering, amidst all the bloviating about Brexit, WW2 and the Blitz Spirit in today's papers.  
The reality of Brexit is now *so far removed* from the Leave proposition - more money, more investment, existing rights and more opportunities - that for the government (or Labour) to claim we must forge ahead is preposterous.No-one will be thanked for delivering a disaster. 
Hi @DominicRaab, 82% of 18-24s are against Brexit. You might not like listening to @OFOCBrexit and @FFSake_ - but you can’t change that! #Unblockthem 
Rees-Mogg: A better plan is Canada-plus free trade deal for whole UK & solve Irish problem by looking at EU’s concerns, its rules & how it applies them on other borders.So solution is available much better than Chequers that ties us to #EU rules.#Brexit 
Hi @DominicRaab I'm young (just) Why are you blocking people like OFOC and FFS who are merely highlighting to you that this significant portion of the electorate don't want your brexit? You are alienating a generation from your politics. Very telling 
I was pleased the EU dismissed Chequers. But I’m not so sure it’s totally dead. The false Brexit of Chequers could still be fused into another set of concessions. May has shown an infinite willingness to appease Brussels. We need the cabinet to act.  
Tories respond to own Brexit failure with worker and environment bonfire plan  
Brexit negotiations are not inherently more difficult than others, they have been made so by the UK Government's persistent failure to decide on a course which is capable of being negotiated. 
What are these +'s? Problem with Canada/Ukraine./Albania type free trade deals is that this is very hard Brexit with lots of border friction. Only appeal is offer of a slow puncture rather than no-deal blow-out. Still leads to a flat tyre, #ExitFromBrexit 
Read carefully folks... @sajidjavid wants to suspend workers rights, environmental regulations and auto enrolment to workplace pensions in the event of a no deal #Brexit Hitting who? You guessed it,  The Poor...#DontBlameMeIVotedRemain#GeneralElectionNow#Lab18#GTTO 
Anti-Brexit group aims to win MPs' backing for #FinalSay referendum.Campaign will reach over one million swing voters in a month to persuade MPs to back a new Brexit vote, says ⁦@eloisetodd⁩’s ⁦@BestForBritain⁩.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote 
So they pretend to be in favour of Brexit in order to attract Brexiters, while also giving the impression that Brexit under their watch will be equivalent to Remain, so as to attract Remainers. This is fundamentally dishonest.

Keep posting this explanation for people who still don’t get it.  We voted (arguably) to leave the EU. That left us two options: hard Brexit, i.e. WTO or Canada, or soft Brexit, Turkey, Switzerland or Norway (EEA). Look below at the cost/benefits of each. Then have a debate.  
Can I say frankly - it is not credible for the Labour party to attempt to fight a general election promising to press ahead with Brexit when the election had been caused by the rejection of a Brexit deal by the House of Commons. That is project fantasy 
Brexit encapsulated in a one-star Amazon review. The book in question, Together, is the wonderful recipe book written by, and raising money for, survivors of the Grenfell Tower tragedy.

David Miliband accuses Labour of 'dereliction of duty' over Brexit  
I am staggered at the self serving silence of @UKLabour front-bench and @jeremycorbyn. This vacuum will not be filled by a Labour government unless we now offer a viable alternative to Tory Brexit land. Reality is screaming. 
Just a reminder when our tantruminng PM is wrapping herself in the Union Jack & the Brexit press is getting misty eyed for our Finest Hour that Churchill 70 years ago actually advocated creating a United States of Europe to ensure peace & prosperity.  
When the definitive story of Brexit comes to be written a few decades from now, the one profession that will emerge with more disgrace and ignominy than the politicians will be the journalists.  
I shall rely on sensible Labour people like @RCorbettMEP to read the tealeaves and explain what the hell is going on in Labour’s Brexit policy. I thought McDonnell was ‘not ruling out the option of #PeoplesVote, now I read he pledges to ‘press ahead with Brexit’. Oh God. 
Strong words from Ireland’s deputy PM. #brexit@simoncoveney “There will be no withdrawal agreement if there isn’t a legal backstop.”“Let me be very clear, the Taoiseach & I will never sign a treaty that doesn’t ensure the UK commitments on Irish border are followed through.” 
Turns out making fun of Brexit on social media actually works 
Chap I know, lifelong Mail columnist, 50s-ish, vociferous leaver, is so angry at how badly Brexit is going that he’s going round using his imaginary friends’ opinions for comfort.  
I think I may repeat this message every day. So when are the remain MPs going to stop supporting their pro Brexit parties and come out and support the centre ground if this country? 
I’ve moved my @ERC_Research grant from the UK, partly because of #Brexit. But let’s not forget the UK’s ideological disrespect of the cultural heritage sector (jobs are scarce & salaries laughable, we are paid less than construction workers or admin staff) 
Retweet if you think this baby koala chewing a eucalyptus leaf would be better at negotiating #Brexit than Theresa May  
Brexit is NOT a done deal.   The referendum in 2016 was a fraud.  With a catastrophic no deal Brexit looming we must TAKE BACK CONTROL of democracy from the lying elite in Westminster and give ourselves a #PeoplesVote #ItsNotTooLate 
Labour's leaders are going along with the Tories on Brexit - they are ignoring their members, voters and the damage being done to the UKLibDems want to give the people the final say on Brexit with a #PeoplesVote & the chance to exit from BrexitWhat are Corbyn et al scared of?  
Tánaiste Simon Coveney says “we cannot allow one party in Northern Ireland to veto #brexit proposals.” In reference to the DUP.  He says DUP accept NI “isn’t Kent or a borough in London.” 
It’s been four years since YOU promised us we’d stay in the EU it’s time you stopped pushing for Brexit and stood behind the Scottish PEOPLE who in a majority voted NO to Brexit - your PM had a hung parliament and had to BUY the DUP so get Off the high horse  
Well there you are folks. Fantasy Brexit Mark 2! What makes Labour think that they’ll be any more successful than Tories at getting cake and eating it?   
Love, Brexit and the Irish border When you live on opposite sides of a border that might not be invisible for much longer  
Mmmm. @Jeremy_Hunt - the man who handled the junior doctors' dispute with such panache - is stepping into the #Brexit debate and advising the EU how to behave. If they don't comply, will he try to enforce #Brexit on the EU? 
No doubt now that this is all just a slow dance to a No Deal Brexit. It’s all about the government positioning themselves to say those ‘unreasonable foreigners’ wouldn’t give the fair and transparent UK a chance. Just check the front pages for confirmation  
Grey skies, Huddersfield in town, Hard Brexit Harry Maguire dishing up the wallops. This is why we voted Leave. Hoping for a good solid 0-0 today with some quality defending. Nothing fancy, keep it solid and take the point. Cheers bob  
This unfolding Brexit disaster means we need an election where we can choose between a party hellbent on leaving whatever the consequences or sticking with Theresa May & the Conservatives 
'Jeremy Corbyn could find himself with an open goal if he decides to back a second referendum'

A Norway-stylus deal is the only kind of Brexit likely to get EU and parliamentary approval. Refusal to accept this leads to no-deal.And since Parliament could never accept a no-deal Brexit, all other paths lead to us remaining in the EU. 
Labour are ignoring what the people want. They’re hooked on a crusade to force Brexit thru, just because a delusional Corbyn believes this will give him the magical powers he needs to create a socialist Utopia. If this doesn’t stop - @UKLabour is finished. #ofoc #fbpe #ffs #waton

If people think that the Brexit facilitating, single market opposing, Labour Party are some sort of answer to the disaster that awaits us then they have some serious thinking to do. 
Tory internal politics might be where the Brexit circus started, but that’s a footnote now. Brexit is now a matter of supreme national consequence and that’s the only/principal lens through which any serious national journalist should approach it. 
You know how I keep saying that Brexit is a result of the UK not having reconciled itself to its history? This - from a school in London - is another consequence of that same failure to face up to the past.  
Well said by Michael Romberg... there’s no Brexit plan that’s likely to make it through Parliament. So any deal (or no deal) has to be ultimately accepted or rejected by the public.  
Interesting survey from Martin Baxter at Electoral Calculus. He finds 36 per cent of people would back a Canada style trade deal post-Brexit; just nine per cent want Chequers. More on Chopper's Brexit Podcast ⁦@brexitbroadcast⁩: 
For some time now Labour has been enticing Remainers by disguising its true position on Brexit. I regard this as dishonest. At least McDonnell has now come clean. When will the rest of the front bench give up their attempt to gain votes under false pretences?  
And all that in a time of legislative & legal chaos - with Javid-like plans slashing people’s money & safety.“Sorry you just got laid off. It’s worth it for Britain. Please go to your local bank with ID and receive your £100 Brexit cash bonus for the rest of your life.”

That key cog in Brexit machine: the emptiness of British exceptionalism and its terror of realityPoint out Britain no longer rules seas & you’re talking country down. EU confirm they’ll defend their interests over UK’s & they’re insulting us. Anyone would think we were insecure  
Spare us the santimonious charade and climb off your non-existent high horse.Yeah, Tories began this horrid mess but Labour has utterly failed to act as official opposition against it.For crying out loud, your own cherry picked Brexit deal would be just as rejected by the EU.  
We have seen tough rhetoric from @theresa_may before and it has proven to be skin deep. Surrounded by Remainers she is incapable of delivering a meaningful Brexit, in my view. 
Today's most important Brexit story - May took such a hard line with EU in Salzburg because DUP said "no" to her plans for regulatory border in Irish Sea @tnewtondunn 
This says everything you need to know about Labour with regard to Brexit. Rather than coming up with an alternative to May’s Brexit trash fire, they are warming their hands beside it. They don’t deserve your vote. No wonder English voters are disillusioned.  
The Labour leadership wants to push ahead with the Tory dream of Brexit - against reason & against the Party’s wishes. While these men are in charge Labour is a dead fish & it stinks. “John McDonnell: Labour wants to push ahead with Brexit - the guardian  
Think what this senior EU official is asking for and why. Implicitly he is saying we fear post-Brexit Britain's economy will surge competitively against our sluggish over-regulated economies. We want the UK to promise not to do that.  
Tories are led by a zombie, paralysed by Brexit, and so scared of being kicked out of office due to this self-inflicted shambles they've stooped to re-gurgitating lies about Labour leaders being Russian stooges. Happy Days.  
Our current leaders in the Labour Party are claiming that they won't stop Brexit because they fear a rise of xenophobia and the far right. Since when did Labour run scared of racists and bigots?When was appeasement appeasement of fascists written into our constitution?

The British gutter press is rabidly anti-EU and have turned their sycophancy up to 11 following Theresa May's diastrous Salzberg Brexit experience. In the UK's time of need, the press is utterly failing to speak truth to power... #BrexitShambles 
Polish Prime Minister M. #Morawiecki told the press after the informal summit of the #EuropeanCouncil in #Salzburg that Poland's position on the issue of permanent & mandatory EU migrant relocation quotas has not changed. The question of #Brexit was also discussed at the summit  
.@johnmcdonnellMP You say a #PeoplesVote could fuel far right, “give an opportunity to Ukip”. ... John: Brexit *is* the far right, essentially. A #PeoplesVote is the *very last* chance we have to stand up to it. It’s @UKLabour’s duty to take that chance. 
May doubling down gets a few good headlines, and possibly shores up domestic support for a few weeks. But what happens after that? She has just made a change of tack more difficult. Brexit comes with a hard deadline, and the path she insists on will eventually run out of road. 
No-deal Brexit would have limited impact on German labour market - Der Spiegel  
As a business owner in design, manufacture & construction industries - MAJOR industries in the British economy, I’m saying it publicly: Brexit is going to wipe us out. We haven’t even left, and the Gov. orchestrated uncertainty around this absolute shitshow, is damaging business. 
Placing a customs border within your own territory is not breaking up your country. Ask the United States and Canada.Recklessly pursuing a chaotic disorderly Brexit however is courting the break-up of your country.  
if anyone wonders how government propaganda works in Britain they can take a look at the front pages of today's UK newspapers and get an idea how Theresa May's failure to negotiate #Brexit properly is turned into her finest hour. And the beauty is that the nation buys that crap. 
Brexit goes against so much of what Labour stands for. Far right politicians cannot carry on dictating the direction of this country. @jeremycorbyn needs to get behind a #PeoplesVote at this year's Labour conference  #Lab18 
And I simply don't want this political debate to dominate my lifetime. And that's exactly what happens in the event of a jobs-stealing hard Brexit, a sovereignty-stealing soft Brexit or if it's perceived that the "establishment" stopped Brexit.We have better things to discuss! 
Can we be clear on something? I don't want Parliament or the government to simply stop Brexit. Even if it was after general election. Because I believe that unless there is a referendum on the negotiated outcome of Brexit, many will never accept that the public will has changed. 
It is increasingly clear that the Tories' Brexit negotiations are a shambles. The people need a final say on the Brexit deal - that’s why I am backing a #peoplesvote  
"You have thoroughly abused the considerable power and responsibility that goes with being the U.K.’s most-read newspaper to undermine *every aspect* of Britain’s Brexit negotiations."

I argued in June 2016 that #Brexit would be bad for Wales. Now we know that beyond question. Wales has NO SEAT AT THE TABLE; UK Tories have lost the plot; UK #Labour do nothing; Lab Welsh Govt hand EU withdrawal powers to Westminster.Think #independence. 
S#Brexiters are hitting the media claiming it's the EU's fault that Chequers was rejected and that the EU has to come up with another plan. Why, the UK is walking, it wasn't kicked out. Time is tight, so here's your plan B. Postpone or cancel #Brexit. There sorted it for you. 
Case in point. You'd hope by now that a very highly paid journalist would know by that that this wouldn't solve the Brexit impasse, without either an Irish sea border, or tech solutions years in the future.  
The assumption they "only have to win once" to achieve major constitutional change licences the level of mendacity that characterised both the Brexit campaign and the Scottish Government's White Paper. There must be more to "democratic principles" than that.  
WE DEMAND A GENERAL ELECTION SO JEREMY CORBYN CAN TAKE OVER DELIVERING TORY BREXIT 
McDonnell saying Labour would press ahead with Brexit. The big idiot. So if you’re heading to conference and want to push for a #PeoplesVote then download this app from @FFSake_ which will help coordinate that. #TogetherAgainstBrexit 
So here we have it.Faced with the lies, illegality and proven harm of leaving, with a majority now supporting Remain and the deadline for any EU deal just weeks away, arch-Leaver John McDonnell says that "Labour wants to push ahead with Brexit." 
People often ask at events what they can do to stop Brexit. I'm not a campaigner so I never have a very satisfying answer. But this is a well thought through & intelligent campaign  
There are reports this morning that John McDonnell has called for #Labour to 'push ahead with #Brexit'Our founder @Alewin7 responds below, saying that any attempt to support Brexit misjudges the mood of #LabourConference#LAB18  
Very impressive anti-Brexit campaign launched using online & traditional ads, leaflets and canvassing, targeting swing voters in soft Leave seats  
Brexit isn’t a party political game @BarryGardiner Brexit will make the lives of millions of people worse. It will kill the NHS. It has already done huge damage to the UK’s reputation. So your attitude on display here is, frankly, disgusting and shameful.  
I voted Labour last time because I was taken in by the calculatingly deceitful  sounds they were making on Brexit. Never again under this leadership. Any Brexit is going to be terrible, but Corbyn's is going to be beyond terrible.  
The very same people who hated the Chequers deal, who demanded that it be scrapped, who threatened May with a coup if it passed......are the very same people now outraged the EU has turned it down.Another stupid day in stupid #brexit land. 
We threaten to walk away with No-deal and the EU will make compromises. They're terrified of a WTO Brexit.  
At beginning of 2017 a very senior official in Brussels told me what the critical Brexit issue was: “The British PM cannot reach the end of the process and claim victory.” Start with this and Brexit will become clearer to you. 
The Labour leader and his shadow chancellor have both confirmed, yet again, that Labour respects the referendum decision and will abide by it.Labour members who argue for another referendum instead of a general election are #campaigningforthetories. 
Stand by my words as nothing has convinced me otherwise. Ultimately a Brexit policy based on lies and deceit will fail.  
When you tell Sky TV that you are leaving do you enter into a negotiation about what they will allow you to keep watching? They tell you what’s happening and you accept it. As I said, Brexit isn’t really a negotiation as we said we were leaving and the EU gave us the two options. 
This makes it very clear where the Labour Party leadership stands on #Brexit. This is a position to which @TheGreenParty is entirely opposed. We want to #StopBrexit with the only democratic way forward from here, a #PeoplesVote  
As Mrs May attempts to play politics, this short film is a wonderful reminder of what is at stake. Peace in Ireland should be preserved at all costs. It's more important than Brexit. And it is certainly more important than the Tory party.  
@BBCRadio4 How dare @jeremy_hunt claim that Remainers will now want to speed up #Brexit because the #EU is threatening to break up the UK. One of the many reasons to #Remain is that we knew all along that Brexit, not our #EU partners, brought this very threat. #r4Today 
Theresa May is now talking up the prospect of a No Deal Brexit, but earlier this year she admitted it would mean delays to life-saving medicines. No deal is the worst deal for British patients. Share her words widely.  
Brexit compromise still possible, Donald Tusk says. Too late, Too Much Humiliation!Leave No Deal!  
Theresa May talks tough on Brexit - is cheered on by the Press.Jeremy Corbyn talks about anything other than Brexit - is criticised by the Press.Vince Cable talks actual sense on Brexit - is ignored by the Press. 
Labour doesn't want to push ahead with Brexit @johnmcdonnellMP Our voters, our members and our supporters; without whom there is no Labour Party, believe it is wrong for our country.Leadership must listen. Conference must decide.#PeoplesVote 
Waving an EU flag and demanding a Second Referendum won't get rid of the Tories it will only unite them. Allowing them to come apart under the  weight of Brexit's own contradictions is absolutely the correct strategy by Corbyn and Starmer. 
Latest @YouGov @thetimes poll. In hindsight #Brexit right 40 (-2); wrong; 47 (+1). Equals record high wrong lead (recorded in May). Polling all/mostly pre-#Salzburg ??? 
"Never interrupt your enemy when they are taking the country towards the hard Brexit to which you have been ideologically committed for 40 years." 
Theresa May took Britain towards the brink of a no-deal Brexit yesterday as she accused the European Union of offering only “unacceptable” options.  
A message here for you @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BorisJohnson @theresa_may#Brexit #Ireland #marr 
Does @theresa_may not see the irony of her response to #indyref2 when she said to Scotland "Why would you leave your biggest trading partner?" Um, #Brexit ??? As a Cornishman in Scotland - bring it on #DissolveTheUnion 
"If Labour comes out in support of a 2nd referendum, they’ll do so at a   time that suits them and the country - not their political opponents."#LabourPartyConference #GTTO #SaturdayMorning #JC4PM #ToryBrexitShambles 
Supernatural, political and fascinating to read in the context of Brexit. Reviewed Sarah Moss’ riveting Ghost Wall. @GrantaBooks 
Something we agree on. Those responsible for stopping Brexit should never hold office again.  
Voted Remain in 2016. Would now vote Leave. It’s clear we are diverging from the future direction of EU. Yet I still respect the referendum result in 2016 as final- those calling for a second vote or delaying article 50 simply want to turn against democracy and block Brexit  
Ireland should take a stand for #FreeSpeech when it holds its #blasphemy referendum. And the vote should prompt global action in defence of free expression on religion  
Labour’s handled Brexit & their conflicting bases pretty well. And ‘don’t interrupt your enemy while they make a mistake’ is a sound tactic. But lack of engagement with media can’t go on forever. The public need to see their Opposition - & May shouldn’t be getting away with this. 
Jesus the Christ - Born 9/19/03 BC 
There has always been a ‘Plan B’ to #ChequersPlan Its called Brexit. 
'A new referendum could stop #Brexit destroying this country's heartlands – it’s up to #Labour to make that a reality' 
‘Labour would fight a snap general election vowing to press ahead with Brexit, but secure better terms, John McDonnell has said’. This is basically same nonsense as ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’  
Hang about, I thought we were going to vote on our Brexit policy at conference?  
Brexiteer Peter Bone says Theresa May should push for a Brexit on WTO rules after the European Union rejected her Chequers proposals.  
Extraordinary to see how many papers and columnists are seduced by May’s outburst on #Brexit, despite being such a distortion of reality. Guess it shows the seductive power of jingoism 
Large % of NHS safety failures reported in last few years come down to one easential truth - severe workforce shortages in key disciplines. It will take years to fix and Brexit will worsen. So all our service planning has to be based on this reality without gloss or pretence. 
The government has mistaken Brexit for a standard negotiation, with opening bids and haggling and trade-offs.But it isn't. It is the dissolving of an agreement, not the making of one.The EU declared their final position at the start. May is waiting in vain for them to move. 
Really sorry to see this response to @andreajenkyns from the MP for #ThurrockWe’d really like to see you pledge to #StandUp4Brexit Jackie, on behalf of your electorate who voted overwhelmingly to leave the EUChequers is not Brexit  
All this anti-EU nationalism and fascist, warlike jingoism turns my stomach. Leavers would send in the gunboats over this if they could. And if we continue with Brexit, it'll only be a matter of time before they try to distract from the economic fallout with an armed conflict.  
We aren't all pro EU. We aren't all political. We aren't all left, or right. What we are is ordinary folk from every walk of life who have an unerring nose for the stink of Brexit bullshit.You should be proud of the part you are playing. #PeoplesVote

Just read this brilliant analysis of the Brexit vote by Matthew Goodwin. I implore anyone who cares, to read it, it’s non-partisan. Particularly #FBPE who believe;We didn’t know what we were voting forThe bus did itRacism caused itIt was a protest vote

In the UK workforce, EU migrants make up:- 30% of workers in food manufacturing- 24% of domestic workers - 20% of hotel staff- 18% of logistics staff- 12% of bar & restaurant employeesClosing the doors to them after Brexit would be a mistake  
Ministers are expected to demand a Plan B on Brexit (Chequers +++?) on Monday and pressure Theresa May to replace her key EU advisers, including Olly Robbins, with a new more senior Brexit negotiating team. Otherwise - could be resignations.  
The EEA is a viable, stable, amicable means of exit. It is a whole UK solution which obviates the need for a customs union or an NI backstop. Theresa May and the ERG have lied through their teeth about it. It is their conscious choice to destroy British jobs.   #Brexit 
When this is all done, we'll look at the BBC and ask, how did their journalism fall so low, so fast, that they failed to push for truth about even the most basic brexit lies and fabrications. 
Theresa May now rails against the #Brexit choice between Norway style EEA membership and a Canadian style trade deal.  But it is her own red lines that have made the current situation inevitable & the #EU illustrated that well  in a slide published on 19th December last year 
#FBPE are all very odd. Still blaming Corbyn for Brexit.Still blaming Corbyn for not hypnotising May.Still blaming Corbyn for not negotiating with the EU.Still blaming Corbyn for not persuading Cameron to ditch the ref. Yet none of them can explain how... 
This is disgraceful. Brexit isn’t a game. The best interests of the country should be our priority, not personal political advantage.  
Good Morning *Scotland* discussing the latest Brexit fiasco. Out of four guests on the programme there wasn't one from Scotland. Why aren't we hearing anything from a Scottish angle? Where is Ruth Davidson all of a sudden? Why isn't the Scottish Govt's voice being heard? 
One more time for all the "Labour aren't opposing Tory Brexit" crowd...  
The vast majority of Labour members and voters do no want to “push ahead with Brexit” so the leadership needs to get in line it is not too late #PeoplesVote 
The Tory party continues to dissemble on Brexit. The EU have held a steady path throughout the process. The problem was @theresa_may signing the article 50 letter with no plan to deliver. She is still putting party over country, such behaviour should be illegal.

No-deal Brexit would have limited impact on German labor market: Der Spiegel  
Interesting. Very interesting. Foreign Secretary @Jeremy_Hunt refuses to rule out a Canada +++ deal with the EU to solve the Brexit impasse in interview with @BBCr4today. Watch Hunt's leadership odds narrow 
To the people in the rest of the UK. The DUP are dangerous. Let the DUPdictate, to Ur PM, the terms of Brexit at Ur peril. They are blinded by religious fundamentalism and will stop at nothing to scupper any forward thinking ideas. Do not let them destroy Ur future too.  
Read my peice for @WestmonsterUK: "It’s now up to the few Brexit supporting Cabinet members left to give a voice to the 17.4 million Leave voters in the country and tell the PM in no uncertain terms:  You tried, you failed, now let’s chuck Chequers." 
Stick to this and we’d alas hear nothing from Billy when his enemy makes mistakes on the economy, wages, NHS, education, rail, crime, welfare, etc, etc, etc as well as Brexit  
Alastair Campbell @campbellclaret hits the nail on the head. Brexit is a total mess. It was a campaign won on lies and fantasies. It’s being negotiated by a negligent government who have absolutely no idea what Brexit means. It’s a national embarrassment. 
Presumably he didn’t catch the May meltdown yesterday afternoon , nor the opinion polls regarding current views on #Brexit ?  Or perhaps he has been campaigning on Mars for the summer ?  
Pumping up the Brexit rhetoric @Jeremy_Hunt says "it is a parody of democracy" for the EU to respond to the UK's decision to leave the EU by saying "that's the end of your country" @BBCr4today 
Labour’s strategy laid bare - a catastrophic Brexit, inflicting severe economic damage, causing unemployment and lowering living standards, seen as an exciting opportunity. That’s how much the party leadership cares about the poor, the vulnerable and the left behind.  
You have a relationship with EU. Before you know it they've moved in, got pregnant and started pressuring you to marry them. You try and break it off but want to remain friends so they demand all your money and tell all your friends and your Mum you beat them#Brexit@Femi_Sorry 
So my gammon little englandshire Brexit loves . Scotland shall have a LEGAL right to stop Brexit. Still think we're better Together ? Have the English the balls to demand Independence? Think not, #LeechingCowards 
The real question is why is Theresa May lying about the EEA when just about every Vote Leave politician cited Norway as a possible avenue? It wasn't a betrayal then so why is it now? #Brexit 
The lesson was that the EU wouldn’t compromise the 4 freedoms to assuage Tory infighting. Brexit happened partly because politicians failed to understand and/or explain this properly.Now May’s beset by Tory infighting & the EU won’t compromise the 4 freedoms to assuage it. See?

BBC news this morning: "Theresa May didn't deserve to be treated like an outcast".  But isn't that the whole point of brexit? The reality? 
In 1 minute, David Miliband just offered more coherent, well-reasoned opposition to Brexit on #r4today than the actual opposition has managed in the last 2 years. He also made a well-argued call for a #PeoplesVote. The time has come.

Trapped between her party’s Brexit basketcases and the DUP, May will begger the UK to save, well, what exactly? Imperial nostalgia wrapped up a tattered Union flag  
It is no surprise that in an era of fake news we saw a fake referendum result. That is what it is, a false representation of a country, a deliberate engineering of a vote as a stepping stone for takeover and rule by the new lords of mamon. The quietest invasion in history.  #FBPE

There are a group of remain fanatics who are manipulating the results of polls on Brexit to try to achieve a second referendum they are well organised and must have funds from some rich backers who seek to overturn the referendum result & UK democracy. 
As ever with this rabble, all the calculations they are making are about party and ambition not the national interest. @peoplesvote_uk to choose - her deal, no deal, no Brexit

You earn respect, you daft hoomanTheresa May demands respect from EU in Brexit negotiations  
Sorry Keir, but I think it is time for Labour (who I support to the core of my being) to oppose BREXIT, rather than just noting the complete incompetence of the Government. Please, its time to actively oppose BREXIT. 
*The EU referendum is a crime scene* #StopBrexit

Fraser Nelson in the Telegraph seems to think the Tories are mad enough to go for a ‘blind Brexit’ under which they would agree to pay up the £40 billion and accept the Irish backstop in return for a promise of continued negotiations. Anything rather than no deal. A death wish? 
Theresa May warns EU she will not overturn Brexit referendum after bloc rejects deal  
The EU is absolutely adamant that they are only prepared to accept a Brexit solution where they keep significant control over the UK and UK interests. No Deal is the only solution for the UK to become a self governing nation again with no EU control whatsoever.

Brexit is in crisis. The government is crisis and you're complaining about what's in the twitter feed of Labour MPs. ( btw there are several comments on Keir Starmers twitter and at least one in Jeremy Corbyn's) 
I just accidentally heard this fraud’s laughable  attempt at Thatcherite macho. First thought: she’s relying on the hope that we are a nation with the memory of a goldfish. The reality: she’s relying on the belief that we live in a nation with the IQ of a goldfish. #scum #brexit  
Theresa May's latest Brexit statement...  
The WA isn't and never was about a trade deal.  It is about giving the UK 2 years grace to get to the exit without doing itself too much damage, whilst ensuring it properly closes out existing obligations and agreements.(Please try harder to understand the Brexit you wanted.) 
And nor is her display of faux anger at the EU to impress Tory hardliners at all statesmanlike. It is disgraceful that with so little time left, shoring up the Tory party and her own political career are apparently of more concern to Mrs. May than agreeing a workable Brexit plan. 
I hope politicians who argue we must have another vote because the detailed form of Brexit was not known at the time of the referendum, will agree we must have another election every time they propose a measure whose specifics were not clear in their manifesto. 
Hi Ruth our group is in your party and we'd prefer you stand up for our membership of the #EU as we voted Remain and you said you'd fight for Scotland. You haven’t you have turned your back on your constituents. #brexit was rejected in Scotland. 
@bcliberals are so confused by the #prorep #referendum. I just took 5 minutes & explained it to a 10 year old no probs. Is Coleman lazy or is the #bclibs' talent pool really that shallow? #bcpoli 
I have an idea - The @theSNP should support a peoples vote. Not on #brexit, but instead to make Holyrood the UK Parliament and give Westminster to England as a devolved parliament with a Barnett formula! | #Indyref #Scotref 
I think part of the problem is just how unoriginal we are. Blame the EU.Blame Macron.Blame Tusk.Blame Merkel.Blame Polish plumbers.We created brexit.It's entirely our fault.Yet when our brexit fails, what do we do?Blame foreigners.Always blame foreigners. Pathetic. 
TM has not treated the EU with "nothing but respect" during the #Brexit negotiations. The arrogant and bombastic Lancaster House speech threatened withdrawal of security cooperation if the EU did not cave in to UK demands. Hard to imagine anything more disrespectful to allies. 
Scottish LabourThe only socialist party in history that thinks Tories can run the country better than the native working class#ScottishLabour #brexit #scotref 
The irony is that Brexit, which is a genuine working class kick against capitalism and globalisation, is perceived as xenophobic, whereas Scottish nationalism, which is a genuine kick against . . . er . . . the English, is portrayed as “joyous and civic”. It’s utter nonsense.  
I am from Dublin, Ireland. I totally agree & support your view. It's absolute madness is Brexit It has to be stopped.  
Yes there was a humiliation in Salzburg but it was Theresa May's alone. It's hardly the first time she's been told the single market is indivisible and that Chequers cannot work. She's been slapped down publicly for not listening to what she is told. She's embarrassing. #Brexit 
BREXIT could be halted at the 11th hour after a landmark legal victory by a group of Scottish politicians who have taken on the UK Government.  
Even now, Corbyn rejects a #PeoplesVote and clings to his hard Brexit dream like an addict. If Labour wants to save the UK, it has to dump Corbyn ASAP. He's a liability, a loser, a fossil of the 1970s, and a politician so out of his depth it hurts to watch#DumpCorbynSaveLabour 
They only have to look & see who is batting for their side.#Brexit is nothing to do with Left/Right, it's totally the Remain establishment against the working population of the UK.Freedom only matters, when you're the one in chains.  
What an utterly appalling thing to say. Brexit is a national crisis - it transcends party politics. Labour must focus all day, every day, on stopping Brexit - not trying to use it to gain an electoral advantage.

1) @BBC & #Brexit in a nutshellThe Chequers plan was widely reported as unworkableOther media were reporting how the Tories were fighting over a pointless proposal deal@bbcnickrobinson *must* have known this & yet like others in the BBC he's calling it a "slap in the face" 
Our position on #Brexit  is to bring the government down. The best interests of our nation can go hang. The End. 
The most beautiful film about Brexit, in words and landscape, you’re ever going to see. Seriously.  
#AndrewPierce demands @theresa_may’s chief EU adviser @OllyRobbins hands  back his five-figure bonus after the #PM was humiliated in #Salzburg yesterday  @toryboypierce | #Brexit  #BBC #SKY #LBC @LBC @ConHome @Conservatives @CCHQPress @DCBMEP @DavidDavisMP 
The argument that can unite a majority of the Scottish electorate is this: Scotland must stay in the Single Market and Customs Union.  If that is part of UK deal, fine. As a distinct Scottish Brexit deal, fine. If what it takes is independence, then that's what it takes.  
It's impossible to believe that the incompetence and naivety of the British government in its brexit negotiations is remotely genuine. Its almost certainly a conspiracy between May and the EU which will eventually see us still under the EU heel. 
Far from economic basket case that Remoaners continually claim, Barnier is making it clear that UK outside EU protectionist SM rules will be incredibly competitive & will undermine most EU economies. They r simply terrified of our business instincts & Free Trade. #Brexit @TheSun 
I cant sleep for thinking about Theresa May asking for respect from the EU when she completely disrespects and totally disregards Scotland. Im in the UK and cheering on the EU! What the fuck? #Indyref2#brexitshambles #Brexit 
EU WILL LOSE: Brussels REFUSAL to budge on Brexit deal will cost bloc £500BN say analysts  
but it wasn't a GE it was an advisory referendum that has been made mandatory without the supermajority and one side broke the law 
As for sovereignty- it’s a critical issue.That’s why I’m so against Brexit. It’s sovereignty shrinkage.If sovereignty is national power (+ citizen, civ society & biz power) to set agenda in world in which you operate... cutting UK out of European rule-making is a bad move. 
British Columbians will soon receive packages from Elections BC for October's electoral reform referendum. Get up to speed about why we need proportional representation with our series.  
It’s genuinely surreal that it’s been proven beyond all doubt that the Leave campaign broke electoral law during the campaign and there is seemingly no ambition to investigate it or hold a second referendum  
As the pound ticked down, Theresa May tried to salvage her Brexit strategy – and her tattered authority  
In a nutshell: "The Brexit referendum was an exercise in economic masochism that Britons will long regret. Grumbling about their marriage to the EU & threatening to leave gave them leverage at the bargaining table; filing for divorce has left them with none." (Madeleine Albright)

Cornish pasties: Brexit will stop EU crimping our style  
Conquer every drive with the bold performance of the All-New BMW #X5. 
Laying in my bed watching #SKYPapers and they’re reporting May potentially leaving the EU without a Brexit deal as if it’s some new revelation! Seriously you and we knew this was always going to be the case! 
'Brexit must be stopped': Lord Adonis renews second vote calls – and says Remain would win  
Looking through the Chequers/Brexit tweets it's clear that the only people who thought Theresa May 'got tough' today were Theresa May's husband and people who drink shampoo. 
The EU's red lines are based on treaties that have been in place for decades, and agreed by member states (including the UK).The UK's red lines are based on the most extreme interpretation of one referendum result and the whim of a few Tory politicians.Who will wobble first? 
What are you doing about it bar tweeting? When we met you said you were reconciled with leaving the EU. We warned that Brexit was merely the open door to a type of society Labour was formed to resist. We warned of the misery ahead. It's happening.Time you did something. 
Remarkable how many suckers swallow the notion that @theresa_may can be trusted to deliver on a clear unambiguous Brexit thus denying what she has been doing for two years. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice.... 
LAnded at LGW and can’t help but feel this sign has wider resonance... #brexit  
Today we saw strength & character from @theresa_may . Congrats Madam Prime Minister for standing up for democracy but more standing up for the People of the UK. The UK has significantly contributed to world development & must not be bullied !! #Brexit must be fulfilled !  
The Tory civil war on Europe - once confined to their party - is now the single biggest threat to the Brexit negotiations. Cameron gambled; then walked off.  
Exceptionally good column which should be read by all Remainers who think we'd walk a People's Vote. We won't. A tough battle is ahead.  We now need a people’s vote on Brexit.  | Jonathan Freedland  
This is political theatre and you know it. Theresa May and Brussels are colluding to prevent Brexit. Who do you think you are kidding.  
Isn't it time they stopped seeing Brexit in terms of their own career prospects and more in terms of the country's security and prosperity? Personally, I am fed up with being fodder for their CVs, particularly since we taxpayers are funding their inflated salaries and expenses. 
If Theresa May hadn't called an election to strengthen her hand in the Brexit negotiations then she wouldn't have had to do a deal with the DUP that weakened her hand in the Brexit negotiations  
Always predicted the DUP MPs with their ultrasectarian views would be a poor fit with Tories for a confidence and supply HMG deal ie total control of UK NI policy. Perfect storm for Brexit disaster ie no deal as DUP intransigence risks hard border & UI sooner rather than later  
French ambassador to #Macedonia @ChThimonier tells us the referendum choice is between "North Macedonia or North Korea"And I for one can't wait to see France turn into North North Africa 
 Like her future was robbed by Brexit. And like she robbed an illegal immigrant of a promised home   
Judging by my twitter feed, nobody voted for Brexit except Theresa May. Nobody. Not a single person. 
"If the Conservatives go towards hard Brexit, the way would then be open for Labour to make a big offer to business to keep us very close,” says Paul Mason after Salzburg @paulmasonnews | #newsnight 
What’d kill Brexit is if we introduced a law that journalists and politicians could only talk about it in terms of facts, never comment. 
The people must have another vote  – to take back control of Brexit  
Deranged Theresa May's Brexit statement looked like a PM attending her own political funeral, says @Kevin_Maguire 
Shame they wasted a year by blocking a debate on Brexit at 2017 conference  
Theresa chose the DUP over a deal to spare Britain the perils of a no deal Brexit. How long will she hold to that view?  
Meanwhile in a country far, far away..... European Court to rule on whether UK can halt Brexit  
Remoaners create new Brexit obstacle: Scottish court refers judgment on allowing the UK government to revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU to the European Court of Justice.  
Why isn't the govt just saying "we tried to negotiate Brexit in good faith, the negotiations have revealed it isn't actually possible without completely trashing the economy, we can't in conscience do that, therefore another referendum now we all know what the real choice is."? 
"She would have the support of the vast majority of the country and of the party were she to say that a Canada plus free trade agreement is what we’re seeking,” says Marcus Fysh MP on May's Brexit approach@MarcusFysh | #newsnight

Newspaper headlines: 'Defiant' May gives Brexit 'ultimatum'  
This would suggest a No Deal #Brexit is being fuelled by DUP tactics. The party prevented her from tabling a deal to EU?  
Speaking of Brexit: you know when two dogs, like, get stuck? Like when the male dog can't... you know... unmount the bitch? And everybody around them just kind of scrunch up their faces, but still they have to laugh, because it's kind of funny and disgusting at the same time? pic.twitter.com/6KwHvOBHC7 
It might be unpopular to say, but the people who run the EU are better than the people who run the UK.. . . I don't just mean better at what they do, I mean morally better people.#Brexit #EU 
There's no Brexit that doesn't leave our country poorer, weaker and isolated. There isn't one where ordinary people don't suffer, where poverty doesn't increase, where jobs aren't lost.We're the British Labour Party. If we don't fight this, we may as well give up.#PeoplesVote 
Impressed by the tough rhetoric of PM against the EU. Though we should have seen this previously. Now please drop #chequers, demonstrate strength by reining in doomongering chancellor & Bus/Sec. And let's delivery the #BREXIT people voted for. 
Day for doubling-down ...same crappy papers that misled to Brexit are in full chip on shoulder bleat again... #MacronsTarget 
This! We were told the referendum was only advisory to parliament, not legally binding. So why can’t parliament make a sensible decision, as is their role, not keep bleating on about the will of the people?  
Dear Leave (@LeaveEUOfficial),You and the rest of the Leave bullshitters are no friend of Britain. You can shove your Brexit up your arse, it's off!Kind regards,The workers in United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales AND Northern Ireland)  pic.twitter.com/P12gp52y2k  
I'm a privileged. Brexit took its toll on me two years ago when people stopped paying for what our business offers. We recovered because we can.It wont be so easy for others and that, my friends, is why #brexit must not happen and I will do my small part to stop it#PeoplesVote 
The sample ballot for the referendum on electoral reform. Question 2 is a set up with no explanation. Not lost on me that Elections BC’s material shows an X on the ballot in the mailbox, but voters must colour in the dot on the actual ballot. Confused??  
Something I don’t think anyone has mentioned yet is that Tory conference clashes with the Ryder Cup. It’s the one weekend every two years that Brits are passionate Europeans. Get Rose and Garcia to sort out a Brexit deal. 
Tusk: “We want to minimise the damage resulting from Brexit”.  There’s the difference, Donald. We on the other hand want to MAXIMISE THE BENEFITS. 
It's outrageous that the Brexit Secretary refuses to listen to the 2 largest Brexit youth groups We and @FFSake_  are fighting for our voices to be heard: @DominicRaab will not listen. What are you afraid of, Dom?#PeoplesVote #OFOC #FFS 
The Archbishop of Canterbury’s views on welfare and Brexit do not reflect those of ordinary Anglicans, research has found:  
Big Brexit Story !!!According to Tusk, May has known about the EU's rejection of her Chequers plan for "many weeks". So her surprise at the #SalzburgSummit seems to have been nothing but a show.Leavers are liars to their core.#PeoplesVote 
Delusion created a Brexit mandate impossible to deliver. Delusion ensured nothing but humiliation was achieved in the negotiations. Delusion brought our country literally to the verge of catastrophe. Yet somehow they think maintaining this delusion is going to save us now.  
Has Theresa May who relies on the Brextremists in her party to stay in power ever asked them to show respect? You know the ones who lied about a Brexit dividend, stired up race hate & criminally cheated in the EU referendum?  
This is an excellent piece on the insanity of Brexit and the magical thinking that is going on around the Irish border "question". Kudos to @FinancialTimes for publishing it. 
Romania set a date for a referendum to change the definition of marriage from one that is gender neutral to one that defines it exclusively as between a man and a woman. Unlike most EU countries, it does not even recognize same-sex marriages that were performed abroad.  
"Just get on with it!"Really? Let's see "it" as a plan on paper.... Otherwise let's rescind Article 50 and drop the sorry mess. If you still want Brexit, come back in a few years with a real workable plan based on this last 2.5 years of learning under your belt. 
Why does the very stern & serious-minded Sir Keir Starmer keep droning on about membership of the single market & the customs union. That's not BREXIT! He surely must know that! 
“Theresa May comes out fighting ... a defiant message” — The opening headline of BBC News at Ten. Instead of scrutinising and challenging this government’s shambolic and chaotic mishandling of Brexit, the UK’s public broadcaster is acting as a Downing Street propaganda outfit. 
Ridiculous tweet - that we can bully ourselves ‘into submission’ to a Brexit we want, not them  
Brendan O'Neill on the elite's war against Brexit:  
May has gone ape.She is now in la la land.This situation re Brexit is entering into absolute chaos. I am now waiting for the only politician who is worth watching,and listening to,Nicola Sturgeon. 
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described Theresa May’s statement on the Brexit negotiations as “dreadful” as she branded the Chequers proposals a “dead duck”.   
I hate Brexit. I hate the laughing stock it has made of country. I hate damage it will do, especially to poorest. I hate division it causes. I hate the Brexit elite who push it, and I hate the supporters who swallow the obvious lies.But I believe in Britain. We can stop this! 
Theresa May: ‘If you don’t like my #Brexit plan then where’s yours ?’Everyone else: ‘ de neeeeeeeeeeeeeeck of her’ 
There is no party - it’s a grass roots movement and we are all very proud of it and each other.  We have  a range of political leanings a range of opinions we are united by a belief that #brexit is a massive mistake.  Viva #fbpe @chesterforeu

Imagine the Brexit Secretary blocking young people’s voices out of a debate on Brexit. Oh wait. #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk 
People of Scotland, please wake up and understand how bad this will become for all of us and most importantly for our children & grandchildren, they're saying it could take 50 years to recover from Brexit, if ever. #indyref2 Scotland needs out before it's too late. 
Regardless of whether we get a deal or not. One thing for sure, Brexit will topple the Tories and Theresa May will go down as one of the worst Prime Ministers of our time. 
Why did European leaders ambush Theresa May at Salzburg? Because they concluded she was trying to paint them into a corner by delaying on Brexit decisions until the last minute, thereby weakening their bargaining position.  
Let's bin Brexit and get back to solving the world's biggest problems with our EU neighbours.Problems like this "Arctic’s strongest sea ice breaks up for first time on record" 
All the Tories (including Theresa May) want a no-deal Brexit precisely because it will give them a spurious excuse to have a bonfire of workers' rights and health and safety regulations and allow complete privatisation of the NHS. 
15 months pretending we had a Brexit plan whilst arguing amongst ourselves. Parts of the press openly treating the EU as if it were an enemy. Barnier and Juncker regularly vilified. Our first offer is a final offer that ignores their red lines. And we are OUTRAGED they reject it. 
Hypocrisy = feminists up in arms about this costume even though they all thought it was a great idea to dress up as handmaids during the abortion referendum   
Keeping Political Prisoners in jail without a trial says very little about the #EU principles. Utterly embarrassing. #Catalonia #Brexit #HumanRights #IndyRef 
Good to see @fiannafailparty have an insightful analysis of the ongoing Brexit talks....  
The funny thing about the England/Scotland dynamic when set against Russia’s hybrid war which people never really think about strategically:You take out that union, you take down Trident and a key part of NATO’s defences.That’s as simple as it is and why Brexit works two ways 
, @Telegraph splash tomorrow: Theresa May heading for massive Brexit Monday. In the morning David Davis and Boris Johnson unveil a rival Brexit plan; in the afternoon her Cabinet will demand a Plan B to replace Chequers. And Cabinet ministers might quit if she doesn't. 
Donald Tusk's statement on the #Brexit negotiations:  
Whatever our views on Theresa May she made a stateswoman-like speech to the nation on Brexit tonight putting the EU to shame. How good to see a British politician stand up to the bully boys. Corbyn was weak again in comparison ... just a Westminster Victor Meldrew! 
There was a lot of goodwill to Theresa May from the EU when the A50 period started. They recognised she was lumbered with a Brexit she couldn't deliver and were sympathetic. But month by month the Tories have grandstanded to the Tory Press and pissed off their EU counterparts. 
Alastair Campbell - Most people are thinking #brexit is a mess.. whatever we thought we were voting for.. it wasn't this. They won the campaign on lies & they have negotiated on fantasies & yesterday the fantasies hit a bit of reality.#PeoplesVote #FBPE #C4News 
For those remainders who allegedly now want brexit because of the way the EU have treated our deluded PM..... you're idiots 
Every day I’m angrier at Labours position on Brexit. A) The push for a GE over a 2nd vote is power play & it wouldn’t answer the question on Brexit. It’s party over people. B) The arrogance to think we waltz in mid negotiation and can fix something so complex. So short sighted

"I will not overturn the referendum result, or break up my country"  
Don't try that FBPE-blaming Bastani crap, you're better than thatIf Brexit happens it will be because Labour failed to take a stand to protect the Many and our NHS.Country before party.People were misled, there is no Brexit dividend.Rules were broken.That's enough for EURef2 
The Tories want to bury their latest racist outrage by putting it out on a Friday night after today's Brexit shambles.Dont let them away with it.   
Leo Varadkar: ‘Nobody in the EU or Ireland is to blame for Brexit’  
Have these Moderates who are screaming for a #PeoplesVote ever stopped and thought about the possibility that the people might vote against their wishes of stopping Brexit, and that would lead to a no deal anyway? David Cameron made a similar mistake in 2016. 
“We should have left on day one when Jeremy Corbyn proposed that we press the button of Article 50, the day after the referendum. We should have sent, proverbially, an email saying: ‘We are leaving. Our people have decided, we are off. We mean you no harm and we presume you .. ”  
my favourite bit of corbyn playing genius level 9-dimensional chess over Brexit was when he, er, called for Article 50 to be immediately triggered 3 hours after the referendum with no preparation time, man that was some sick covert Remain astral-plane kasparov chess strategy 
UK fruit farmers feel the squeeze as Brexit looms  
The other myth spread b the mainstream media and the FBPE mob is that “...but Corbyn never talks about Brexit”. He does so frequently and often. That the media and the FBPE choose to ignore it, is their problem. 
Anyone remember how Brexit leaders like @Nigel_Farage told us by this stage the EU would be coming to us cap in hand desperate for a deal because they need us more than we need them?#surelytheydidntlie 
"I will not overturn the result of the referendum. I will not break up my country"Well, maybe, your party, Mrs May, should have thought twice before holding a referendum which is wrecking lives and businesses and was always going to force you to have to do one of those things. 
Theresa May had an important announcement to clearly reiterate today - “Brexit has gone to shit and we’re sorry we don’t know what we’re doing but we need to cling to power, we’re all fucked.” 
Announcement late on a Friday when everyone is looking at Brexit.Completely disgraceful and shows completely what this govt think of the people of Britain.  
Made a "Brexit is bananas & (wal)nuts loaf" to sustain my fellow @SODEMAction protesters at #LabourConference tomorrow.Sadly, it's cake for the few, not the many, so first come, first served! 
The Brits were never asked outright if they wanted political linkage with the EU. Certainly not in 1975 when the let's-stay-in Referendum campaign was all about a trade relationship (Common Market). When we were asked, finally, about political linkage in 2016, we said 'Leave'. 
"I've had a brilliant day Jim, but I'll take what I've got and let the others have a go".@Coldwar_Steve continues to put out the highest quality of Brexit satire.  
Lexit is toast. It is now 100% Labour’s duty to come out firmly against Brexit and release us from this endless Ayn Rand national nightmare.   
Storytime: I voted leave in the EU referendum (not for racist reasons) only to be diagnosed with diabetes two years later and then learn that insulin is only made abroad. So I effectively voted to kill myself 
Anyone know why Jacob Rees-Mogg who has already rejected the Chequers Brexit plan has spent all day slagging off the EU27 for telling Theresa May it is unworkable? 
You learned to walk because, like all babies, you understood the unquestionable advantages of doing so which make it worth the effort.Brexit offers nothing but hollow slogans & illusions of control.The "difficult option" is not necessarily the one with the biggest returns. 
Gerard Batten claims that he’s ready to hit Remainers. When our operatives tried to pay a visit to his office they found that he’d vacated the premises due to unpaid rent. UKIP are dead, just like Brexit. 
No David she is not respecting the referendum result. Scotland voted REMAIN in fact you haven't respected the result either and your the Secretary of State for Scotland. Instead your putting the internal #Tory party fights ahead of the national interest. 
For a very comprehensive and comprehensible explanation of exactly what NO DEAL Brexit means, this is a great document & will provide lots of evidence to combat the Quitters who think it's the holy grail!#StopBrexit #bbcaq #MarchForTheMany @Women_4_Europe  
Brexit and Italy are mere results of the Populist wave that has surged across Europe, UK, USA etc.  Populism is not a threat to the "prosperity" of the EU but its death knell. Rightly so - the EU/Globalist attempt at world domination must be smashed.  
All models of Brexit sit on a spectrum between wanton national self-harm and damage limitation. There is no painless path that might allow a government to fulfil the referendum mandate without severe cost. The moribund Chequers plan is no exception. 
I’m 66. Apart from the odd speeding ticket, I’ve always been a law abiding citizen. But if this dreadful Tory government, propped up by the regressive DUP, lead us over the #Brexit cliff, by god, I think I’ll be rioting in Westminster. #FFS #StopBrexit Stop this madness! 
We are from different political families and disagree on much but entirely agree with you on #PeoplesVote and salute your courage in speaking out in the media against Brexit lies and false promises. As a former MEP you like me know the true peace & prosperity agenda of the EU. 
Peter Brookes on Theresa May and Brexit negotiations – political cartoon gallery in Putney  
With people focusing on Brexit now after Theresa May's speech, the Govt decided to release this news tonight. The Tories really are without shame  
Professor Tanja Beultmann @cliodiaspora talks about the 819 “days of limbo” that EU citizens living in the UK have faced since the referendum in June 2016. A profound and at times deeply worrying presentation about the horrible situation that has been created and shames the UK.  
This is like how, a month after Scotland voted “No” in the 2014 referendum, a poll came out that said that “Yes” would’ve won  
The people who didn't respect the result of the first referendum want a second referendum, which they say they definitely will respect this time. I wonder why? 
There is absolutely zero evidence that the referendum is reversing itself. Listen to John Curtice a man who knows a damn sight more about it than you. Or do you only talk to people who think the same as you.  
Today I stood at the Berlin Wall. A construction borne from human suffering, used to keep alive, anger, division and hatred. A political tool, perpetuating the notion of ‘the other’, right versus wrong. For those calling for a hard border post #Brexit, wake up. Wake up.   
Just when you thought the #Brexit situation couldn't get anymore bizarre, UKIP conference stalls start flogging Nigel Farage condoms, boldly stating "For when you have a Hard Brexit" I don't think this is going to be a big money spinner for UKIP somehow, more like a hard sell   
This is ridiculous. Their ‘counter-proposal’ would be EEA membership (which is bad for different reasons)The Tories said they could deliver a Brexit that kept trade status quo and ended EU payments, rule taking and free movement. They can’t. They never couldElection please!  
No future textbook on Brexit will be complete without an illustration from @Coldwar_Steve. I can imagine setting essay questions on this one  
It’s quite incredible, the amount of people I meet with no language skills whatsoever, who apparently were going to live and work in Europe until Brexit. 
Let’s be clear:1. May’s red lines were hers alone. They did not automatically emerge from the referendum.2. They significantly narrow the available options for future EU relationship.3. This has been explained clearly on one slide by Barnier.4. It is not a surprise. 
People say you can’t predict anything with certainty when it comes to Brexit.I disagree. One thing that can always be guaranteed is that when it comes to 1.2mn @BritishInEurope ... the U.K. govt will isolate, betray and ultimately abandon us every time.#PeoplesVote 
‘I’m not a #TommyRobinson fan, I think he’s a bit of a lout’Carry on Farage, more & more eyes are opening every day to see you for the establishment snob that you are.Aside from Brexit you have very little understanding or anything in common with the average working man.  
My brilliant friend, Clare Dwyer Hogg wrote a brilliant poem Brexit: a cry from the Irish border, read by Stephen Rea for @FT and it explains precisely why this is so profoundly emotive for those of us who live or have lived in the North of Ireland 
Earlier today in a video I said, "The only solution I see to the Irish border situation post-Brexit, is a reunification of Ireland."Since @georgegalloway is a rare voice of sanity in a country run by nutcases, it's nice to know he agrees  
Today we saw Theresa May taking the firmest stance she's taken against the EU throughout the whole Brexit process... and it was to demand they accept a deal where we're forced to copy EU laws which we have no influence over.#TakeBackControl 
Scotland deserves better than a First Minister who is using Brexit to prepare for a second independence referendum. All I can see from this statement is hot air, and no substance.  
Would have Kier Starmer negotiatiing brexit any day of the week than the shower of chaos and mess we have right nowKier and Labour speak sense #Brexit #BrexitChaos #Chequers #Labour

@campbellclaret  nails it on @Channel4News Brexit referendum won by liars and prosecuted by fantasists.  Salzburg is reality check.  Wake up call.  Prosperity and peace and security in danger. 
When they say they want a people's vote it would be basically to overturn the previous people's vote. That's exactly how the EU overturned the previous 3 referendums that went against it in France, Netherlands and Ireland. The scenario is exactly the same for Britain. #Brexit 
So on what level did you think a Tory referendum, with a Tory Govt, would deliver a workable Brexit that doesn’t screw the country, doesn’t screw the poor, and doesn’t deliver our public services to vulture capitalist tax dodgers and trade to a quango WTO? Curious to know.

It’s funny how every Leave loving hack suddenly knows a Remainer who came over all Brexit overnight.  
The UK and EU were at an impasse the moment the UK believed it was a negotiation. It was never a negotiation. It was only ever a withdrawal.Gross incompetence has led us here. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE 
This doesn’t do anything to calm my worries about the quick fix of the People’s Vote. While the iceberg of Brexit looms over the Titanic, the passengers are shouting “Just get on with it!” at the quarrelling crew.

The @UKLabour press office has gone absent without leave. In the 24 hours since May’s Salzburg humiliation it has tweeted not a single thing about Brexit. What an abject absence of any sort of official opposition. 
The FT View: After Salzburg, the focus must now be on simply limiting the damage of Brexit  
British Pound hit by May's #Brexit stance, has even fared worse than Turkey Lira today.  
Is the #PeoplesVote campaign led and supported by people who neither voted at the EU Referendum of 2016 nor knew that it was taking place for some obscure reason? Or is it, as we might suspect, led and supported by just those people who voted in 2016 on the losing side? 
After listening to @KateHoeyMP and @danwootton's Brexit propaganda, @Femi_Sorry did not hold back!!#MayStatement #TheresaMay 
Seb. You can’t reason with the Brexit media cheerleaders. Thankfully the public are different.  
Pound To Euro Plummets As Theresa May Delivers Crunch Brexit StatementThe sterling suffered its biggest fall since November. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "I think we shouldn’t be afraid of a free trade deal on the base of WTO"That is opening up trade with lots of other countries. It would allow us to get on with the rest of the world sooner because it wouldn’t have an implementation period." #Brexit  
Maybe Brexit means eventually realising what a dumb and undeliverable idea it is, and then remaining. Whilst learning a little national humility and that working together is better than working alone. 
"Enough. It’s time to say no to Chequers, no to further compromises, and, if necessary, no to any kind of deal that falls short of Brexit."Brendan O'Neill on #Salzburg 
The distance between the UK’s demands for #Brexit & the EU’s position of #BRINO is as great as ever. #Chequers was never the answer but a Canada style #FTA is. Let’s hope we can now reset the debate. @theresa_may #PM delivered a robust & welcome speech @10DowningStreet  today. 
Brexit: Get an Irish passport Northern Ireland company tells staff 
Thanks to everyone who came out to support us in London last night. Here's a snapshot of the evening. Thanks to those who shared their stories and made their voices heard. Please sign our petition:  Help us stop Brexit Borders #MakeThemListen 
The FT’s first experiment with telling the Brexit story through fiction. Already record-breaking first-day publication views.  
1/Just seen a few tweets from Brits demanding a return to wartime spirit, claiming foreigners won't defeat "us" and "we" should display that same wartime spirit to get through Brexit. Thank you, Theresa May, for stoking the Home Fires of xenophobia. 
Especially when they're led by a man who pretty much single-handedly ended apartheid and brought peace to Northern Ireland. Solving Brexit should be a cakewalk to such a man...  
I trust @NicolaSturgeon - she knows what she's doing. I was shouting for a quick #indyref2 but I get it now. No deal for Brexit first, even tho we all know it's coming - then call the referendum. Then we win. Then we #DissolveTheUnion Ireland will be united, we will be free 
The report suggests that, post-Brexit, EU and non-EU migrants should be treated equally   
There is corruption deep at the heart of the BBC when Rees-Mogg gets more airtime than Mrs May today. Of course no comment at all from any Remain person about the disaster that Brexit represents. Shameful reporting  guaranteed at the BBC.#FBPE 
Petition: If no agreement on the Ireland Border can be reached, Brexit must be abandoned.  
Camilla Tominey - "People knew that they wanted to leave the single market and the customs union."They wanted to sever ties with the EU. That is why Chequers is anathema to so many people - because it is neither in nor out and certainly no-one voted for that." #Brexit  
Brexit: What happens next?  
There's no such thing as a 'No Deal Brexit'.45 Non-EU countries want free trade deals with the UK and many more that have trade arrangements now with Brussels want to morph these into deals with the UK when we leave.With the rest — including the EU — it's trade on WTO terms. 
“We’re seeing the salami slicing of free speech" - @DominicRaab, 2012. The Brexit Secretary doesn’t want to hear views of young people on Brexit (is it because we’re overwhelmingly in favour of a #PeoplesVote?) - so has blocked us and our friends @OFOCBrexit#FFS 
Chap I know, lifelong Islington-style Labour, vociferous Remainer, 65ish, not a Corbynite, is so angry at EU's treatment of Mrs May that he now wants Brexit. 
So now will so many on the Remain side see the EU for the bullying bureaucratic imposition it really is? Ah! Keep having referenda til we get it right?! After Salzburg the Brexit vote will increase cos the Brits hate bullies. Overplaying a hand or what! 
Now #Brexit is exposed as dangerous fantasy it’s down to Corbyn. He is either part of the problem or part of the solution as unions, momentum, party and voters want #PeoplesVote. Time to get off the fence. 
They’ve snuck this out late on a Friday while their shambolic handling of Brexit dominates the agenda, absolutely disgraceful   
The EU finally reveals itself for what it is:- an arrogant bully bent on punishment, terrified that another member might have the temerity to follow the Brits. “Have another referendum” they say, just like they did to the Irish, the Dutch & the French. It’s time to stand up to 
Hugely significant. @JolyonMaugham@GoodLawProject strikes again. Time for a mask & cape I think. #BrexitLegal action to revoke article 50 referred to European court of justice 
Absolute nonsense.  You've made a complete dog's brexit of this from the very beginning.  Your lack of respect for all concerned is astounding and only equalled by your disingenuousness.  
Announcing this on Friday PM after a staged Brexit press conference which has dominated the media is absolutely scandalous. We need root and branch reform of our broken immigration system now. 
Almost two years of #brexit negotiations from Theresa May and this is how they've gone so far #MayStatement 
For absolutely no reason, I've got an overwhelming urge to share this cracking Irish Times letter on #Brexit again  
Scottish & English football leagues are asking for a special Brexit exemption for their EU players to stay and play in the UK. This enrages me. FFS, we're talking about food & medicine shortages and these arseholes are worried about their football teams. 
Triangulating between a hopeless divided failing government and an EU which has been clear throughout seems weird to me. Can you please spell out how the jobs first Brexit works? And if there is an election what Labour Brexit policy for government is.  
BRITAIN doesn't like being bullied. Bar the mentally ill with FBPE hashtags, the decent majority now understand why 17.4m people voted to exit the tyranny of the EU. Disgraceful from Tusk, tweeting pics to humiliate the UK Prime Minister. #Brexit  
Keir, who is after all the brexit Secretary, was interviewed by Michael crick only this afternoon. I just don't see how that is running away? 
Damaging Brexit is making people who voted 'No' to Scottish independence think again. Worth having a look at this piece by @chrisdeerin  
We now need a people’s vote on Brexit. But don’t assume remain would win | Jonathan Freedland  
It’s funny that 7 or 8 months ago, @montie told me on here he would “gladly” own the consequences of Brexit. And yet here he is. Blaming anyone but himself. 
Good. The Tories wanted to ‘own’ Brexit, let them own the ground falling away beneath their feet.  
So, Labour’s policy with Brexit is not to ‘interrupt the enemy while they’re making a mistake’?Is this why Lab also doesn’t oppose the Tories on anything else? Is this why Lab went completely quiet after the Tories won in 2017 and will stay quiet until the next GE? 
No Deal Brexit will break up UK anyway. Scots & Irish voted Remain, they won't accept this lunacy. Even Unionists concede likelihood of United Ireland. Little Britain next, led by David Walliams & Matt Lucas. They'd be better than this govt. #PeoplesVote 
This Brexit situation is scary. How has it got to this !! Why has it got to this !!  
Can anyone explain why we are wasting so much time, money & resources on Brexit negotiations?Surely its bloody easier to stay in the EU rather than negotiating to keep what we have now?It's just SILLY. 
Cannae believe it.@BBCNews is actually reporting on how bad Brexit will be for Scotland 
"Scottish judges have asked the European Union’s highest court to urgently consider whether the U.K. government’s #Brexit process can be reversed " via @BrexitGo on, #Scotland. You  didn't vote for this mess. Neither did #NorthernIreland !#TheresaMay 
If May can't even come up with a coherent brexit plan how the hell are we expected to believe that airspace plans, border check plans and all other plans will actually be achieved. We need a GE NOW. 
One of the things that puzzles me about  the Brexit debate is the level of abuse.  Just seen a Christian academic posting, without provocation, that those  who voted for Brexit are immature, ignorant and racist.   Why does anyone, let alone a Christian, post such things?! 
With all due respect, President @EmmanuelMacron has missed the point. Brexit was always going to be difficult. But we did not vote to leave the EU because of anything Cameron and Osborne said. We are leaving in order to control our own destiny, confidence, prosperity & security.  
A truly bizarre aspect of Brexit is this idea Remainers have that Leavers yearn for our Imperial past. Just imbecilic. We weighed up the pros & cons of membership and decided, reluctantly, that the loss of sovereignty wasn’t worth it. We don’t want to reconquer India. DUH  
Ben Jennings on Tory plots, Theresa May and Brexit negotiations – political cartoon gallery in Putney  
.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg says @theresa_may was "bullied" by the EU over her #Brexit strategy. But the Tory MP argues that it is clear that her Chequers plan "doesn't work for the UK or the EU". Read the latest on the prime minister's fiery speech here:  
Liberals should realise that people didn't vote for Brexit and Trump because of ignorance but because they held different values, argues @giles_fraser 
The will of the British people looks in favour of overturning disastrous brexit. Let's have a PeoplesVote. 
Brexit: Gave the whole class a detention in the spur of the moment, realised shouldn’t have later on, parental complaints start to rain in, pride the only thing stopping you from cancelling the whole thing and moving on! 
David Allen Green: One day a historian will offer explanations for how Brexit happened. Future generations, on the other hand, will perhaps wonder if we were out of our minds.  
The Guardian view on Theresa May’s Brexit: panic dressed up as statecraft | Editorial  
Yes, the EU should be clear, despite irrefutable proof that the EU referendum result was delivered through the cheating and law breaking of the Leave campaign and the DUP, the Conservatives will not overturn the illegal result.  
Theresa gets it wrong again. The referendum was not legitimate. The leave campaign lied, cheated and broke the law.  
Am I suffering my own cognitive dissonance in that I can’t believe that the government, and Labour, and millions of people in this country can’t see how disastrous Brexit will be? And therefore I think it has to be stopped. 
Speaking with @rtenews this afternoon, Sinn Féin Leader @MaryLouMcDonald gave her reaction to Theresa May's speech on #Brexit"There cannot be a withdrawal agreement without an operable backstop, and there cannot be a withdrawal agreement until Irish interests are protected."  
EU responds to Theresa May's surprise Brexit speech and explains why they rejected her plan  
Only 10% of #Cornwall businesses surveyed are in favour of #Brexit.82% say leaving the EU would have a "negative impact" on them.Fortunately it's still not too late to stop this pointless catastrophe, whatever @Theresa_May would like you to believe.#PeoplesVote 
Crashing out because the over 700 agreements we have with the EU cease to be valid on #brexit day without a Withdrawal Agreement and the transition period that goes with it disappears. Your lack of understanding is shocking & irresponsible. 
Wrong. A trade deal is not what is being negotiated. A Withdrawal Agreement is & Chequers’ role is what it does to resolve the backstop issue with the Irish border. After all the hot air you spout over #brexit you are still unable to grasp the basics. We will be crashing out. 
Democracy is a rolling process. It didn’t end in June 2016. The Brexit you voted for is dead soWhat exactly would you like everyone to get behind?The deal?The ideology?The memories of time gone by? 
England and Brexit have made a mug of Scots like me who voted ‘no’ to independence  
You're off beam Billy. Corbyn has neither the competence nor the integrity to face down the government and force them towards a people's vote. He will be forever remembered for this. Besides which, a no deal Brexit is unlikely. It's perilous and most Tories know it. 
Donald Tusk seemed to delight in trolling Theresa May on Instagram, as two EU leaders came out backing a second referendum and the French President decided to insult the British electorate.If this is them signalling Chequers is step in the “right direction”, who needs enemies!  
Govt’s pursuit of destructive hard #Brexit could sever all ties and put crime & policing in jeopardy.We have long been warning of the risk of losing European Arrest Warrant, information sharing, & more.We cannot let Govt’s ideologies sabotage our security.#ExitFromBrexit

Nudged by the undertaker, the elderly town sheriff, handlebar moustache a-drooping asymmetrically, hitches up his pants and touches his gun belt nervously. “You two strangers ain’t lookin’ for trouble, are you? No Hope’s a sleepy Brexit town and I intend on keeping it that way” 
Theresa May is lying. Dog whistle politics. She said today that EU Brexit demands would mean that “uncontrolled immigration from the EU would continue”. The UK government has always had the choice to implement the EU rules to limit EU immigration, but has chosen not to do so.  
Teresa May's predecessors in the British government divided my country in two in 1921.Time to right that wrong for the benefit of all.#Brexit #disaster #Endpartition #UnityRef

European Council President Donald Tusk says Member States decided "for the good of the negotiations" the Prime Minister's Chequers proposal for Brexit "is a step in the right direction" and says he is "convinced a compromise, good for all, is still possible" 
Poor @theresa_may the clue is in Brexit, it’s Britain leaving the EU hence the need for her to have a plan. It’s pathetic the BG is absolutely lost, clueless and don’t know what they’re doing from one day to the next.  Media reporting ‘Coming out fighting’ is comedy gold 
Theresa May retaliates after bruising EU summit and sends pound plunging 
"Chequers plan died months ago"David Cameron's former spin chief @CraigOliver100 and Guardian columnist @OwenJones84 debate @theresa_may's #Brexit plan, the possibility of a no-deal scenario and the EU's actions towards the UK.Latest on Brexit here:  
Image if you will, the referendum outcome if the vote was to:* Destroy the Good Friday Agreement* Crash the Pound* Stop being the 5th largest economy on earth* Pit neighbor against neighbor* Diminish our place in the worldyet, that is the outcome of a no deal

Nicola Sturgeon slams ‘dreadful’ Brexit statement by Theresa May

There are many calling for second referendums on Brexit and Scottish Independence, but shouldn't our experience with these tell us the UK should never hold a binary referendum ever again?  It's evident they resolve nothing and are therefore useless as a tool of democracy. 
After Salzburg, what next for #Brexit? "At a time like this, it is essential that those responsible for safeguarding the health of the British people are heard," says @martinmckee  
On Salzburg and the 24 hours that followed: Theresa May has doubled down on her Brexit plan. Repeating the same thing again and again is unlikely to work.  
No but you WILL refer to the #EU Laws in replace of your own....Great Britain needs a REVOLUTION.#Brexit #BrexitChaos 
Not so. Tories rule out another referendum. Labour do not.  
Statement on the #Brexit negotiations:  
May challenges EU as Brexit talks hit 'impasse', sterling tumbles  
MORE LIKE REMOANESH RANGANATHAN AM I RIGHT MY BREXIT BROS  
Exactly. The EU’s attitude to Brexit from the start has been outrageous, shocking even. Its apologists and quislings here at home have made the situation worse.  Support for us leaving with no deal will rise sharply now.  We’ve had enough.  
Look what has the Basque Autonomous Community Parliament approved on #Brexit and the need to guarantee fully implementation of Good Friday Agreement@M_AndersonSF@DeclanKearneySF@GerryAdamsSF@caoimhinmgm@newbelfast@PaulMaskeyMP 
The UK always retained sovereignty within the EU. Brexit is proof of that.Scotland has no sovereignty within the UK. Being dragged out of the EU against our will is proof of that.Comparing the two like this is just dishonest, and Michael Kelly knows it.  
It is Labour’s biggest mistake ever to sit smugly on the deck of this sinking ship looking forward to taking over as captain once we’re all thrashing around in the frozen Brexit waters. Say nothing, do nothing and Labour will be equally blamed. 
Hyperbole. We don't measure elections by turnout, with the highest turnout the most important. Many things can undermine public trust, and do. And the meaning of the referendum is not nearly as clear as is asserted here 12/  
The Tories created Brexit. Only they can destroy it. Frustrating I know, but if Labour came out now for PV, tomorrow’s headlines and every Tory interview would be about ‘traitors’. If we want to stop this, we can’t gift the Tories a unifying betrayal narrative. 
As the govt falls apart over Brexit - the biggest challenge facing this country for generations, Labour could seize the day but on no. We charge into conference with a thrusting public facing message about... deselecting our own MPs. FFS. This is so unbelievably depressing.  
Theresa May is leading the most incompetent and unpleasant government in my lifetime. They are embarrassing us on the world stage and taking our country backwards. Obviously they will blame Brexit chaos on the EU, but we need to hold them to account! #GTTO 
Are you for real? Taoiseach had a good meeting with PM. Stop being taken in by the UK #brexit media 
Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer was interviewed this afternoon by Michael Crick for #C4News 
Every time a Leaver whines that Brussels is bullying Britain just remind them that their leaders assured us that the UK would hold all the cards in the negotiations. Here's Gove in April 2016:#PeoplesVote #Brexit #LeaveLies 
The EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country.  
Try to remember that Brexit may take a while for the benefits to truly emerge when we’re all living in the woods and eating our own shit. 
DUP leader Arlene Foster heaps praise on Theresa May’s tough Brexit stance against the EU

Thank you to @MartinVickers for pledging to #StandUp4Brexit It’s so important that we keeping pushing to ensure the Brexit we voted for is deliveredIf your MP hasn’t pledged yet please email them and ask them to  
Economic, health, work, education, crime, transport, environment or any other crisis for a Tory PM and Labour would be demanding to be heard, screaming MSM bias against Corbyn if the party wasn't included. Sidestepping Brexit is telling  
Oh yes, May’s Government has showered the EU with respect over the last two years.Go whistle, liberation, white flags, independence, citizens of nowhere spring to mind.Minister for Brexit treating Barnier with disdain.The government’s approach has been abominable. 
"Ambush"... Because Brexit is something done to Britain by hostile Europeans, not the other way around.  
Watch Keir Starmer put this lazy journalism right. Labour’s position has always been clear, it’s the media who choose not to report it.#Brexit #NoDeal 
In negotiations, the EU always keep pushing until you push back. Pleased that is what @theresa_may has done today with her strong statement.I still believe we can negotiate a good Brexit deal. But if that’s not possible then Britain should leave without one. 
Given our current #Brexit chaos if there was ever a tweet that hasn't aged well then this David Cameron gem must rank in the all time top three   
Great to see you tweeting on Brexit Penny. Your comments regarding the EU’s behaviour and people’s determination to see the referendum result enacted are spot on. Time to pledge to #StandUp4Brexit? 
British Prime Minister Theresa May says it is "not acceptable to simply reject" proposals in Brexit negotiations with the European Union."In the meantime, we must, and will, continue the work of preparing ourselves for no deal."  
A myth the media have peddled on behalf of the Tories is to say “...but Labour’s policy on #Brexit isn’t clear.”Watch Keir Starmer put this lazy journalism right. Labour’s position has always been clear, it’s the media who choose not to report it.  
READ: Despite @theresa_may #Brexit U-turn, #PeoplesVote is still on the table: 
French president says EU should resist prime minister’s calls for compromise on Brexit  - it's clear that the final Brexit deal won't be as good as the deal we have with the EU right now. That's why we're marching for a #PeoplesVote: 
May’s capitulation last December at the end of “phase 1” of the Brexit talks was a wake up call to get rid of her. Unbelievably the Tory Party didn’t do so & Salzburg was the result. We are being humiliated by the EU for no good reason. She has to go.   
J Corbyn and k Starmer have already issued clear and positive statements. We need a GE now to be rid of this cruel chaotic and failed Tory Gov. #Brexit mess is on them but Labour has the policies and vision to sort out this as well as all the other misery they have caused. #JC4PM 
So now you want to interview them, grill them on Brexit failure. Get May on and grill her...it’s her mess. You’ve all gone soft on her 
Who's this 'we' Mr Grimes. You didn't fight in the war. Nor did I, but members of my family were killed in breaking those Atlantic blockades. That generation didn't fight fascism so people like you could use their name in vain to smuggle fascism in through a bent referendum.  
Kate Hoey: "They're talking about a People's Vote, which is just another word for a second referendum." Watch ▼@DanWootton | @KateHoeyMP |  
Right we have officially gone off piste la la land now. There MUST be something we can do to stop #Brexit It’s utter full scale national insanity not the will of the people. Please promise me friends you will fight for #remain right to the end? We can do this but only together. 
That 'long game' has seen my business trashed, my income decimated, my EU national friends leave Britain, my British friends leave France in droves. Brexit is having a real impact NOW - we can't just wait for the 'long game'. 
I think @theresa_may should treat 1) the 62.53% of the electorate in 2016 who didn't vote for brexit;2) Scotland;3) Northern Ireland;4) Gibraltar;5) The 2017 election result;with the sort of respect that she now demands from the EU. 
Theresa May had plenty of time to negotiate a Brexit deal for Britain. She has failed. She has let the country down. It’s time for her to go, and Britain needs another general election.  #NoDeal #Article50 #GeNow 
Amazing how so many people including it appears a lot of the media seem to have forgotten that we we're all warned about the Irish border issue BEFORE THE REFERENDUM on 9 June 2016 - BBC News - Major and Blair say an EU exit could split the UK  
Theresa May is 'weaker now than she ever was' despite her defiant Brexit speech demanding respect from EU leaders.Kevin Maguire of The Daily Mirror reports on what the last few days could mean for the 'hurting, clueless' Prime Minister's leadership.  
Brexit negotiations have descended into the Twitterspat phase, where you argue over tone rather than addressing the issue at hand.  
How lucky are we to have an amazing negotiator as our @potus? Just look at how badly England’s #Brexit negotiations with the Globalist EU are proceeding under Theresa May.She should ask Trump for help!  
Had to get 2 broken teeth fixed at the dentist today... Lady on reception said "I love your hoodie... I've just heard about #theresamay's speech on the radio!"  the people can see that #Brexit is a disaster... #STOPBREXIT IS THE ONLY WAY! Time for a #PeoplesVote 
The PM is forced to make a statement on live TV about her Brexit chaos. Meanwhile, some senior people in Labour are literally sitting in room talking about reselection of MPs. It's politics, but not as you know it, Jim. 
The shadow Brexit minister says Labour would consider the possibility of holding a second referendum if no deal is reached with EU  
If a necessary condition of making Brexit a success was having the nation united behind the idea, perhaps going full tilt on the back of a 50/50 vote wasn’t the best plan?  
It's a bit weird that the friday before Labour conference as Brexit is at "impasse" according to Theresa May we can't find a senior Labour voice to come on #C4News live tonight 
The only winners today in the Brexit fiasco are the circling US vultures rubbing their hands* with glee at the prospect of UK, desperate for some kind of positive, agreeing to any trade deal that they insist upon no matter how exploitative.[*I know vultures don’t have hands] 
Jeremy Corbyn is a pansy, a quisling and a Chamberlain type that would sell this Country down the river over Brexit. Labour are unfit to ever take power again in the present form it finds it's self in. All Brexiteers must unite to ensure they never see power for many years. 
Theresa May was not ambushed.Ambushes depend on surprise.Anyone that understands even only the basics of Brexit knew that Salzberg was absolutely, obviously bound to happen. 
Happy Peace Day! Let's Not forget... #thanks #Europe #brexit

His stance together with Starmer has been consistent right up until now: respect the ref, set out 6 tests, oppose any Brexit that doesn't pass them. Also, offer a vision of a soft Brexit with a customs union. Vote down any hard Brexit. Meanwhile, let the tories hang themselves. 
At least Anthony Eden resigned after he was humiliated by his handling of the Suez crisis whereas #TheresaMay clings to her Brexit humiliation like it were a safety rope rather than what it is-a noose.

"The ball is in your court?" RUBBISH. It is not EU's responsibility to make up for TWO YEARS of bumbling, unprepared, waffling incompetence, TWO YEARS. This abomination should have not seen the light of day as a referendum when CLEARLY nobody did the damn research first. 
Hey! Travolta! We both know toooooo many voted Brexit because of the tried and tested ‘foreigners will eat you’ fear campaign and implication that we’d get free foot massages on the NHS. It was not fair. It was dark, sordid and lies made it undemocratic. #PeoplesVoteMarch 
The Prime Minister’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster.From day one, @Theresa_May has looked incapable of delivering a good deal for Britain.The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option. 
The UK government is starting to realise more and more what #Brexit actually means. We are still ready to reach out, but the @EPPGroup will protect the principles of the EU. We should continue working on further progress in the negotiations.

Cambell has a workable & legal plan.You don't.I have a plan.You don't.#PeoplesVote has a plan.You don'tAfter promising a wonderful #Brexit, you don't have anything do you.You can't deliver anything.You have no ideas and don't have a plan.Pathetic. 
Wrong. @DavidLammy There was a specific form of Brexit on the ballot paper: Leave. Not stay in a bit, but Leave. Both you and @theresa_may need to respect that. 
Treason demands respect, yet she won't respect the evidence that the referendum that caused this disaster was delivered through cheating and dishonesty because it's her fellow Tories and the neanderthal DUP, that's keeping her in power, that are responsible.  
A Type 1 diabetic friend went to get insulin prescription today, told there’s none left due to panic stockpiling. This is why Theresa May has started the Tory PR campaign around a No Deal Brexit. Consequences loom on the horizon, and Operation Blame The EU is *go* 
At last, Theresa May is showing some steel against the disrespect of the UK by the EU. She has promised to stick by the referendum vote to leave. Brexiteers will hold the Tories to that promise. There's no going back now. UK's membership of the EU must be history in 6 months. 
So @theresa_may demands respect from the #EU. When exactly does she intend to treat the views of the people of #Scotland with respect? #Brexit #BrexitShambles @IanBlackfordMP @Feorlean 
1/2 One point that is quite clear to me is that those calling for a 2nd referendum share a great deal of responsibility for where we are today - by undermining the PMs position and giving the EU hope of reversing the decision. 
James Max tells @Will_DryOFOC to "go live in France if you're that worried about brexit"Will fires back... I think that's an awful thing to say... you're taking the right of young people to live in another European country away through the process of #brexit#peoplesvote #FBPE 
Challenge for UK and US publics is that consequences of Brexit and Trump will build - and get worse - over time, which makes it all the more important to hold pro-Brexit and Trump politicians accountable when they inevitably try to shirk responsibility.  
This is a good explainer from the indefatigable ⁦@JolyonMaugham⁩ on today’s bombshell brexit ruling. Hopeful of an ECJ ruling before December.  
At least you can say of the Captain of the Titanic that he didn't deliberately steer his ship into the iceberg... He made a mistake. It was an accident.Unlike @theresa_may he didn't increase speed, grab the wheel and aim headlong towards it, screaming #Brexit means Brexit ! 
What did you think of Theresa May’s speech today?#Brexit #TheresaMay

EU must respect UK in brexit negotiations  :) from a govt that has  repeatedly threatened not to pay the bill and has been holding EU citizens in the UK for ransome for over two years ?!!!!! 
Ireland taking back the six counties after the shambles that is Brexit  
Theresa May has utterly failed with her Brexit 'negotiations', it is embarrassing to watch her try to offload responsibility to the EU. 'It's not my fault, it's them' isn't going to cut it. We need to #StopBrexit now before a No-deal disaster... #DowningStreet #MayStatement 
May's statement is nothing short of ridiculous. Two years since the referendum the government has done nothing except bicker, fight, and waste time. It's risible to expect the EU to fix something the Tories broke.No wonder the UK has little respect from EU negotiators.

“She put on black as if she was at a bloody funeral and looks into the camera as if she’s Margaret Thatcher” Labour MP @DavidLammy scolds Theresa May after her Brexit statement  
17.4 million hard right deplorable ideologue people like me voted to leave the EU - those Brussels Bully Boys are not our friends on Brexit Ally - stick up for Britain  @montie @Arron_banks @LeaveEUOfficial 
Mrs May finally catches up with 17,410,742 voters and realises that 'EU Leaders' are just a malicious bunch of psychopaths and bastards hellbent on punishing UK for exercising our right to LeaveTime to go.Viva Brexit! 
#UPDATE British PM Theresa May hits back at the EU after it roundly rejected her #Brexit plan, saying its refusal to compromise was 'not acceptable' and reiterating the possibility of walking away from negotiations  
Theresa May is 'weaker now than she ever was' despite her defiant Brexit speech demanding respect from EU leaders.@Kevin_Maguire reports on what the last few days could mean for the 'hurting, clueless and desperate' Prime Minister's leadership.  
conservatives have no viable brexit plan, labour's plan is to stay quiet so as not to offend anyone and hope to capitalise on the chaos - sort of disaster socialism, and the lib dems have got who cares 
(7/7) > Is that enough historical fact to dispel this ridiculous, jingoistic narrative of yours, ie: first, that the UK won WW2 & liberated Europe from Nazi rule more or less by itself: and that second, #Brexit is somehow on a par with WW2?Because it isn't. It's not even close. 
“That these citizens—five million people and their families—are likely to become the main victims of Brexit makes the situation even worse than it would be in any case. They are, essentially, being punished for choosing to live exactly what the EU is about.” 7/ 
The publication will be available from the FES website later this week. It will be publicised in the UK and throughout the EU, including in Brussels, by FES offices to help make sure that no @The3Million nor @BritishInEurope citizen is left behind because of Brexit.  3/  
I don't know why I'm surprised any more to venture onto UK political Twitter and see precisely no one talking about Northern Ireland, despite it being the alpha and omega of Brexit. This absence of debate will be an historical artifact. 
When I boarded the train to London early this morning I knew my day would be focused on the rights of @The3Million: today I am pleased to announce the publication of “Endangered Rights: The Impact of Brexit on EU Citizens” with @FES_GB. Little did I know how topical I’d be!1/ 
So anyway #FBPE you know how we kept telling you to trust @jeremycorbyn with his sit back and watch approach to brexit? Won't say we told you so  
Oi you! @theresa_may your first few words were a lie today. The referendum was not a democratic exercise, it was a exercise in corruption “won” by Vote Leave lies, cheating & law breaking. Upholding it will kill Parliamentary democracy in the UK. #PeopelsVote #Brexit #FBPE 
The Prime Minister's message is clear: "I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement on resolving the two big problems in the negotiations and we stand ready!"  
Theresa May's reached the end of the road with her #Brexit strategy. It's time to get a grip. Parliament must be reconvened so we can break the logjam in the national interest - then give public the final say in a #PeoplesVote 
Let’s not let @campbellclaret and  second ref crowd off the hook either. They’ve undermined Brussels’ incentive to give the UK a fair deal. So long as EUcrats think #Brexit is reversible they have little incentive to negotiate. Campbell et al have served their country v badly 
Labourites! In Liverpool on Sunday? If so please come to our event on data, politics, Russia, the referendum & more. Dep leader @tom_watson isn’t making a platform speech, but he’ll be speaking here with @chrisinsilico @shahmiruk  me & @ObserverUK’s @soniasodha 
Can someone explain why there can’t be a new Brexit referendum now we know the deal - or total absence of one ? Original vote taken blind. 
“Brexit means Brexit, Nothing has changed, Strong and Stable, We Stand Ready”  
Isn’t it wonderful that everybody is so obsessed with @JeremyCorbyn. They know he is the next @UKLabour Prime Minister. Appointing @Keir_Starmer was an excellent move. Labour’s Brexit strategy has been absolutely correct. @CONservatives have a majority; Brexit is theirs. 
"I have treated the EU with nothing but respect, the UK expects the same." Prime Minister Theresa May speaks following a summit in Salzburg, Austria, where her plan for Brexit was largely rejected:  
Brexit now taking on a slight railway-timetable-in-August-1914 vibe, with people trusting that “good sense will prevail” because “conflict is in nobody’s interest”. History suggests unwise to bet on it. 
Theresa May; negotiating Brexit with the EU is a lot like making love to a beautiful woman. You nip over to the content to schmooze her but end up making a complete tit of yourself and come home with your tail between your legs, proclaiming that you didn’t fancy her anyway pic.twitter.com/yFh9qU6CaX 
More and more, it seems like the choice is between no-deal chaos and a #PeoplesVote.The ball is in our court. The left can give up and let hard Brexiteers lead the UK to a disaster, or stop Brexit and bring down the Tory government.#StopToryBrexit - the time is now. #Lab18 
From today's @FinancialTimes #Brexit #SalzburgSummit18 #TheresaMay #ChequersPlan #NoDeal 
.@TheEconomist:‘In 2016 the @LibDems’ call for a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal was considered eccentric. Today half of voters back it’I’m so glad we @LibDems @timfarron had the courage to initiate this idea, and the persistence to keep it alive during 18 mths of mockery 
Announcement from PM suggesting that UK will lead the world on phasing out petrol & diesel vehicles is delusional. Their messy #Brexit will negatively impact our car industry & discourage investment in new, green technology. #ExitFromBrexit 
The only thing @theresa_may's desperate bluffing will achieve is boosting the case for a #PeoplesVote.She's gone from failure to farce, and now with the ramped up threat of a no-deal Brexit thrown in. It's time to give democracy back to the people. 
Well this whole Brexit thing seems to be going splendidly. 
Well said ⁦@gareth_snell⁩ ..”turning our backs on the traditional Brexit voting heartlands we doom ourselves to another Tory government and reinforce the view that ‘we know best and you should know your place’.  
Desperate, deranged, demonic Theresa May is  Europe's worst Brexit poker player. My video verdict on her Downing Street meltdown  
Theresa may demanding respect from the EU! Like the respect you have shown to the people of Scotland and the Scottish parliament over Brexit you soulless reptilian cretin. #DissolveTheUnuion 
Whether you agree with Brexit or not this is a clear statement both of principle and its practical implications. Why didn't the SNP understand the same about indyref?  
After 21 years in 3 Ambulance Trusts my NHS service has drawn to a close . Exciting new ventures beckon for me and I have amazing memories to keep with me forever. Will miss so much, above all the great people I have worked alongside. Brexit = Broad Exit!  
For those of you who missed it earlier, the PM's speech on Brexit:  
We need to think about our own future. A hard Brexit or no deal would be disastrous for Scotland. The people of Scotland needvto engage in a debate on our options.  
Let’s just not and say we did. #brexit 
Corbyn once again failing to call for the people to have a final say on Brexit, or for an exit from Brexit. Since he called for Article 50 to be triggered the day after the referendum, he has failed to stand up to Tories on Brexit & is ignoring Lab members who want a final say  
"Young people in Northern Ireland are desperate for our voices to be heard."This is the reality of Brexit. @OFOCNI's Doire Finn explains why a #PeoplesVote is the only way forward to avoid disaster in Northern Ireland. 
Pound sinks after PM May says Brexit talks at impasse  
UK minister says many Britons content to leave without Brexit deal  
The fact that there was not sufficient power at Downing Street and Theresa May had to postpone her statement says it all. The lights are going down on May’s Government. She should go given the failure to provide leadership over Brexit. 
The #Labour opposition will vote down ANY deal #May could gain from the #EU never mind a #NoDealBrexit Enough #Tory MPs will reject No Deal and so the government will collapse. Brexit has broken the Tories and will bring down their government. Good job! #Moats @talkRADIO 
BREXIT: Furious Theresa May berates EU leaders over failure to accept her plans - “please help, I’ve promised a bunch of crazy people who hate me a load of stuff I can’t deliver. I don’t want to go home. Don’t make me go home.” 
A thought-provoking watch - whatever your view of Brexit - and @Jacob_Rees_Mogg's interview on @bbctheview back in May is the starting point for the film... 
Brexit campaigner says PM May should now ditch her Brexit plans  
Miscalculation the EU made was that we are happy to mock our national figures ourselves, but that doesn’t extend to themBritish people want a #brexit deal, but if the EU keeps treating them this way their support for walking away with no deal will go up and up #PoliticsLive 
In response  Corbyn says ""The political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option." But we still don't know how he would negotiate a "jobs-first" Brexit with all the benefits of the single market without accepting freedom of movement 
A national debate on how we’ll spend the 40 BILLION pounds we won’t now be paying the sleazy fat-cats and spivs in Brussels to leave their bankers ramp is now crucial #Labour #Corbyn #Brexit #Moats @talkRADIO 
Deranged Theresa May's Brexit statement looked like a PM attending her own political funeral, says @Kevin_Maguire 
It will never stop. When you die and go to hell Satan and all his demons will be arguing about Brexit. For eternity. 
Theresa May has been trying to divide the countries of the EU. She's failed & is now trying to present their clear, united position as bullying.The fact that her own party is deeply divided & full of ruthless #Brexit bullies makes this look especially ludicrous.#MayStatement 
After two meltdowns in two days, it's now obvious that Theresa May can't carry on leading our talks with the EU, her rank incompetence is driving us over a cliff, this is more important than the #Brexit vote, she must be removed ASAP, Article 50 suspended and a GE #VoteLabour 
Today Theresa May took Britain another step closer to the worst possible outcome from the Brexit negotiations - a catastrophic ‘no deal’ that would hammer jobs and growth. It’s clearer than ever that the British public must have a final say on Brexit.  
Summer 2015: a Greek PM struggles to avoid a deal on EU’s termsCan’t win a game of chickenDoesn’t know how to tell his partyDesperately seeks face-saving compromiseEU dismisses his cakeist proposalsClock is tickingAny resemblance to Brexit is purely coincidental 
May wants EU to respect UK in #Brexit talks. With respect, EU didn’t instigate this, we did - through a vote based on false prospectus. Now we know this mis-sold Brexit can’t be delivered, respect is owed to British public (esp. Leave voters!), by asking ‘do you still want out?’ 
"I will not overturn the result of the referendum & break up my country." says Theresa May.Well here's the thing,Ireland is not England!  
Who is most to blame for the Brexit talks impasse?

.@jeremycorbyn responds to Theresa May’s statement on the Brexit negotiations  
.@theresa_may called an election she didn’t need and lost. She said Brexit meant Brexit when she didn’t know what it meant. She picked her own cabinet which split. And she’s had two years to convince Europe but has failed. She’s had her chance, we now need a #PeoplesVote 
The Government’s approach to the Brexit negotiations has been chaotic & confused throughout. Right now all signs point to a bad deal or no deal at all.It’s clearer than ever the British public must have a final say on the negotiations, with the option of staying in the EU.  
No Deal Brexit, £ tanking, entire industries, companies & jobs at risk, Northern Ireland Border, the rights and freedoms of every citizen in the U.K. at risk... anything to say?  
The U.K.  rejected @theresa_may and her horrible #Brexit in GE17. She then bought seats to ensure she could force herself on us.She is only representing the tiny Tory membership and most of them can’t stand her or #chequers either. #peoplesvote#voteleavebrokethelaw 
Theresa May's impossible dream ‘to honour the referendum and not divide the country’ is our living nightmare.Lets have a #PeoplesVote and end this farce now. Come on Jeremy Corbyn, earn your Opposition Leader salary for once. 
Corbyn Supporters: The great thing about Corbyn is that he doesn't play politics, he's honest, and he always says what he meansAlso Corbyn Supporters: lol at people not understanding Corbyn's 4D chess moves with Brexit, sit down, it's time for some game theory 
Good stuff.  But of course the Chequers proposal WOULD overturn the result of the referendum.

As the prospect of a no-deal Brexit gets ever-closer, RBS boss Ross McEwan told LBC that would leave Britain in a "very bad position" for the short- and medium-term.  
Theresa May’s handling of #Brexit is continuing to go well then...  
This jingoistic whipping up of a populist sense of victimhood and blaming other nations for your self-inflicted wounds is how wars have started in Europe, only in our recent past.May and her Brexit Tories are beneath contempt.

Brexit  
Don’t know whether to laugh or cry #Brexit  
Can anyone point out a time when @theresa_may or the conservative party treated the EU with respect? She accused them of meddling in 2017 GE, she consistently undermines @MichelBarnier by going over his head to lobby EU leaders about brexit negotiations at every summit. 
.@H_E_Samuel: Macron's attack on May over Brexit was all part of his bid to become the big man of Europe   
Brexit meant leaving the EU. All of the EU. Stop whingeing. The electorate knew this was a one off..so stop trying to pretend we’re the same as Ireland and will keep voting til we get the one you hard lefties want 
Corbyn only has to support a #PeoplesVote at the Labour Conference and then May, the Tories and Brexit are finished all in one go. But will he? Stop Brexit.#FBPE 
Always good to get a wee reminder of this video of the day after the Brexit vote. Has anything actually changed? UK doesn’t have a scooby  
Democracy redefined there. Referendum was won on cheating, misinformation and outright lies. Time to face the truth. 
Who knew it was actually an English vote that would lead to an Independent Scotland and a United Ireland  #Brexit #TheresaMay #indyref 
What erodes trust is the fact that the unsafe advisory referendum is still used as an excuse for this unnecessary chaos. There is no mandate for No Deal Brexit. There is no longer any mandate for Brexit at all in fact. Put it to the test. #PeoplesVote 
Sorry Kate. I voted for Brexit too but if you think this was a "defiant" speech you kidding yourself. It said nothing new. Same old same old, just said with a dramatic flourish to gull the Tory faithful at the party conference. She'll never deliver the Brexit we voted for. 
EU diplomats clearly do not share the interpretation of events in Salzburg reflected in U.K. press this morning. They tell me they remain in constructive mood as regards #Brexit negotiations and that negotiations are tough by nature 
Fuck Theresa MayFuck BrexitFuck Boris JohnsonFuck Michael GoveFuck David CameronFuck Jacob Rees-MoggFuck Nigel FarageFuck David DavisFuck the right-wing pressFuck the BBCFuck all the stupid flag-waving gammonand fuck this 'will of the people' bullshit  
For all the PM’s big talk, fundamentals are the same:- the Tories wasted 2yrs disagreeing with each other nevermind the EU;- there’s a majority in Parl against no deal;- a majority in Parl against an extreme Brexit; but-no consensus on the form of Exit.Solution: #PeoplesVote 
In the next few weeks when the GE is called I'd like to ask everyone who wants to remain in the EU one thing:Please Do NOT vote Tory or Labour.Neither party is willing to save the UK from Brexit, so neither is deserving of your vote. 
A couple of days ago she said she has worked non stop for years to ensure there is more social housing. Today, she says she has worked ‘day & night’ to resolve Brexit. C’mon now, which is it. Lying again & again, & again. I’ll give her that, she does work hard at lying 
This, from May’s statement, is an amazing rhetorical pairing. *We* must respect the referendum result; *they* must act in the interests of their citizens.  
Today rich Brexiteers have robbed money from every family in the country and Mrs May is determined to plough on with Brexit. The whole country needs to demand a #PeoplesVote We can’t allow this to happen. Stop Brexit. #FBPE 
Theresa May says EU must treat UK with "respect" in #BrexitnegotiationsFull statement and analysis:  
Kate Hoey MP: Labour Conference must not seek to overturn the EU referendum outcome  via @PoliticsHome 
Today's @theresa_may speech has raised the temperature of Brexit negotiations. Time is running out to avoid a no-deal.  Given only 1 in 7 small firms are preparing for this outcome it "must be avoided at all costs" says @MikeCherryFSB  
The powdered technocrat fop Macron so dearly WANTS Brexit to be complicated. To his Statist New Class supporters, unnecessary Byzantine complexity is their reason for being and source of power. Negotiation with these snakes is pointless. 
I am ready for any Brexit hardship, says man who’s upset if his boiled egg isn’t just right 
The cleverest trick the Tories will ever play is calling an entirely unnecessary referendum, taking two years only to negotiate a devastating no deal - and then convincing the public it’s *the EU* who have destroyed the country. 
Overheard at the koolaid stand in Jones Town. #brexit  
Theresa May's speech today: "If I go down I'm going to make sure I take all you fuckers in this country down with me". #Maybot #ToriesOut #HELP #Brexit 
May says Brexit talks have hit impasse, EU must produce alternative plans  
Every time I see a Labour statement on Brexit I'm reminded of what Jim Callaghan said to his top civil servant when he arrived at the Foreign Office in 1974: "I hear you really care about Europe. Well, that's alright, as long as you remember I really care about the Labour Party." 
British Pound in +1.0% Slump as May Confirms Brexit Negotiations have Reached Impasse  
The Pound in free fall and who’s benefiting, Rees-Mogg. He needs to be put on trial for talking our country and future down. This is a national disaster. Stop Brexit.#FBPE 
Not come across any EU diplomat today who defends Tusk’s cherry picking instagram at Salzburg summit. His people say it was an attempt to reach out to a younger audience. If so, clearly mis-judged and ill-timed #Brexit 
Jeremy Corbyn’s response to May’s shambles #Brexit speech reported on Sky News.Please note, things are so tough at Sky they don’t have one single pic or clip of Jeremy to use for this! #GENow 
So ... where exactly are we now with Brexit?1. EU won't accept cherry picking.2. May won't accept no cherry picking.3. EU cannot budge.4. May will not budge.5. May rejects a #PeoplesVote 6. May insinuates that the EU doesn't respect her.7. On this, at least, she is right. 
Shutting down the federal government always backfires on the Republicans. They never learn. So stupid and self-destructive.  So damaging to Feds and us all. 
The PM has just admitted that Brexit negotiations are a failure. No amount of fighting talk will hide the risk of a no deal catastrophe #Brexit 
Highly depressing.There was me hoping/expecting May to announce the cancellation of Brexit and she stands there sounding as if she is willing to lead us into war.I can’t believe I am witnessing this.Sincere apologies to all our EU27 friends.#PeoplesVote 
Madly, there was a moment there when I honestly thought she was going to say "None of the options are workable, so we're not doing Brexit". 
Rather exhausted by all the Brexit takes at the moment. But here's mine. It's a mess. We can't be sure about what's going to happen. But there'll probably be a deal largely on the EU's terms because no deal is too awful for the UK. 
EU response to PM’s statement just now: We are and having been listening to UK position and offering U.K. a unique partnership post #Brexit but we will not agree to anything that will harm us, the EU 
In amongst all this dreadful Tory disaster, it’s worth remembering that Jeremy Corbyn called for Article 50 to be triggered the day after the 2016 referendum. 
Theresa May's Brexit statement in Brief: HELP! 
"Throughout this process I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same."Theresa May says it is "unacceptable" for the EU to reject the UK's Brexit proposals "without a detailed explanation and counter-proposals".  
Anyone who still thinks #Corbyn hasn’t absolutely killed this #Brexit shambles is in serious denial....bossed it from day 1. Watched them implode from the sidelines like we all knew they would. My man  @jeremycorbyn  #TheresaMay #DowningStreet #ChequersPlan 
Theresa May "will agree to nothing that will divide her country".(1) There are four countries(2) None of them are yours(3) Erm.....wtf do you think Brexit has done? 
If anyone missed Theresa May's hardball Brexit speech at Downing Street earlier, this was its crowning cringey climax   
PM #Brexit plan rejected by EU leaders, rejected by many on both wings of her party,rejected by business,rejected by the vast majority of voters too,but she is to carry on down the same path. This is a PM who cannot get any deal,it's time for her to resign it's gone on too long. 
Given Northern Ireland voted to remain in the EUShould they now have a referendum to decide if they stay in the EU or UK?. 
This is the same Jeremy Corbyn who wanted to trigger #Article50 immediately after the #Brexit referendum with zero preparation.  
Disorganised, directionless, delusional Brexit negotiations, disorganised directionless UK Political parties, matched in their ineffectiveness by Media Reporting thats partisan, at times frivolous, loaded with opinion, lacking fact & presenting little challenge. 
The more that the EU tries to belittle the UK, the more we see the true face of this failing institution.#Brexit EU bullying and Blair’s ‘Project Patronise’ reaffirm why so many of us voted for Brexit in the first place  via @BrexitCentral 
This was the real audience she was speaking to, since as ever Brexit is a Tory internal war in which the entire country is merely collateral damage  
"I have treated the EU with nothing but respect, the UK expects the same." Prime Minister Theresa May speaks following a summit in Salzburg, Austria, where her plan for Brexit was largely rejected:  
May: "I will not overturn the result of the referendum nor will I break up my country. We need serious engagement in resolving the two big issues. I've treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same."These options were offered a year ago. May rejected them all  
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn responding to the Prime Minister's statement has said "Theresa May’s Brexit negotiating strategy has been a disaster" and "the political games from both the EU and our Government need to end because no deal is not an option" 
The pound whenever Theresa May speaks about Brexit   
The intransigence of the EU when dealing with David Cameron in 2015/16 was a contributory factor in the UK voting for Brexit (an outcome they didn’t want). It’s seems that the lesson from that hasn’t yet hit home. 
#DowningStreet   "I will not split the Country" as she ignores Scotland's  vote to #remainIs this woman on glue or just wants to keep the 10 DUP Votes?#Scotland #brexit 
You have it the wrong way round. The referendum result is reversing itself... and the PV is a natural response to that status.  
A #NoDeal #Brexit could have a devastating impact on Wales - our agriculture, our industries (we export a LOT to EU), our communities.Westminster doesn't care about us. We must care for ourselves.In the event of a no deal Brexit in March, do you want to see 
A simple phone poll would very likely reveal that the will of the British people has changed in the last two years as a result of increased understanding of Brexit’s dire implications. To refuse to acknowledge this fact you have to be either disingenuous or deluded.  
Pleased to see Mrs May sounding a bit tougher but a huge opportunity missed to push for a free trade deal with no political linkage. That is what Brexit voters want.  
As #Brexit becomes the inevitable omnishambles, we in Wales have to start believing we can, and should, decide for ourselves where our future lies #indyCymru.Join #YesCymru.  
Ideally I would like to walk out of this interminable screening of Brexit: The Movie, but they’ve only gone and locked the fucking doors. 
i should be very interested to hear what @jeremycorbyn has to say about this  it's an open goal; will he put the ball in it? will he even attempt to? will he turn up to the match?? or simply sit at home muttering about an equally impossible 'jobs-first' Brexit?  
But no Jake. The mess and the chaos you have unleashed has taken the country so far from what it voted for, the Brexit offered by her and by you is so far removed from what it voted for @peoplesvote_uk only way to resolve this now 
Yesterday £1 bought me €1.03 at my local post office.Today the £ dropped another 1.3%Strong possibility it'll get you less than €1 from tomorrow morning.It got you €1.30 the day before the referendum. 
Theresa May’s press conference today was not about a Prime Minister making tough choices in a negotiation. It was about appeasing the insatiable Brexit fanatics in her own party. Brexit is a Tory psychodrama, nothing more. 
The Brits were trying to choreograph something positive - warm words and momentum in the talks. It was the UK which fought to get Brexit even on the agenda at all in Salzburg. Then they turned up and royally pissed everyone off. There's no hiding it's not brilliant diplomacy. 
Also PM’s claim that the other side have a duty to compromise and respond to her proposals is not something she ever thinks when devolved governments put proposals to her - if she did UK position in #brexit would be much more sensible 
Whilst the chaos around Brexit continues never forget that @RuthDavidsonMSP lied to Scottish voters about a No vote meaning we stay in the EU. 
MISSING: An opposition party which has a view on where we should go from here on Brexit. Perhaps we'll find out next week in Liverpool. Or perhaps not. Astonishing they're not all over the airwaves making hay. 
No one wants Brexit anymore, I think you are miles out there mate as from everyone I talk to their views on leaving the EU have hardened!! 
can't believe we're even talking about 'breaking up the country' what the fuck theresa may, how did we get to this point, how can you respect any referendum result which has 'breaking up the country' as a potential consequence??  
Whipping up domestic anger as a substitute for producing a Brexit proposal. She would rather create a toxic (or ‘hostile’) environment in UK to maintain power than seriously engage with the EU. Britain is truly cursed to be led by such people.  
Theresa May demands respect from EU in Brexit negotiations  
Can someone, anyone, stop May saying stupid things. We all know #Brexit will be a disaster for the economy and now it appears the lack of any UK plan is seeing Sterling tank. More than ever Scotland needs Independence.  
Theresa May has demanded the EU "respects" the UK in Brexit talks: “The EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country”. Then go for a Canada++ deal or walk away under WTO..  
.@theresa_may: “No one wants a good deal more than me. "But the EU should be clear: I will not overturn the result of the referendum. Nor will I break up my country.”  
Sterling tumbles after PM May tells EU to come up with new Brexit proposals  
May says Brexit talks have hit impasse, EU must produce alternative plans  
Corbyn’s a liar, he would be facing similar obstacles in his party. A large chunk of his MPs are openly defying the leadership’s line by calling for another referendum. He also wanted to trigger Article 50 the following day after the vote.  
No-deal Brexit is a bad deal for science.Statement from @royalsociety 
2/ the only remotely workable way to do Brexit is to stay in the single market and customs union. If PM not prepared to do that, Brexit shouldn’t happen. ‘No deal’ or ‘no detail‘ Brexit simply not acceptable - especially for Scotland, where we did not vote for this. 
.@Nigel_Farage on Theresa May’s Brexit statement: “It’s the first time she has said ‘no deal is better than a bad deal’ and actually believed it”   
IF I SHOUT SOMETHING LOUD ENOUGH, AND IN ENGLISH, THOSE BLOODY FOREIGNERS WILL CAVE.#Brexit 
Brexit deal has passed away. RIP u will live on forever. Cant believe it. I wanna run to you. Really cant believe this. @ 
You know what would make the economy soar?Rejecting Brexit.  
Brexit negotiations confidence set to max  
Just for anyone outside the UK, the panic in British social media over Brexit in no way reflects everyday experience for the great majority of UK citizens. Life is ticking along for most people as if nothing will change after March 2019. No sense of crisis among most voters 
Theresa May says she has been respectful throughout Brexit negotiations, but she appointed Boris Johnson and David Davis who were constantly rude and contemptuous. Her judgement has been completely out of touch with reality from the start. She's wasted two vital years!

PM May's statement on Brexit talks after EU rejects her proposals  
NEW: British Prime Minister Theresa May says Brexit negotiations are "at an impasse" after the European Union rejected her proposals for leaving the bloc.  
Theresa May’s punchline for her #Brexit nonsense speech was pretty much ‘respect my authority’.She basically did a Cartman impression.This loser needs to go, we need a #GENow 
Yes, losing our jobs, earning potential, rights, freedom of movement and life chances is indeed very bad. If Brexit happens, we’ll all be bad losers. That’s why we’re not going to let it happen. 
Lib Dems call for the recall of Parliament to debate Brexit. Are they absolutely sure that Vince Cable and Tim Farron can make it? 
"I have treated the EU with nothing but respect, the UK expects the same." Prime Minister Theresa May speaks following a summit in Salzburg, Austria, where her plan for Brexit was largely rejected:  
If you're still playing catch up. Here's why the referendum being illegitimate is a fact: . 
Theresa May's speech from Downing Street shows that a mess we are in. Brexit is simply too important to leave to the PM and her chaotic cabinet. Demand that the people have the final say on the deal, with the option to remain >  
The media horse-race coverage will largely ignore this point but worth making it anyway:UK is only at "an impasse" over Brexit because the PM's plan was / is created to please the Tory right. Cameron couldn't appease them, and neither can May. This was never going to work. 
May: “We now need to hear from the EU what the real alternative is and we can discuss them.”Sorry Theresa, but the EU have offered you 6 solutions to Brexit. But you have rejected all of them. It's YOU who's caused this, and it's YOU who's driving us headlong into #NoDealBrexit 
There is no doubt a no-deal Brexit would be catastrophic for Britain – Theresa May’s increased threat today is extremely reckless. It's now more important than ever to have a  #PeoplesVote. 
BROADCASTERS: stop using biased phrases like "will of the people". This has no real meaning and is nothing but Gammony Brexit propaganda. Your harebrained DJs are supposed to be impartial so say “Vote Leave sold a lie and no one wants Brexit anymore”, which is what it actually is 
The People's Vote campaign is simply trying to reverse the referendum result. It is 'bad loser' status.  
.@timothy_stanley: The problem isn't the EU or Brexit. The problem is Theresa May's terrible leadership   
Thanks Theresa May for making it clear that we have two choices:Break Brexit or Break apart the country.#DowningStreetSpeech 
If Theresa May has only just realised that Northern Ireland border & her failure to put forward workable economic proposals are the main issues  it really says something about how blind the Tories have chosen to be to the obvious truths evident since the referendum #brexit 
Everything Theresa May has claimed about the negotiations so far, what the UK should expect as things progress, how Chequers is the only viable solution... has proved wrong.TM does not know what she’s doing.She needs to go, & we need an avenue to avoid Brexit.#PeoplesVote 
This Tory Government has had 27 months since the Referendum to prepare for the UK's exit from the EU and the best that PM May can come up with is that the ball is in the EU's court. Where is the workable plan to take Britain forward successfully after we leave? #Brexit  
That bit at the end of the PM's speech where she went "WE STAND READY" and then paused slightly before shuffling off is pure Brexit vibes: farcical pretense at some kind of control, mired in cliché and bellicose catchphrase. Stop acting like it's the bloody Blitz. 
“No Brexit” is better than both of those #justsayin 
It's hard, it's a mess, it's a nervous future:  but OMG I have more respect for the  woman pitchforked into handling Brexit than I do for the (mainly male) hacks, sniggerers and wannabe-comics taking the piss . 
So the main thrust of Brexit is: we’re leaving the club and we want you, the remaining members, to come up with a plan to make it as comfortable and profitable as possible for us whilst allowing us to maintain the benefits of membership. And by the way we never liked you anyway. 
Never forget- A No Deal Brexit is A No Plan Brexit which is national suicide. #TheresaMay 
Theresa May is being driven to desperation, forced to give this speech as her chaotic Brexit plans unravel. The country deserves better than this mess. Join our campaign NOW to give the people the final say on Brexit, with the option to stay in the EU:  
.@theresa_may "I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country" 
Has Theresa May finally found her backbone? The EU are not our friends. They have belittled the Brexit vote and ridiculed the people who voted for independence. It's about time she called EU leaders out for what they are - bullies!Support us at  
Wanting to leave the EU and then asking them how to do it does really reveal the poverty of Brexit thinking. 
Every time the Prime Minister opens her mouth we all* get poorer. *Except for the disaster capitalists who funded Brexit and are making out like bandits.  
This dangerous person is going to drag the UK down to the depths with her. #PeoplesVote is ESSENTIAL. “May: EU must respect UK in Brexit talks” - BBC News  
Your own Brexit minister threatens to withhold the agreed financial settlement almost fortnightly. You just said you “would never accept” the thing you agreed to in writing in December. 
Seems PM Theresa May is doubling down on UK-loopy ... Enough for Scotland now #indyref2 planning has to get serious in Scot Gov pronto and strong signals given to the people for hope in this Brexit madness!! 
Not sure that any Leave or Remain supporter voted for this damaging Brexit mess. After failed Chequers plan and humiliation in Salzburg the UK public deserves better from the UK Government. #Brexit  
#TheresaMay supporting a no deal Brexit is like supporting a no plan D-Day and hoping for the best. 
The @donaldtusk cake photo jibe was silly and disrespectful but the respect point is the least substantive element of what has happened. Yesterday the Brexit fantasies crashed into reality. It was always going to happen. 
 DUP *won't accept* a border in the Irish sea and *can* bring down the UK Government at *any time*. Tories will do *whatever* it takes to stay in Government. Brexit deal *requires* a solution to the NI/Irish border. 
Scottish judges have asked the European Union’s highest court to urgently consider whether the U.K. government’s Brexit process can be reversed  
Solving big problems with little words:1) #Kavanaugh - VOTE NOW2) #Brexit - NO DEAL. 3) #Critics - DO ONE. #FridayMotivation 
EU has always said 'not our job to come up with the British Brexit plan'. The EU will not change its basic rules for a country that is leaving.Brexit 101 since 24 June 2016. 
And while I’m at it, can broadcaster please stop calling the campaign to stop Brexit the “People’s Vote”. It’s a “2nd referendum” or, more accurately, the “Losers’ Vote”.  
BREAKING: British Prime Minister Theresa May says Brexit negotiations are 'at an impasse' after EU rejects her proposals for leaving the bloc. ' 
Theresa May basically just said that more then 2 years after the Brexit referendum & despite Liam Fox, secretary of state  for international trade saying an EU trade deal would be “one of the easiest in human history” she and her Government have proved incapable of agreeing one 
The Brexit dividend in one graph.  
Theresa May on #BrexitIt's not my fault - it's them... Me trying not to laugh at her serious face ending.. How long had she practised it?  
Prime Minister @theresa_may gave a statement at Downing Street, saying that Brexit negotiations with the EU had reached an impasse. 
No, Theresa May. Denying the legitimacy of the referendum does not 'threaten public trust in democracy'. Breaking the law to win it does. Any election, campaign or referendum won by cheating threatens the pillars of democratic systems. Embarrassing that this is our leader. 
People who think Chequers plan won’t work:- the EU-27- Michel Barnier- anyone who’s done any thinking about Brexit- hardcore Brexiters in ERG- Labour, Lib Dems, SNPPeople who think it will:- Theresa May- Chris Grayling- Dominic Raab (because he has to) 
So it’s off the #Brexit cliff edge we go.  #MayStatement #BrexitChaos 
This is mad. It’s a total failure to recognise the reality of our position.The government has been talking to itself for two years, ignoring the inherent contradictions of Brexit. Now - when confronted with reality - the PM is asking the EU to sort the mess for us. 
even with the bar set unfathomably low, as May's is, to argue her non-announcement admitting she hasn't got a fucking clue what to do about Brexit is her finest moment as PM is laughable. or, it would be, if we weren't marching towards total disaster.    
Mrs May: The EU should be clear: I will not break up my country or disrespect the referendum result.Sorry @theresa_may but its not your country. Its a union of two countries, a principality and an annexed region of Ireland 
Theresa May's statement moves Scotland closer to a damaging #NoDeal #Brexit that would cost 80,000 jobs and shrink our economy by £12.7 billion. Here's just some of the other ways a no deal Brexit will affect our daily lives.  
Frustrating that the very people responsible for #Brexit keep looking to others to design it  
And @theresa_may you have not worked “to bring people with” you. You called us citizens of nowhere. You pandered to the worst fringes. And now you claim a manipulated referendum is the biggest democratic exercise. You’re a disgrace. 
The PM is spot on. The EU27 can’t just say “don’t like it” but then not put forward any sensible counter proposal. We won’t break up the UK and we won’t ignore the referendum result. The ball is now in their court.  
BREXIT STATUS: Pretty sure I can hear the EU laughing from here...  
Once again, Theresa May comes out fighting, talking tough and steely eyed. But at some point we need to see strong actions that back up those strong words. Time to walk away & prepare for a No Deal Brexit. 
The Downing Street statement, this late in the process, shows what a ridiculous mess the Tories are in. We cannot go through Brexit blindfolded to the implications. The people must have the final say on the deal, and option to remain. Join our campaign:  
"I will not overturn the result of a referendum, nor will I break up my country" - @theresa_may tells the EU "we stand ready".Follow the events live here:  
"No-one wants a good deal more than me, but the EU should be clear I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country" - UK PM Theresa May gives Downing Street statement on #Brexit talks  
May’s statement: intransigent and typically, stupidly & stupifyingly obstinate -and contradictory: “Anything which doesn’t respect the referendum or divides our country is out” - “respecting” the crime & lies referendum will end the unity of the UK. 
It looks like I'm going to have to get this one out again. #Brexit  
If we don’t press for an independence referendum now we are giving up the opportunity. #ScotlandCan #Brexit 
To sum up the PM’s statement this afternoon:1) Those foreigners are rotters for not changing their minds.2) I’m not changing my mind, but I’m not a rotter.3) They’d better change their minds, or else.4) I’m now going to stick my fingers in my ears.#Brexit #SalzburgSummit 
May standing on the edge of a Brexit cliff and threatening to jump off is a curious negotiating strategy when she knows it would hurt Britain most 
Pound down nearly two cents against the dollar after that Theresa May speech. Markets suddenly v nervous about a hard Brexit  
From @theresa_may's speech it's clear that Brexit lies promised in 2016 cannot be delivered. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote#OFOC 
The EU's reaction after Theresa May's Downing Street Speech.#Brexit #TheresaMay #DowningStreet 
Theresa May says it's unacceptable for the "EU to divide the UK in two". The EU aren't doing that Theresa, you are. Northern Ireland will NOT be dragged out of the EU against our will #Brexit 
BREAKING: British PM says she will not overturn referendum results or break up her country 
I'd surmise the PM's statement in these terms, Fuck you EU don't try and treat us like shit and mug us off, we're not having any more of your bollox, sort it out or we're off without a deal, and you Peoples  Vote tossers can do one as well. #DowningStreet #Brexit 
Theresa May is absolutely nailing Brexit. Nailing it to an oil tanker, setting fire to the attached alcohol-soaked rag, and driving said tanker into a firework factory. 
UK PM Theresa May demands new proposals from EU to break Brexit "impasse" after Chequers plan rejected by EU leaders

What an utter travesty of the truth...She has never attempted to take the 48% with her or Scotland.More hollow words and outright lies.#Brexit #DowningStreet .@SkyNews .@BBCNews .@itvnews 
.@theresa_may it's clear that there is no good #Brexit deal on offer - only workable plan is a #PeoplesVote to give the public control on the final deal 
An attempt at some hardline bluster from a Prime Minister who knows she’ll probably be out of a job in a few months time. I think it might just be dawning on the government that Brexit has been rumbled. 
I’m raging. May is throwing our country’s future away because she lacks the strength to stand up to the Brexit maniacs in her own party. #maystatement 
What threatens trust in democracy *is* the 2016 referendum and the shonky way it was handled you unmentionable 
Brexit was the largest ever democratic exercise in this country ... err. What about Love Island? 
Theresa May repeats the hard eurosceptic spin that the referendum was a vote to leave the customs union. Nonsense. No specific form of Brexit was on the ballot paper and no-one voted for the no deal we're on track for. This is precisely why we need a #PeoplesVote. 
Theresa May talks very tough and doubles down on the Northern Ireland border issue. "Throughout this process I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same."Take that @donaldtusk."I will not overturn the referendum. Nor will I break up my country."  
.@theresa_may is delivering a #Brexit statement in Downing Street.The Prime Minister says both sides want a deal but there are "two big issues where we remain apart". Follow the latest here:  
Theresa May just now:"Anything that effectively divides our country in two is a bad deal"The whole of Ireland just started laughing. The brits sure have some brass necks.  #Brexit 
Theresa May still misses the point completely. You can't leave but remain, you can't have the benefits but not contribute & you can't leave but have no hard borders. She's asking for everything but conceding nothing. JUST. HAVE. A. SECOND. REFERENDUM. FFS. 
To Theresa May, on her speech standing in front of two Union Jacks:It is a lie that EU immigration is uncontrolledThe referendum is a mockeryYou do not respect the referendumYou have made the 48% - now the majority- invisible.This is the speech of a fascist: blame the enemy 
Theresa May channelling her inner Maggie: "I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same." #Brexit

'Anything that divides our country in two would be a bad idea...'Like the referendum?

Theresa May outlining the EU27 position on Ireland and free trade - positions which have been blindingly obvious for two years. #Brexit 
Theresa May describes NI remaining in Single Market and Customs Union as "terrible" That's a huge mistake. DUP clearly fuelling this statement and were in No 10 this morning apparently. #Brexit 
Theresa May says the first EU option of keeping the UK in the Single Market and Customs Union would "make a mockery" of the referendum. 
The power hasn’t been working properly in Number 10 since David Cameron decided it’s ok to hold a referendum on the UK’s EU membership to solve @Conservatives infighting. 
EU diplomats says surprised at PM’s ‘upset and emotional’ press conference post Salzburg summit. They ask why she was so surprised that EU rejected her #Brexit stance on Irish border and on single market. They say that rejection was well-known before the summit 
May's statement on Brexit scheduled 1345 has been delayed by a lack of power in No.10. The irony! 
This speech is just like Brexit: not happening on time, not what was promised, and a waste of everybody's time.A #PeoplesVote, on the other hand...  #FFS 
Theresa May's statement has been delayed because of a power failure in 10 Downing Street. I mean power of the electrical type. You couldn't make it up! #Brexit 
Other countries are in American news too. Did you hear of Brexit? Everyone and everything can have a butterfly effect. Please break out of your glass bubble.

Just caught up with #PoliticsLive.The UK is standing on the edge of an abyss  !The chortling, chuckling, merriment & cracking of jokes - entirely inappropriate given the serious position re #BrexitIn my VERY humble opinion ! 
Dominic Raab, Brexit minister on #SalzburgSummit18:  "We have been rebuffed on our plans without any coherent explanation as to why."For real?Let's start with the EU is the EU.#WeareEurope #IamEuropean #StopBrexit 
UK’s Brexit negotiating approach if it was in a BMW dealership: - “I want a BMW”- “Great, how much have you to spend?”- “500 quid”- “Our cheapest car is 40k”- “Come on, work with me here”- “?”- “God, you people are just not willing to negotiate - the deals off!” 
You're influenced by Brexit Fan Boy @PiersMorgan too much! He spouts this shit every morning on @GMB... Brexit is national catastrophe. You can afford to ride it out. Why don't you consider the nearly 50m others being dragged out of the EU off the back of criminal cheating.  
Hold on tight for a statement from Theresa May on Brexit. General wisdom is that she'll be saying we won't back down...  
The last 24 hours clearly shows the reasons why we are right to leave the EU. I hope in this statement the PM will back Britain, take a stand and put forward a free trade agreement as equal partners, making it clear that otherwise we will walk away! #Brexit 
Complaining the EU 'did not reciprocate' Britain's efforts in negotiating Brexit is like being annoyed your girlrfiend refuses to sleep with you occasionally after you dumped her.

I would say we have been having a constitutional crisis since the referendum, and that is how this era will be described by the Chinese scholars who will write the history of it.  
"I am calling an election AND a referendum but get this: you each get to vote in one or the other BUT NOT BOTH. Up to you." 
Theresa May to deliver Brexit statement following EU criticism  
The British Ministry of Foreign Affairs thought that Donald Trump’s support for Brexit represented a “threat,” according to former Trump advisor George Papadopoulos.  
Would have been mad for Labour to say: "We will ignore the Referendum and vote against whatever deal the govt strikes with the EU."It would have unified Tories and allowed media to say they wrecked any deal before it was struck. 
Irrespective of what Theresa May says, this could be the development today that has most lasting impact on the Brexit process. 
The inability of any prominent Brexit advocate to say anything realistic about what we should do is really astonishing. 
Of course she isn't calling an election. What good is an election? Britain has two main parties which both support a Brexit that the rest of the EU won't agree to anyway. 
MY FEED: brexit is gonna be a disaster! it'll let right wing tories wreek havoc on the economy. it must be stopped!ME: yeah, probablyMY FEED: it'll lead to the break up of the uk too!ME:  
Can Article 50 be revoked if MPs vote for it? A previous court rejected the bid to have this referred to Europe's highest court. The judgment has been overruled. Even the judiciary can change its mind. So can we on Brexit. MPs: For UK's sake revoke A50  
Great to hear @Keir_Starmer on WATO set out Labour’s Brexit position so clearly: PM plan judged on what she promised, Peoples Vote on the table as an option if Parliament votes it down. Labour wants a Customs Union and Single Market package. Good! 
“More a problem for them than us …” apropos of @JeremyCliffe on Piers Morgan: impact of a “hard Brexit” on the UK is approximately ten times worse than on Germany, France and Italy. @OxfordEconomics 
In so far as Barnier, Juncker and the Mogg have said they want a comprehensive free trade deal as basis of post-Brexit relations, then yes.  
Brexiteer delusion -willful refusal to own up to the consequences of their own choices - is the story of Brexit. Excellent summary here.

Theresa May is to issue an update on the Brexit negotiations within the hour.  
Perhaps Theresa May might reveal what Brexit means? 
"All the details (on the big questions on Brexit) will be set out when they are set out" - Dominic Raab tells BBC #wato.18 months after the triggered Brexit this govt still doesn't have a plan or a queue. Astonishing 
I'd actually really love it if May just opened the door to Number 10 and shouted out "I've Cancelled Brexit" and then slammed it shut and refused to come out again until everyone else went away.

Friends, humans and country people, there is no Brexit. Scotland, Wales and Ireland are free. Europe is our friend. Trump is dead. The Conservative party is closed until further notice. I resign. Have a nice day. 
Today we handed the EU a note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 that they were prepared to accept Chequers, a state of war would exist between us. No such undertaking has been received and now this country is at war with the EU.#Brexit #NoDealBrexit 
LIVE: Theresa May to make mystery Brexit statement from Downing Street  
So we’ve around 30 minutes to play “Fantasy Theresa May Announcement”. I’ll go first “I’ve decided this is been a terrible mistake. Brexit will destroy the UK and have a negative impact on most people’s lives. People voted for it because people in my party lied to them. It’s off” 
Delighted Scotland’s Supreme Court has unanimously agreed with me & my fellow petitioners that it’s vital for MPs to know from #CJEU in Luxembourg whether #Article50 is unilaterally revocable before we’re asked to ratify any withdrawal agreement #Brexit  
Surely Theresa May can’t double down on Chequers now? It’s clearly unworkable.Only three realistic options:A) General electionB) 2nd referendum (options on the ballot being the government’s deal or a no deal Brexit)C) No dealLet’s wait for the statement at 1.45pm.. 
That Brexit isn’t happening, we’re actually joining Schengen & that there will be compulsory foreign language lessons from Primary School to Degree level. She can resign, as well, if she wants  Too much to ask?! 
As Emmanuel Macron calls Brexit leaders ‘liars’, some suggest that if he only crossed the street he might find someone who cares about his opinion. 
I have a horrible suspicion that she is going to call an Election so the Tories can pass this festering bag of shit with #brexit on it over to Labour.... then it can be all Labours fault for the next 200 years 
"Brexit was a terrible idea all along, and all David Cameron's fault. That's it. We're moving to revoke Article 50."

You are the one calling voters stupid, not me. UK Voters were, however, misled. More important, Brexit was put to a vote before it could be known what it would entail. When details are known, citizens should have a chance to accept or reject it given how consequential it is.

Enough is enough. Time for you blowhards who said this would be easy and costfree to admit you lied to win and haven’t got a clue how to deliver Brexit without damaging the UK. No country should be treated like this by the Brexit elite  
Headline: "Theresa May loyalists insist her Brexit plan still workable despite EU rejection"Dead whale on beach. Dynamited. "It can still swim" claim Brokenshire and Crabb, covered in bits of burnt blubber. Sgt. MacKenzie sounds in background. Fade to grey.

Been offline for a while. How’s Brexit going? 
Half the country liked Brexit in principle. Half didn't. A far larger majority don't like what Brexit has become in practice. That's why a #PeoplesVote on the Brexit deal is the only way to bring the country together. Otherwise...  
EU leaders are united on Brexit but divided on migration  
Walk away. They want to make us beg. They want to split the UK as punishment for dare voting to  leave in a democratic vote. Take our £40bn and use it to mitigate any short term negatives from leaving. If they wanted a deal they wouldn't be 'cherry joking' about May. #Brexit 
For months @BBCNews spread vile smears about the Leader of the Opposition, none of which was supported by actual evidence Meanwhile BBC news totally failed to ask the obvious hard questions of the prime minister over BrexitBBC news is falling the UK and undermining democracy 
One thing that makes me think a 2nd Referendum would return a 2nd "Leave Vote" is that many of the tactical geniuses behind it were also behind the 2nd Labour Leadership Election that led to a 2nd Corbyn win. It's the "do your exam again until you get it right" tone. 
Back in July a No.10 official told me "Until now, we don’t think there has been a parliamentary majority for a no-deal Brexit. But if the EU rejects this offer, and shows it is not prepared to respond positively, then we think that position could change". They could be right.

Theresa May ‘Humiliated’ at EU Summit, Likelihood of No-Deal Brexit Grows  
Right now it's absolutely essential that Labour *don't* back a 2nd referendum.Tories are desperately trying to find anything to pin the blame on when they can't get a deal. Labour backing a 2nd ref would be a dream for them.After they've collapsed, then yes, one is needed. 
Yes, UK press has led its readers to 'unmitigated disaster'. (What's new? They also led us to Thatcherism, Iraq war, austerity...)But don't think for a moment Macron's lecture cuts any ice in #Brexit-voting areas.#ChequersGoesPop is a gift to No Dealers. 
Brexit is shaping up to be a national disaster J’accuse1. The Tory Party2. The mainstream mediaThey have been weak, short-termist, arrogant, lacking in rigour, tunnel-visioned, dreamy and complacent 
Since the Government doesn’t have a coherent or workable plan for Brexit - can Brexit be stopped? How? | Gavin Esler In Conversation with Lord A...  via @YouTube 
What explains the main differences in strategies & outcomes of the EU’s & UK’s approache to #brexit? The EU views brexit as a problem to mitigate so as little damage as possible accrues to the EU.Brexit for the UK has been mainly about who gets to become Prime Minister. 
1/ When Theresa May said there is no such thing as a citizen of the world she wasn't saying that there is no world state, she was attacking the concept of universal human rights, in favour of a dogmatic nationalist conception of values and rights.#Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE

I've said it before, but I am convinced that the WM government want a No-Deal #Brexit The UK economy will crash and a few people will get incredibly wealthy off of the whole scenario. (including many in the government). 
"The Chequers Plan is dead" says Prof @JonTonge "It was always a plan based more upon optimistic leaps of faith than expectation of implementation. Not a single EU state wants it." #Brexit #SalzburgSummit18 
We are a small island off the coast of mainland Europe. We were known as the "Sick Man of Europe" until we joined the Common Market and rescued our economy in 1973. Before the last Referendum we were top of the EU growth league. Now we are bottom. Fact, Darren Facts. 
Are people starting to see that @UKLabour policy on Brexit was based on the correct prediction that the @Conservatives would self-destruct?Not just because the tory party is filled with incompetent, self-interested politicians, because a positive Brexit deal is not possible. 
Brexit has been going on too long. The EU needs a short sharp shock! Scallop wars turn to CRABS as French fishermen come to English waters to SABOTAGE Britons  
The ERG couldn’t come up with a plan in 2 years, they allegedly got to 140pages then shelved it because they couldn’t agree on it  I doubt if another 30 days will help. Brexit is, or should be dead when it’s prime proponents can’t deliver a plan. 
Brexit is 189 days away. #brexit 
Here is the thingBrexit matters hugely for the UKIt was *entirely predictable* that May’s plan would be rejectedWHAT have MSM, BBC and the rest been DOING for months?Instead of tamely going along with May’s narrative, they should have been asking the (obvious) hard questions 
The UK pound fell after EU negotiators told Prime Minister Theresa May her Chequers Brexit plan 'would not work'  
Interesting chat with Ukip's Lord Dartmouth at #Cornwall business #Brexit conference. He had claimed Australian wine is cheap in the UK thanks to WTO rules. We pointed out this is not the case - the EU has had a bilateral deal with Oz on wine since 2010, with very low tariffs...

We need to suspend A50. We need to confirm this brexit was lawfully instigated at all. We need to take a moment to think. This whole mess is down to rushing about because of hysteriaWe have a constitution. We should follow itHad we already, we wouldn’t be in this mess  
I do not understand why a 2nd Brexit referendum would be non-democratic when the first vote was taken amidst incomplete and often erroneous information. I also do not understand the lack of confidence by Brexit advocates: if it is such a good idea, it would surely win again 
Following rejection of Chequers plan, Brexiteers say they're shocked and angry at EU leaders continuing to say precisely the same things they've been saying about Brexit for the last two years. 
I now have a very limp and flaccid Brexit.

Brexit: How the different regions in the UK voted: For AgainstVia @elOrdenMundial 
I honestly don’t believe @Theresa_May would go through with a ‘No Deal’ because she knows @CONservatives would be done for. For years. They would never be forgiven. It’s why I think she has two options: - Resign- General Election Brexit has ruined the Tories good & proper! 
what the EU achieved yesterday was to show the UK how contemptuous the EU are and how they are punishing the UK for exercising it's democratic rights under international law, the mockery of the pm was unacceptable, however this has just cemented the reasons for Brexit ... 
Fantastic session with @LaRetraiteSW12 politics and history sixth formers in Lambeth. Really bright aspirational mainly working class students. Informed questions. Not much love for Trump, Brexit, May or Corbyn. Next to none indeed. Yet so much passion. Politics is failing them

*Of course* it matters that Labour says something about Brexit and Salzburg. It’s not like it just happened this morning, and yes it is their job too - they are the opposition and one of the few entities that can stop Brexit from being an utter mess. 
Tony Blair's former spin doctor Alastair Campbell claims there is a "big shift" in support towards a second referendum. Wrong then, wrong now!  
Yes there is. People’s vote to stop Brexit  
No British PM should make such a fool out of herself.The EU is not the problem.#Brexit is a crime. You're in it and we'll fight you. We will #StopBrexit, so better get used to that.

Hate to bang on about the halfwit @donaldtusk but if a British politician spent hours dreaming up Instagram stunts to humiliate visiting prime ministers debating crucial issues, he’d have to resign the next day. But Eurocrats don’t resign, nor can we vote them out. Thus, Brexit.  
Jeremy Corbyn says he 'wouldn't rule out consent' for a second independence referendum.A wee reminder that back in 2015, he thought @theSNP were privatising Calmac & Scotrail... 
Highlevel EU sources say PM’s blunt rejection of Barnier’s ‘de-dramatising’ Irish backstop, her uncompromising Die Welt op-ed pre-summit + #Brexit address to EU leaders Weds night meant they had to be unambiguous in their response or would appear EU about to bend its principles 
Brexit is in crisis. The government is crisis. There is nothing on the twitter feeds of @UKLabour, @jeremycorbyn, @Keir_Starmer, @EmilyThornberry, or @BarryGardiner in response. My once great party. 
Yesterday the leaders of the undemocratic EU showed their true colours. This isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket.  #Brexit 
The Brexit referendum was called to end division over EU. The majority of those who voted, voted to Leave. If a Leaver isn’t negotiating exit, Leavers will forever feel that Brexit wasn’t delivered & divide continues. Put Leave in charge & hold accountable for success/failure. 
Jacob Robs-Mugs is having another bad day. No strategy. No plan. Leave have nothing to offer UK but an apology and resignations.Time to face facts and cut UK free from the dead weight of Brexit.#PeoplesVote 
Be in no doubt, Lab moderates will try to use Brexit to undermine Lab leadership/members at #Lab18 If you've trusted Corbyn's judgment so far (let's face it Lab was all at sea before his ldrship) keep the faith, keep attacking the Tories & see what deal the Tories come back with

Utterly astounding that @UKLabour was unable/unwilling to field a spokesperson for @BBCr4today on May's #Salzburg disaster.Our opposition is complicit in this #Brexit catastrophe. And the fault lies with #Corbyn. #SalzburgSummit18 #r4today #PeoplesVote 
"The only practical option to get out of the mess we are in is to refer this back to you, the public." @vincecableDo you want the chance to exit from Brexit and get out of this mess? Join our campaign >  
Real question now is can we honestly justify handing over an extra £39 billion of taxpayers money to EU on top of the £589 billion given since we joined, when they treat us in such an inconsiderate and obstinate way. #Brexit 
One of the many great reasons  I voted to Leave was to escape the inflexible grip of  the antidemocratic unelected Brussels Bastards like Tusk, Barnier, Juncker and their Federalist Cabal.Yesterday's events in Salzburg reinforced that I was 100% rightAm I alone?Viva Brexit! pic.twitter.com/SdlOTwgznc 
Just for a laugh, @jeremycorbyn, would you be so kind as to publish your detailed ‘jobs-first Brexit’ plan so we can compare it with May’s? 
Slouching towards #hard #brexit: a pessimistic thread on why the #NoDealBrexit deal catastrophe is now the most likely outcome 
For the first time, I took a group of representatives from Pimlico Plumbers down to Brighton to attend the Lib Dem Party Conference. The conversations we’ve had, the people we’ve met and the fringe event’s we’ve attended have all further energised my battle, to stop #Brexit.  
What the bloody hell is the point of another General Election to resolve the Brexit issue if both main parties support Brexit? Jeez this is exasperating! Brexit needs to be stopped so we can get on with fixing the problems that blight the UK. 
been saying this time and again. The minute Corbyn utters a word about scrapping brexit is the minute labour buries themselves, the far right galvanizes, floods into cons and it's game over. People don't understand the game, they just see linear predictable tactics. 
The Chequers deal does not work. It does not deliver Brexit. #ChuckChequers 
Brexit is unique: [...] Migration is usually about people moving to a foreign land. This time, it will be about a land where people already live (and, in some cases, have for decades) turning foreign under their feet.  
I don’t understand why Corbyn says the referendum result from 2016 must be respected as the will of the people, but he also wants a general election to let the people decide their government. Er, we had that last year, and you lost. That WAS the will of the people! 
French President Emmanuel Macron says Brexit was sold to the British people by "liars" who immediately fled the stage, unwilling to see their project through  
This is the poll of polls tracker. Remain is on 42%, Leave is on 35% with a massive 22% of Don't Knows. It would be madness to have a second referendum now. I've no idea why you think Tories would allow one anyway.  
Who says us Brits can't negotiate a deal, hey? #DriveSmug #Brexit #WeMakeDeals 
During referendum campaigns or when there is an eruption of anger about the abuse scandals, high profile Catholics are subjected to particularly vicious attacks. #TodaySor 
The EU will not support a soft, cherry picked, “have your cake and eat it” Brexit lest others be tempted to follow suit. This argues for a 2nd UK vote on Brexit in practice rather than Brexit in principle. This would be the more honest, democratic response  
In #Salzburg EU leaders were shocked not only by May’s intransigence on #Brexit but also by the strident lecture she gave them about why the EU should sacrifice its basic principles so that the UK can cherry pick the single market. Warning: no deal ahead #PeoplesVote 
Someone on radio saying that "at least Brexit shows that people still care about politics". Like saying: at least a bout of dysentery made you appreciate your bowels. 
The entire Tory strategy was based on Corbyn adopting a remoaner position these last two years. If he had they would have won a majority last year. That he didn’t means Brexit is up in the air.Some humility from detractors would be welcome.  
Very good from @mk1969 with a couple of #RemainerNow points"The whole bloody premise of Brexit is a lie. People are waking up to that." &"If they have changed their minds based on what they have seen, then they should have the opportunity to say" 
Free movement of EEA nationals must continue after Brexit – a fair policy will benefit us all, says @GreenJeanMEP  
May wants to avoid a general election, but given her deal - if they get one - won't get through Parliament, a second referendum is a mechanism they can use to remain in power, while trying to pin the need for one on Labour for "sabotage". So Corbyn's right to not campaign for it 
Lesson from Salzburg: EU leaders have concluded May isn't worth saving. They could have helped her get through her party conference with a few subtle hints of progress being made but they decided not to bother. #Brexit 
Everything that was promised by leave can not be delivered. Everything dismissed as 'project fear' is now happening. Leave broke election law. Even Emmanuel Macron has said that Brexit was sold with lies! We need to change direction, it's suicidal to continue down this road. 
"If Labour comes out in support of a 2nd referendum, they’ll do so at a  time that suits them and the country - not their political opponents." Exactly.  
So the @ScotTories were urging @theSNP to back Chequers, if they didnt they'd be to blame for the Brexit disaster.Now that the EU has rejected it (again), will the @BBCScotlandNews team report that the Tories were wrong, and SNP right? 
May is struggling not because she’s useless but because Brexit can’t be delivered without hitting economy, threatening the union, jeopardising N. Ireland peace, and splitting the Conservative party. So what matters- delivering 2016 ref or avoiding the consequences of delivery? 
#ChequersPlanStill struggling to make sense of May's #Chequers fixationCan only think of 4 possible reasons1) She always intended a vassalage Brexit (sellout).2) It was her best shot at covertly ensuring No Deal (masterplan).3) She's out of her depth.4) She's lost the plot. 
Brexit's made me review some European history I learnt, and more that I never learnt. When scratch the surface, the extent & bravery of European resistance movements (Dutch, French, Polish, Czech etc) is incredible. All partly run from London. We MUST stop Brexit. We belong in EU 
Macron is right. Message to every Brexit editor: he is talking about YOU. What a total and unmitigated disaster much of the UK press has led its readers to.  
Brexit bounce: There were 11 baby boys named Nigel in the UK last year, according to new ONS baby name data, compared to fewer than three Nigels born in 2016. 
Keep it up Jeremy. Just a few more months of dithering in your allotment and you'll have that brexit you so desperately want. You know, the one that will decimate the NHS and destroy the nation. Nearly there! 
Your grandfather and your father both die freeing your neighbours from tyranny. You then spend 50 years funding their dreams. Then you realise they are taking the piss so decide to distance yourself, and the neighbours spend two years threatening you and bad mouthing you. #brexit

John Redwood's spouting nonsense on the BBC again. "We won't impose any new restrictions on imports after brexit."Yes we will, because otherwise the WTO nations will sue our assess off.

I didn't vote in referendum. Was out of country. If I had, I'd have been a mild brexiteer with EU sympathies. Two years on, I'm a rabid brexiteer thanks to a gov that seems incapable of acting on result & a bullying, arrogant #EU.

I was disappointed with #Labour's policy on #Brexit at first. But now I see the ambiguity has given the Tories just enough rope to hang themselves withLabour's patience has allowed the party to solidify Brexit policy when the time is right, based on what's right for the country 
Tories that want Labour to rule out a 2nd referendum and Centrists that want them to rule it in, are effectively playing the same game.If Labour comes out in support of a 2nd referendum, they’ll do so at a time that suits them and the country - not their political opponents.

Daniel, Andrew is still being paid to1. be factual re the EU ie we’re the ones leaving the club and naturally the EU27 aren’t going sacrifice their principles and interests to give us a deal not so good for them; and 2. hold politicians to account on Brexit. Andrew #DoYourJob 
We *already* voted against Brexit - in typical, predictable fashion, the British Gov are running roughshod over that democratic expression, over the GFA & over the welfare of our people & stability of our institutions. What’s to say another vote would suddenly make them care?  
Then Labour would never say anything on the economy, rail, housing, tax, work, NHS, education, welfare...Funny how it's only Brexit crises like now we hear the sound of silence  
It’s odd that despite being able to negotiate peace in Northetn Ireland and the Middle East Corbyn has nothing to offer on Brexit.  
#Brexit, 'The easiest thing in human history'.More than a year on from this article, the best deal is likely to be no deal because actually, Brexit turns out to be the most difficult thing in human history. Stop the lies, demand a #PeoplesVote

Two things have been clear ever since Cameron called the referendum: 1) the Tories would not have an answer to the Irish border question.2) Brexiters would use this as a chance to force the country into a disaster capitalist trade deal with the USA.That’s still where we are. 
This is one of the most desperate, embarrassing tweets I have ever seen. EVERYBODY knows #Brexit is finished. It would have ruined us. Yet May prattles on, and Corbyn bumbles on behind her. Two of the worst politicians we will ever have. Time to dump them both and raise the bar.

This was predictable. No.10 (Parkinson et al) listen to the wrong people in Bx. Seek support from marginalised countries (H,Pl etc) & out of touch MEPs (ECR,EFD) it's all part of the plan by Brexit bad boy no deal seekers. See them now blame Bx & mobilise against @peoplesvote_uk 
Time running out for Brexit deal  
Labour leadership doesn't know what to say about May's Brexit plan collapsing is why the party put no spokesperson on the media. Deep divisions, confusion in the opposition too

There's been a solution to #Brexit staring May in the eyes ever since the vote. Just emulate Norway. It keeps the #Leavers happy as the UK will have 'left the EU' and keeps #Remainers happy as the benefits are broadly the same as membership.And ignore the ERG protestations. 
3/~ There is no section of British business that actively wants No Deal. Few have interests aligned to a Canada+ deal either. So: for Labour the way is open for a hegemonic offer. Norway+ and a second referendum...

2/~ The medium term effects of a Canada+ FTA will be to tank the economy and industrial investment flight. The UK will then fall apart, as United Ireland referendum and Scottish independence loom...

NEW: EU willing to write into Brexit exit package a temporary customs “bridge”* (in effect, a second transition) delaying Irish backstop coming into force***but only in the political declaration **backstop stays in withdrawal agreement

The pound falls after EU leaders bluntly reject Theresa May’s Brexit blueprint  
May's Brexit plan goes pop after "humiliation" by EU, British media says  
Donald Tusk seemed to delight in trolling Theresa May on Instagram. Meanwhile, two EU leaders came out backing a second referendum and the French President decided to insult the British electorate.The Prime Minister's compromise was thrown in her face:  
Brexit: What's behind Donald Tusk's Instagram diplomacy?  
Remainers and others who are revelling in Mrs May’s dilemma should remember that slavering away in the background is Corbyn and his Marxist Raving Loony Party with no economic credibility, no clear Brexit strategy, and a plenty of thugs to back up their policies. 
The parade of commentators asked for a solution to @theresa_may’s #Brexit  problems are missing the point: there’s no magic bullet. Chequers = unacceptable. Canada+ = threatens Union. WTO = major economic shock.Slowly it must be dawning: seeking a clean Brexit is a fool’s errand. 
The BBC fact-checker who savaged @campbellclaret yesterday on his lies about alleged support for a second referendum was @Joel_Massey. What a breath of fresh air compared to the usual BBC bias! #FollowFriday #FFSupport us at  
If May made a conference speech saying "Brexit is bollocks. I tried, but it's bollocks, and I won't be associated with it, so I'm resigning right now", and immediately walked off into the sunset, she could still just about avoid being remembered as the worst PM in a century. 
The very solipsism and exceptionalism that underpins Brexit is the stumbling block for the negotiations /fin 
One aspect of the British Brexit debate has come into focus for me in the course the last two years: EU citizens are invisible for many Brexiters. Let me explain /1 
May and the Tories handling of #Brexit has been an utter shambles. They’ve made a mess of it from day one. But don’t forget what they’ve also done to the NHS, the police, the rail system, schools, the council cuts, prisons, #Windrushscandal etc. Time for a new election #GENow 
I am writing to the Lord Speaker this morning asking for the House of Lords to be recalled for Monday to debate the Brexit crisis. He has discretion to agree this 
One half of our political class has run trips to Brussels urging EU to offer a terrible deal, the other has negotiated with excruciating naivity, offering up concessions for nothing in return. Now let Brexiteers run Brexit: prepare for WTO and no divorce bill to focus EU minds. 
Everybody owns the result of #Brexit that is not actively either stopping it, supporting a #PeoplesVote or providing a workable plan.That is up to 3 million jobs lost that @UKLabour and the @Conservatives will be blamed for.Labour are the opposition, they own this also. 
If true democratic process was followed the referendum result would have been treated as advisory (as written in law) then disregarded as it became clear that #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw. & Cameron would have been held to account for misleading the public into believing it was binding. 
Remember that Brexit was a vote for a simpler world, which is impossible. That’s why so many Brexiteers can’t engage with detail. They want a word without detail. 
I read Jeremy Corbyn's words on Brexit last night & was too upset to comment. For years I've supported @UKLabour because protecting the most vulnerable is important to me & them, but now I'm the vulnerable one, Labour has abandoned me & 5million others like me. Why? 
Telegraph Letters: For what it’s worth, I voted Remain, but having seen the true colours emerging from EU leaders, I’m convinced that leaving the EU as soon as possible is the best decision.#Brexit #EU 
While out for my walk I composed a series of scorching tweets about Brexit which probably would have brought down the government but thankfully I got it all out of my system so instead I gift you my silence. 
Incredible that on biggest political issue of the decade, with a Tory PM on the rocks and her party at war, the main opposition party refuses to talk about #Brexit & #ChequersPlan on @BBCr4today. How can Corbyn call himself a leader? Pathetic stuff 
#Salzburg further exposes the shambles of #Brexit, the myths that were peddled and the fact there are no easy options. And now those who caused this mess - Johnson, Farage, Grayling and co - try to blame everyone else - but blame lies solely and squarely with them. End of story 
The really really stupid decision was to to have a referendum giving people the chance to vote on a binary question about whether they like or hate an institution the gutter press has spent forty years telling them is to blame for all the UK’s woes. 
Many UK commentators saying that Macron proves we have to leave EU. Which is a bit like getting divorced and when your ex wants her share of house saying ‘this is why we had to divorce’. Having the hardest Brexit possible to ‘show EU’ is like burning house to avoid splitting it  
2. The real prob is the Labour leadership...the Govt will undermine itself with its impossible #Brexit but Corbyn's stubborn refusal to back a #PeoplesVote & a clear #Remain option is not PRINCIPLE it's CYNICAL GAME PLAY.He's wrongAny #BrexitShambles harms us ALL. #StopBrexit 
I hear BBC R4 calling Failing Grayling a “ senior cabinet minister” this morning. They never say “ junior”, do they ? He is 14th in seniority out of 27 (far  too many) listed & should be concentrating on his poor record as transport secretary, not his even worse record on Brexit 
Me too, Jamie - and a note to James, I don't feel insulated from anything when it comes to Brexit. It is not just about money, it's about the tone of our country now, and the growing right wing sentiment. Oh, and btw, I care about the future after I'm gone. 
So in the key Brexit discussions at the European Council yesterday, Viktor Orban was around the table, Theresa May was on the plane homeImagine what Churchill & Thatcher would have said about that 
Salzburg puts us well & truly in brinksmanship phase of Brexit where EU seems willing to play ‘chicken’ with the economic & geo-strategic interests of the continent. European leaders threw the PM's hard-won compromise back in her face. My take  
A cry from the Irish border: Belfast-born actor Stephen Rea's powerful plea to Westminster on the real impact of Brexit.Watch the video here:  
I'd concur that the indivisible 4 freedoms of the SM are immovable, but there's nothing irresistible about Brexit. A #PeoplesVote will stop it in its tracks. 
1. FGS what's wrong with us?I was surprised by Saltzburg, not that it happened but that it happened NOW.I thought they'd let May get away with it as she hoped & kick her invalid harmful #Brexit down the road.Judgement Day sooner.No more Tory CON#PeoplesVote #Remain ASAP 
Off to @rcgp council. The best debating and decision making chamber I have ever been in - coming up to nearly 20yrs on it. Never a dull moment. Today cannabis med, decriminalisation of Abortion, sepsis, Brexit & NHS and more. 
Just so we're clear: I voted Remain, I am not a Tory, I think Brexit is a trainwreck, I strongly support immigration... and I also despise Corbyn, think Labour under this leadership would wreck the economy, and don't want another referendum.Stop putting me in your boxes. 
Do you think Brexit is going well? No.So if you let a botched Brexit make life harder for younger generations, will that heal the divisions in our country? Or will it spark a fierce resentment that will never go away? 
Really, remain to hard Brexit; sorry, don't believe you.  
Has Brexit & the problem of the Northern Irish border made Ireland's reunification inevitable? Possibly a lot sooner than you think. Listen to @ritula with unionists and nationalists  @reg4change @newtonemerson @deirdreheenan and @kevinpmeagher 
Could you get some people from Derry, Newry or Enniskillen on your show to tell your listeners how patently stupid Brexit is to the vast majority of Irish people please? Ask the English folk if their local shops/garage 5 mins up the road has a checkpoint how would they feel. 
James Brokenshire, 'The PM is acting in the national interest' ffs she's acting in the tory party interest, she knows #Brexit will be a disaster, if she was acting in the national interest she'd pause Article 50 and call a #PeoplesVote or a GE, stop lying to us #r4today 
4/ In case anyone missed it the first time round, here's OFOC's plaintive wail when they were let down before, and my thread explaining why the only viable option to stopping Brexit is getting the Tories out, getting Labour in, and putting Art. 50 on ice.  
Never mind a second referendum - I don't understand why the government can't say "People were badly misled and consequently voted for everyone in the country to stab themselves in the face. We can't let that happen. Brexit is off". 
Don’t buy the Brexit hype: it’s a border in the Irish Sea or the customs union | Jonathan Lis  
Here's what EU leaders make of their Brexit talks with Theresa May in Salzburg. (Hint: it isn't great)  
May humiliated at Salzburg as EU rejects Chequers proposal: Brexit News for Friday 21st September  
Letters: EU leaders keen to advise UK to hold another referendum on #BrexitI encourage them to hold a referendum in their own countries first.I'm sure Danes, Dutch, Greeks, Italians, Swedes, Hungarians, Czechs & even Germans, in fact everyone, would welcome the opportunity!#EU 
“We beat Napoleon, we conquered India, we beat Hitler, we can win at Brexit!” No, other people did those things, and they’re dead. You’ve spat in the faces of your closest allies in a vicious spasm of xenophobia, & you expect them to sort out the mess. 
Deliver the “will of the British People” from an advisory referendum that was based on lies and an illegal campaign? No, we cannot accept that one moment should condemn our country to a disastrous future. This is too important.  
So, we have a Brexit plan that the EU, the Leavers, and the Remainers all reject, a hapless, inept & divided government, like never (ever) before in my lifetime, and no functional opposition at all - but apart from that everything in the UK is going great....#FUBAR 
Yet more evidence the Labour leadership cannot ignore. After Salzburg the  goal is open: offer Norway+ and a referendum  
To build a car it’s 60% goods & 40% services, the 2 are indivisible. Don’t buy the Brexit hype: it’s a border in the Irish Sea or the customs union | Jonathan Lis  
We had another people's vote in June 2017, you asked for an overwhelming personal mandate to lead Britain over the Tory 'brexit' cliff, we rejected you and rescinded your party's Parliamentary majority. You ignored us. We were correct, you are a shambles and not fit for Govt. Go. 
TELLING: Loser’s Vote Remoaners promote French President’s attack on Brexit Britain. Says it all!  
Have your revenge Theresa - tell them to go to hell and do a WTO Brexit NOW.THAT will be a kick in their balls! 
James Brokenshire:PM is acting in the Natl Interest.We're in a negotiation & the PM is steely.ME:#Brexit is a total idiocy & proven disastrously vs the Natl Int.It's never been a negotiation but a setting of terms.The PM cocked up but is stubborn.IT ISN'T THE EU's FAULT 
.@JustinOnWeb has just tweeted @UKLabour is fielding nobody for broadcast on the Brexit shambles. This is a disgrace. The single most important issue, govt in crisis and the Opposition not even on the pitch. Mindblowing 
Theresa May is the author of her own Brexit humiliation:-- Triggers Article 50 too early- Calls an unnecessary election which she lost her majority- Bribes DUP with £1billion- Wastes 2 years to produce an unworkable plan- Stubbornly refuses to budge from her Chequers plan 
Might talk about Brexit a bit today. 
The abject lie that Corbyn actively wants Brexit - and that Labour has done nothing to oppose the Tories on Brexit - makes an obsessed, if small, rump of continuity Remain no better than  Trumpkins. It's poor binary thinking, reinforced with bad faith.  
Look at the people who are clamouring for a No Deal Brexit. Given that we know how disastrous this would be for our country & hit the poorest the hardest, what might be their motivation?Join me & @Women_4_Europe Sunday at the #MarchForTheMany in Liverpool at #LabourConference 
James Brokenshire "Mrs May is battling for Britain & putting the country first".Oh no she's not.At least when Blair & Thatcher did terrible things they believed in the bollocks they were spouting.May knows Brexit is a disaster but she's going ahead with it anyway.#r4today 
Privilege is a part of life in Britain distorting the ability to assess risk in action and inaction.As a result, the punditry on Brexit is dire. The reporting on Brexit reality detached.An exercise in wilful blindness which has led everyone up the path to the slaughter shed. 
What the hell is @BBCNews up to? Tabloid WW2 framing of #Brexit will just lead to more suffering for UK citizens. It's not a war. We are not in the Blitz. We screwed up the exit process. Demonising foreigners for that is proto Fascism  
The public did know what they were voting for during the Brexit referendum. Saying they didn't is a silly argument. A binary question has a binary answer. If remain meant fully remain, then leave meant fully leave: out of SM, out of the CU, no ECJ rule, no EU regulation etc. 
All along, problem has been that PM & #Brexiters have negotiated as though choice was between something better than status quo, or status quo - a normal negotiation. Reality is choice is between something slightly worse than status quo, & disastrous no deal Brexit. Clock ticking.  
Come on ⁦@UKLabour⁩   A majority of your supporters want a #PeoplesVote   It would stop Tory #Brexit hitting the poorest hardest And it’s the best chance of being rid of this utterly useless incompetent government. What’s not to like?  
I hope everyone realises that we are witnessing a theatrical performance cooked up between No 10, Brussels and EU national leaders, to lead to an 11th hour Brexit “deal” which is intended to con the British people & undermine democracy.  
They didn’t have to be so brutal. They want to destabilise her. They’re hoping for a general election, a Labour government, and a second referendum where they can bully us into changing our minds. They’ve forgotten who they’re dealing with. 
Macron rightly described Brexit as a “choice of the British people pushed by those who predicted easy solutions . . . Those people are liars.”#bbcr4today wrongly accused Macron of going too far in suggesting that @BorisJohnson & @michaelgove lied. They did.#r4today 
It isn't "May's Brexit" it's the #Brexit of:EU families who face an uncertain futureBusinesses who face bankruptcyWorkers who will lose their jobsPoor people who will be unable to pay higher food/gas pricesOld folks who face no social care help to dress/eat  #finalsay 
I’ve started tweeting today. My article in today’s Irish times about Brexit might be of interest. ⁦@piris_jc⁩ ⁦@FabianZuleeg⁩ ⁦@hayward_katy⁩ ⁦⁦@SimonFraser00⁩ ⁦@tconnellyRTE⁩ ⁦@anandMenon1⁩ ⁦@martinkettle⁩ ⁦  
Brexit is already a “gross betrayal of democracy” - a referendum built on lies, misinformation, cheating, Electoral Law being broken & referrals to Police.If the vote is not annulled, to not allow a #PeoplesVote would make further mockery of democracy. 
Also, this was known BEFORE the referendum. The UK government itself spelled it out in it's leaflet.Leavers voted to obey EU Rules, but have no say in EU Rules. They can't now pretend to be shocked to be leaving the EU on EU terms.  
Seeing as your EU shitehawks have proven themselves to be a loada vindictive, bullying scrotes and rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal.Here's my alternative deal for them. pic.twitter.com/KKRfgqI5Dp 
Corbyn is not the Labour Party. He promised that the Party would set policy. The Party does not want Brexit. The Party wants a #PeoplesVote. Not only does Corbyn share the same pro-Brexit fantasy as Rees-Mogg, he shares the same dictatorial attitudes as May. Labour: get a leader. 
Thanks to @Leannewood for letter of support on #Brexit - and for continuing to be such a strong and principled voice for Wales.  
They just need to wait until the final “deal” is clear, then people will see Brexit for what it is. Any earlier and there is a real risk of leave winning again or labour taking a hit to let the tories win; both in my mind lead to the hardest of Brexits 
Agree: a #PeoplesVote would offer the people a choice on Brexit. A general election would not.  
In case you’d like to know how the Salzburg summit was reported on the continent, in this case in the Netherlands: a large article on the EU border force discussions followed by a small box on the Brexit talks.  
TripAdvisor review for Salzburg:Birthplace of MozartDeathplace of Brexit 
Those calling for a “People’s Vote”, meaning a 2nd Referendum, need to have a serious think. It would mean the nasty, lying, cheating @CONservatives are in power for years.Maybe that’s what they really want?We need a General Election & a @UKLabour Government.#r4today 
Brexit: Brussels just got serious  
UK warns there will be no Brexit deal unless EU softens on Irish border  
The history books will not be kind to T May. Anyone detached from Britain can see that the referendum was highly corrupted by Cambridge Analytica’s targeted racism and a Leave campaign of thinly veiled immigrant lies. You can’t honour corruption so we can’t honour the referendum  
Labour would win if it backed a second Brexit vote - a shock poll reveals  
"Brexit is a bet. The biggest bet any of us are ever going to make. It’s a bet on our future & our children’s future. I don’t believe it’s a bet that most of us are now willing to place. But there’s only 1 way to find out. Ask them."

Gareth Bennett urges UKIP to be radical after Brexit #UKIPConf 
The Tory Party spends 40 years fighting over Europe and blaming ‘Brussels’ for our every ill. Then finds it hasn’t got a clue how European governments are likely to respond to Brexit and so buggers up the negotiations. I am shocked. 
If you think that Sir Winston Churchill would stand for this shit from the EU, you are gravely mistaken.#Brexit pic.twitter.com/WUTpIctZkM 
Because of #Brexit Some people will lose their jobs.Some will lose their homes.For some this will destroy their family.Can you honestly say that this is what you expected when you voted leave?#PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE 
Your party invented BrexitYou gave people a binary choiceYou activated Article 50You have the majority in ParliamentYou have been in charge of negotiationsYou have brought the country to its kneesYou have achieved nothing.Yet all you ever do is blame Labour 
We are heading for a hard #Brexit which my MP, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, confidently predicts will be 'a Brexit for the poor.' I predict the poorest will suffer most from crashing out of the EU. Time, and hopefully the wise constituents of North East Somerset, will tell who is right. 
Backlash as EU chiefs say Britain should have ANOTHER Brexit voteNo Way! This is fault of Remainer’s action! Not Democracy! Leave No Deal!  
It does not matter what your view is on Brexit. If anything gets changed or overturned, it's the end of democracy. It's in remainers interests too to not see this changed. If we allow it, who is naive enough to think this would be the only time they overrule the populace 
After Salzburg the stupidity of "Brexit means Brexit" & "No Deal is better that a bad deal" is clear for all to see. PM May obviously now needs "Any Deal"or it will be "Crash-out March"And Scotland needs now to set course for #indyref2 away from this UK mess. 
Both main parties are rejecting a referendum do-over. But the chances of Tory implosion are very high now.Most likely outcome - GE.If so one of the big two MUST support Remain, or democracy in the UK is a lie. 
#r4today presenter Justin Webb did everything and anything to pin blame on Jeremy Corbyn for Theresa May and the Tories Brexit shambles.Justin seems to have forgotten that who’s in power and negotiating. What a joke. 
Never trust a Tory, these are dangerous times for our children and grandchildren. After May’s humiliation the right wing media will try to whip up a rule Britannia hysteria to hide the failings of this Brexit bullshit. 
The day starts once again with well informed concern about the effects of #Brexit being met with ill informed platitudes from @GovUK .   Medical research concern over Brexit - BBC News  
I feel more than qualified to reject all 7 points. What rubbish. Bring on a WTO Brexit   
Jeremy Corbyn has never ruled out a second referendum. Neither is he calling for one. It's not that complicated. Not sure why hacks struggle with that. 
#GinaMiller just wiped the floor with #r4today presenter. It was embarrassing, like her or loathe her she clearly knows her brief & is logical she is probably the only sane person left in the #brexit debate. 
Webb misrepresenting Labour's position. They have never ruled out another referendum and have sensibly left all options on the table, depending on how things play out in the next few months. #r4today 
#Brexit was never going to work the way the #Leave liars said it would.Why would anyone ever believe the UK could have all the benefits of EU membership for trade, but not have to pay and not have to follow the rules.It was cleary a lie. 
Don't think that Corbyn will save you from a hard Brexit, he's as committed to it as the Tories.The only way out of this disaster that protects Scotland's economy and jobs is to vote for independence. #indyref2 
Sadly Ian many of my colleagues are unquestioning adherents to the EU evil empire dogma &Brexit sunlit uplands creed that it would be too painful to ever admit to anything positive about the EU. The more rational ones find denial sometimes a difficult burden and the defenses slip  
Ukip meeting in a Birmingham conference centre built with £50m European money is a delicious irony as Brexit implodes 
If you are not following @JasonJHunter you should be for fact based EU withdrawal analysis #Brexit  
I predicted this Brexit outcome back in March. It now looks even more likely.  
And here’s another one — Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' by backing Brexit referendum  
Story you won’t hear covered on @BBCNews this morning - Labour could surge towards winning power if they backed new Brexit referendum, polls find  
#Brexit liars hit back at Emmanuel Macron for calling them liarsWell if the British media are unwilling to call them out for what they are, thank goodness for a true statesman saying it as it is.The UK needs a #Macron 
BREXITThe EU isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket for the political establishment. And all they have is the chance to punish us & prove to the rest of the continent that it isn’t worth leaving.  
Tory MEP @CharlesTannock puts his finger on the cognitive dissonance at the heart of much #Brexit thinking. It’s a pity that he has persuaded so few of his colleagues of this truth.  
Where is @UKLabour voice on Brexit shambles this morning? 
Labour could surge towards winning power if they backed new Brexit referendum, polls find #PeoplesVote can not only save the country from #BrexitShambles but also get rid of this useless governmentCome on @UKLabour! Time to support the #PeoplesVote 
Learn another European language – and give two fingers to Brexit Britain | Gaby Hinsliff  
Mr Macron attacked Brexit as a “choice of the Brits,pushed by those who predicted easy solutions . . . Those people are liars.”No Mr Macron the 17.4 million are not liarsWe're just proud Brits who want our country back from arrogant dictators like him. 
Any MP still backing, enabling Brexit in any way is a disgrace to their office. Kick them out, refuse them your vote. We know Brexit is disaster, polls show people don't want it. To continue is nothing short of betrayal of the country. MPs are required to act in UK best interest 
I'm surprised that I can still be surprised at the UK media & politicians' repeated surprise at the unsurprisingly consistent EU position on post-brexit relations. 
They are all planning to betray Brexit, Theresa May has done everything in her power to derail this. This has all been planned. These politicians are the enemies of the people.  
If only The Telegraph could give us some clue as to the identity of these Brexit liars, maybe Boris can shed some light on it in his £250,000 a year column on Monday  
You didn’t need the word ‘Tory’ in there, Mr McCluskey. Stop pretending there’s some Labour version that won’t be devastating for jobs, prices, livelihoods etc. There’s no good Brexit at all.

France's President Macron has said: 'Brexit is the choice of the British people, pushed by those who predicted easy solutions... Those people are liars.'  
The EU treated our PM, David Cameron, badly & with a total lack of respect.They now do the same to Theresa May.These clowns think they are above us, in many ways.Yet they want & NEED our dosh.Time to kick back, UK.Time for WTO #Brexit & only then we can talk about 'deals'. 
People’s vote with option to stop Brexit is the only clear way out of this crisis. After Salzburg there is case for people’s vote to take place now, not next year. Parliament should be recalled next week to debate the Brexit crisis urgently 
EU history repeats itself as anti democratic dictatorial EU chiefs say Britain should have ANOTHER Brexit vote and doubtless have as many votes as necessary until it votes to remain inside the German jail of nations  @MailOnline

Brussels can't stop Brexit with insults - The Telegraph  
The worse Brexit gets, the more insanely obsessed May becomes with pursuing it. I’m no psychiatrist - does a condition like this have a medical name, and psychologists or psychiatrists, please? 
Really an extraordinary time in British politics. The EU stands tight; May is eclipsed; populism breaks to right and left; in the middle Vince Cable (AWOL) and Tony Blair (Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises). But if history is our guide the endgame or solution to Brexit will be pragmatic. 
#EU leaders will push for a #Brexit deal next month but warned #British PM Theresa #May on Thursday that if she won’t give ground on trade and the Irish border by November they are ready to cope with talks collapsing

So what do you expect him to do or say? The government WILL completely screw up Brexit, the government are reswponsible for this situation and Gardner's party is not in a position to do much about that as they ain't in power. The TORIES are criminally selfish 
They made their redlines abundantly clear over 2 years ago. To stick to them is not to show bad faith.Fact is, the fundamental contradictions inherent to Brexit are now being thrown into stark relief.The fantasy project us dying on its feet.

if i post an instagram, whether u like it is a referendum on me as a person 
'@theresa_may is trying to destroy #Brexit. Her #ChequersPlan not only goes against the Brexit vote but May is trying to maintain EU control over the UK particularly our economy. Chequers does not provide freedom, it is our prison. #TheresaMay & #Chequers both have to go & quick! 
#Brexit is under attack from the undemocratic EU & national leaders including UK politicians. The EU has never accepted #democracy, every time a nation votes against the EU they are ignored or made to vote again. Brexit won’t be 1 of those occasions. Brexit is worth fighting for!  
Chequers - why we are in this mess. #Brexit  
There will be books written about the bastard politicians who supported  #Brexit and it will bring shame on their children and grandchildren... and anyone even slightly related to them... 
I am sorry Richard, but if by respecting the referendum you mean condoning the lies and the illegalities of the Vote Leave campaign, then you have a lot to learn about the definition of democracy. As of tonight Chequers is dead in the water, as was always going to be the case. 
It always astonishes me that the polls show almost everyone thinks Brexit is going badly, but only a substantial majority want a #PeoplesVote.If you believe Brexit is going badly, then not wanting any safeguards on it can only be explained by your own personal pride. 
I think @MitchBenn said it best: Democracy is a reality, but reality IS NOT A DEMOCRACY.Sticking to Brexit because you believe it *should* have worked out fine, is simply irresponsible. 
I really don't get the Brexiter mentality, that says even though Brexit is entirely the UK's initiative, the EU are being bastards for not giving us what we can't agree we want, and not agreeing to self-destruct by compromising on the very things that justify its existence? 
Full house tonight @MLECJaguars for the first in a series of town hall meetings to inform the public regarding the #SecureOurFuture referendum. For more information, visit . 
Wow that poor Telegraph hack on #bbcqt. So fraught with anxiety about democracy continuing beyond 2016.  Either that or - like other hard-right Tory  Brexshitters - she knows how to profit from a catastrophic hard Brexit. 99.99% of of the population won't profit 
Tusk: Theresa May's Brexit plan won't work.Brexit is a fiasco. Contact your MP and demand they #ExtendA50 and support a #PeoplesVote to #StopBrexit. 
The more I hear people interviewed randomly on the streets about Brexit and the woeful answers they give, strongly suggests that the general public are hopelessly misinformed. 
There is widespread opposition to #Chequers as it stands let alone further concessions. It is seen as unworkable by the EU. But most importantly, the British people will not accept it. #Brexit #ChequersPlanThe full text of Davis' speech: 
Congrats on your brill Brexit vote everyone it’s going really fucking well great call well done 
One foolish old man is stopping @UKLabour from saving us from #Brexit.It's time the many sorted that one out.  
“In fact, the only way prices can rise post-Brexit is if parliament votes to impose tariffs." The simplicity of Tim Martin's understanding never ceases to baffle me.#BoycottSpoons#StopBrexit 
Now that Theresa May has more of an idea about what a realistic #Brexit entails, it’s time to be straight with people. It‘s not what was promised or hoped for. The only democratic course of action now is to #suspendA50 & give people a #FinalSay #SalzburgSummit #dreamsmeetreality 
You once interviewed me around two years ago and accused me in a friendly fashion of too much pessimism about the outcome of Brexit. You quoted an Australian at the time that UK would greatly prosper outside of the EU. Hate to say I told you so Iain but it was never easy or quick

Barry Gardiner is saying we should let the government completely screw up Brexit so we can have a general election, just so we can have a Labour government, with no guarantee that we'd get more time to negotiate.@BarryGardiner you criminally selfish political careerist.#BBCqt 
Macron puts the boot in after May's Brexit breakfast blunder  
This so-called “British” group of anti-Brexit activists is using attacks on the UK by the FUCKING FRENCH PRESIDENT to undergird their case.Let that sink in.  
Just listened to @CamillaTominey speak for a solid two minutes and nothing she said was backed up by the reality of our current EU relationship or even hinted at an attempt to make Brexit compatible with the Good Friday Agreement.If Brexit happens I've saved the footage..#BBCqt 
I realise that last tweet was quite whimsical and not about Brexit, Trump or existential crisis. I’ll do better next time. Sorry. 
MP @CSkidmoreUK said we should leave because the EU has mistreated us in the Brexit negotiations.Who voted to turn the EU, our partners of 40 years, into our economic competitors? Was that the EU? or was that us?#BBCqt 
mental health more unstable than the british pound during brexit negotiations 
Why do @BBCNews & @SkyNews put the phrase “So Called” before People’s Vote.It’s a People’s Vote on the final Brexit dealDrop the “So called” because the voters will absolutely 100% be people! It’s a People’s Vote for people Thank you 
Um.1) Wow, they got that together quick, didn't they?2) There are more men than women in this picture.3) Brexit taught us things written on the sides of busses are always true.  
I almost want a no deal #Brexit just so nobody ever listens to the Tory right about anything ever again. We'll get to see the full extent of how spectacularly wrong they are about trade. 
How has Theresa May never gone home, drunk gin until 3am, muttered "eff this for a game of soldiers" and just handed the whole clusterf**k to Boris on a silver salver and said, "g'wan so"? #Brexit #SkyNews 
A refreshing perspective.Thankfully someone out there understands that #Brexit is Mission Impossible.What a great pity that person is not anyone in the govt.#bbcqt 
Newspaper headlines: 'Your Brexit's broken' and 'May humiliated'  
Who didn't realise that Chequers couldn't possibly work for the EU?  I don't know a single person that follows Brexit that wasn't clear on this. 
The only place you have taken us since the 1st referendum is BACKWARDS. Square 1 is looking quite attractive right now. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
Just a wee thought...would anyone be interested in gathering somewhere visible on the night of Brexit - 29th March 2019 at 11pm - and using torches with coloured filters to form an EU flag? 
Tens of thousands pro-independence supporters take to streets in #Barcelona, on the 1-year anniversary of Spanish occupation forces' raids on govt buildings to (unsuccesfully) stop #Catalonia's independence referendum 
Hello Barry GardinerOf course the Labour party conference is going to have the largest ever number of attendees: they are all turning out to make sure that Labour turns its back on #Brexit.Labour's members are determined that there shall be a #PeoplesVote#bbcqt 
Absolutely. I have been gobsmacked by the sheer idiocy and mindlessness that Brexit has unleashed in the UK, not to mention the viciousness and bigotry. It is a long way back but it should begin tomorrow with Brexit being declared void. 
Finding the right balance between not boring those who are following along and not alienating those who are keeping half an eye on it is very difficult in the Brexit debate. 
Labour would win if it backed a second Brexit vote - a shock poll reveals  
'A new referendum could stop Brexit destroying this country's heartlands – it’s up to Labour to make that a reality'  
May asks Corbyn to rule out a #PeoplesVote & he rules it out. Both R complicit in a #BrexitShambles, both invoked A50 w/o due diligence; both R responsible.We face a #Brexit disaster, our Rights removed, our country trashed yet neither allow a #FinalSay.Let's rule them both out 
So we destroy British agriculture, import hormone rich meat,  chlorine washed chicken , and American subsidised sugar and suggest we are free. Absolute Brexit rubbish.  
Spoken with the emotional maturity of a child, but not  unusual for Brexit devotees.  
Yet another #bbcqt with brexit as major discussion with only @CamillaTominey ( out of 5 ) representing brexit, yet she ran rings around them 
A second referendum/people's vote that leads to a remain win is a win for the status quo. We'd still have a Tory government, still have austerity under-funding and cuts.. in other words the reasons people voted Brexit would still be there. We need a General Election. #bbcqt 
What's the difference between a,LAZY MP And a HARD WORKING MP?A lazy MP wants to remain in the EU, and have all of their work done for them, by the 42,000 personal assistants of unelected bureaucratsA hard working MP wants to work and fight for the people of the UKBREXIT! 
The ability to lie and deceive unchallenged by the media will be seen by historians as the hallmark of the Brexit Referendum Leave campaign.

Brexit is real  
Goodnight Twitter. Tonight, I am very worried for the future of the UK. We are lions led by Tory #Brexit donkeys with very few  brain cells between them.  So sad to think we were on the road to economic recovery before the EU referendum. Now we are all in deep S**t. #bbcqt 
#Labour and #Corbyn right not to back a #PeoplesVote or second referendum, Theresa May is trying to run with Labour "sabotaging Brexit talks" and if Labour backed those two things, it would have stuck. So Corbyn just played the "give them enough rope..." game. #bbcqt 
Camilla Tominey on #bbcqt: "I don't know of any leave voters who are running around screaming 'oh my god, I've made a terrible mistake.'"Next audience member: "I voted for Brexit but now I've looked at the facts and listened to the lies, I think it should go back to the people" 
Guardian front page, Friday 21 September 2018: May humiliated as European leaders tell her: your Brexit plan won’t work  
''When people voted 18 months ago, it was a very simplistic question''This audience member says it is a 'democratic right' to have the opportunity to vote on Brexit #bbcqt 
We DO NOT need another referendum on #Brexit. We already had a #PeoplesVote in 2016. If politicians don't deliver the will of the British people, then trust in politics will be permanently destroyed. #bbcqt #StandUp4Brexit #RespectTheResult 
I agree with Elizabeth Wood on @bbcquestiontime if there was another vote on the Brexit deal people would vote with more knowledge... 
The country was never split down the middle about Brexit.Not until the Leave campaign started telling people we'd have more money for our public services if we left the EU.#BBCQT 
''We'd have more respect for the government if they said 'we're sorry, we can't get out of this, we're tied to Europe' '' This audience member says the government is unable to deliver Brexit #bbcqt 
So Corbyn's position is to call a general election to "let the people decide what direction they want to go" on #Brexit, choice being the Tory party, who support leaving the EU or the Labour party, who support leaving the EU....  
#bbcqtPoliticians would be a lot more honest is they just admitted that they DON'T respect the result of the referendum........ 
Just watched @theresa_may on @SkyNews she was clearly sweating with nerves. Looks like #brexit will be a hard crash out affair. This will boast support for Scotland to leave the UK. Our party has created a real mess. @ScotTories @SkyNewsBreak 
''I can't believe that we're still talking about no deal''This audience member says that Brexit is 'all about the Conservative Party and nothing to do with the country' #bbcqt 
Apparently "We can't have a second EU ref bc that wouldn't be democratic"... Vote Leave chose to criminally cheat in the 2016 referendum. #BBCQT 
Theresa May's refusal to accept that the #ChequersPlan is dead puts the country at further risk.Her whole Brexit strategy has been a mess. We must give the people the final say on the deal and option to remain. Agree? Join the campaign >  
I’m watching BBC Question Time and the audience are enthusiastically clapping whenever anyone mentions the merits of a no deal Brexit outcome. Basically, the audience are enthusiastically clapping a monumental act of self harm.#bbcqt 
Remember: @Theresa_May has a majority in Parliament & used our money to buy it..@UKLabour are not in power & are not negotiating.If she can’t get her deal through Parliament that’s her problem.She should speak to her MPs.Brexit belongs entirely to @CONservatives.#bbcqt 
''People voted for Brexit, so Brexit is what they deserve''This audience member says she does not see a no-deal Brexit as a bad deal #bbcqt 
Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' by backing Brexit referendum  
I agree that brexitters deserve brexit, but the rest of us don't. #bbcqt 
Such clap trap. It'd be the same people voting. How can we "betray" ourselves? We are a sovereign nation. If we have changed our minds about Brexit who can tell us otherwise? Not the Brexit Elite. #PeoplesVote 
''There is clearly a very big swing in that direction'' @vincecable says that many people have changed their minds on whether to hold another vote on Brexit #bbcqt 
''If a deal is so important to Britain, then by it must be very, very important to the EU as well'' @CamillaTominey says a no-deal Brexit would be a failure of the EU's negotiating strategy #bbcqt 
.@nazirafzal says that the reality of voting to leave the EU is becoming clearer and believes there should be a referendum #bbcqt 
Sir Vince Cable said that "Brexit is not inevitable - it can and it must be stopped" #bbcqt  
.@vincecable says that many people have changed their views on Brexit and believes a referendum should be held on the issue #bbcqt 
#bbcqt Why are we respecting a referendum result which it has been proven to be won by fraudulent illegal activities? 
#bbcqt @bbcquestiontime at the time of the brexit vote there was 1.5m 16-17 year olds. Shouldn’t they have a say on their future? Including myself, I was 16 at time of the vote now I’m 19 and able to vote for my own future 
A #PeoplesVote will #StopBrexit. No clearly defined Brexit can ever be the will of the people.  
Here it is, fresh out of Salzburg, this week’s Brexit Republic Podcast: Episode Nine via @RTENewsNow  
.@CSkidmoreUK, who voted to remain in the EU, says he would now vote to leave due to how Theresa May has been treated during Brexit negotiations #bbcqt 
To those saying we need a GE not a #PeoplesVote - I want rid of this awful Tory govt more than anyone.But we need to get real. Tory & DUP MPs are not going to vote for a GE in a month of Sundays. Far more likely some vote for a referendum amendment - if so, the govt collapses 
The difference between 'Soft Brexit' and 'Hard Brexit' is the difference between jumping into an empty swimming pool feet first versus head first. Both are so crippling, you have to be intoxicated to do it, either by drugs, for the pool, or by ideology, for Brexit. Don't jump.  
Rumbled @campbellclaret lol  face it Ally it’s just a fantasy that the ‘people’ want another vote - brexit hardening  
Want does no-deal Brexit means for the supply of medical radioisotopes? This piece is it.We'd be out of EU priority supply. If roads are blocked, we'd have to pay to fly them in. That's if the flights are still going & airport customs can handle it. 
This front page, from Brexit supporting Telegraph, is extraordinary.  
Thank goodness (again) for the DUP on #Brexit  
If the UK govt had insisted in 1998 that Northern Ireland could not be treated differently from the rest of the UK, there would be no Good Friday Agreement. #Brexit 
Even before today’s failures by Theresa May at #SalzburgSummit18 , polls show that Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' by backing a #referendum on the #Brexit deal:  
All true from Macron: "Brexit has shown us one thing - and I fully respect British sovereignty in saying this - it has demonstrated that those who said you can easily do without Europe, that it will all go very well, that it is easy and there will be lots of money, are liars." 
Obviously all the mass stabbings, murders, acid attacks, moped robberies and attacks are all the fault of Brexit. All under Khan's watch. 
Why, #newsnight, are you interviewing Chris Grayling on #Brexit?Brexit is not his area of expertise.Railways are his area of expertise.And look where he's landed the nation's rail travellers.I suspect the Newsnight dog would be possessed on more information on Brexit. 
One day people who admit they supported Brexit will be as thin on the ground as people who admit to having been Gary Glitter fans. 
Brexit is going well. 
Massive pro EU panel again. Here's a preview:Brexit:DoomGloomDisasterFearDoomGloomDisasterFearDoomGloomDisasterFearDoomGloomDisasterFearDoomGloomDisasterFearDoomGloomDisasterFearDoomGloomDisasterFearDoomGloomDisasterFearJust don't watch it.  
No, Low Facts Chloe - talking with EU diplomats is not "colluding with foreign governments".But some of the crooks who backed the #Brexit campaign *were* colluding with a mafia state that murders people in the UK, and that sought to reward them with lucrative "business" deals.  
Even the revolting Daily Telegraph seems to be 'fessing up to the reality that Brexit was won on the back of a lie.  
My latest on how we ended up, entirely predictably, in the #brexit mess  
A historic meeting between @VP and @Zoran_Zaev in historic times, days ahead of the 30 September referendum! Grateful for the US support and the encouragement!  
“This terrible Brexit mess is clearly all the fault of the civil servants, not the politicians. How could they be so incompetent? Don’t they know how to polish a turd properly?”  
If this really is death-of-Chequers (in any form) it’s a v shortsighted EU move. It cannot guarantee UK will back away from Brexit. And it makes the most reckless form  more likely. The only winners are the ERG. 
I’d wager that a significant number who voted leave didn’t vote for the disastrous #Brexit we are marching towards. As responsible elected politicians, you cannot allow a flawed, and as it turns out illegally funded referendum, to ruin this great country for generations to come. 
However this #Brexit saga ends, the UK can't now emerge from it with dignity. We have been diminished in Europe & the world & have only ourselves to blame. 
The Telegraph has changed its Brexit relationship status to “it’s complicated” on Facebook  
Let’s be clear:1) You can’t leave without a hard NI border2) NI voted in a referendum not to have a hard border3) A vote demanding a magic border instead was a really silly idea  
Friday’s TIMES: “Humiliation for May as EU rejects Brexit plan” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday 
And a brutal self own by The Telegraph. Devoting an entire front page to calling themselves liars is admirably brave and the most accurate reporting they have done on Brexit in months. Bravo! 
Has any country ever been quite so unfortunate as to embark on so vast and complex a project as Brexit with so little talent in power?Johnson, May, Fox, Davis, Raab, Gove - what an absolute shower. And Corbyn and the Politburo are worse.

If I’d been a prominent advocate of Brexit two things’d  scare me: how I’ll be treated for the rest of my life and how I will be remembered. 
*I want to quit twitter but I also want to stop the Brexit Catastrophe*  
Robert Peston has just said on ITV News... “I do not myself believe that parliament will back ‘no deal’....I think it HIGHLY LIKELY in those circumstances that parliament will assert its authority and force a referendum on the government...” I’m very slightly daring to hope 
Labour's annual conference to focus on austerity and Brexit  
Macron’s attack on Brexit “Liars “ is strong. For many in Europe Brexit is part of Le Pen-Bannon-0rban-AfD-Salvini axis of nationalist xenophobic populism aimed at destroying EU. Mrs May has tin ear on this @CER_Grant @Peston @JeremyCliffe 
EU leaders call for UK public to have final say on Brexit outcome with new referendum 
Cannot help thinking now that whatever possibly happens in relation to #Brexit and the UK, some EU members have behaved so abominably that they have destroyed what they presumably wanted to protect. Darkest hour indeed. But for the EU, ironically. 
"I think it is highly likely that parliament will assert its authority and force a referendum on the government" ~ Robert Peston 
Friday’s GUARDIAN: “May humiliated as European leaders tell her: your Brexit plan won’t work” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday 
The bluff has been called. There is, quite rightly, no appetite among EU leaders to capitulate to an enfeebled British PM. Brexit is a suicide mission, and we should stop it now. 
Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' by backing Brexit referendum  
I mean, Brexit, obviously a car crash with only awful errors flowing from it.But surely the strangest twist has been the sight of FG getting used to gleefully sticking it to the Brits.I mean, when Britain loses FG, it’s time to pack up the tent. 
Friday’s Telegraph: “‘Brexit is the choice of the British people...pushed by those who predicted easy solutions...Those people are liars’” #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday (via @AllieHBNews) 
“The choreography has gone badly wrong...very embarrassing” @bbclaurak sums it up. Others calling it a “disaster”. Anger, frustration and isolation clear on PM’s face. What a mess. Time for @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit #Salzburg 
The 2nd indyref is coming & coming soon, more & more people are seeing 'YES' as the only viable option for Scotland.The Scottish people WON'T be fooled again!!!Time for a change#YouYesYet#indyref2#Referendum#Independence#DessolveTheUnion 
British diplomacy has been shown to be thoroughly substandard during the Brexit process, missteps and insularity throughout. It’s won’t get any better post-Brexit. 
Rees-Mogg: “British people voted to Leave #EU -date we Leave is 29 March 2019That’s been passed into law twice now & not to implement that law would be letting down people who voted to Leave & would be a considerable failure of Government policy.”#Brexit 
Fighting Brexit and offering people a vote on the deal is basically a win-win-win for ⁦@UKLabour⁩ Labour voters want it Majority of public want it It’s what’s ⁦@BestForBritain⁩ Come on JC, do us all a massive favour!  
This is how the leadership of the European Union treats a country that liberated much of Europe together with the United States. Nasty, vindictive, supremely arrogant and classless. Brexit cannot come soon enough.  
I’m so, so bored of #brexit. Can’t we just tell the EU to fuck off, walk away, spend the £39bn on a knees up, then just deal with the consequences afterwards? 
Sweet old lady: Hello dear, may I have your seat? Me: Yeah sure, what did you vote in the referendum tho? Old bitch: leave Me: pic.twitter.com/CBqnPjXkd4 
I hate Brexit, I hate Farrage, despise @David_Cameron for going about referendum SO poorly, despair at the MPs trying to sort it. It's an impossible and horrid situation that should never have come about. It is a total drain on resource and time, for a people who were doing fine. 
Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' by backing #Brexit referendumSo it would serve the party as well as the country if @UKLabour came out in favour of the #PeoplesVoteWe look to Liverpool in anticipation 
Donald Tusk: Theresa May's Brexit trade plan won't work. Of course it won’t, we are heading for a #NoDeal so let’s roll up our sleeves and get ready. It’s working perfectly well for China and USA and dozens of other countries. We have nothing to fear 
Shout out to @AdamBoultonSky for confronted Nigel Farage with video of him citing Norway before the EU ref. BBC Brexit fans #TheAndrewsSisters Marr & Neil ignore & block for making such requests. Leave narrowly won by obtaining millions of votes 4 Norway which was never available 
Dear Theresa & Dominic. Please, for the sake of our national pride & status, stop flogging this dead horse - you're turning us into a laughing stock. Plan B time: an #EEA-based Brexit. Solves Irish border, secures trade relationship, & commands Commons majority. Time to get real.  
Away from Brexit - if you have been following Labour shenanigans on the NEC and party changes in rules and culture, read this from long serving, well respected activist, Ann Black

"We will not stop."Pro-independence protesters in Catalonia marked the anniversary of a Spanish police raid that sought to prevent last year's independence referendum.  
“I am in blood stepped in so far that should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o’er.” I keep saying that Brexit is Macbeth.  
Indeed as Ken Clarke says today - off the record there isn’t a single MP (right wing loons aside) who think Brexit is actually a good idea 
Our fantastic @skynews political correspondent @lewis_goodall has somehow found time in amongst the #Brexit drama, breaking news, Sunrise shifts, Boris comments, Labour crises, Tory crises and Lib Dem exotic spresms to write a book!! A real book!!! #leftfordead 
After Salzburg it is time to call a halt to the madness that is brexit.It really should be that simpleSIGN and then RT this petition (now over 26,400)"If there is no agreement to leave the EU then brexit must be stopped"SIGN here #FBPE #StopBrexit 
So the EU27 have rejected Theresa May's barking-mad Chequers plan and it's looking like we are heading for Hard Brexit... This Sky Data poll shows how the British people feel about that. Remain 20m - Hard Brexit 14m #PeoplesVote 
Here's Brexit in a nutshell. English Leave voters happy to jettison Northern Ireland. Presumably Scotland not far behind. That is why #Brexit means #Brexit - Britain as we know it exiting the world stage.  
If there really was a Deep State, I think it would be doing rather better at steering us away from the #Brexit cliff edge. 
The real reason we’ve made so little progress on Brexit is clear, says @jamesrbuk. The hardliners central to the process have made very little effort to understand it 
How others see #Brexit: German public broadcaster ARD accuses May of drawing up the UK drawbridge but failing to notice the enemy is within: Boris Johnson and extremist Brexiters. No sign of Berlin demanding a favourable deal for UK. That was always #fakenews 
Opposition parties spend their entire life arguing against a democratic vote,that’s what opposition means. That you want to end democratic debate with one plebiscite rather makes you the despot. You need to stop treating the referendum like an enabling act.  
The country needs someone who can deal with a ganghanded chicken livered bunch to sort this #Brexit crisis. @theresa_may my love, I am ready to help. Look at my record, I defeated Nicole, I defeated the #Loosewomen mob so a man named after an elephants tooth will not beat me dear 
Fuck off and deal with the fact that it was an advisory, non-binding referendum and that in a democracy people are allowed to campaign for what they want.  
Definitely....or even better....just cancel the bloody Brexit.....its been proven the Leave campaign cheated....if we want the will of the people and democracy....they now don't want to Brexit.... 
'Pledging to give the British people a final say on Brexit would see a surge in Labour support that would carry it to the brink of government' Most current and potential @UKLabour voters want a #PeoplesVote. A new vote is Labour's only route to power. 
How if HMG refuses a #PeoplesVote can Parliament instruct it to grant a 2nd Referendum unless there is a no confidence vote which is a nuclear button as no one wants a GE & doubt there are the numbers to secure that even with no deal. Strikes me as potential Constitutional crisis 
People like you have aided and abetted this by encouraging @uklabour to play their silly game.  Brexit is a disastrous decision by the public and you all know it and there is only one fix.  Let’s examine the consequences on our lives and have another look #PeopelsVote #fbpe 
Another referendum. 
You have this completely wrong. Labour must respect the Referendum result if we don't want to further alienate the people who were desperate enough to vote Leave, Don't let them down by telling them they're stupid and wrong.  
Labour could surge towards winning power if they backed new Brexit referendum, polls find  
The amazing thing is that Britain, acting unilaterally, cannot unite behind a settled Brexit view, whereas the EU27–27!—are serenely at one.  
That Kavanaugh nomination's is fast becoming not just a referendum on Trump and GOP, but a Rosetta Stone to a larger transpartisan ruling class (at Yale Law School) that's pushing his nomination, may be another sign of a coming realignment. The unraveling narrative of wealth and  
Brexit might have it's downsides, but I think most of it will be worth it when we see Boris Johnson, Theresa May and Nigel Farage being executed by firing squad on Christmas morning in an emergency broadcast during a Two Ronnies repeat. 
So Corbyn is proposing an election to resolve the Brexit deadlock in which he will still back Brexit, just like the Tories.What a complete abdication of responsibility.  
What would Labour policy on Brexit be?  
Here’s what I wrote about Theresa May and Brexit’s likely no deal outcome in March 2017 for @TheCommonSpace You should probably read it and reflect on it with the new information from the subsequent 18 months: 
Well worth reading for this line alone: "Aides scrambled to lower the temperature of the sweltering summit by urgently procuring a giant Dyson cooling machine for Mrs May's news conference. A Brexit fan."

Communication between the EU and UK on Brexit is at a turning point  
The Kavanaugh hearings have become the ultimate referendum on that stupid Eastern Seaboard country club guy hairdo 
We have been too quiet recently - the reason is we are working on a report about Brexit, the Irish border, the Customs Union and EFTA. 59 pages so far, plus another ten or so to go. Chequers is dead - EFTA/EEA plus special customs arrangements is the way forward.  
Says @theresa_may who knowingly and illegally triggered article 50 in full knowledge that the referendum had been rigged and won through cheating.  Not my PM.  This is simple treachery against the UK by a sitting PM - it won't be allowed to slide.  
.@KateNicholl and @NualaMcAllister have called out Sinn Féin for their blatant disregard for the consequences of Brexit, after the party made “weak excuses” not to support a debate on the People’s Vote #Brexit #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk 
 BREXIT.  
Brussels can't stop Brexit with insults:  
I agree.  One of the most interesting and well informed speeches on #Brexit i have seen to date, an absolute must read from Sir Ivan Rogers.  
This is a sensational month for non-fiction: @realBobWoodward on Trump, @BenMacintyre1 on Gordievsky, @MarkLeibovich on the NFL, @RobDotHutton on comically bad British Nazis and Max Hastings on Vietnam. God knows when I'm going to write book three on Brexit 
Macron  has today vastly strengthened the hand of Leaversif the impossible happened  and we had a losers ReferendumThe British and NI people hate  being told how to run their Country by outsidersWhen those outsiders are French and call our ppl liars it’s a forgone conclusion  
Full house for Maria Steen's talk tonight on the abortion referendum. @ionainstitute 
There is a bit of me that feels rather peeved our PM has been kicked about by the EU in such a public way.But at the same time, the EU are pushing Brexit along nicely....... 
We have entered a hideous Brexit parallel universe where the govt pleads with the opposition not to oppose them and the opposition obligingly agrees and they all talk endless shit because it’s easier than telling the truth.... And the UK slides apathetically into the bin. 
They say it won't work, but Theresa May insists her #Brexit plan is only "credible" option 
A Canadian analytics firm that worked for Vote Leave Brexit campaign has been hit by the first ever GDPR notice  
Tonight's Question Time panel: Chris Skidmore = Remain, Barry Gardiner = Remain (but now pragmatically supports Brexit), 'Sir' Vince Cable = Remain, Nazir Afzal = Remain, Camilla Tominey = Leave. So there you have it, four against one, but don't worry, the BBC isn't biased #bbcqt 
The prime minister insists that her 'deal' for Brexit is credible and has not seen any viable counter-proposal from the EU.Get the latest on the Brexit talks here:  
Every day @Theresa_May says there won't be a second referendum, kinda like she knows she's fighting a losing battle. 
Why are we letting 1.5% of the UK’s population (Unionist Brexiteers) from a place as as near to Britain as France - and which accounts for just 1.5% of the UK economy - force a hard Brexit that will damage 98.5% of our economy?  
Labour could surge towards winning power if they backed new Brexit referendum, two separate polls find  #PeoplesVote #FinalSay 
Yep and well done Craig for running a really crap 2016 losing Remain elitist campaign after your glib boss, the worst PM since Chamberlain, promised the backfiring referendum purely for Tory tactical advantage. Own your share of the crisis  
The results are in! And it's a landslide victory for those viewers who think the UK should get a new vote on #Brexit. 84% say Yes!  
**LIVE now on CNN - should Britons get a chance to have a vote on the Brexit deal?? 84% YES15% NOGet voting people!@peoplesvote_uk @Women_4_Europe @spaceangel1964 @women4PV @Ferretgrove @lunaperla 
'Brexit will be a disaster for the working-class people our party was founded to represent. They are the ones whose rights will be ripped up by any deal the government negotiates and they deserve a say.'Brilliant move from @Hounslow_Labour & @SalmanShaheen#PeoplesVote 
Truth is, Macron's line's been consistent:"The best trade agreement for Britain..is called membership of the EU" Feb 17"Those who wanted Brexit never told the British people what the cost would be" Oct 17"As you decided to leave you cannot be part of the single market" Jan 18 
That's exactly what will happen. I'm a moderate leaver who was flirting with 2nd vote, but not any more, this treatment of UK is why I voted Brexit in first place and it just reminds me of my reasons why I voted the way I did. 
Pres. Macron is right. After 19 ys of dealing with EUsceptics as a Tory MEP I've learnt for many in the cause of Brexit the end will always justify the means & that includes outright lies & deceit. That's why after the Ref I resolved I'd had enough & time to speak the EU as it is  
President Macron tells us the truth about the Brexit catastrophe shame that Theresa May doesn't.  
MEMO to the PM.You've done your best re Brexit - you've tried to square the circle re your intransigent , obdurate RW. You've indulged the ERG. & the DUPWhy not just accept that the entire Brexit gig is not worth a row of beansAND CALL IT OFF.And put Country BEFORE Party. 
The principal reason why there shouldn’t a Second Referendum is that 17 million people who voted the first time will not believe the result wasn’t FIXED in favour of Remain. I mean, do these people seem trustworthy to you? 
Who would you rather was leading the Brexit negotiations? Please vote and retweet for a large sample amongst Conservatives. #MoggMentum 
Govt was warned of this by Ivan Rogers after the referendum and he was rubbished by Brexiters and ignored by May and the Cabinet. 
Theresa May's plans in Salzburg shattered as they collided again with the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone.Someone please buy her a copy of my new book, which will be in the shops just in time for next month's vital EU summit. #SalzburgSummit18 #Brexit  
Emmanuel Macron calls Brexit campaign leaders 'liars', in extraordinary attack - something Labour should’ve done in 2016. And 2017. And now. #ChequersPlan 
So sad that Traidcraft, pioneers of #fairtrade face closure, blaming the fall in the value of the pound due to #Brexit vote. Sadly symbolic too. The trade deals Fox hopes to stitch up couldn't be more diametrically opposite to Fair Trade principles.  
The word “brexit” cannot now be used without the next word being “crisis”. As in “the Brexit crisis”. Brexit is a crisis.  
My 13-year old son has just hit the nail on the head over Brexit...“I don’t understand why we are doing this. We will lose much more than we will gain.”Exactly my boy. Put that on a bus. 
Companies like Pfizer and Cadbury are making plans to ensure Britons don't run out of essentials after Brexit  
NEW Labour could gain more than 60 seats and 1.5 million votes if it backs EU referendum - poll 
Watch the full report as the EU rejects Theresa May’s ‘Chequers’ Brexit plan:  
Our country is being humiliated. This is an unmitigated shambles. We look like idiots. Thanks to this bottmlessly useless govenment and this stupid corrupt tainted idiotically simplistic referendum. 
Just arrived @Lbc to talk to @iaindale He is sounding very low. Another Brexiteer seeing the fantasies evaporate ! Here to talk book but happy to talk Brexit and @peoplesvote_uk all night. 
After 28 leaders posed for the EU summit group photo - they went back to the meeting room for the next session. Theresa May said her goodbyes - not allowed back in for their next discussion about her Brexit plan.  
I’m really missing #CunkOnBritian - we need to see @missdianemorgan doing more “Cunk On”... Cunk on Shakespeare, Cunk on Science, Cunk on Space - dare I say Cunk on Brexit? Whatever it is keep them coming forever and ever, pls? 
Labour would win if it backed a second Brexit vote - a shock poll reveals 
MAJOR BREAKING: Thousands protest in Barcelona on the anniversary of the first Spanish police raids on Catalan government buildings in order to halt last year's independence referendum.  
Ridiculously, calling a second referendum may now be the only way that Theresa May can possibly survive as Prime Minister. 
We've spent 18 months on a monumental Brexit bender. Now we've been shoved under a cold shower. We need to sober up quickly and do our best to see what can still be agreed. /End 
Wrong. Donald Tusk represents the elected govts of the 27 EU member states. He used to represent Britain as well, but we decided to leave. No one needs to mock Britain. Our prime minister humiliates our country day after day. Brexit has turned us into an object of pity & despair. 
Corbyn rules out a second Brexit referendum as PM. Anyone who still believes he’s pro remain and playing the long game must be deluded. And yet he won’t rule out another indyref in Scotland. Apparently some mandates are more important than others. 
After 4 years of seeing every mention of UDI described as zoomery and dangerous and impractical and illegal and mad, the thought just ocurred to me, what else is a No-Deal Brexit except a UDI?If the British Government can talk up UDI...#DissolveTheUnion 
Well worth reading this superb speech by former UK ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers in which he agrees with me that there is more than a whiff of 1914 about the current Brexit crisis. #sleepwalkers  
The public knew from day one, that Theresa May's Brexit plan is no good and will not work. It’s time for May to get into her Jaguar and head to Buckingham Palace to call a general election. Britain needs a Jeremy Corbyn led government. #ChequersPlan 
May in fight to save Chequers Brexit plan after Salzburg ambush  
Brexiteers have ridiculed and insulted Remainers for *years* for saying that:- "German industry won't save Brexit"- "Bypassing Barnier makes no sense"- "The EU27 aren't bluffing about the 4 freedoms"The apology must be in the post.  
May is wounded. She looks a pathetic figure. Britain is diminished. May has NO RIGHT to put Britain in this position. Brexit MUST BE STOPPED...NOW! It is undeliverable. 
The reason the Tories sided with all the neo-Nazis & extreme-right nasties to support Orbán in the first place was supposedly to get a better Brexit deal. In reality it's just hardened attitudes against them because the rest of Europe watched on in disgust as they did it. 
Wrong @theresa_may there’s been no vote on any detail, no consultation with the public, no consultation with business, no agreement even in your own minority-government. We don’t live in a Brexit Dictatorship where you alone decide on our rights as citizens and businesses ENOUGH!  
ICYMI: This is what Donald Tusk and the EU did to Theresa May's Chequers Plan today #brexit #ThursdayThoughts #ChequersPlan 
9/ After our agriculture industry is dead we are stuffed and they can increase their prices on sales to the UK.... because we have nowhere else to go post Brexit.I digress... a little.  The issue with 
4/ arrangements and trade agreements and not essential to the departure of the UK from the EU and are subject to change in due course.WA is about an 'orderly Brexit' Or orderly separation. 
one day we'll look back on all these brexit negotiations and laugh and laugh and laugh and harvest algae from pools of industrial waste to feed the children we haven't sold 
Honestly that's bloody hilarious.His job right now is to act in the interest of the 27 EU member states, to the EXCLUSION of British interests. That's the job that Brexit voters literally gave him. And now you complain that he's doing precisely that? 
It’s time for Theresa May to chuck Chequers and offer the EU a "take it or leave it" free trade deal ultimatum, says Nigel Farage @Nigel_Farage | #Brexit  
In this video Nigel doesn't just dogwhistle for people to riot if the public gets to decide on the Brexit deal, but he admits that there is no economic price he wouldn't inflict on the British people so he can get his Brexit.And the craziest thing, he's sharing this voluntarily! 
No sympathy for Theresa May's Salzburg humiliation. This woman is a remain voter who has refused to tell the truth about the economic disaster that #Brexit is. Prioritising party over country and dogma over facts.Signed.Citizen of nowhere.#PeoplesVote #FBPE 
#quote "Anyone who is still defending the EU as the reasonable, honest side in the Brexit negotiations must now admit they were wrong..EU officials sought to profit politically from scaremongering..and yet now..admit that..the border IS a fixable problem."  
There’s huge value in going into communities and finding out their realities. But I’m not sure how much is gained from just asking punters ‘what do you think of Brexit?’ These kind of answers don’t really illuminate anything, and perpetuate false notion that leaving is easy  
May must deliver a CETA+ FTA as promised at Lancaster House. Any move to keep the UK in the Single Market via Norway style deal would be a complete betrayal of the Brexit vote“I want to be clear. What I am proposing cannot mean membership of the Single Market”#StandUp4Brexit 
Labour could surge towards winning power if they backed new Brexit referendum, polls find  
May’s a total loser. Everything she touches turns to dust - the Election, Grenfell, Brexit - even her conference speech. Why on earth do the tories keep persisting with her?  She needs to do the decent thing: resign. Then we need the tories to hurry up and choose a proper leader.  
May in Salzburg: on pragmatism and pathology. My latest Brexit Blog post (with, for those who read it earlier today, a short update in the light of subsequent events this afternoon):  
Liars are we Mr Macron?  You really don't understand the British psyche do you?  The harder we are pushed the deeper we dig our heels in. No deal No 2nd Referendum No thankyou Europe.  
Liam Fox wants to scrap EU food standards in order to get a trade deal with the USA.  US-UK right wing groups want foreign competition in NHS & a regulations bonfire. Rees-Mogg thinks Indian standards will do fine after #Brexit. They want a tax haven and damn the consequences. 
I've been under the weather for a few days. so I wasn't aware that Jeremy Corbyn became PM and that Labour had a majority to introduce a referendum bill that would pass?  
#CurseTheresaMayYou exploited the carnage of Brexit to steal a job you are unfit for. So may Brexit destroy your career and your party 
#C4News Jesus that report from Northumberland was depressing. Do these people really believe their NHS, for example, is likely to survive Brexit? 'Let's just get out'. I am starting to think Leave voters deserve everything that's coming to them. But then I remember the 48%. 
The xenophobic English electorate will vote again for #HardBrexit if there is another referendum.Of that I have no doubts.Scotland however, would vote in even higher numbers to remain.Let us get the hell away from these people.#INDYREF2 Now  
There's tragedy at the heart of Brexit. A well-trodden tragedy about being careful what you wish for, and about not knowing what you've got until you lose it. We will leave, because having more than enough is no longer enough for us. So now we must be less than we were. 
So Long Salzburg...Is it Farewell to Chequers,Auf Wiedersehn to a Brexit Deal?Or Goodbye? 
Alastair Campbell wrongly claims support for a second referendum has been growing. But then he got fact-checked by Professor John Curtice...   
Pro-independence supporters take to streets in force in Barcelona, on anniversary of Spanish police raids on government buildings to stop referendum  
Two years ago, then Brexit minister David Davis said UK could do side deals with European leaders. Today Theresa May has one supporter among EU leaders - Victor Orban. 
Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' by backing Brexit referendum  
Poland wants a breakthrough in Brexit talks: Prime Minister  
Sinn Fein didn't support a motion calling for a 2nd referendum on Brexit. What? How can they say they are anti Brexit? They didn't register to campaign against it, they won't go to Westminster to oppose it and they refuse to support a #PeoplesVote. Are they now anti EU again? 
We Remainers must seize the mantle of patriotism back from the Brexiters. #Brexit is absolutely not patriotic. It has been driven by foreign interference & offshore tax-dodging press barons, it damages our economy, weakens our democracy & divides the country. #StopBrexit #FBPE 
So the big question after a Brexit trip to Salzburg has to be whether this is the crisis which finally turns UK Government cake stale, or whether as immediately suggested by the PM nothing has really changed - just a negotiating tactic. Thoughts - 1/  
Claire Fox has nailed this.We can simply WALK AWAY.It's not for the public to arrange this, we merely told them we want it done.Fine, they are too weak to get a deal, go out on WTO terms & you can have all the time you need to GET a bloody deal.WE WANT #BREXIT, no more crap.  
Whenever I hear Theresa May say there won’t be a second referendum, I remember that she said there wouldn’t be an early election in 2017. And we know how that turned out. 
As the #EU rejects May's #ChequersPlan and May insists that Chequers is the only option, are we to assume that a no-deal outcome is the only possible #Brexit reality now? Because no one voted for that!A GE or a #PeoplesVote is where I see this heading. 
Macron says leading Brexiteers are 'liars' The French ‘Little Napoleon ‘Macron has called the leading Brexiteers Liars.Well I think that he will regret this statement as it will reinforce the steadfastness of all that voted for Brexit.Time to push back. 
How the European Research Group envisages Northern Ireland after #Brexit(spoiler: it's not exactly 'frictionless')   
Guys, I'm suddenly not sure Brexit is a good idea. 
Brexit is the most humiliating, confused, dishonest, isolating, risky, undiplomatic, empathy-free, complicated, ignorant, energy-sapping, integrity-destroying pile of political shit we have ever had the great displeasure of wading through. And we have barely started. 
The patriotic thing is to oppose Brexit. The UK should be leading in Europe & therefore the world, not running away into small isolationism. The UK has too much to give to be curling up in a far-off corner & putting itself to sleep. 
May has said a softer Brexit wouldn't be leaving the EU and a harder Brexit wouldn't protect jobs.So now #Chequers is dead, whichever way she goes next, Brexit is a failure on her own terms.With her failure, she must call a #PeoplesVote 
Thanks so much to Mike Penning for pledging to #StandUp4Brexit todayChequers may be dead in the water, but a real Brexit is still far from a certainty. If your MP hasn't pledged yet, please email them and ask them to #StandUp4Brexit 
Rejected by the EU, rejected by your own party: your shambolic Brexit plan is a bad deal for Britain.Nobody voted for this mess. The public deserve a say.  
Brexit, usually pretty absent from the French media, has hit the headlines in a big way in the wake of Salzburg. And guess what all the attention is on? It’s almost as if this was an issue you might have seen coming.  
.@JeremyCorbyn absolutely right to not propose another referendum..@UKLabour are not in power & we are not negotiating. It’s for @CONservatives to make Brexit work; it belongs to them.If they can’t do that then @Theresa_May should call a General Election.Labour are ready. 
I've always thought that there would come a time when we'd have to consider walking away from the Brexit talks. Everyone surely has a bottom line and we've just reached it. I've thought in recent weeks that a deal is 85% likely. Not now. 
The clock started on the Brexit negotiations on 29 March 2017. It's now 20 September 2018. We have no workable plan. And the negotiation deadline is the start of November. COME ON!! You know this isn't what you wanted!#ChequersPlan 
So much for SF opposing Brexit. Didn't bother to campaign against it in the 2016 referendum, now voted against the #PeoplesVote.You'd almost think SF are happy to let Brexit continue, despite the damage it would do to the entire island, in the hope it might further a UI   
Hannan & Davis have claimed calls for a #PeoplesVote are undermining May's negotiations. They are lying. The real sabotage of Britain's position is coming from the Tory Brexiters who are willing to gravely harm the British people to get themselves a #Brexit tax haven.#StopBrexit 
Seriously. Forget everything you know or believe about Brexit and just watch this. There are 6 weeks left of negotiations. Does this look good?#ChequersPlan 
Theresa May is now the walking wounded. With one breath Donald Tusk blew over her house of cards. Johnson and Rees-Mogg are like vultures surrounding their prey. They want a no-deal Brexit at the cost of jobs, the NHS and the economy. A People's Vote is our only path to safety. 
It’s long past time Britain abrogated it’s partition of #Ireland in any case. To wreck #Brexit over the occupation of six counties of someone else’s country is absurd. Let the border between Britain and the #EU be in the middle of the #Irish Sea 
The #ChequersPlan is now dead.Brexit affects every single part of your children's futures.And we're 2 years in, 6 weeks left to go, and there are no plans left on the table. 
Speaking with a close farming friend today , we will never go hungry we grow and produce our own , whatever the #Brexit deal brings we will be farming and feeding our family and hopefully other British families. Did make me smile   
If they call another fricking general election I will vote for a fricking monkey in a hat riding a duck if it pledges to cancel brexit. #MONKEYINAHATRIDINGADUCKPARTY #VOTEMONKEYINAHATRIDINGADUCK 
Macron says Brexit must hurt, only liars said it would be easy  
BBC'S Damian Dramaticus's comment that BREXIT was not top of the EU agenda at the Salzburg Summit said it all! The EU have treated PM May with utter derisory insolence and there is now an acrid stench of anger that could lead to a 'NO DEAL' scenario 
This is absurd.Labour are not trying to frustrate the Brexit process. In fact the frustration for many is that they are largely absent on the issue.Perhaps May's frustration is that she's been given too much rope.  
The Supreme Court ruled the referendum didn’t make a decision. It was also steeped in fraud and gerrymandered.PM decided to leave and #labour could clean up now. Instead they run to help save #May and #Brexit.  
A non political mate, who voted Remain, just rang: HIM: "Have I got this right? These people are supposed to be our friends, yet this is how they treat our PM? ME: Well...YES: I hope there's another referendum so I can tell these f**kers where to stick their single market.  
.and you are falling into the JRM trap (why am I surprised?)Yeah, let's blame the EU for Cameron deciding to hold an non-risk assessed referendum. Let's blame the EU for the lies, fake promises and illegal money. Let's blame the EU for mismanagement. Let's NEVER blame the Tories 
European leaders reflect on the progress of Brexit negotiations.Most have been critical of Theresa May's Chequers' plan, but Hungarian Prime Minister Orban said he "would like to have a fair Brexit.”  
Brexit is a perfect storm of:a) a self-serving elite in government.b) an onside xenophobic media with pet journalists.c) a dumbed-down, softened-up electorate.It couldn't really happen anywhere else. 
It’s cleer that the EU have given up on British body politic and don’t care whether #TheresaMay stays or not. No evidence that they care who is PM #brexit - interesting weeks ahead. 
Just call a GE for gods sake ! Stop trying to involve corbyn in your unholy mess . The conservatives are responsible for Brexit NOT LABOUR !!  
Many thanks to the city of Salzburg, @sebastiankurz & @EU2018AT for hosting the #SalzburgSummit on: #migrationEU, internal security and #Brexit.Watch the highlights now   
Britain's Brexit strategy #Chequers 
Does everyone remember 2012, when the whole of policing screamed that May’s police reforms were a bad idea which would lead to years of problems but she did it anyway?If you think she doesn’t mean what she says about Brexit, you are off your pickle. 
Interesting timing Standby for more interest in this & Canada & Norway. NB Other Brexit options are available.  
What a strange thing for a senior political corr to say. Brexit really isn’t bringing out the best in British public discourse  
Please , I'm a labour voter and I'm on the left , but please spare me the pathetic Lexit excuses for not opposing the catastrophe of Brexit , to me socialism means decemnt jpbs, decent housing , and all these things are part of being in EU if only UK wasn't so backward 
Tonight on The Briefing Room...There are growing calls for another referendum on the UK's relationship with Europe - but how would it work, and is there enough time?@DAaronovitch explores the mechanics of this hypothetical proposition. Radio 4 8pm 
The trouble for Theresa May is that she was playing #Chequers while everyone else was playing Chess.....#Brexit #EUNegotiations 
I really wish people that bang on about we had a vote to leave  & whether we leave with prudence or with disaster lapping at our feet is immaterial, would be forced to put 75% of their worth in escrow to help cover the costs if calamity befalls Britain with Brexit. #ChequersPlan 
This is a fine example of "whataboutery". Never mind the utter shambles the UK is making of Brexit,  let's talk about EU migration.  Ridiculous.  
Not that it matters much, but my overriding emotions on #Brexit now are deep sadness that the UK finds itself in such a mess, and deep foreboding about what's going to happen this winter.  
Brexit - the economic effects. On #BBCNewsSix and #BBCNewsTen tonight @BBCNews 
Let’s pop over to #Brexit and see what’s happening...  
On @BBCNews in Scotland they are reporting that @jeremycorbyn would not stand in the way of a second Scottish Independence referendum if he was Prime Minister.So Mr #Corbyn - if the Scots can have a 2nd referendum then we can have a 2nd referendum on #Brexit@peoplesvote_uk 
The EU leaders have made it patently clear to May that Chequers is dead. If she wants a #Brexit withdrawal agreement she needs to respect the #EUs red lines and she needs to come back with concrete proposals, not promises of details at a later date.It is so embarrassing. 
My new blog with Greg Smith: How Anglicans Tipped the Brexit vote - and why Archbishop Justin Welby is singing from a different hymn sheet  @LSE_RGS @CASBSStanford 
Donald Tusk has told Theresa May her Brexit plan “will not work” - @Nigel_Farage asks: Is it time to chuck Chequers? 
Brexit, summarized.  
Taking a huge amount of joy from the idea Jeremy Corbyn would "decide at the time" whether to allow a second referendum on Scottish independence. What would it depend on? His whims? How busy he was making jam? 
We need an extension on Article 50, an  election and then a referendum on any final Brexit Deal which would determine whether to rescind Article 50 and none of that is going to happen b/c the Tories have too much skin in the Brexit game.  #ChequersPlan 
We strongly reject the proposal to allow low-welfare food in after Brexit. “This proposal shows the need for extreme vigilance to protect British consumers and farmers as Brexit approaches." - Nick Palmer, Head of Compassion UK.  
Lots of talk here in Salzburg of a Macron triumph to kill off Chequers. Don't be surprised if the French President soon takes centre stage as Middle England's Brexit villain number one 
8. The Remain movement was poor in the run up to the Referendum and took too long to unify afterwards (and is still too fragmented).Whilst I lay the blame for this chaos at the door of the Tories, Labour have not acted as a decent opposition.4/5 
My blood pressure is through the roof as rejection of #ChequersPlan means No Deal Brexit is more likely.1. Cameron should never have gambled with the UK's future to appease Tory Eurosceptics, nor should he have said the decision of that advisory vote would be implemented.1/5 
Fuck all to do with Labour, Tess. Tory Referendum Tory Brexit Tory negotiations Tory Shitstorm 
You and David Cameron caused the mess and left it for someone else to clean it up , you destroyed everything and will be remembered the worst party in history.You called the referendum and messed it up. 
In the Brexit debate, we hear little but Ireland, Ireland, Ireland.  Funny that no one mentions Gibraltar. 
I think trust in Politicians went out of the window with that big red bus Theresa. There is no appetite for your Chequers proposal either in Parliament or amongst the EU27. It’s time to go back to the people and let them decide now we have seen the Brexit car crash! #FinalSay 
Weird she didn't mention her own Tory MPs, Justine Greening, Philip Lee, Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve, Guto Bebb, Sarah Woolaston, etc who are calling for a second referendum...  
Macron calls Brexit campaigners liars. He is perfectly correct. I think this is significant. 
Donald Tusk, @eucopresident  has said @Theresa_May 's Brexit trade plan won't work. It’s ok Donald we all get that. The only one who doesn’t is the Prime Minister. #NoDeal it is then. 
1. Michael doesn’t understand what an orderly WTO Brexit means. 2. Michael prefers to attack Daily Mail readers to cover up his stupidity. 3. Don’t be like Michael.  
Stark Brexit message from @eucopresident today: by UK “suggested framework for economic cooperation will not work.”  
I think the official term for the situation we find ourselves in is SCREWED. We need another a referendum so that people can actually vote for what #Brexit really means rather than the lies we were told #ChequersPlan 
Brexit is a slow-blooming nightmare where every day, anew, I realise how fucked we are. Then I look at the small handful of people who could still just about avert some of the worst of it, & then I really, truly, yet again realise how utterly & completely fucked we are. 
The Tories in deep trouble are now demanding to see Labour’s Brexit plans and want Labour to rule out a second referendum. They have nothing left. Pathetic stuff. Brexit is your ‘project’. It’s down to you. Get on with it. They are going down for sure. 
Another General Election could be IMMINENT after EU leaders COMPLETELY rule out Theresa May’s Chequers Brexit proposal.For the sake of the country, you need to go @theresa_may 
Chuka Umunna says that Brexit is exposing our weaknesses as a country. And rather than tackling those weaknesses, he would rather sweep them under the rug and go running back to the protective folds of the EU. That’s quite the profile in cowardice.  
The problem with #Brexit is that it's ideology based and that's hard to break down. If every single one of us was looking at it from a logical viewpoint, it just wouldn't be happening.....#ThursdayThoughts #PeoplesVote #ThinkAgain #FinalSayForAll #StopBrexitSaveBritain 
Second referendum is playing with fire, attacking the trust on which our democracy depends. The intervention by EU leaders in backing such a referendum is highly irresponsible.  
Theresa May has finally achieved the impossible. She has managed to unite the country over Brexit. All it took was her Chequers plan.The EU don’t like it.EU countries don’t like it.Brexiters don’t like it.Remainers don’t like it.#ChequersPlan 
Hi all, thanks a lot for watching #politicslive & engaging here. It’s worth remembering specifically what I said Prof John Curtice told me, which is that, in his view, there is not “consistent evidence of a shift in support for a second referendum”. Thanks, J 
So the famous Islington English Union social imperialist Corbyn does not  rule out ‘allowing’ Scotland a further independence Referendum. What a frightfully decent chap he is, not ruling out something not in his gift to give. 
We knew that the European Union were not going to accept Chequers. Nobody voted for a disastrous No Deal Brexit, we need to refer it back to the people in a People's Vote.  
We told you so. We warned you repeatedly.This is #Brexit. 
Brexiteers: “We need to leave as the EU are a shower! A deal will be easy too, we hold all the cards as they need us more than we need them!”  Also Brexiteers: “Ah well Brexit would have been great if only the EU hadn’t been a shower and used all their leverage against us.” 
Is there a #Brexit plan that will get through Parliament, not cause widespread harm to the UK & get the thumbs up from the EU? If not, we need to prioritise, compromise or think again. And politicians on all sides need to collaborate rather than make #Brexit a career opportunity. 
Theresa May's Brexit.  
Memo to @NicolaSturgeon today in Holyrood you thrived on Brexit difficulties our UK is experiencing. You said how you campaigned for Remain. I am calling you out on this subterfuge. You were hardly in the picture, spending more money on a by/election. You are a hypocrite. 
It is 819 days since the referendum and there is no more viable plan for leaving the EU today than there was on day one. It is over. The government has failed on its own terms.It is time for @UKLabour to show leadership, call for a #PeoplesVote and campaign to #Remain in the EU. 
My favorite bit of Brexit has been the bit where everything has happened exactly as we expected it to fucking happen   
Who remembers Brexit? That was a mad time wasn’t it? What were we all thinking? 
Geez, Britain, just have a second referendum to cancel Brexit & get it over with. You are boring the entire universe with your stupid debates & in-fighting. A second referendum is not a middle finger to democracy, the opportunity to correct mistakes is the essence of democracy 
Domestic UK political drama aside (which I understand is important), most significant news out of Salzburg imho is that Britain will soon table a backstop proposal. The backstop remains the one issue to solve that will determine whether there is a Brexit deal or not 
EU leaders are saying today they want a second referendum. So my assumption is this’ll be the trade off for extending A50 process: they’ll agree if there’s another referendum at the end with an option to remain. May knows this hence she’s now unconvincingly trying to blame Labour 
The mood at No10 will be bleak tonight. The chances of: no deal; a General Election; Corbyn in No10; a second referendum, all went up after Tusk’s comments. It’s almost impossible for @theresa_may to start looking at a Canada-style deal: as a Unionist she fears cutting NI loose. 
Macron is such a twit. Who left the next day after the referendum? A PM who voted Remain.  
Theresa's been stitched up ............ yet again. Time to walk away, let them come to us.UK's post-Brexit plan 'will not work', EU says  
The #ChequersPlan has been well and truly torpedoed, as i suspect May knew was going to happen, she's now been cornered by a few extremists in her party who want no deal #Brexit, she must now resign call a GE, if @UKLabour offer #PeoplesVote they'll sweep into power #ToriesOut 
I will say this only once... There will be NO riots when brexit is canned. There will be a nationwide noise of tutting...proceeded by the sound of many kettles being clicked on.We're British, it's what we do 
Anyway I'm sure the Labour Party will make the most of the government's implosion over Brexit by announcing a new bunch of party rules changes, which they'll argue about for another month 
Jeremy Corbyn says Labour will push for an election if PM can't get a deal through Parliament. "Our preference is a general election - let the people decide what direction they want to go. We've made it very clear; we understand and respect the results of the referendum" 
Parliament should be recalled for Monday now the EU has rejected Mrs May’s Brexit policy. We can’t carry on as a country with no policy whatever 
Our motion calling for the support of a @peoplesvote_uk has just fallen in Belfast City Council Brexit Committee (only SDLP supported). Especially disappointed Sinn Fein voted against, though can’t say particularly surprised. #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
Theresa May's Brexit fails. It was an impossible task so we shouldn't blame her....nor the EU; they said no cherry picking right from the start...but we should blame Farage & Johnson who lied that we could have our cake and eat it. #PeoplesVote 
3/~ Labour, meanwhile, has the opportunity to create a hegemonic moment: spell out Norway-based alternative on White Paper and offer a second referendum on any deal. It's clear only Labour or Labour+ govt can move UK on from Brexit... 
May and others just never quite get that key EU leaders (Macron, Merkel) see Brexit as existential challenge to European project, so put huge premium on solidarity at 27. 
No more energy should be wasted on the anti-democratic farce of another EU referendum. The real task ahead is to reclaim British independence:  #BrexitBetrayal 
Brexiteers are blaming the EU and Theresa May for the crisis but the truth is that Brexit is defeating itself, writes @georgeeaton 
Am I the only one sick to the back teeth of Elsie sturgeon bleeting on about Brexit?FFS @theSNP spent more on a council by election campaign than they did on Brexit#someofthepeople #SNPOUT 
There is no Brexit deal that:a) satisfies Parliamentb) satisfies the Tory partyc) satisfies the EUd) doesn't stuff the countryWe need #PeoplesVote to get out of this mess#OFOC 
Have always been up for compromise on Brexit but watching the outcome of that EU farce in Brussels and treatment of May (not usually sympathetic) am leaning towards the hardest possible Brexit. They are the most appalling shower. 
The PM’s humiliation in Salzburg has been there for all to see for months. May refused to listen, and this is the inevitable result.The choice has *always* been:- retain trade; have no say- reject trade; crash economy- reject Brexit: keep trade, forge a better future 
So Theresa May's #ChequersPlan has been killed off more times than Sean Bean, and the combo of Tory infighting and Dominic Raab's Ralph Wiggum approach to negotiations is pushing us closer to a No Deal Brexit that nobody bloody wants. This government have absolutely shegged it. 
Remember what @DavidDavis was saying ahead of the Brexit vote? This from Deb 2016  
Emmanuel Macron calls Brexit campaign leaders 'liars', in extraordinary attack. ‘Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be alright, and that it's going to bring a lot of money home are LIARS’  
Brexiters unable to articulate any credible/workable Brexit plan of their own now cross that EU leaders aren’t interfering in British politics by proffering plans of their own.  
An observation: Most of the hacks most clued up about Brexit believe the inevitable solution is:a) 2nd transitionb) eventual UK/EU customs unionc) limited Canada-style FTA with carve outs for NIThey believe that it won't be May who finally gets to b) and c) but it will happen 
Oops ...All 27 EU leaders believe Theresa May's Brexit trade plan 'will not work’  
Another General Election could be IMMINENT after EU leaders COMPLETELY rule out Theresa May’s Chequers Brexit proposal  
Looks like we're back to Brexit means Brexit. What a shambles.  
Theresa May tells EU leaders at Salszburg that Britain is prepared to talk away without a Brexit deal. No it is not. A growing majority want a people’s vote. Any PM who so distorts citizens’ wishes can expect to see her authority (such as it is) crash and burn 
Hungary's Orban rides to May's aid. The UK govt is now part of a far-right axis including Trump, which is intent on undermining democracy, the rule of law & human rights. Never forget May's loathing of the ECHR, #Windrush & mistreatment of EU27 nationals.  #PeoplesVote #Brexit  
"We all agreed on this today, the proposals in their current state are not acceptable."EU leaders denounce UK's  Brexit plan  
She's seen the writing on the wall, she's out of a job shortly.If only she'd said back in 2016: "The referendum split the country. We need to work with both sides. Both will need to compromise...then, when we're all agreed, we trigger A50"Oh how different it could have been  
Europe’s press fear a hard #Brexit  
I would love to go 10 years into the future and see where whatever #Brexit will look like takes us. Amazed that some people can be so certain #Chequers 
Have a look at the proposed UK US trade deal - NHS is parted up and sold to US healthcare cos! Brexit is about asset stripping the UK by vulture capitalists like Rees Mogg. 
It was always going to be No Deal, because there was and never has been a viable plan. Brexit was the impossible sold to the gullible to enrich the powerful. #ChequersPlan #TheresaMay #Tusk 
The Chequers deal doesn't work. It doesn't deliver Brexit.  
The term "a people's vote" is a continuity Remainer marketing concept. I am surprised to see objective journalists using it. Factually, what they are demanding is a second referendum.  
Theresa May's shambles at Salzburg shows there's no such thing as a "good" Tory Brexit. Time she acts now in the national interest and calls a general election. Jobs and livelihoods are at grave risk but she's incapable of protecting them while so many in her party won't let her. 
No. We voted for Brexit and we have a viable option which is @DExEUgov’s Canada+++ Norway is not #Brexit#StandUp4Brexit 
Sorry Theresa, none of them are looking back #Brexit  
President #Macron calls Brexit campaign leaders 'liars', in "extraordinary attack." Good for him because that's exactly what they are.   
Theresa May's Brexit plan won't work says Tusk.   Well, Tusk & Barnier just saved Britain £39 billion quid, then.  No Deal it is.  Bring it on! #bbcnews #c4news 
Important point: at the heart of the Brexit debacle lies not just a shameful failure by the political elite to be honest with the British people but a deliberate strategy to mislead them in which Whitehall - with the cameras rolling - disgracefully connived.  
Worth pointing out that labour’s plan doesn’t work either. The EU won’t allow a customs union where we get to do our own trade deals.We can’t have a better than Norway deal but reject Freedom of Movement and there most certainly is no jobs first Brexit. 
The people now claiming that they wanted ‘no deal’ all along are *exactly the same* people who urged us to support Brexit because getting a deal superior to the status quo would be a piece of cake. They are utterly shameless. 
#brexit is totally bonkers!Resist the madness, join the #LibDems 
Theresa May has no solutions for Brexit and no care for Irish Interests – @MaryLouMcDonald  
#Remain and prosper because #Brexit   is totally bonkers!  
So the EU has shot Mrs May down in flames.Sure;y she must now put Jacob Rees-Mogg's plan to them. If they reject that then No Deal it is.If the EU is attempting to force a 2nd Referendum they will fail. 
It is Brexit that is humiliating May, the EU are just pointing that out.  
Most of the UK games industry is at #EGX, so @Games4EU decided to do a Brexit poll. These were the results.  
What's going on in the world when the @UKLabour leader is lining up with the Tories against the unions and against NHS staff?#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
So it looks as though Theresa May's Brexit plan is finally dead then... it's about bloody time, both leave & remain voters, and the EU have been saying for two years that we can't cherry pick!... maybe now she'll listen. Full steam ahead to Canada-style FTA.  @DCBMEP 
I notice the blunt message for Theresa May in Salzburg in which Council President @donaldtusk says her Brexit plan won't work for EU. Well, I'm no Brexiteer (in fact I voted Remain), but we may fast be approaching a situation where our handing over £39bn won't work for us either! 
Donald Tusk doesn’t like May’s Brexit proposals. Whoda thought it. Can we now agree this process is dead - it’s like asking a vegan to endorse Beef Wellington; it’s never going to happen. #secondreferendum is the only way to solve this. Fact. 
Over my long life, I've  learned that democracy never works when there is collusion by a foreign power and vested interests involved in either an election or a referendum. Moreover, the Brexit referendum wasn't a vote of carte blanche for national destruction.  
#Brexit talks in a single image: one brave lady in a political predicament one wouldn’t wish on one’s worst enemy, dealing with an unprecedented constitutional change under pressure from all -her party, opposition, EU, Brexitters, Remainers -versus 27 arrogant uncompromising.....  
Emmanuel Macron calls #Brexit campaign leaders 'liars', in extraordinary attack'Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be alright, and that it's going to bring a lot of money home are liars'  
Thoroughly agree.#ChuckChequersIn fact, chuck all versions of Brexit. They're all bust, all unpopular - and the UK has run out of time.Come back in 10 years with a plan. 
I have never seen a British prime minister more isolated & humiliated at a summit than Mrs May at SalzburgBrexit is turning us into the laughing stock of Europe 
If 2018 Brexit was exactly the same as 2016 Brexit, or if Brexit voters were happy and believed it was going well, then it might be legitimate to say "We voted out. That's it".But it's not, is it? 
Theresa May's Brexit approach is tinged with stubbornness says Jacob Rees-Mogg.  
What is striking, with so little time left before Brexit, is that the EU offered @theresa_may nothing she could use to silence her critics at home. Which may imply they have lost confidence she could ever deliver a deal  
I tweeted this exactly 6 months ago. Just saying. #ChequersPlan #Brexit #DeadAsADodo 
"Brexit is the choice of the British people, pushed by those who predicted easy solutions. Those people are liars. They left the next day so they didn’t have to manage it." That's the President of France not me! Good luck Theresa May getting a ‘cake & eat it’ deal in 6 weeks! 
Don’t forget that Sir Ivan Rogers resigned as Ambassador to the EU as long ago as January last year. “He may have been seen as a pessimist because it fell to him to convey the hostility and scepticism with which other governments view #Brexit.” 
“Millions of people voted Leave, not because of ‘Brexit lies’ but because they saw the truth about our pro-EU, democracy-loathing establishment”, writes Mick Hume 
HMG had no alternative. Brexit is an insoluble problem. Anyone who claimed otherwise is a fool or a liar. May had no choice but to let nature take its course. Now - at last - the reality of what the UK has inadvertently chosen should be clear to all...  
Moment of truth for #brexit talks will be October #EUCO. We expect maximum progress and results by then.  
The British Prime Minister was  absolutely humiliated in Salzburg today. Theresa May is NOT a leader.We need someone in charge of Brexit negotiations who can stand up to these EU bullies & fight for our country's future - before it's too late.  
Another General Election could be IMMINENT after EU leaders COMPLETELY rule out Theresa May’s Chequers Brexit proposal  
BBC News - Nicola Sturgeon calls for Brexit to be delayed  
I’ve shortened this story for you, .⁦@BBCNews⁩ “The EU has told Theresa May to take her plan and ram it”.You’re welcome. #Brexit  
The in any case advisory referendum of 2016 was subverted by foreign actors. It was also blighted by falsehoods by  Leave campaigners. Had it been binding, this would have been enough to have the result annulled. 
Dear Prime Minister,Square one was £350 million a week for the NHS, was it not?But Brexit is already harming the NHS and threatening my patients.So I’d like a vote on the reality we face today - and it’s my democratic right to call for it. #NHSAgainstBrexit 
omg you're not even listening, we don't want a damn re-run of the 2016 referendum; we want a vote on the final Brexit deal to make sure it's up to scratch because frankly we don't think it will be, an opinion evidently shared by the other 27 EU member states! 
UK's May says there is no EU counter-proposal for Brexit deal  
"The real reason we’ve made so little progress on Brexit is clear: the hardliners central to the process have made very little effort to understand it."  
".@Peston: "If all conventional roads lead to a hard no-deal Brexit, the notion of Parliament exerting control and forcing another referendum on us would begin to look not wholly fanciful"  
"Brexit is currently having a multitude of effects: it’s harming working class communities, it has created uncertainty for businesses, but worst of all, it has led to a rise in the far right."  
Macron:"Those who say we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be alright, that it's going to bring a lot of money home are liars"This has always been his view. In Oct he said:"those who wanted Brexit never told the British people what the cost would be" 
How can the UK have a "Norway plus" if even Norway hasn't managed a plus? Best option: Remain! #Brexit 
Number 10 source says the EU has just 'thrown an elbow' , and it was 'inevitable' that there would be some kind of clash like this during the Brexit process - PM would 'not just roll over' 
We now have proof that Theresa May's Brexit is unacceptable to EU27, so expect the #ToryConference18 to be a showdown. That's why we need to be in Brum Sunday 30th Sept. to protest to #StopBrexit!Please do all you can to be there + RT @birminghampost  
‘Brexit is the choice of the British people..pushed by those who predicted easy solutions. Those people are liars,’ - Emmanuel Macron  
It’s not gonna wash with the people Nige. You know the ones you Brexit elite claimed you were doing it for  
Remember folks, in the mad world of Brexit the UK may be about to leave the EU without a deal because the EU insists on a clause to keep the Irish border open, thereby closing the Irish border on the orders of the EU... (er, please check, ed) 
President Macron makes it clear there are no easy solutions. Clear we need a #PeoplesVote to give the public control of the #Brexit deal.  
- “Easiest deal in human history”- “Delivering a Brexit which works for the whole UK”- “We hold all the cards”  
Theresa May is a disaster, she's literally ballsed up everything she touches. An election that she should have won by a country mile and Brexit. How do Tories look at her and think she is the right leader?The UK is drowning because we have the worst politicians in the world. 
The daily Brexit mess makes it imperative that all those currently entitled and living in Scotland get a vote in #indyref2 Esp EU citizens as well those from elsewhere in UK of course. Thus timing important and must not exclude like #Brexitref did. 
when it's my day off and someone tries to talk to me about brexit  
Shame the #BBC (@BBC ) doesn't  reply to @InFactsOrg 's measured, well argued criticism of its pro-#Brexit bias: 
"Gentlemen, may I interest you in some Parsnip and nettle jam? No? How about some dog eggs? Anyone? Some finest Stevenage Sparkling Wine?Oh well, your loss." #Brexit  
Chequers is dead. @theresa_may is unable to come up with a workable Brexit plan.Politicians have failed: we need a #PeoplesVote#OFOC 
“Emmanuel Macron calls Brexit campaign leaders 'liars':“Brexit is the choice of the British people.....pushed by those who predicted easy solutions. Those people are liars” he said.  
May says UK preparing for no deal if no acceptable Brexit proposals agreed  
Now that would be a PM I could respect.One who said that the nation was evidently divided and that it was now plain for all to see that any form of Brexit would harm the country. Hence it made sense to return to square one and reconsider. 
QUOTE of the day "Brexit is choice of the British people.....pushed by those who predicted easy solutions. Those people are liars. They left the next day so they didn’t have to manage it."  Emmanuel Macron 20.09.18  #Salzburgsummit

Imagine what this country could have done by now without Brexit. Our politicians would be working on actual stuff instead of a heap of bananas bollocks, we'd have hoverboards and jetpacks and drones that bring you cake but NO we have to please the lot who got tricked by a bus 
Seems Brexit definitely doesn’t mean Chequers. 
Fact Check Torpedoes Campbell  via @GuidoFawkesI listenened to Campbell today on Politics live endlessly Venting that the tide had turned and that ppl wanted a2nd Referendum.Facts Are he has been proved wrong.yet Again. 
.@EmmanuelMacron calls out the Brexit liars in a way neither @theresa_may nor @jeremycorbyn have done. He will rightly be very wary of the blind Brexit plan too. And assume the public will not be fooled again.  
How come the EU can manage to get 27 different countries to agree yet our own PM can’t get 1 to agree - and continues to cling to something no one wants?! #Brexit  
Just extraordinary for the Prime Minister to suggest that trust in politicians will be enhanced if we reward them for lying to the public about Brexit. Where does that take us, @theresa_may? 
After criticism of her Chequers plan by EU leaders, Theresa May stands by her #Brexit proposals as "the only serious and credible" option - but admits there's "lots of hard work to be done" to reach a deal  
Summary:1. Here’s the science behind the Brexit vote and Trump’s rise:2. Brexit and Trump voters were all Fascist bigots.3. But 97% of them have now died of old age.4. And the surviving 3% want Our Second People's Vote.5. Talk about Our Settled Science!6. That's all, folks!  
"There will be no second referendum, the government will not accept a second referendum" - @theresa_may addresses chances of a no-deal on #Brexit.Follow the events live here:  
Theresa May has said her Brexit plan is "the only serious and credible proposal" on the table after European Council president Donald Tusk said the Prime Minister's Chequers proposals for Brexit "will not work" 
Lily Allen: ‘I’d spend the #MercuryPrize money on post-Brexit visa applications’  
Your own advisors, sitting in your office, are under investigation from the police for that referendum. Lies and deceit can only get you so far. There will be a second referendum. You are losing - trying to deviate attention to Labour when our country is in crisis is pathetic. 
#ChequersPlan is dead. The big question now is how can Theresa May survive Tory conference? Admittedly, after last year the bar is low, but she really will have to fight for her political career now. #Brexit #P45 
Theresa May: No second referendum. The Government will not accept a second referendum.  
You are the Brexit elite. And the people are demanding a vote on the mess and chaos you helped deliver. Threaten all you like but this is all heading one way now and it ain’t your beloved hard Brexit  
We are launching our country-wide Save Brexit Tour this weekend in Bolton with @DavidDavisMP, @Nigel_Farage and @KateHoeyMP. Today, millions of people will see our message on billboards across London and in the Sun and Daily Mail. Visit  for more. 
"The government will not accept a second referendum" says @theresa_may 
Who’s to blame? I’ll give you a clue it starts with T and ends in ories Rail chaos, Brexit, Child Poverty, Wages lower than 10 years ago, Windrush, NHS collapsed as the richest wealth doubles  
Don't want to sound superior, but now we must have a change of leader, to get a proper Brexit. 
There are two problems with your position: 1) Brexit in any form harms the UK; 2) UK people don't want it any more because of 1).  2016 ref sold a fast, cheap, easy, no damage Brexit.  It doesn't exist.  Time for a #PeoplesVote then the #RemainDividend 
Did you know that in 250 million years, all the continents on Earth will squash back together into Pangaea Ultima, but the UK remains an isolated nub on the edge, because Brexit will last until the end of geological time? 
He's spot on. Cameron, who called the referendum ran away. Farage who had inflamed the Leave side of the debate ran away by resigning UKIP leadership. Johnson launched his leadership bid press conference by running away.Gove tried it for a few days then ran away. 
The ministers and mandarins who called it wrong by investing in Chequers are still in their jobs. The ministers who resigned, correctly calling it out as an unworkable piece of crud that sold out Brexit are not. A PM with no mandate now has no policy either but squats in No10. 
Campaign cheating and lies exposed. Cabinet split. Chequers dead. Negotiations stalled.The PM is rattled and Brexit is on the ropes.  
EU Leaders are not on the side of the British people. Their aim is simple. To reverse the result of the Referendum and put Brussels back in charge.  
French President Emmanuel Macron: "Brexit is the choice of the British people... pushed by those who predicted easy solutions... Those people are liars. They left the next day so they didn’t have to manage it."#SalzburgSummit18 #eu 
It's time for a General Election @theresa_may YOU have failed as a leader.YOUR party has failed on delivering Brexit with "no deal" looking certain.YOUR party has failed 99% of people. The country is in paralysis of YOUR making.WE need a General Election & a LAB government.  
Theresa May's Brexit Chequers plans "will not work" says Tusk.Brexit is a project pursued by "liars" says Macron.Fair to say this has not exactly gone the way May had planned.  
BREAKING: France's president Macron says British government's Brexit proposals are 'not acceptable' 
#Salzburg latest PM: it’s my Chequers Deal or No DealTusk: EU27 agree Chequers “will not work”Dutch PM: Netherlands is more prepared than UK for No DealFrench PRes: UK politicos who sold Brexit are “liars”The hills are indeed alive... 
The tweet of a PM who few trust, rattled and desperate that the tide has turned against her and Brexit, reduced to pleading with the Opposition not to oppose her.How low Brexit and her government have laid the UK. How low.  
This is significant, but it was clear that the Chequers plan was unpalatable for the EU. Nobody voted for an extreme No Deal Brexit - we need a People's Vote.  
.@JunckerEU #Salzburg #Brexit “We need a positive conclusion and we need it in October. No deal is not my working assumption. But would it happen, we are prepared. @EU_Commission has prepared all elements of a possible no deal. Don’t worry, be happy.” 
Donald Tusk has just said what anybody who has a modicum of sense knew already and has been saying all along.“Chequers will not work”It’s very simple stay in SM & CU or crash out with No Deal Brexit & crash the economy. Scotland we need to be prepared to get tae fae the UK 
Great article by @HackneyAbbott on the need for a common sense, facts based approach to immigration policy now and post-Brexit: 
European Council President Donald Tusk says EU leaders agree Theresa May's Chequers plan for #Brexit "will not work" because "it risks undermining the single market"  
The problem is that you are NOT delivering the will of the people. Labour can't call a 2nd referendum. I know you sometimes get confused at PMQs and question Jeremy Corbyn, but you are (unfortunately) in charge and are getting nowhere with #Brexit negotiations after 2+ years. 
Germany's Merkel says there's a lot of work to do on Brexit by October  
.@eucopresident says he is more optimistic about positive outcome of Brexit than he was, but pretty much everything he has said seems dire for @theresa_may - especially in relation to her Chequers plan for the future trade relationship, which he says will not work 
All 27 EU leaders believe Theresa May's Brexit trade plan 'will not work’  
It's no surprise that one of the few EU leaders who stood with his own people against Brussels and their migrant crisis is also one of the few who truly gets Brexit. Bravo to Hungarian patriot Viktor Orbán! Support us at  
Get ready for a General Election, folks..@Theresa_May has failed & Brexit (or not!) is going to bring down the @CONservatives.As @BBCNormanS says: “seems the EU have just called Mrs May’s bluff”. She’s a crap negotiator and a crap businesswoman.Socialism is coming! 
One of the major mistakes political punditry is making in Westminster is confusing public opinion that says Brexit is going badly with wanting to stop it. 
The 'cheap food' policy is straight out of the Legatum institute & ERG stables & designed to placate UK consumers who will be hit with price rises elsewhere & allows FTAs with US & other lower gulatory standard countries. It's a disaster for Brexit backstop for NI & UK farmers!  
We held a people’s vote, it was the referendum in 2016. It is now a matter of trust in politicians that we should deliver on the will of the British people.That’s why I’m calling on Labour to rule out a second referendum and not take us back to square one.  
#BREAKING EU Council President Tusk: May's Brexit trade plan 'will not work'  
I know Remainers love listening to experts, so perhaps they should read this article from constitutional experts who say a second referendum is in practice not workable. It would take at least 6 months, and by then we will have (thankfully) left! 
“The moment of truth for #Brexit negotiations will be the October European council” - says European Council President Donald Tusk  
Dear @BBC_HaveYourSay,What on Earth is the @BBCNews report at 1pm all about?When the vast majority of Britons in Spain live in Madrid & Barcelona & Valencia, Why do you do a Brexit report on new arrivals in Torremolinos?WHY?@Suewilson91 @BBCChrisMorris

Support for #PeoplesVote on Brexit outcome is surging - with 45% now wanting a referendum (rising to 63% among Labour voters) versus 34% who do not, according to big ⁦@YouGov⁩ poll. Remain would win by 53% to 47% 
I'll be honest. The delusion of Tory Brexiteers makes me more hopeful that May's Brexit plan is rejected and it brings her down, leading us into another general election.Isn't that the most likely scenario now? 
Wrong. The oposition is given a privileged position in our system. It is granted exclusive resources and opportunities to put the government under pressure. Yet on Brexit, Corbyn's Labour has given the Tories everything they want, usually supporting them with a three line whip

"I've never pretended [Brexit] is a walk in the park," says David Davis. Here's what he wrote after the referendum.  
Those people who think Donald Trump will give us a good deal after Brexit haven't thought it through 1) Trump will be gone before the transitional period is over 2) He's a lying narcissistic bully3) We have all our global deals due to being an EU member4) We are small 
Let's not forget that EU27 countries hold 17% of UK bank deposits.... what happens to UK banking sector if they decide they don't want to leave over a trillion pounds in a 3rd country with a no deal Brexit? 
As Bolsonaro rises, it's chilling to watch Brazil's media & establishment generally replicate US/UK behavior during Brexit & Trump: 1) refuse self-critique about their role in spawning anger & 2) demonize all (rather than many) supporters as troglodytes with no valid grievances:

May must show she doesn't agree with her anti-Brexit Chancellor by sacking him  via @Telegraph 
Interesting. The only way to guarantee a second EU referendum now is by extending A50, say constitutional experts. That requires unanimity among the EU28 - so May could veto it (or Macron, as France wants us out too). 
Fox’s plan to throw British farmers & health under bus for US megacorps deal:“The UK trade secretary wants to use government powers to rewrite UK food standards in order to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with the Trump administration.”  
'Have you got your Brexit parachute on yet?' Adam Jezard's good read on the business's climate of the North East which voted heavily for Leave but there are signs of more disquiet now two years on & some regret as the hardBrexit reality sets in.  
A year ago, Spanish Guardia Civil raided 40 offices, arrested 14 senior officials and seized 10 million ballot papers in a bid to halt the Catalan Referendum. People responded with massive protests in BCN. Documentary + Q&A this Sat 22nd at Pearse Street Library. 2PM. Dublin #20S 
Austalian Low Tax Chloe got a vote in the referendum. 5 million people far more deeply affected didn't. If the referendum were treated as advisory and their views properly taken into account that wouldn't matter so much. But that is not the case. An unjust gerrymandered #Brexit.

A 21 month 'transition period' is not Brexit. If Gov't can't negotiate the UK's exit from the EU in 2 years and 9 months, it doesn't prove they need more time, it proves they're not up to the job. 
EU leaders 'unanimously' want a second Brexit referendum, says Maltese PM 
After Brexit your car keys won't work.Why are they keeping this secret? 
I think we need to accept that the UK won’t even be operating under WTO rules after Brexit, it’ll be straight up WTF rules 
The EU want the UK to have another referendum in the hope we will change our mindsDon't they realise we are not Denmark, France or IrelandHave they not noticed how foreign interference in #Brexit backfiresWe have made up our minds and we are leaving

Q. Can we leave the EU without it harming the UK, and those residing in it? A. No.On this basis alone, especially given the FACT the ref was ADVISORY, #Brexit should NOT be pursued, until such time, if EVER, it can be undertaken WITHOUT harm whatsoever. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay 
openDemocracy A pretty good summary of the LAB approach to Brexit. 
May is totally on the hook when it comes to the #Brexit negotiations.   She would be DELIGHTED if Labour backs a 2nd vote (#peoplesvote) in advance of the deal being presented - she'd claim Labour's undermined Britain's negotiating position, an act of treachery, betrayed voters

Agreed mate, but I really wouldn't try to reason with a muppet - the hilarity of him saying "Brexit is better than remaining if they had easy to read figures..." amazes me. Would love to know where these figures that the Brexiteers voted on the basis of were in 2016

Lib Dem leader @willie_rennie urges @NicolaSturgeon to back another EU referendum - but the First Minister says a so-called 'people's vote' offers Scotland no guarantees. #fmqs

60% of the population is "bored" with brexit.And out of 8.3M 15-24 year olds ( the age group of the vast of majority of rioters ) ony 300,000 voted for Leave.Brexit-borne economic collapse will lead to far worse civil disrorder than a few petulant gammons ever will. 
Quite right, and the term “enemy of the UK” will also include the Conservative Party if they fail to properly execute the Brexit they were instructed to by the people, or if they seek another referendum.

If we go ahead with Brexit, how many years it will take to eradicate the stain of corruption, deceit and the humiliation from British history and from the despicable and shameless Tory party. Will it depend on the extent and duration of the damage that Brexit inflicts? 
"The referendum wasn't about GDP."So there you have it. Straight from the horse's mouth. You've all been conned you absolute gammon dickheads.  
Nicola Sturgeon has called for Brexit to be delayed beyond next March if the UK has not secured an agreementSeems sensible but will almost certainly not be considered by the UK gov. Meaning Indyref has to be March 2019 for the people of Scotland to decide our future post Brexit

Or we could just let everyone have a voice now? 16-17-year-olds included. Given that 2018 Brexit looks nothing like 2016 Brexit, surely people should be able to have their say on whether this Brexit is good enough for their futures? 
#politicslive Great to have Andrew Neil back today. Best political interviewer on TV. Sticks boot into all of them. Had all the Remoaner bores out this week. Now we’ve got that idiot on Alastair Campbell. 1/100 slagging off Brexit & Donald Trump. And talking about People’s Vote.  
Your question is not well posed because "consistent with the referendum result" is meaningless. e.g. I might assert that it would be consistent to leave the EU but remain in THE customs union. Further, I assert your interpretation (Chequers) is motivated by Party management. 
"Its a serious demolition of Britain's world stature, it's a loss of power, it's a removal of Britain from the top table". #Brexit #FinalSay 
The paradox of Brexit voters: Amputating a foot in the belief that shoes will be half price. 
I'm not ignoring anyone. The government's Brexit deal will look nothing like the fantasy a small majority voted for in 2016. People deserve the chance to accept or reject it.This will be the first democratic vote on the reality of Brexit. What are you so afraid of?  
EXCLUSIVE: Writing for ANM as part of her party's 'Brexit Month', the leader of @ForBritainParty Anne Marie Waters explains why even leaving the EU may not be enough by itself. The whole establishment needs bringing down. 
The paradox of Brexit voters being put at risk of losing their jobs because they voted to leave the EU as they thought that the EU was to blame for putting them at risk of losing their jobs. 
EU diplomat tell me there are "good cops and bad cops" on Brexit among EU leaders in Salzburg.When asked which country was the worst cop, the diplomat said without hesitation, "France. ...But also Germany.They have worked very closely together on this. " 
Brilliant Nigel. When will the #FBPE brigade & @BBCNews & @SkyNews actually understand and accept and even discuss JUST FOR ONCE that Brexit is about politics and not economics? 
Its normal practice in the EU to have referendum after referendum till they get the answer Germany wants, don't kid yourself anything else. 
OK, this is priceless. Was doing some research for a piece on Corbynites, Labour and Brexit. And I came across this. First video was published on the 23rd May, 2016    Second video was published 17 days later on 9th June, 2016. 
Lord Heseltine: We extend #Article50 & reopen negotiations with Europe on the issue they're going to have to discuss.. whether we are in or out.. which is immigration & if we can find a solution to this then the whole momentum for #brexit is undercut.. then hold a #PeoplesVote. 
Czech PM now vocal in his call for the United Kingdom to hold yet another referendum on our membership, arguing the case that the EU is financially doomed and we need to 'solve problems'. Probably not the best strategy or will it strengthen his case but brutally honest.

Sigh...two years on and still this rubbish. The EU operates as a trading bloc. In a worst no-deal #Brexit scenario the bloc loses trade with 1 country the UK. The UK loses trade with bloc of 27 countries.  How is it "more a problem" for EU? #notrocketscience

WATCH: Life doesn't always turn out how you thought. It's ok to change your mind. If #Brexit isn't turning out the way you thought, maybe it's time to think again. It's time for a #PeoplesVote 
We had the people’s vote in 2016. A second referendum would need a different name. The hypocrite’s vote? The cheat’s vote? The crybaby’s vote?  
The most undemocratic plot I can ever recall. A cynical stitch-up between UK fanatical Remainers and overseas governments: "Offer the Brits a terrible deal and then make them have a 2nd referendum on accepting it or staying in the EU." Quite outrageous.  
I feel really strongly that supporting Orban is the moral degradation of Brexit  
Holding a second referendum would only encourage EU leaders like Muscat and Babis to give us a bad deal. It is wrong of them to try to interfere in the democratic decisions of this country.  
The people steering Brexit don’t care about the people that voted leave. They care about their bank balances. 
“Politicians have gone from ignoring women in the brexit debate to doing something much more sinister. They are expecting women to pay for it” - @SophieRunning  at @UKandEU event on #brexitgender

The Conservative party & Nigel Farage voted with Orban on the European Parliament last week. Utterly shameful. My column in this week’s @TheNewEuropean is on the collapse of morality in British foreign policy because of Brexit  
These same Henry 8th powers can be used against us @The3Million citizens if no deal Brexit.Unacceptable. We need lifelong guarantees, monitoring and oversight that can only come from international treaties.UK govt and home office promises are worthless, look at their record. 
Apologies for banging on, but in case you missed it here’s why I think there should be a referendum on the final Brexit deal.  
Talk of EU leaders wanting second #Brexit referendum is somewhat of a red herring. They’ve never hidden fact that wish U.K. would change its mind but they do not believe it’s likely. Not something they’re actively planning for 
Brexit is built on sand. It’s an insult to our country and our constitution to do it this way. If do it we must. And now it is unpopular as well. @UKEUchallenge 
Hey Tim Martin - instead of blathering on about the wonders of #Brexit, how about recognising unions at Wetherspoons and paying its staff a living wage? 
The people didn’t decide to do brexit. Our parliament don’t either. It was just @theresa_may on her own.  With not impact assessments. No plan. And no more formality than running a bath. Total. Total. Joke. 
Liam Fox is plotting to scrap EU food standards in order to win a Trade deal with Trump. Who cares about food safety when Liam's got all his US chums to keep happy! Maybe Boris can draw you a Transatlantic Bridge Liam! #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
It’s ludicrous that this one woman:A) personally decided as an executive act to leave the EUB) recast advisory referendum as mandatoryC) purported to trigger A50 with the knowledge it was a criminally tainted referendumD) had no impact assessments for her decision  
Who are these people telling us we should have a second referendum? Their nations rely on the EU to fill their begging bowls. They are desperate for the UK not to leave because of the hole it will leave in the budget. They should mind their own business.   
The government keep saying its in ‘negotiations’. But its not a negotiation. The EU have no need to negotiate. There are procedures & conditions on Brexit that the UK must adhere to. Yet, after 2 years, the government still don’t understand this. That’s why they are floundering. 
@MetroUK @KimSJ “I regularly come across people who say “I thought it was done and dusted” and I think the BBC is contributing to that and it worries me,’ he said. ‘The BBC saying “when” and not “if” makes Brexit sound like an unstoppable juggernaut.“  
EU leaders call for UK public to have final say on Brexit outcome with new referendum  
Happy Birthday to me!That would be my #birthdaycake #birthdaygirl #Brexit  
Liam Fox believes "we are on course to negotiate with the US for an FTA and that will require compromise,".Why, Mr Fox, do Brexiteers find it acceptable to compromise with the US but not with the EU?Conclusion: #Brexit is NOT about Taking Back Control. 
Brexit should be delayed beyond next March if the UK has not secured a detailed agreement with the EU by then says Nicola Sturgeon. 
What does Brexit mean to you? This is what it means to me...  
Brexiter hostility to a #PeoplesVote proves that they are sure they would lose, and that they know they are forcing #Brexit through against the will of the majority. How is that democratic! 
⁦@Andrew_Adonis⁩ on Bloomberg TV ⁦@Brexit⁩ ‘A 2nd referendum is likely to see a huge majority for Remain because the young are increasingly engaged. They have the most to lose & are pro-EU in the main’ #PeoplesVote 
EU leaders keep up pressure on May to take Brexit deal  
At these crucial times we need those Brexiteers in Cabinet to show leadership on #Brexit just like Boris Johnson & David Davis have demonstrated. We know that certain Cabinet Brexiteers want to be PM (Male & Female). Staying silent on #Chequers would certainly not win our support 
This from @JolyonMaugham contains some alarming insights into the DUP's use of dark money during the referendum campaign. Very worth reading.  
So the Czech and Maltese prime ministers publicly call for a second Brexit referendum. Not surprising, it’s the EU establishment’s default. Time and again European electorates voted against EU plans but have been ignored. Well that’s not the British tradition of democracy. Bye.  
You are in power with a majority. Bleating on about @UKLabour fools nobody. Brexit and all its ruinous mess belongs to your party. 
Calls for a 2nd referendum in the UK very familiar to Irish people.  The EU's idea of democracy is to either ignore result or force countries to vote again. 
Labour would take us back to square one on Brexit by backing a second referendum and postponing the exit day.Our plan means we will be leaving the EU on 29 March 2019.See the details:  
To say that 17 million people voted for Brexit is to credit those 17 million with supernatural precognitive powers, plus a total disregard for their own welfare.You're saying they knew it would be this difficult, this risky, this damaging to the UK, but still voted for it? 
Many Remainers seem to think that unless someone is a strong Remainer, they likely support Brexit (like Corbyn). That is bonkers. The world isn't black or white. Remainers have polarised themselves like many Corbyn supporters. Lots of grey inbetween. 
Not sure that the sight of EU leaders lining up to support a second referendum is all that helpful to the People’s Vote campaign. 
Concerns about Scotland‘s place in Europe are shared by many in Austria during their presidency of EU. It’s well understood that Scotland voted by 62% to remain. #eu2018at #scotland #brexit   
David Allen Green: One day a historian will offer explanations for how Brexit happened. Future generations, on the other hand, will perhaps wonder if we were out of our minds.

Summary:1. Ten EU diplomats have all asked me the same thing:2. "Why hasn't Brexit been reversed yet?"3. After all, up till now every referendum about the EU that's given the wrong result has been overturned.4. Talk about Our EU-style democracy at work!5. That's all, folks!  
Astonished (or possibly not) by the endless nonsense being spouted about Brexit/Chequers etc. The facts are simple - we don’t know what the final offer will be, and when we do we will need to compare them with the alternatives, no deal, 2nd ref, etc. And then we will vote. 
So the billionaire Czech PM and Maltese PM - both mired in corruption scandals - decide to lecture the UK that we need a second referendum so we can help clean up the EU's own problems? That will go down well  
Now up to Labour, come off the fence: People's Vote says 'multiple opportunities' for Brexit referendum - BBC News

About to appear on @Brexit to discuss last night’s further disintegration of Mrs May at Salzburg, paving way for a people’s vote 
If Labour had a ‘normal Leader’ it’s quite possible that Tory rebels would actually bring down their own Gov to stop Brexit. Corbyn is such a wild card that he keeps this in place both with the ERG and the rebels.They will vote for any deal rather than risk him. 
Brexit road movie today - we start at sunrise in stunning N Berwick. Gannets, Bass Rock, Isle of  erm....May! And one of the highest remain votes in UK. Come say hello and have your say as we head south!  
Never thought I'd say this, but Theresa May gave me hope today in Salzburg.She said there will definitely be no second referendum or #PeoplesVote. I think we know what that means... 
.@malorieblackman is publishing a fifth book in her Noughts & Crosses series, inspired by Brexit, Trump and the rise of the far-right in Europe:  
Found this short video demonstrating how a ‘no deal Brexit’ would pan out. pic.twitter.com/wcnkX4XIx5 
A ‘blind’ Brexit with little or no detail on terms of future EU/UK relationship would be no more acceptable than a ‘no deal’ Brexit. If that’s the choice, Article 50 should be extended to allow all alternative options for Scotland and UK to be considered.  
It’s Thursday.Good morning, @theresa_may To use your own words:No British prime minister could accept the damage #Brexit is inflicting on the country.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote 
Britain is 85-90 percent of the way to agreeing Brexit deal: UK minister  
NEW: EU leaders are 'almost unanimous' in wanting a second Brexit referendum says Malta's Joseph Muscat  
.@NicolaSturgeon has today said that the PM and the rest of the UK political establishment need “an urgent reality check,” warning that the Brexit process was heading toward a choice between two “completely unacceptable” scenarios – a no-deal Brexit or a ‘blind Brexit’. 
So tonight on @BBCNewsnight Brexit, Railways...... and @jed_mercurio on #Bodyguard that’s JEDMERCURIO .... who wrote one of my favourite books Ascent but somehow I don’t think we’ll be talking about that tonight! 
Remember John Major's confidence motion to ram Maastricht through the Commons (1993). Could this happen with the PM's (probable) #Brexit "deal", however unpalatable?  
Exclusive: Liam Fox is plotting to use Henry VIII powers in order to scrap EU food standards and win a Brexit trade deal with Trump.

John Redwood looking distinctly uneasy and getting very shouty when a haulier takes him to task on customs checks post Brexit.  
European Union leaders will hold their first serious discussions on Brexit since March at a Thursday summit in Austria  
Just realised the government’s entire Brexit strategy is that scene from Fight Club where he beats the shit out of himself and hopes that from the outside it looks like the other guy did it 
Please share this message from @campbellclaret about why now is the time  to support The New European in the fight against Brexit. More details  here:   
I am not a "remain trope". I am a concerned person who has to go to a meeting later and explain how Brexit and Brexit uncertainty is killing our housing proposals 
My 8 and 12-year-old son and daughter were not allowed to vote in 2016. 100% of them want to Leave the EU. To ignore these young voices, who have the most to GAIN from Brexit, would be nothing less than a betrayal.#GoBrexit 
Watch this & if you have a dog, lead them down to London & take them for a walk to call for a #wooferendum on #brexit on 7 October. You would be barking mad not too if you can. UK can be saved & we can retreive'er from a damaging brexit#4dogpuns 
#Brexit: one Ireland tomorrow ? Front page of Liberation today  
Looking forward to debating this with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and @afneil later. This seems much better than the original draft that we were told was going to transform the Brexit debate #politicslive 
The irony of @NicolaSturgeon chiding the UK Gov for the lack of a detailed plan for Brexit (which I voted against BTW) in the light of her own White Paper in 2014 which was a tissue of lies, spin and obfuscation is literally off the scale.Only the real cult believe her now. 
Priti PatelRemoaners “are not on the side of the British people and they do not believe in BritainThey don’t trust you and they don’t like the way you votedTheir aim is simple. To reverse the result of the referendum and put Brussels back in charge" 
Given that the Brexit vote was largely driven by our country being so London-centric, maybe Chris Grayling should focus on rail links across the North and within Wales to support thriving independent Welsh and Northern economies. Rather than an HS2 to london...  
Who can argue with Mike Penning's rationale?PM loyalist Sir Mike Penning declares Chequers Brexit proposal is 'dead as a dodo'  
Mrs May last night in Salzburg ...."This is my Brexit plan !Remainers don't believe in itLeavers don't believe in itMy party doesn't believe in itThe public don't believe in itI know you don't believe in it and to be honest, neither do I, deep downBut PLEASE accept it !" 
I’ve just had a discussion with Corbyn & woken up all agitated. He’s making no concessions on Brexit & is very annoyed that the issue as he calls it won’t go away. But it’s clear all the noise about Brexit is getting to him. So let’s be huge & loud in Liverpool.Stop Brexit.#FBPE 
I did not see anything about a "deal" in our referendum paper. It stated Leave or remain. If the EU wants a "deal", let them come to London and ask for one.  
Brexit.  
Britain is willing to walk away without a deal, Theresa May warns EU leaders in Salzburg: Brexit News for Thursday 20th September

If you’re a public health campaigner or civil servant working on Brexit, we’ve just launched a guide to using the #publichealth duty to #DoNoHarm as part of our #Brexit campaign so pls read & share it to help protect the public’s health as we leave the EU  
The jokes been made before about Grayling but bears repeating - if he was in charge of Brexit we’d be using the Euro by Christmas  
A chaotic mess that caused endless misery for millions, pushed through by incompetents despite repeated warnings of what would happen. That's the railway fisaco. In a few months' time Chris Grayling will be refusing to take any responsibility for #Brexit.#PeoplesVote 
Have to be very dubious about UK brexit proposals on customs duties collection and management for EU. This govt cannot even manage to re-design a train timetable. Nearly 250000 companies trade with EU only so this is really important for them ... 
Watch how EU Commission President Juncker replies when asked how close negotiators are to a Brexit deal  
Malta Prime Minister @JosephMuscat_JM tells @Marthakearney in Salzburg that EU leaders almost unanimously think: "We would like the almost impossible to happen... that the UK has another referendum" #r4today 
'We genuinely believe Theresa May may not have a majority in Westminster'  - Tom Watson says Labour will not rule out a second referendum on Brexit. For more news, head here:  
Quite agree. We don’t NEED a vote to stop Brexit, May could do it today by withdrawing Art50, but it will only heal us all if saving country is done by the people. @peoplesvote_uk @bbclaurak 
#ChequersPlan #MayMustGo#quote"A senior member of TMay’s govt has threatened 'pro-Brexit' MPs, saying that unless the PM’s plan for a 'soft' exit from the bloc is supported in Parliament, there will be a second referendum."Final straw. Time she was gone. 
Foreign leaders now meddling in British politics, telling British voters to try get the correct answer at another vote. Terrible look for the second referendum campaigners who have spent months trying to pretend that’s not their message. 
Prime Minister of the Czech Republic Andrej Babiš is "very unhappy" that the UK is leaving the EU and there should be another referendum, he tells @marthakearney in Salzburg  #r4today 
MAY: EU agreement by November or No Deal. “Delaying or extending these negotiations is not an option” “No second referendum in the UK”“The UK will leave on 29th March next year” 
#SalzburgSummit18 Theresa Maybe  making mess Brexit negotiations with EU. Hopeless  no backbone. Spends all day waving the white flag to the EU. How did she ever become PM. Time to get tough with EU. Theresa May does for politics. What Giant Haystacks did for Trampolining.  
Radio 4 in full Second Referendum promotion mode his morning. You idiots: of COURSE EU leaders want another vote. It’s how they operate.  
What is Theresa May's Chequers plan? Here are the key points from the deal published by the government in July #Brexit 
There are people out there who genuinely believe Chris Evans has named his twins Ping and Pong. This is how Brexit happened. 
The extreme right wing of the Tory party are pushing the country towards a no deal. That is one of many reasons why we need a general election. The country has been decimated by Tory rule & will be further decimated by a Tory no deal Brexit. We need a LAB government now!#JC4PM 
Summary:1. What is Brexit doing to Our Mental Health?2. It's driving us mad, that's what.3. Which is - literally - crazy.4. After all, people didn't vote to become madder.5. Luckily, it's easy to spot the main sign of madness:6. It's Our #FBPE Hashtag.7. That's all, folks! 
Well said Molly. The BBC has sadly become the British Brexit Corporation with a discernible pro Brexit bias across all its flagship news programmes. Tragic and unforgiveable. The BBC is not intended as a spokesperson for HMG hard Brexit policy. 
Looking forward to listening @BBCr4today from @JosephMuscat_JM PM of Malta who leads a population of less than 0.5m people why he thinks a referendum in another country which 33.5m people voted and 17.4m voted to Leave should be held again 
'Cut those tariffs, forget Chequers' Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin has some advice for the PM on #Brexit  
Nick Clegg seems to behave as though the referendum never happened, so it's hardly surprising he can't bring himself to admit what he said at the time...  
As a Remain voter, I demand that Chris Grayling is immediately put in sole charge of Brexit. 
Chequers “will need to be reworked and further negotiated” @donaldtusk If by reworked you mean turned into a Canada+ FTA, then yes we agree DonaldChequers is less popular than the Poll Tax, doesn’t deliver Brexit & is a very bad deal#StandUp4Brexit 
Who’s to blame? Rail chaos, Brexit, Child Poverty, Wages lower than 10 years ago, Windrush, NHS collapsed as the richest wealth doubles, I’ll give you a clue it starts with a T and ends in ories  
Putin told Trump the 'deep state' was trying to undermine him. Most rational people would agree the 'deep state' in Trump's case is the constitution - the rule of law. Britain has no Mueller, no real investigation of the Putin's Brexit interference.

'Seven in 10' EU workers in UK would be barred under Brexit proposals  
A new force emerges. Renew are delighted to announce an alliance with @AdvanceRBKC spearheaded by experienced grassroots campaigner @AnnabelMullin. Renew will continue to reject Brexit to revitalise politics in this country. Read more here:  #RenewParty 
Former ally attacks PM's #Brexit strategy “Does she really want to go down in history as the Prime Minister who gave us a Chequers deal that no one in her own party wanted, with Jeremy Corbyn’s help?”Frankly, the answer to that is clearly yes 
Nicola Sturgeon: PM must delay Brexit beyond March next year if there is not a detailed agreement on future trading arrangements. Taking the UK off the "Brexit cliff edge" without an agreement "would be the most irresponsible thing any PM has done in a very, very long time".Yes! 
Theresa May tells EU27 she won't delay #Brexit despite lack of a dealTypical pig headed May approach. In any negotiation, if you need more time you take more time, instead of rushing to an arbitrary deadline. Page 1 of Negotiating for Dummies  
.@bbclaurak Can you please stop spreading the myth that the EU forces second referendum on member states? You know that’s constitutionally impossible, tabloid nonsense that we don’t expect to hear from @BBCPolitics If British people want a #PeoplesVote we can choose to have one

You must feel pretty foolish if you actually thought the NHS was going to be £350 million a week better off. Right-wingers are publicly plotting to open up the NHS to US firms after Brexit.  
Yesterday, in a classic of corporate capture, we saw right-wing thinktanks launch their blueprint for our trading relationship after #Brexit, simultaneously in UK and USRead more about the Anglo-American nightmare of this #BrexitSyndicate and please RT 
Absolutely ridiculous the Maltese and Czech PMs said in Salzburg that they want the UK to have another #Brexit referendum and change our minds. About time the EU learnt to accept democracy, instead of repeatedly telling countries to vote again when they make the "wrong" decision. 
Ian Paisley REMAINS an MP after WINNING petition demanding he face by-election.Good news for #Brexit.    
When the full criminality of Trump, Brexit and Putin's interference is finally exposed, both Britain and the US will have to do a root and branch inquiry and analysis about how we became so vulnerable to this kind of corruption and malice. 
The Today programme leads on TWO EU leaders wanting Britain to reconsider #Brexit. I’d be surprised if any didn’t want us to reconsider. 
Are you really this dense @theresa_may look at the polls. We don't want Brexit! Prove that the people back your daft proposal #peoplesvote If you force through Brexit on this basis there is going to be hell to pay. Have you stopped to think what people will do? They won't accept 
I can offer that now: A man who once shagged a dead pig’s mouth wanted to resolve Tory infighting with a referendum.So another man who once described black people as piccaninnies got himself a red bus to spread lies. Then a robot took over and proclaimed Brexit means Brexit.  
Today, a year ago, I was on my way to a work meeting when I heard on the radio that members of the Catalan government were been arrested for organizing the October 1st referendum (to be celebrated, then)  
The far-right of the Tory party are publicly plotting to open up the NHS to competition from US firms after Brexit. The policy is included in a report launched by Boris Johnson. Many people voted for Brexit to save the NHS - now we need to stop it to #SaveTheNHS #r4today 
Even more reasons to fight May's Chequers plan.  Read #Brexit summary here:  
In the two years since the Brexit referendum, the European Union has maintained its original position: no market access for the United Kingdom unless it accepts all relevant rules and judicial oversight.  
Man loses an eye to #GuardiaCivil rubber bullet during #1oct referendum. He is then prosecuted, not the Guardia Civil. This possible in countries like China, Venezuela, Russia and, yes, Spain. What do you think of this @amnesty? #Catalonia

Radio 4 reports that the Maltese and Czech PMs are telling the UK to have another referendum and change our minds on Brexit. EU has form for telling countries to vote again when they make the 'wrong' decision. But I can only see such interventions stiffening the British resolve. 
No-deal Brexit to fuel £1,500 rise in cost of EU car in UK, says motor trade  
I hate to diss colleagues, but there's a difference between the responsibilities and horizons of journalists - zero and short - and those of serious policy makers. Brexit is a hacks' coup led by commentators Gove and Johnson who now cannot even write their way out of this mess.

I would vote for Corbyn to become Prime Minister if the Conservative government failed to take the country out of the EU or held a second referendum. Many others would do the same.  
We are supposed to believe If there’s no deal on Brexit it’s not the fault of our inept government or our dire PM it’s the fault of the EU....I suppose it makes a change for her not to blame Jeremy Corbyn.

The FT headline is ‘Inflation defies forecasts...’ It should remember that the next time it gives us more drivel from the Treasury or the BoE about what will happen during the first fifteen years of Brexit.

And the actually worst thing about Brexit? The acceptance that 52-48 is a mandate for life/economy changing decisions. This is not democracy. It's a split decision, a hung Parliament, a 'we're not really sure' vote. And we've let the extremists round 52 up to 100 per cent. Mad 
And what about the 3 millions EU citizens living in this country who would be a hell of a lot more affected by the Brexit vote, arguably more so than Brits? If we're really to base our democracy on the extent to which one is affected, then Brexit certainly wouldn't be happening!

No-deal Brexit must be ruled out to save motor industry, warns SMMT  
A senior government source has told Reuters Theresa May was set to appeal directly to European leaders at a summit in Salzburg to drop "unacceptable" Brexit demands 
Brexit"Should we leave the plane?" "Yes" "Ok we'll leave the plane now" "Wait. We're at 30k feet. What's the plan to get us off safely?" "Getting off means getting off" "What does that mean?" "We're negotiating parachutes but it may be a no-parachute deal" 
But which ignores the political and constitutional repercussions of going back on your previous commitment to respect the outcome of the first referendum and which is grossly naive about the EU’s willingness to accommodate more British fecklessness.  
May urges fellow EU leaders to drop 'unacceptable' Brexit demands

Unless you stop backing the Tory Brexit madness, there will be no economy to rebuild. All the sloganeering and best wishes in the world will not and cannot rescue Britain from the disaster you and the Tories are guiding it toward. 
When the idea of a second referendum was mooted during tonight’s Cross Questions, Brexiteer MP John Redwood certainly wasn’t shy in making his views known…  
How frustrating is it to listen to the British prime minister, leader of a party which received less than 4000 votes in the north in 2017, purporting to represent the best interests of Irish ppl in #Brexit talksTeresa, your party has created a disaster for Ireland#Endpartition 
David Allen Green: One day a historian will offer explanations for how Brexit happened. Future generations, on the other hand, will perhaps wonder if we were out of our minds.  
Brexit: 'We're no closer to withdrawal agreement says Varadkar  
Seeing a lot of scaremongering about US carving up NHS post Brexit:1. Tories/Lib dems/Tory B team been doing this since early nineties.2. EU could do this in future via TTIP/CETA.The only way to guarantee stopping this happening in future is a Corbyn lead Labour government. 
B-b-b-but he said there wouldn’t be any flights after Brexit!!!  
I wouldn’t dream of drawing attention to potential difficulties for Marcus Fysh MP of the type below I’m still waiting for him to explain why he said we’d stay in the single market before the referendum only to volte face (& delete his tweets) afterStill, I’m happy to wait   
Won't somebody please think of the children!This house is in the Republic of Ireland, the trampoline & swings are in the United Kingdom. In 191 days these kids will have to leave the European Union to play !#Bonkers #Brexit #Irishborder @BorderIrish 
Rumours that Cadburys are going to cease production of the Ripple bar because of Brexit fears hitting demand are untrue. More flake news. 
It really pisses me off that I find so much that @jeremycorbyn says true - except whenever the subject is Brexit.I cannot support Labour while Corbyn still props up the Tory Brexit shambles.  
The body of EU law, essentially created by its government - the EU Commission, called the Acquis, is 187,000 pages long. And growing! This is what May wants Britain to be shackled to under #Chequers, with her slyly named 'Common Rulebook'. Doesn't look like #Brexit, does it?  
About to go on @LBC to call for people’s vote instead of Dominic Raab’s extremist Brexit 
Despite Brexit.  
The rising star of the @LibDems is none other than @LaylaMoran A voice of reason and tolerance as all around British politics stumbles into extremism.An opponent of #Brexit who deserves our support. 
It is beginning to look like Theresa May is the only person in UK currently claiming there couldn’t be a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay referendum, but then we must remember her track record of saying there wouldn’t be an early general election. We need an #ExitFromBrexit 
One of the tragedies of post Referendum Brexit history is that the DUP via its hold on HMG and in its intransigence and non inclusive ultrasectarian policies is the perfect storm to deliver the hardest UK wide Brexit or even no deal & in so doing accelerate the chances of a UI.  
Lots of people have defined themselves, or perhaps allowed themselves to be defined, as Brexit voters.They know all the arguments against it, but a Brexit voter is what they are, so they have to stay true to themselves.One day they will see Brexit like ex-smokers see smoking. 
Mel Stride, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, has warned that if Chequers is not accepted, the alternative is a second referendum or remaining in the EU. Please. Even May has ruled out a second referendum and we voted democratically to leave the EU. Who does he think he is? 
A Treasury minister has suggested there is a possibility of a second EU referendum if Theresa May's Chequers proposals are rejected by the House of Commons  
Wednesday evening prep for tomorrow’s Brexit Committee meeting - on the agenda is the @allianceparty motion that @NualaMcAllister & I tabled calling for the support of a #peoplesvote, we strongly support the electorate having a say on the final deal - this impacts all of us. 
Ireland's Brexit backstop, and why it matters  
Germany's Merkel hopes for respectful Brexit, close ties  
EU's Juncker says Brexit deal still 'far away'  
Slovenia PM: chance of autumn Brexit deal if Britain backs it  
I want to be clear too. People who support a second referendum are traitors to this nation who care nothing for its healing, only remaining in this European superstate. May’s a traitor too. She’s fooling no one.  
I wonder what the result of the Brexit referendum would have been if this important sentence had been printed in bold at the bottom of the voting sheets?BEFORE VOTING TO LEAVE, PLEASE CONSIDER THE BUNCH OF FUCKWITS WHO WILL HAVE TO DELIVER THIS FOR US. THANK YOU. 
Theresa May to get 10 minutes to deliver Brexit pitch to EU leaders#ChuckChequers 
Manchester #euflagmafia in action. A 'flag wave. A few mates, flags or banner, motorway. Hundreds of hoots of support. #brexitisitworthit #fbpe there's no support for Brexit here.  
Brexit progress elusive as sides ask each other for help  
Irish PM says no progress in Brexit talks on border issue  
Thank goodness rabid Brexiteers are in the minority at Stockport Council. The large majority of Councillors voted to support a People’s Vote as they know that Brexit will make people of Greater Manchester poorer. Syd’s clearly suffering from an overdose of Daily Mail or similar!  
Individual MPs have to be persuaded to make a stand if Parliament is to give people a #FinalSay on #Brexit. I can vouch for the fact that’s hard. But when our country is so divided on such a fundamental issue, the answer is more democracy, not less  
When Brexit is over, will we continue the network of followers?What will we talk about?I hope we can take advantage of the huge diversity of people, backgrounds and interests, and continue to support, learn from and amuse each otherSmall job first - stop Brexit! 
Many people are asking what the electoral systems referendum ballot looks like - here it is.  You can vote for #FPTP and against  Proportional Representation and be done.  No need to rank Pro Rep systems.  #BCPoli #NoBCProRep 
People like him give the younger generations a bad name. Myself and my sister are both early 20’s, both university educated and both voted for brexit. Going against a few statistics there  
These are the personal stories behind Brexit that we shouldn’t forget while legislating. Some of it is so sad. Sigh. Hope my Romanian constituents know how much I appreciate them.  
That’s a wrap in Dublin! Up next tomorrow we are in London at @LDNIrishCentre at 7pm Thursday 20th September. Help us make those with power listen and stop #Brexit #Borders Come on London we’re calling! 
Dear liberal-dems, forewarning I will still be writing to my French pen pal after Brexit, or are you going to sabotage the post as well? 
The fact Govt discussed this is a major recognition that, as I‘ve been saying for months, we need more time and to #SuspendA50. It‘s also vital to give people a #FinalSay on Brexit once we know what we’re getting. It’s a pity @DominicRaab dismissed this sensible approach 
Theresa May at #SalzburgSummit18 :“Please, please, don’t reject my Chequers #Brexit plan until after Conservative Party Conference - I’ll look really silly if you do” #bbcnews#CPC2018 
Treasury Minister Mel Stride has become the first government minister to admit that a #PeoplesVote is on the cards, if the prime minister’s #Brexit deal is rejected. 
Redwood and his mates should have got this scrutiny during the referendum. It’s a bit late now.The actual Port Of Dover modelled delays from 2-4 mins and got 17 mile tailbacks.Raab did not deny it could take 45 mins per truck.  
You can't stop can you @Nigel_Farage ? Here's what you were actually promising the voters at the time of the referendum, this is what they voted for. The truth is your promises were a pack of lies and the vote was criminally procured as exposed by the Electoral Commission.  
Thanks to the Austrian National Bank for hosting Brexit discussion at same time as Salzburg EU Summit. Major concern from the audience about risk to Scotland being taken out of EU after voting by 62% to remain. #Brexit #Scotland #eu2018at #SalzburgSummit18  
EU airports unable to cope with safety risks of 'no-deal' Brexit, leaked memo reveals  
The president of Ireland Miggledy Higgins just officially turned the yes result of the referendum into law. There’s still work to do to support our sisters in Northern Ireland - something UK pals can help by putting pressure on Theresa May. Well done @repealproject  
Brexit will not be delayed beyond March 29th 2019 even if there is no deal with the EU, Dominic Raab has told @IainDale  
Good discussion today at the #EPPSummit on #migrationEU & #Brexit. @sebastiankurz, the Austrian Presidency and @eucopresident are building bridges to achieve positive results. The #EPP is Europe’s driving force. #SalzburgSummit18 #BetterEurope 
The referendum wasn't about GDP, it was about leaving political union and becoming an independent country! That is the issue that neither the Conservatives nor Labour wishes to address.  
Should the criminals at Vote Leave who criminally cheated in the EU referendum... 
Why is Dominic Raab demanding ‘urgent clarification’ of Labour’s Brexit policy? Is he looking for tips? 
LISTEN: @DominicRaab takes a call from Joe from Abergavenny, Wales. He’s worried about young people’s futures. They’re losing sleep. How does The Brexit Secretary sleep? “Pretty well thanks.” Before saying hate crime rises weren’t to do with Brexit. #PeoplesVote#FFS 
This man lost an eye during Catalan referendum due to a rubber bullet shot by an unidentifiable Spanish police. Attack is recorded but Police doesn’t help the judges identifying the attacker. But there is more! Attorney opened an investigation on the victim.  
More than 800,000 people have signed our petition calling for a #FinalSay on Brexit. Add your name to the list today  
must have missed the referendum on scotland's right to exist.  
Will be disappointed if Sky don't find a Brexit blame angle on this..  
If the Tories had any sense they would arrange for a #PeoplesVote. It would leave Labour floundering & largely exempt the Tories from blame for what happens next. And it would be very hard for the Brextremists to successfully  oppose democratically consulting the public.#brexit 
Why are the Government being so tin-eared to the popular & workable FTA+ solution that delivers the Brexit we voted for?What promises have the government made to the EU, or automotive manufacturers for example, that prevents them from delivering real Brexit?#StandUp4Brexit 
It was great to talk to @IainDale this evening on his @LBC phone in. Enjoyed taking an hour of calls, explaining how we will make a success of Brexit.  
Rejection of Theresa May's Brexit plan could trigger second referendum, admits Treasury minister  
The Nazis used anti-Semitism as a cover to loot Jewish businesses and wealth.  The super rich architects of Brexit have used xenophobia to do the same to Britain. It really is that simple. 
Taoiseach: No progress in Brexit negotiations on Irish backstop  via @rte 
How many more people are going to reply to me that there can be another vote but not a Remain option. Absolute rubbish. Brexiteers sense that the tide has well and truly turned. Stop Brexit and the lies. #FBPE #PeoplesVote 
May's Brexit hopes rest on 10 mins after dinner in Salzburg>That will need to be some next level, crazy schmoozing skills hitherto unseen that TM will need to deploy in that 10 min meeting. You can NOT talk about running through cornfields etc #UpYourGame 
Join us tomorrow for a discussion about gender, equality and Brexit. Looking forward to a day full of meaningful conversations about one of the most important issues in politics today.  
Wow. Presumably Hammond instigated this. A Chancellor who has never respected the referendum result and conspired to undermine it from day one - with the tacit support of the PM in one of the most deceitful episodes in modern UK politics.  
May has ruled out the idea of a second Brexit vote, saying that the 2016 ref was ‘the people’s vote.’  a) People didn't get a say on the final Brexit deal in 2016, which is why we are campaigning for a #PeoplesVoteb) Didn't May also rule out a 2017 GE? 
Congratulations to everyone at People's Vote. I didn't think it could be done. A phenomenal achievement. Theresa May announces second referendum.  
"There has to a #Brexit debate on the conference floor, without doubt." Absolutely right.The energy and passion of grassroots Labour members has made it possible. At #LabourConference those members can convince the leadership to back a #PeoplesVote 
We don't elect a government and then refuse them the right to govern because a majority don't like the outcome Susanna, first we Leave and then after a sufficient time lapse you can then start campaign like UKIP did to have a referendum.  
4. The Kavanaugh nomination has become a referendum on a certain wing of the American aristocracy, whose entire raison d'etre is to be above democratic accountability. 
How can Theresa may claim the Chequers proposal will deliver what the British people voted for in the referendum? Every promise which was made has been broken and will not be delivered. In fact nothing tangible will be delivered for benefit of the nation! 
Bob Moran on Theresa May in Florence and Brexit negotiations – political cartoon gallery in Putney  
 @theresa_may on the prospect of a second referendum. Not a chance, essentially.  
Treasury Minister Mel Stride says rejection of the Chequers deal could lead to a #PeoplesVote and the UK staying in the EU.  A slip-up? A challenge to May? Or Tories testing the water for an escape from the #brexit imbroglio? 
This man died and travelled through time and saw all the young people who had their futures stolen by #Brexit. He returned from death to warn us we need a #PeoplesVote . 
Chuka now displaying worrying symptoms of “Lord Adonis Syndrome”. This is a terrible condition whereby apparently normal politicians who oppose Brexit become increasingly deranged & obsessive about it. So much so that they lose all sense of reality & talk total rubbish.  
EU airports unable to cope with safety risks of 'no-deal' Brexit, leaked memo reveals—At least 6 million passengers on UK-originating flights transferring in the continent would have to group through extra security and screening before their second journey

Why should Brexit make any difference to airline safety?  Exactly the same planes, pilots, airspace, airports etc will be operating after 29 March 2019 as will have been operating the day before. Sky’s relentless scaremongering on Brexit is causing millions to switch off.  
As a matter of interest @YouGov why don't you turn this round and ask ..."Would you like, post-Brexit, to take away your and your children's rights to live, work, study and retire visa-free in the rest of the continent ?"The results may be a tad different...

Tesco to open a new discount store chain called Jacks to compete with Aldi's and Lidl. It admits, however, should the UK #Brexit with no deal, the stores will be economically unviable. 
German MEP's aide caught coming out of No10 with Brexit notes on a 'general election' and and another 'public vote'. Sell out..  
The problem May faces is the stream of people who, since 24 June 2016, have told Brussels, EU embassies in UK & anyone else who will listen that there will be a 2nd referendum. Believe me I've heard it endlessly behind closed doors at diplomatic receptions 
I learn May loyalist Mike Penning savages Chequers plan in @telegraph interview, saying he will not be "blackmailed" into backing plan that betrays Brexit voters & cannot vote for it. Similar attack to that of Remainer @JustineGreening. May more and more isolated in her own party 
The Bank of England expected inflation to drop this month but it has gone up. If the Bank can’t forecast inflation month to month, why should we believe its forecasts on Brexit?

We need to stand up and protect the economic interests of NI. Real danger that rhetoric and opposition from UKG and DUP misses the opportunity for NI to gain some comparative advantage if Brexit proceeds - the best of both worlds.  
If the islands need more people then why not get them in from the UK rather than the EU?Of course the SNP want EU folk because they think they will vote for independence in any future referendum whereas the UK folk are more likely to vote status quo. 
May on arrival in Salzburg. “There will be no 2nd referendum”.  A message aimed at both Labour and her fellow EU leaders who may still be clinging to the hope. 
“A #brexit deal needs the UK to acknowledge the EU rules” says Malta PM @JosephMuscat_JM - “there is room for manoeuvre on the EU side as long as it doesn’t tamper with our rules. If the UK is asking that, that’s a big problem. That cannot happen.” @SkyNews

This is the end result of all the effort LeaveEU and Vote Leave put into conflating the UKs EU membership with the problems in the NHS, schools and our transport sector. They never fooled everyone, they didn't have to, they just needed to fool enough. 
The #Brexit challenge of @BorderIrish 'issue' re: trade is not just a simple choice to prioritise either GB/NI or NI/IRL flows of goods.Here's a rough diagram attempting to illustrate the complexity of the challenge re: post-Brexit movement of goods.In sum: It's not all UK/EU!  
Govt migration advisory committee wants ban on foreign workers earning less than £30k per yr and visas for EU workers after #Brexit. Hauliers, house builders and hospitality all united in opposition. Nobody voted for this self-harm. A people's vote must stop it #FBPE #Peoplesvote 
The relationship between the UK and the EU will change profoundly with Brexit, but I am determined that we should still have the strongest possible economic and security partnership.

Why would you feel the need to add those words? Is the plan that if Chequers fails Theresa May will go for a General Election and seek to win Remain votes by offering a referendum? /2 
Now we know the EU was lying about Ireland. Brussels whipped up fears about the Irish border to bash Brexit:  
The BBC and Sky News have always been bias towards Remoaners and Lefties but they are way over the top. Their dismissal of Brexit and their ignorance of the Leavers is intolerable, if i hear about the red bus one more time i will throw the tv through the fucking window Bollocks. 
At the moment we are protected from public asset fire sale trade deals because we are in the EU. After 29th March 2019, that protection will cease. Brexit means our NHS is at risk. Put that on a bus.  
Piers democracy means exactly the opposite. The only vote that ever stops debate is the one that elects a dictator. Leave leaders have failed to meet their campaign promises and in the light of that fact we’re entitled to change our minds. A 3rd referendum would be democratic  
I continue to find it unfathomable how many otherwise-respectable people, who wld certainly call repeating a vote without implementing the 1st decision akin to a coup in any other circumstance, seem to think ignoring a democratic vote fine & consequence-free in the case of Brexit

Rejection of Theresa May's #Brexit plan could trigger a #PeoplesVote, & stop Brexit altogether, admits Treasury minister.It's meant as a threat but millions will see it as a gleam of light at the end of a long, dark tunnel of complete insanity.

There is going to be such a shortage of customs agents post brexit that business will be simply told “ I’m sorry were to busy to take on any more work “ leaving them high and dry and unable to export their goods. There are approx 17 agents in the Dover area . 
Sky News used to be a great news source; impartial, incisive and entertaining. Now they wheel out Labour activists disguised as ordinary folk to spew inaccurate information and pump out quickly debunked anti-Brexit nonsense daily. Now a sham channel

If anything has politically vindicated Labour's non-position on Brexit (beyond not handing a gift to the vile right by promising to overturn the original vote) it's how pathetically rattled Raab has revealed himself to be.

“There is perhaps more hope, but there is surely less and less time.”European Council President Donald Tusk says there’s been a “positive evolution” in the UK’s approach to Brexit, but some areas still need to be “reworked and further negotiated.”  
Don't know about anyone else but I want to see @IanDunt, @jonlis1 and @JasonJHunter  on the telly debunking Brexit and showing up the politicians, who seem to be largely ignorant and happy to be so. 
The Labour party are not negotiating Brexit!! The only party responsible for it are the Tories. Dominic Raab needs to spend more time talking to the EU and sorting this mess out and less time playing party politics and sending letters to Keir Starmer about nonsense!!  
If Tory “Brexiteers” tolerate yet further dilutions the truth will dawn on 17m Brexit voters; Brexit is almost unrepresented in Parliament.  
Overall opinion on the @Plaid_Cymru stall at #Bangor Freshers Fair today is that #Brexit isn’t working and will never work for #Wales. Thanks to all who stopped by for a chat. #Bangor #PlaidCymru  
No-deal Brexit to fuel £1,500 rise in cost of EU car in UK, says motor trade  
Ireland's President formally repealed a constitutional amendment that banned abortion in the country, following a resounding referendum vote in favor of changing the law  
So whatever the damage, whatever we now know about the reality of Brexit you would deny the British people the right to change their mind? You have a very strange idea of democracy.  
If we vote on the Brexit deal in January, then there will have been more time between the two Brexit-related votes than between the last two general elections.We got to vote twice on that in the space of two years and general elections AREN'T EVEN PERMANENT! 
Regardless of your opinion this should be horrifying to watch. Both sides during the referendum saw abortion as a tragedy. So why is it seen as something to be giddy about here?  
In response a Labour source says it's "not calling for a second referendum" + "with only weeks of...negotiating time to go and no progress in sight people would expect Dominic Raab to be getting on with the job of negotiating...not wasting time writing letters to the opposition." 
Days since Brexit has actually been put into practice? Minus 6 months and counting...  
#Pope is to receive at his Santa Martha residence U2’s Bono this afternoon. He’s visiting the Vatican to express his support for Francis’ Scholas Occurrentes Foundation, a non-religious educational project. Bono and U2 supported Ireland’s recent referendum allowing abortion. 
German MEP’s aide caught coming out of No10 with Brexit notes on a ‘general election’ and and another ‘public vote’  
I stand up for freedom! I stand up for democracy! I stand up for Britain! I stand up for success!OK... sounds impressive. But after 20 years of advocating Brexit - where’s your plan? 
EU tells Theresa May to go back to Brexit drawing board  
You should implement the result and then try to over turn it. Stop being a bad loser, we should at least give Brexit a chance!  
Days between the 2015 and 2017 general elections: 763Days since the 2016 Brexit vote: 818  
"Trying to stop Brexit is anti-democratic" The only way Brexit stops is if it becomes the expressed democratic will of the people to stop Brexit.So either we fail and the will of the people remains intact, or we succeed and the will of the people remains intact. 
So basically we have 2 options!1. No deal and we leave the EU2. Deal & we remain in the EUHow about a referendum on replacing our MPs 
Philip Hammond said a no deal #Brexit will wipe out all the gains made from austerity, so according to the tories all the dead bodies have been worth it, my god folks we need to get these bastards out of power ASAP and #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #ToriesOut 
before the referendumI used to say stufflike: “pregnant women”when what I meant was: “pregnant people”so then I juststarted saying:Pregnant Peopleit really wasn’t difficultI stopped thinking about itand I wasn’t erased.I’m still here. 
RAAB ASKS STARMER: Will you respect the referendum vote?Will you rule out delaying Brexit?If you propose delaying Brexit, by how long?What would be your question in a second referendum?How and when would you legislate for a second referendum? 
Too late for that Donald, you opened the doors. Typical that you want to stop the 'blame game'. The voters decided that you had failed = Brexit, Sweden, Hungary, Poland, Italy and Austria. They want you to repatriate immigrants and close borders. Simple.  
This is why Data Scientists often quote that “causation != correlation” but here’s an interesting data point nonetheless #Brexit #Brisket 
POW: @DominicRaab demands Brexit clarity from Remoaning Labour. He’s not the only one. Labour’s opportunistic game-playing has been disgusting!  
Dear Mr Starmer, could you please let me have the details of your Brexit policy as they might be a bit more attractive than ours and I can nick a few bits. 
Groups all over the country are organising coaches to the March for the Future on 20 October, to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. There are currently over 40 departure points, with more being added every day.Find your nearest departure point at  
“#Brexit means Brexit”, apparently means:- Turning our back on the world’s largest trading bloc- Rise in business uncertainty - Fall in economic growth  The people also deserve a #FinalSay and the chance to #ExitFromBrexit. 
First JLR, now BMW talking of suspended car production due to #Brexit. Any Brexit deal has to pass scrutiny of Parliament. There is no appetite for current options  & so it will need to go back to the people. Why are Tory leavers so frightened of democracy? #Peoplesvote 
MAJOR BREAKING: A judge is investigating 13 Spanish riot police officers for their "disproportionate, indiscriminate and dangerous" actions during the 2017 Catalan referendum in a Barcelona polling station in which a man lost an eye after being shot with a rubber bullet. 
May refuses to consider #PeoplesVote. Says voters would feel betrayed by politicians. So the politicians who foisted on the nation a referendum won by lies, electoral fraud and promotion of bigotry which will make us poorer in any scenario walk away. Now that's real betrayal. 
#Brexit Latest: Dominic Raab writes to shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer seeking to clarify/embarrass Labour over its confusing party position:

Fine, so what happened to ALL the Project Fear forecasts, which SNP stoke daily, that economy would collapse because of vote for Brexit? You can't have it both ways.  
If you’re wiser, why are you still completely unable to answer basic questions about the economics of independence?Why, four years after the referendum, do you not even have a currency proposal that you’ll stand by? 
This is what Brexiteers have said all along. Surely this must blow #Chequers out of the water? After all, weren't we were told Chequers was drafted because the EU would't accept trusted trader/technological solutions? #Brexit  
Until my late teens, I was religious. I *knew* God existed.I knew all the arguments against - war, disease etc - but I bought the counter-argument that God is ineffable and moves in Mysterious Ways.The arguments for Brexit are exactly the same.No, thanks. Show me evidence.

If Britain wants a good Brexit deal, we should now go on all-out attack vs the EU. Make them realise we're quite happy walking away with 'No Deal' & trying our luck outside their flawed, bureaucratic machine. Play hardball @theresa_may- or we'll get completely screwed.

No, you argue it because you're a very obvious Remoaner who wants Brexit reversed.. just spit it out & own it.  
Shouts as ever to all of the wonderful trans and nb people who worked on the referendum. Where were all of these Brit headcases when RQR and pals were giving up weeks at a time to protect vulnerable people outside maternity hospitals?

“Every day that is left, we must use for talks” - says EU Council President Donald Tusk as he calls for a new #Brexit summit in mid-November  
Well done. Great call.  Can u help us stop Brexit first tho please? Thanks.  
We can’t shy away from the fact that Brexit is going to make everything a lot worse   
Today there is perhaps more hope but there is surely less and less time. On the Irish question and the framework for economic cooperation the UK’s proposal needs to be reworked. #Brexit

Brexit is about taking back the powers that our political class have so happily signed away. It is about restoring democratic control to the British people. What Lammy and the Parliamentary Remainers really fear is democracy: government of the people BY the people FOR the people. 
You know the people of Milton Keynes no longer want Brexit, @MarkLancasterMK & @iainastewart.You know the people who voted for you want a #PeoplesVote.We think you know which way you need to vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal. Don't be cow-ards.  
“If it made sense for parliament to ask the people for their view on the principle, it makes sense to give them a say on what Brexit would mean in practice” from John Kerr, the author of A50  
It wasn’t an election, it was a Referendum. Remain lost, END.  
With all this talk about EU citizens leaving the UK due to #Brexit and taking their taxes and expertise with them - you Brexiteers know we're taking our British partners and families with us so the skills and tax gap will probably double, right?  
Thing is though, if remainers had accepted the vote and spent the last 2 years influencing the brexit negotiations rather than being hell bent on trying to reverse it, we'd probably be in a much better position than we are now 
Extraordinary for an ERG MP to compare 'no-deal' Brexit to the US/Canada border, where there's been a free trade agreement since 1988 and the Auto Pact before that.  
A quick Brussels takeaway on Brexit that isn't widely reported - EU Member State diplomats baffled by what the UK actually wants in talks. Not because Chequers hasn't been sold, but because they keep getting different messages 1/ 
David Lammy sounds like a tool to Brits outside of London.Labour heartlands pushed through Brexit yet Lammy labels them as Far-Right. It doesn’t even make sense. Labour no longer speak for the working class they speak AT that them with sneering, condescending elitism.

RT if #brexit has become a source of personal embarrassment. 
In the two years since the Brexit referendum, the European Union has shown no signs of wavering from its original position: no market access for the United Kingdom unless it accepts all relevant rules and judicial oversight.  
The idea that the UK can leave the EU is nonsense. We can give up our membership and our major influence in the EU, but the economic superpower will still be next door, having a huge impact on our economy & domestic policies.So take back control #StopBrexit!#Brexit #FBPE 
John Redwood explaining no deal Brexit  
BREAKING: Brexit was about free trade, not EU protectionism. Love when Remainers demand single market access at all costs, but when it comes to trade deals with other countries it is a total disaster. Free. Trade. Benefits. Everyone.Inward looking Remainers...  
TB: The Brexit deal is too important to be fudged, the public should have the final say.

John has form on nonsense coming out of his mouth.....best ignore him, everyone else does. 
honestly this idea of just letting an illegal referendum result stand because you don't want to cause a fuss is the most British thing ever and i fucking hate it 
Rejection of Theresa May's Brexit plan could trigger second referendum, admits Treasury minister  
Young fools bang on about how all old people voted for Brexit - so how do they explain all these "old" folk who voted for Remain? Do you think the youngsters have been hoodwinked?  
Brexit offers a unique chance to leave the flawed EAW behind and establish a better system of judicial coorperation, with those nations whose standards of due process are demonstrably similar to our own. 
RETURN OF THE REFERENDUM  
Actually, we do. For better or worse, we have to implement the result of the Referendum - or British democracy is dead.  
The thinking that made England choose Brexit.  Next week - your roof leak? Why not return to the caves

Theresa May says that a #PeoplesVote would "destroy trust in politicians". No @theresa_may, a greedy elite forcing through a destructive #Brexit won by lies, law-breaking, foreign interference & hate propaganda, against the will of the majority will destroy trust in politicians

No 10 strategy; Warning to Remainers; don’t accept Chequers = No Deal. Warning to Brexiteers; don’t accept Chequers = risk Brexit. Not very subtle is it?  
"Michael Fabricant [hopes] Theresa May becomes “the new Boudica”, perhaps forgetting that the Celtic leader poisoned herself after her failed uprising"On bad history and #Brexit. Amusing and also serious. 
“Libdems only have 12 Mps and one MEP lol”“We need to be really worried about the rise of UKIP”These repeated notions by Labour leadership only maintain the idea we give into fascism and not talk up opposing Tory brexit. it’s frustrating and makes you a little complicit. 
'We are happy to bet on Britain!' US business boss dismisses Brexit fears  
As the prime minister takes her Chequers plan to Europe, former Brexit Secretary @DavidDavisMP says he warned Theresa May that the EU will take her to the cliff's edge:Listen to the full interview:  
Excellent article @S_Hammond “So my message to colleagues is clear: if you chuck Chequers or any negotiated settlement, Canada will not be the answer”. EFTA/EEA with a Customs Union has always been a responsible & achievable  #Brexit via @CityAM 
Treasury minister @MelJStride suggests there could be another referendum if the prime minister's Chequers proposals are rejected by the Commons:  
Definitely ignore anyone that has taken time to explore the complexities behind Brexit.   If they understand what 'ALL YOUR TREATIES CEASE' means then call them an idiot!   Yes.  Definitely do that.  
Minister hints at second referendum if Commons chucks Chequers  
Yes. But what is obvious is that since you took office violent crime in London has relentlessly spiralled out of control.  It needn’t have if you hadn’t wasted your time banning bikini models on tube adverts & campaigning against Brexit etc but had focussed on the day job.  
Brexit: May says second referendum would 'destroy trust in politicians' - Politics live

Brexit is all about selling the UK out to the US without having to ask the voters if that's what they wanted. Always was and always will be.  
Brexit paradox: if all these people don't mind being poorer and losing their jobs to get us out of the EU, why were they whining about EU citz "taking jobs" in the first place? 
UK real wages fell by 1.7% in the year following the Brexit vote, costing the average worker 4.4 days of earnings, a permanent pay cut, @DennisNovy #CEPBrexit @CEP_LSE

.@OwenPaterson writes,"Brexit marks a crucial moment in the battle for the heart of the global regulatory system. The US must act now, with determination and the entrepreneurial spirit that has characterised the nation from its beginning." 
Since referendum night, Leavers have been working up the story that when Brexit proves to be calamitous it’ll be the fault of Remainers for not supporting it and the EU for not giving everything and asking for nothing. But definitely no fault of their own.

Dear @theresa_may , you claim a second referendum or #PeoplesVote would "destroy trust in politicians".Don't you think leaving without a deal will not only destroy trust in politicians but also destroy Britain? 
Doesn’t matter how many routes are available for politicians to try and call a second referendum, it would be wrong in principle - a clear betrayal of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave.  
I heard that Redwood (and a few others) will be financially ruined if #Brexit is stopped.The stakes are high.#WithdrawA50#PeoplesVote 
Majority (53%) of Brits think the financial situation of average people is worse than it was 20 years ago; 70% pessimistic about children's future.The status quo has failed the working man. Brexit is a fantastic opportunity to redress the balance!  
POLL: Majority of Brits say finances have worsened over last 20 years, pessimistic about children's future. Brexit is a huge oppprtunity for change!  
I was brought up to 'never trust a Tory'. Anyone else suspicious that the histrionics of the Tory hard Brexit Quitters, plus the timing of the no deal warnings have been orchestrated to make the Chequers Fudge deal seem appealing?#StopBrexit #EndTheChaos @mikegalsworthy

"Prime Minister Theresa May said Britain and the European Union were nearing a divorce deal but called on the bloc to show “goodwill and determination” to avoid a disorderly Brexit and secure a close future partnership."  Translation: May has surrendered.

 Leading figures in financial services are now calling for the UK to /reverse/ compromises made so far in Brexit negotiations, due to the EU’s unwillingness to act in the same good faith. 
One interesting thing to come out of brexit is that despite the phenomenal amount of money spent by government and its globalist instructors on poisoning the people against brexit, they have failed miserably. People know what they want and it's not the corrupt European Union ! 
I mean. In any logical civilised society. That would be it! Brexit game over... The main campaign is actually delivering the exact opposite of what they promised, so we call time-out on Brexit. I don't know what else I can say.

And this is the plan from the feral FPBE types like Blair, Soubry, Mandelson, Branson,Grieve, Clegg et al. Undermine Brexit negotiations with secret EU meetings, EU offers crap deal and they think they get a 'People's Vote', while all the time their aim is to stop #Brexit.

In even allowing a second referendum to be discussed is insulting democracy in Britain and the British people. There is no point in voting if you are not going to abide by the result of that vote. Something By the way that the EU is more than aware of.

#Tesco's new #Jacks store branding appears to be founded on some #Brexit inspired #BuyBritish mania. Good luck getting coffee, melons and grapesNevertheless their central isle is packed full of cheap Chinese tat..Also, they can't spell for toffee .. 
‘Come to Stoke’ - CHALLENGE issued to Lord who claims UK has turned on Brexit on Newsnight  
We absolutely must ensure we retain access to highly-skilled workers. But not just them. Our NHS and care system would not function without staff from the EU #Brexit 
This is deeply unhelpful. Sinn Fein are doing exactly what the DUP want- framing Brexit as a constitutional issue. It isn't. NI has a chance to be a BRIDGE between BOTH EU & UK. This is about getting the best outcome for NI. Not a zero sum game. #Brexit #backstop 
11) I may not have agreed with all Labour policies but I always assumed Labour was basically honest & basically on the side of "the people"I never thought Labour would tacitly support something so destructive as #Brexit, and I've found it personally shocking 
After years of scaremongering about the Irish border, the EU now admits there is a technical fix. It is scandalous how Brussels has exploited this issue to weaken Brexit, says @Ella_M_Whelan 
10) the current Tory party repulses me however I've always thought that the Tory world view was too simplistic & short termist.The fact that modern Toryism spawned #Brexit doesn't particularly surprise meBut being "centre left", I just expected better from Labour 
"If it made sense for parliament to ask the people for their view on the principle, it makes sense to give them a say on what Brexit would mean in practice" says John Kerr, who wrote Article 50, voicing his support for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. 
He doesn’t mince his words does he? ‘Fudge immigration at your peril’, @Nigel_Farage warns the @Conservatives. Huge uproar across Europe over mass migration - get Brexit wrong and it’ll be Britain next! Support us at  https:// 
"There is still time. If there is a majority in Parliament for a People's Vote, there are multiple routes to securing one..."Reminder: Brexit is not inevitable  
The PM’s #Chequers compromise is being rejected left, right, and centre. Govt has made a mess of #Brexit and is failing to deliver for the people.The only way out of their mess is for the people to have an opportunity to #ExitFromBrexit. 
Friends! It gets worse!Standard British money - e.g. farthings, halfpennies, shillings, florins, half crowns, ten-bob notes, etc - WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED inside Our EU after Our No-Deal Brexit! Direct from Our Horse's mouth, i.e. Our Sky News!Talk about playing by Our EU RULES!  
Just what is it about the EU that the ultra-wealthy offshore tax avoiders who backed #Brexit hate so much?  
Which do you prefer for #BrexitPlease retweet after voting#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit #Conservatives 
So it turns out the very thing which stoked up the Brexit fires we now realise is the thing which will save the Economy post Brexit. So.... the obvious question... Why? #PeoplesVote 
4) second reason is anger at Corbyn's piss poor #Brexit referendum performance.  I know he's a brexiter, and I know he was faking it during the ref campaign.It may be unfair to blame him as the reasons Remain lost were complex, but remain lost by a few percent. 
Some people think it’s impossible to get a People’s Vote because Theresa May has ruled one out. This is not so. MPs will have many ways to give the people a final say at the end of the Brexit talks if that’s what they want, according to the writer of Article 50 Lord Kerr, 
They're discussing #Brexit on #VictoriaLIVE, two tory MPs and a panel of mainly Brexiters (how surprising) but what's even more depressing is a lovely German lady who's sold her business/house and is going home after 19 yrs, she doesn't trust this govt, how true #PeoplesVote 
If Brexit was condensed into a conversation between Britain and the EU...  
Jacob Rees-Mogg is profiteering from the Brexit debacle. He isn't tring to make the UK richer - he just wants more profit for himself. #ShameOnYou #r4today 
End of the UK car industry? Brexit job losses are going to hit the UK top to bottom, corner to corner. There will be nothing left for the most vulnerable @UKlabour @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer Lexit is an unforgiveable betrayal of the people you represent #PeoplesVote 
Lord Kerr: As the author of Article 50, this is why the UK needs a final say on the Brexit deal - we need a #PeoplesVote 
They come over here, keep NHS, hotels, restaurants, building industries going. Pay taxes and make contribution.-But now in name of #Brexit we can be rid of them.-That’s taking back control Via Migrant Advisory Comm  
The Momentum crowd say #FBPE are doing the Tories work for them. Isn’t it true to say that Corbyn is doing a pretty good job of this himself. Stop Brexit. #FBPE 
When the govt legislates for an advisory referendum, conducts it to no democratic standard without pre-written legislation so no one knew what they were voting for we have a right to reject the result... That's before the Leave campaign stirred up race hate & criminally cheated.  
No-deal Brexit must be ruled out to save motor industry, warns SMMT  
Imagine if Scotland had not been lied to by this man, how we could have avoided Brexit.   
If #Brexit were cancelled most of the population would be relieved, some would be angry at the waste of money and a few gammons would be fuming.A month later the majority of the population would be getting on with their lives. The gammons would still be fuming, but off the TV 
So Westminster want Scotland shut out of the EU Brexit deal, want our farmers out of business, want our parliament powerless, want our produce branded British, want 45% of our oil attributed to another region. Remind me, how is this a union of equals? Time for Indyref2. 
The populists question is What will Brexit mean for you? The truth is the same as i voted for as a Leaver 2yrs ago. What is all the fuss Barnier saying he's giving a better deal on the Irish Border. Truth is British Government has been allowed too be bullied. Lets just get out. 
This is political choreography. The #ChequersPlan gives the EU what it wants so it will accept it. It aint Brexit.  
We DONT want a ‘people’s vote @ChukaUmunna , we’ve already had one. It  was called a referendum. We voted to Leave the EU. Why part of that do  you not understand? 
This is an important intervention from the author of Article 50. Nothing in brexit is inevitable and there is still time to change course. Scotland voted to remain   
Dream on..... only those in the No 10 bunker and some desperate Cabinet  ministers believe this propaganda....truth is it’s a total sell out of Brexit and must be stopped. 
#tesco opening new cheap discount shop called #jacks focusing on british union jack branded products. Could there be a better metaphor for #Brexit Wake up Scotland. #DissolveThisDamnedUnion 
And for those of you who have enjoyed listening to David Davis, Nigel Farage and Bernard Jenkin on #r4today this week, tune in tomorrow for the next in our ‘Brexit Fuckwits Spouting Shit’ series. 
Tory MP James Cleverly says they’ve put together "a really sustainable long-term funding package" for NHS! They don’t know how much, if anything, the “Brexit dividend” they plan to use will be, when it will materialise or where the rest of the £20bn will come from! Heaven help us  
MUST-WATCH: John Kerr, writer of our authoritative report released today, is absolutely right to say that support for our campaign is growing in every region, every day. The more we hear of Brexit chaos, the more the public are demanding a #PeoplesVote. Pls RT: 
.@ThangamMP exposes Rees-Mogg and his ERG colleagues (Extremely Rich Gangsters) for what they really are - ideologues holding our country to ransom for their own self-interest. Would be devastating for #Bristol, the South West, and the UK as a whole. #Brexit   
The most successful thing about the Brexit propaganda is working class people thinking Remainers are the people trying to ruin their lives.We are the people trying to stop them ruining your lives. 
The barbarism of Brexit is the gift that keeps on giving. I'm giving up entirely on politics if we can't amass a Scots Indy majority to leave this nonsense behind.  
There are ZERO chances of UK making a success  of Brexit under any model that has ever been modelled by anyone anywhere on the planet. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg has had a life of privilege - which he sees as the perfect qualification to be the voice of the poor. A voice which he is using to push for the hardest Brexit possible. The likely economic collapse won't harm Jacob but will crush the poor #StopBrexit #r4today 
Here we are - the vultures are gathering , hoping that #Brexit will provide rich pickings.....Rightwing thinktanks unveil radical plan for US-UK Brexit trade deal | Politics | The Guardian  
A new Brexit portmanteau for my Brexicon: Neglexit. The perfect term for describing how Brexit has sucked the life out of UK government. Opportunity costs? Yes, there are quite a few... 
Why are BMW shutting down their Mini factory after Brexit day? Watch ▼@JuliaHB1 | @JLongworthLML |  
Great news folks Due to high demand a 2nd coach has now been booked for 20th Oct & #PeoplesVote march in London. It will start in Cardiff (more details)It seems that @ValeforEurope & @Cardiff4EU could each fill a coach. If you’re fed up with #Brexit join us  
Senior police officers have given a stark warning, claiming that a no-deal Brexit would make it harder for the police to protect people. 
I'm really interested in why people want to pay £15 billion a year to the EU when we could fix the NHS with that so I'm doing my first ever Brexit poll. Please share it if you think anyone else is interested in the answer. Do you want to give money to the EU or the NHS? 
David Davis is a funny guy.  I have no idea why he is on #4rtoday talking about Brexit because he didn't really achieve anything when he was in charge of negotiations. @BBCr4today should get Michel Barnier on the mic - we can trust him to the tell the truth. 
How to get a People’s Vote and stop the train wreck Brexit  
David Davis says there are Brexit other options, such as a "World Trade Organisation deal". There is no such thing. 
Leave want to kill off the NHS with #Brexit. Leave have already stolen 10 years wages from 30,000 nurses, 10,000 doctors, 10,000 teachers, and 20,000 police. Leave have nothing to offer UK. #PEOPLESVOTE 
If we were ‘better together ‘There would be no Independent movement.Devolved governments would work seamlessly together! All MP, MSP would be properly scrutinised. The BBC would seem less of a Westminster propaganda wing. Brexit wouldn’t be happening. Unfortunately! 
Brexit summary, then:- There are no benefits of leaving the EU. Brexiters can demonstrate no upsides, even now.- Migration is good. It is not hurting UK workers, and has actually been boosting the economy to the benefit of all.- What many people voted against was Austerity. 
David Davis betrays the fundamental insecurity of the Quitlings/ERG. Has just stated he doesn't like Chequers because it might invite people to stay in the EU. Trouble is David, your ideas have exactly the same drawback. There is no Brexit deal better than staying in the EU. 
Theresa May: “Brexit plan delivers the freedoms people voted for”.  But Theresa: Your job is to deliver Brexit, not to double-guess which freedoms people voted for. Those freedoms were not on the ballot paper: “Leave EU” was. 
As l listen to @DavidDavisMP sounding so enervated on #BBCR4today, l am reminded of his assurances that the Brexit deal would without doubt give UK people and businesses “the exact same rights and benefits” that they had before Brexit. He was lying then, of course.#PoliticsLive 
Every time you start to worry about Brexit, it helps to remember that if we got through Coco Pops changing their name to Choco Krispies... we can get through anything. 
Lol, who honestly thinks Britain will have a market after Brexit? Who genuinely believes that things will carry on as normal, unaffected? OMG sorry but i'm am going to sit back and watch the sheer panic as realisation hits and believe me hit it will! Like hitting a wall at 100mph  
*Brexit Explained in French*  
Right wing headbangers of the world unite! How much more evidence do @UKLabour need that Brexit is a project of the right by the right for the right?  
Brexit should allow us to work more closely with freedom-loving kindred spirits in the USA, says @OwenPaterson 
Important report explaining how a #PeoplesVote can be held deal or no deal. Please read and please RT - the people must have the final say on Brexit.  
Some people read the newspaper from the back not because they don’t care about Brexit, or the problems in the NHS, but to switch off for a few minutes. Sport is wonderful because it is escapist, a safety valve in a frenetic world  
3/ The EU27 are READY and expecting a no deal.  Chequers is dead 100%.  EU deal on the WA or no deal. TM the PM has run out of time.   If agreement not in sight by Oct 18th formal summit then no kicking the can down the road.We MUST stop Brexit.  For all our sakes. 
New EU law on advance travel authorisation for non-EU visitors finally published in Official Journal: Likely to apply to UK visitors after Brexit transition; will apply to visitors from US, Japan, moreBackground and analysis here:  
84% of Gibraltar voted in the EU referendum. Over 95% of them voted to remain. Their livelihoods are tied in with Spain. And yet, the only people I’ve heard talk about them are @EveryCountry and @JasonJHunter on #3Blokes 
“What Remainers don’t understand is that we didn’t vote Brexit for economic reasons. We did it for political reasons. We didn’t vote to make ourselves richer but to make Britain more democratic.”Brendan O’Neill on Sky  
If Brexit brings restrictions on EU workers coming to the UK then taxes will have to rise for UK workers. EU immigrants pay far more tax on average than British workers. Brexit, still the gift that keeps on taking... #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #r4today 
"We are not thinking machines, we are feeling machines that think."This is why the Vote Leave's imagery of immigration & linking of our beloved NHS to Brexit worked & is still working for a hard core of Quitters.If we get a #PeoplesVote to #StopBrexit we must remember this! pic.twitter.com/tnIcktqPFM 
Brexit is a project of the Right wing elite of UK politics - always has been, always will be. Here is yet more evidence.  
Great Heseltine quote on Boris but also sums up Labour policy on Brexit“A man who waits to see which way the crowd is running and then dashes in front and says ‘follow me’....” 
Exodus of "vital" low-skilled workers post-Brexit will cripple industry and shaft consumers, warn experts  
The EU's chief Brexit negotiator warned Theresa May that substantial progress on the U.K.’s orderly withdrawal from the bloc is needed next month if there’s to be a deal  
I hope @MBuhari's leds administration is listening, #Referendum is a democratic process recognized all over the world not a call for war. Biafrans has the same right to#BiafraReferendum ,Togo announces referendum, legislative election dates  
If Labour is serious about power it must back a people’s vote on Brexit | Polly Toynbee  
You're married with kids, you both work, life is tough but you're getting by. You sometimes row but mostly get on.One day the other half leaves you with the kids and the bills.It's not an affair. It's worst. They're off to find themselves on a beach and have no plan.Brexit 
A People's Vote would "destroy faith in politicians" says the PM. On the contrary that's exactly what a botched Brexit has done. 
Flashback to the referendum campaign: when @VeteransBritain’s research on Churchill’s opposition to European Community membership was confirmed by Churchill’s biographer…@BorisJohnson. 
Britain can still cancel Brexit declares peer who wrote Article 50 
When Brexit goes hideously wrong, don't forget it was Johnson, Farage, Corbyn, Gove, Rees-Mogg, Dacre, and all the MPs without the bottle to do anything to stop it who are to blame. Don't let them off the hook.Punish them all. 
It's funny, how nationalists can get so worked up, about the need to respect the will of the Scottish people, in the EU referendum which was actually a UK wide vote, while ignoring the will of the people, in the Scottish Independence Referendum. Selfish for Scotland.  
This is simply arrogant stupidity & pathetic political prejudice.  No one who knows anything about the Highlands will believe for a moment that depopulation is nothing to do with lack of inward migration nor that the current crisis in employment isn’t connected to #Brexit  
Brexit has already made most of us poorer in real terms, hitting us hard after years of austerity. Not Jacob Rees-Mogg, like other 'bankers' - he's been making hay and adding to his personal fortune... #BrexitShambles #r4today 
I’ve been spending time talking to key Labour players about Brexit, and here’s the result - Moment of truth: Labour's fraught path to MPs' crucial Brexit vote  
'I wrote Article 50. This is why the UK needs a final say on Brexit'  
Ministers confirm Brexit means end of low skilled migrants from EU have automatic access to Britain. It’s why many voted Leave 
Whatever we hear in British media, the European Parliament has a vote on the Brexit deal; here is the leader of the largest group in that Parliament holding firm on the question of the Irish border  
If @UKLabour is serious about power it must back a people’s vote on Brexit.  
Brexit - out of EU in just 6 months from now, altho still no plan. Social housing - tiny amount of jam in 3 years time. Don’t be fooled about Tory priorities. Brexit, Brexit, Brexit, while the country rots 
Many mental health professionals say understaffing is a key reason why so many people face lengthy waits for treatment. The clampdown on NHS pay since 2010 has hit staffing levels and Brexit may make things worse. #mentalhealth 
Study trip by @ecfr also to express important support to the Macedonia name agreement ahead of the referendum.  
Salzburg bound for eu leaders shindig - Govt hopeful of ‘narrative not policy move’ - in other words they hope and believe Merkel, Macron et al will say nicer things about May’s Brexit proposals  - signalling (finally) , they are ready to broker a deal 
WRONG to say the short-term closure of BMW's mini plant in April is due to BrexitRIGHT to say the timing has been brought forward because of Brexit It's not difficult!! 
Majority of Igbos are for #referendum not restructuring. True or false? 
One again waking up to the nonsense of Brexit. What an irony that the EU is doing more to protect the peaceful co-existence of people in Ireland than the UK (yes I know, it's not ironic at all - it's just the continuation of 800 years of arrogant self-interest). 
News Daily: Brexit border 'offer' and Korean nuclear 'deal'  
Brits in Europe have told 5 Live they feel like they are being ignored in the #Brexit process.Rob runs a convenience store near Torrevieja in Spain. He says expats don't know what's happening and feels "Britain has proven they don’t care about us."#5LiveBreakfast 
BREXIT REALITY BITES HARD FOR MANY - I doubt there’s a single one of us who seriously considered, in June 2016, that we’d be in this situation; who could even imagine that our rights – citizens’ rights … human rights – could be the collateral damage of Brexit? 
Hey, @Daily_Express? You've pushed Brexit daily despite it being bad for the UK. You've aided the liars and the cheats whilst attacking our strong, multicultural society. So don't expect the population to drop the battles for #PeoplesVote or to #StopBrexit. 
The real leaders of majority of Igbos(IPOB) aren't talking of restructuring they are for a #referendum@Amaka_Ekwo@NkemdiMary@NkirukaNistoranTrue or false? 
⁦@ProfTimLang⁩ (who is more qualified than Michael Seals who thinks a hard Brexit will be just fine ⁦@FarmersWeekly⁩) concludes that Ag Bill is heading for a cheap food policy as we focus on Enviroment and we wind down domestic agriculture. 
Honda warns no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions  
People had a vote on the principle. Now it’s time for a People’s Vote on what #Brexit means in practice. This is how it could happen #PeoplesVote  
Moment of truth: Labour's fraught path to MPs' crucial Brexit vote  
Britain’s Brexit fixation brings other government work to a halt  
Britain, EU are close to achieving orderly Brexit deal: May  
"Nearing divorce, May seeks goodwill from EU to avoid disorderly Brexit" -  
Gina Miller says it is untrue that she wants to stop Brexit. She merely wants a deal that can be put to the electorate in a new referendum. That deal of course would keep us in the EU. But  naturally she doesn’t want to stop Brexit. Just the referendum result. Pull the other one! 
This should never have gotten to a referendum. Opening up portage and main is going to have a net positive effect on our city. The cost is worth it to creat new jobs and new economic opportunities. #voteopen #PortageAndMain 
Brexit was always going to involve a tricky tradeoff between satisfying political pressures at home and facing the reality of life outside the European Union’s markets. 
Pro-EU campaigners map out path to second referendum, say Brexit can be stopped  
If the #PeoplesVote was on whether there should be #nodeal or #Chequers, I’d get it. What I cannot accept, as a #Remain voter myself, is an option to ignore the result of the referendum & stay in the EU. Even though I'd like it, I think it’s anti-democracy  
Imagine a world where MPs where held up to say the same standards as lawyers. In the event the “advice” they gave was wrong they could be sued. Now imagine them all being legally responsible for the consequences of Brexit....  
When asked by Nick Robinson if she truly believed in Brexit, May could only reply ‘Our  best days lie ahead’. Michael Gove supports ‘Chequers for  now’. Hammond, like the IMF, fears any kind of Brexit. Aren’t we lucky to be led by such gutless Tories? And the ERG seems no better. 
The Brexit vote took place two years ago. But when Britons voted to leave the EU they had no say in what sort of Brexit they wanted. It has become clear that a softer Brexit is better, and Britain need only look to Norway to see why  
Yes, here's me in the New European making my spurious Brexit arguments.  
Leaving the EU has already cost billions in new salaries, staff, consultancy fees and other expenses. Such a waste. Actively paying money to sabotage our own economy. Maybe we should put that on the side of a bus? #Brexit 
“Have yourselfA merry little Brexit..”  
The millionaire, landowning, hard brexit supporting, farmer MP in Dumfriesshire, Alister Jack was exposed as having financial interests in a tax haven. He'll probably be in an excellent position to buy up distressed farms post Brexit. 
#Chequers"Swallow your pride, CHUCK Chequers + DELIVER the Brexit we voted for"Well said @Jacob_Rees_Mogg. 
You're as guilty as Farage I'm afraid Steve, and you know it, hence the faux outrage. Along with Elliott, Cummings and the right-wing media you facilitated the manipulation of the electorate in order to deliver a non-representative result which has emboldened these thugs. 
I wonder how many American corporate farmers are now being lined up to buy out Scottish farms that'll go bankrupt post Brexit? 
This is what Brexit is really about.Brexit gives foreign money a route to privatise our NHS and cut workers’ rights.So much for taking back control.Nobody voted for this. Demand your MP backs a #PeoplesVote to #StopBrexit. 
EU Council agrees to UK negotiating citizens' rights and other issues with EFTA States before Brexit Day (from press release of Tuesday's EU Council meeting)  
Have to admit I had a massive #Brexit ‘Erotic Spasm’ it was brilliant   
Nice thread. As a French migrant and pro Brexit, I see this situation with my own eyes having lived in the EU for 35 years in 5 EU countries.May's incompetence will put this country down, not the actual referendum - The PM herself in person -  aka The Liar in Chief  
.@JerryBrownGov has vetoed a ban on paying circulators who collect initiative, referendum or recall petition signatures on a per-signature basis. Says his perspective hasn't changed since he vetoed similar bill in 2011.

Nearing divorce, May seeks goodwill from EU to avoid disorderly Brexit  
The failure of BBC post 2016: This once-respected global media source trashed and thrashed by Brexit. Consumed by it. Ending up cowering, wanting, subservient, docile, scared, compromised and unfit. Exposing us to danger by its own lack of integrity, balls and competence. 
A cost to one company of tens of millions of pounds will cost how much in lost tax revenue to the communal kitty?Then roll that out across all businesses facing losses due to #Brexit..Discuss please #r4today #newsnight #c4news . 
The Tory Brexit nightmare I predicted prior to Brexit is happening- Tories creating a power grab & fixing their power base for decades to come- Diminishing workers & people's rights still further- Setting up a TTIP type US deal where everything is up for grabs including NHS  
They're selling off our NHS ..... just so you know #brexit 
Owen Paterson MP: Brexit should allow us to work more closely with freedom-loving kindred spirits in the USA  
A sad day for Ireland. #prolife voters should take heart from the huge numbers  who have become involved in the #prolife movement since the referendum. The fight to protect every human life goes on. #FightOnLoveBoth 
My mojo has gone today. A spineless country with spineless politicians who ignore the public majority for the sake of an elitist EU hierarchy whose only mission is to become a super state. What confidence does this give to our future democracy? What's happened to #Brexit?  
Just heard the Labour leadership of Corbyn & his acolytes will not attend the #PeoplesVoteMarch on October 20.Already made that decision before their conference...Time for people who oppose #Brexit to switch to the @LibDems 
Thought @CarolineLucas made a far more cogent case for #FinalSay second Referendum than Gareth Snell. Particularly liked her 'colling off period' consumer right to reconsider an impulse purchase which you then regret on further reflection as an analogy.  
Difficult not to agree with @vincecable when he says:1. More and more people are changing their minds on brexit it (as they become #remainernow)2. Brexit is not inevitable; and 3. It can and must be stopped!#stopbrexit #ExitFromBrexit 
Hats off to @peoplesvote_hq for a great addition to the debatethere are multiple ways we can get a people’s vote to give people a final say on Brexit@CarolineLucas is right - as is Sir John Kerr: they’re rarely wrong! #finalsay #peoplesvote @BestForBritain

BMW closing down its factory is a real indicator of what Brexit may bring. Never thought I'd use BMW and indicator in the same tweet. 
Henderson, Trent, Milner & Sturridge were so good today. We have too much English sauce. Brexit really means Brexit. 
Supt @Jeff_Eakins presents during tonight's #TownHall meeting. Referendum can only be used for A/C maintenance, classroom technology, safety & security & new school construction. Typical family would pay $63 a year or 17 cents a day.  
THIS is a large part of what Brexit has been about. You were warned. The NHS US healthcare sell off is the tip of the iceberg.... 
Problem with centrist is they want to stop Brexit which I don't have issue with but they don't want to fix the problems that caused Brexit which incidentally isn't Russia, although they took advantages of the rot, but a system skewed to enrich the few at the expense of the many.  
“Chips will be an inch SHORTER next year after European drought caused spuds to shrink.” And we all know what caused the drought — yes, Brexit.  
All for de-dramatising this. Backstop does NOT undermine constitutional position of NI. Just about practicalities. Backstop is a platform on which to build. If Brexit happens, NI must not to pass up chance for NI to be a bridge into both GB and EU markets. 
The Achilles heel of Brexit  
It would require a full Reporting Scotland programme to put the questions to Ruth Davidson that she has managed to avoid. Seriously. Issues include the refusal of Tory Ministers to meet SNP politicians, P1 assessment tests U-turn, Brexit, Frigates pledge, May's tax rise pledge. 
Can someone bring me the head of Simon Bruni.On a stick would do.He’s a remainer who makes statements such as coffin dodgers and old ppl dying to stop Brexit.I would get him myself but he blocked me sometime ago.His sort need to be sent to a place far away. 
People's Vote says 'multiple opportunities' for Brexit referendum  
What a fabulous 'excuse' for xenophobic abuse of Germans living and working in the UK. At least Germany has not fallen for a right wing coup such as Brexit. Guess what, we don't do referenda, we learned the hard way where the 'will of the people' leads.  #FBPE 
Our new report highlights at least six ways that Parliament could encourage or force the Govt to give the public a vote on the Brexit deal. The public won’t forgive MPs who hide behind logistical or procedural arguments to avoid a #PeoplesVote 
I had a discussion with @Nigel_Farage on @LBC this evening and put across my point about immigration in this country. My view is that we share many values with the E.U and those who come to work, live and study here should be respected and shown gratitude for their input. #Brexit  
This is the scary reality on EU defence - and now we have PESCO, an EU Army Headquarters. If only voters had known the reality in the Referendum, Leave would have won 60-40 at least!  
The UK's leave majority of 1,269,501 is now shrinking by 1,350 every day and –according to @YouGov’s projections – is set to disappear two months before #Brexit. @FFSake_ @OFOCBrexit #DRUGSTORECULTURE #StartHere

MUST-READ: there are multiple opportunities that can deliver a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. Please RT this so everyone knows:  
Lord Kerr *wrote* Article 50. He says it's perfectly possible to suspend #Brexit and hold a #PeoplesVote.Gareth Snell claims people in Stoke don't want one because they've seen no improvement to their lives since the last referendum.What the hell, Snell?#Newsnight 
Spare a thought for how London welcomed and hosted governments in exile of Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Greece, Yugoslavia and the Free French in WW2. And what the EU then prevented. Brexit erases all of that. For Mogg's ideology. 
Shortages of really quite basic drugs occur regularly now. Our pharmacists do a fantastic job sourcing alternatives, often from other parts of the EU, which will become more difficult after Brexit. The NHS needs the European Union.  
There are those who are looking forward to taking their holidays in the UK from now on. Trouble is #Brexit is going to screw the tourism industry as there won't be enough foreign workers to carry out most of the jobs the industry relies on. Fucking stupid is as stupid votes. 
Gareth Snell should not be so resistant to a #PeoplesVote.Unless he fears Leave might lose.If the result of a #PeoplesVote goes the same way as 2016 referendum, that would truly validate that referendum.Seems so very sensible.Brexiteers should be calling for this.#Newsnight 
Lord Kerr says in the case of a no-deal Brexit people want to be able to give “informed consent” ie a ‘people’s vote’ #newsnight 
Also in the event of “no deal Brexit”: The skies will darken, as the sun sinks below the horizon casting the world into darkness.  
Theresa May set to warn EU leaders there will be NO Brexit deal unless the Irish Sea border demands are dumped   
Britain can still cancel Brexit declares peer who wrote Article 50 
As remainers we used to get told to leave the country if we didn’t agree, now we have to stay and ‘make it work’. Brexit is broke it can’t be fixed, take it back to the manufacturers of Brexit and ask for a #PeoplesVote 
'We have one chance to get Brexit right and ridding ourselves of Chequers will let us take it', says @Jacob_Rees_Mogg. He's right. #ChuckChequers 
So much for all the hype on #BBC Michel Barnier has rebuffed British calls for the European Union to change its stance on the contested issue of the Irish border, as he said a “moment of truth” was fast approaching on a Brexit deal. 
If there is one thing that explains Brexit more than anything else its the thousands of ignorant plonkers trotting out this stupid and irrelevant comparison. Because many years of risk analysis and hard work avoided Y2K problems a hit and hope head in the sand Brexit must be OK.  
We must unite against this disgraceful behaviour. Democratic self government is a noble cause which can defeat populism and nationalism. @GeorgeFreemanMP has rightly said Brexit must be a moment of renewal: all decent people should rally to that call  
Rees-Mogg: We have one chance to get #Brexit right and ridding ourselves of Chequers will let us take it May is wrong: There are alternatives to Chequers or No DealGove is wrong: A future PM could not unilaterally alter a #Brexit deal via @Telegraph

If Labour is serious about power it must back a people’s vote on Brexit | Polly Toynbee The goal is wide open .......... 
I would like him to say that to my three sons faces, they all voted for Brexit. 
So the Chief Economist of a secretly funded, right-wing UK Brexit backing think tank, is now promoting a post Brexit economic proposal from a Koch funded US r-wing think tank  that drops regs on farming & banking, & privatises swathes of the NHS among other things@LBC #newsnight 
Raised eyebrow at the notion the ERG will vote down Chequers for a General Election but not for a #PeoplesVote. This nonsense exposes "Labour strategists'" true agenda: desperate for Brexit and will say anything to get it. Ugly and shameful. 
I don’t know how this can be sold as anything other than the most amoral betrayal of a UK electorate in modern times. They say stopping Brexit would undermine faith in democracy. FFS people - look at what is being planned in its name. 
BBC news report referred to Northern Ireland being “cut off from the rest of the U.K.” with the EU #Brexit backstop. A glance at a map would show it already is, by something called “the sea”. 
A lot of EU leaders will just look at her and say it doesn't matter to us who eventually concedes to our view of how Brexit should be settled  
Make no mistake with or without Brexit, the #NHS will not survive another 5 years of a Tory or centrist government.

 a very interesting read into the new plant built in Slovakia to build the new discovery .. never underestimate a companies resolve to safeguard their interests against brexit 
The only way Labour will support the People’s Vote is if it’s forced to by its members and public opinion. Otherwise it’s happy to talk about anything else under the sun rather than the true impact of Brexit. The current stance is shameful, disingenuous and arrogant.#FBPE 
Farage: Public must remind MPs that country voted for Brexit - Westmonster  
The damage Brexit is doing to Britain, to jobs, to manufacturing is immense.@UKLabour need to get off the fence, back a #PeoplesVote and #StopBrexit. 
. Brexit is a cliff, not a gradient. The mistake we are in danger of making is to believe that some Brexits are better than others when the fundamental problem is Brexit itself. | Andrew Adonis  
British and American trade groups to publish a draft UK-US trade deal based on mutual recognition. This is what Govt should be focusing instead instead of trying to curl back under momma EU's skirt via the #Chequers chicken-out?#Brexit

This election is not a referendum on me. It's a referendum on them, all of them. FIGHT LIKE HELL 27  
Hope @MBuhari's leds administration is listening, #Referendum is a democratic process recognized all over the world not a call for war.You have no choice than to accept #BiafraReferendum to decide. Togo announces referendum, legislative election dates 
This is what happens when a major news channel keeps employing biased reporters like Faisal Islam who don’t disguise their anti-Brexit bias.  
So not a " #Brexit  closure" at all then?  
Software companies spent 10+ years planning, developing, testing, re-developing, re-testing etc precisely so that nothing would happen for Y2K. It is literally the antithesis of Brexit! 
Do the 50m Brits who didn't vote for the Brexit catastrophe have a right to an EU referendum which wasn't narrowly won by criminal cheating, by stirring up racism, bc the outcome was vague & one that wasn't attacked & funded by a hostile foreign power? 
Packed in the AK Bell tonight as we discuss this Tory Brexit. Great questions and well hosted by Perth for Europe. Scotland has its constitutional options and soon we will have to deploy them.  
This is from banking services part of EU prep notes and says that uk banks will have to get re-authorisation after #brexit to to provide services in the EU e.g. credit and debit cards. This might take some time after brexit.  
The new BBC #Brexit jargon buster speaks the truth   
Just realised @Nigel_Farage doesn't really want #Brexit to happen. If it does millions will be  out of work hungry and furious at people like him. If brexit is stopped he can scream betrayal pretend he'd have done a better job and keep his MEP pension.

Theresa May has failed the British people in all respects. She has never fought for Brexit, she has never been tough in Brexit talks & never stood up to the EU on our behalf. The Chequers deal represents May’s total capitulation & betrays everything we voted for..  
I think that many people believe that the #NHS is some kind of inherent thing...a British right.It was created.It can be de-created. Without us knowing it. Especially if a few billion are on the table. Which the nation will  need post #Brexit. No government could say no.  
'Brexit must be stopped' — A. C. Grayling, 13 June 2018.Brexit ‘can and must be stopped’ — Vince Cable, Liberal Democrat Conference, 2018.Brits voted by a clear majority in 2016 in the largest vote in UK history to leave the EU. You don't 'stop' democracy, you embrace it! 
This is EXACTLY what Brexiteers have been arguing for months; Irish border is an easily solvable problem with a little imagination and has been shamelessly politicised by the EU. Good to hear them starting to come to their senses#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit 
Four years ago Scotland voted democratically in a binding referendum on independence. London allowed it and would have negotiated transition to statehood. An example that the so-called "democratic" Spain is unable to follow.  
Sick of being surrounded by people who are apathetic about Brexit? Me too. So, for one glorious day, come and be surrounded by people who care. Anti-Brexit march - London 20th October - you’ll be sorry if you miss it.   
"A "no deal" would have a significant and negative shock effect on the UK economy.And any Brexit deal, Chequers or otherwise, was also likely to mean a smaller economy in the future"  
Britain will be an anti-Brexit country by January 2019 - poll  
Merkel says she wants the UK to suffer in Brexit talks for daring to leave the EU. How about instead we get a competent leader in power (not May or Corbyn) & then walk away from the EU on WTO rules & not pay them a penny. The EU is desperate for UK cash..  
Thank goodness this isn't remotely true.If the truth about Brexit is actually bad, why must you lie to people about it?

Good exchange of views with PM @theresa_may today in Downing Street 10 on #Brexit. I see progress, but there is still a long way to go. The @EPPGroup will closely follow the negotiations to protect the interests of EU-citizens.

Immigration myths that fuelled Brexit blown apart by major government commissioned report  
Well seemed Alex Salmond had "a view" but another electoral mandate was always overriding for a second independence referendum. And we have that :) #IndyRef2 
So you do not speak for me, and many young people. Brexit is about a new global future, and will make politicians more accountable to all voters, including young people. Time to stop complaining and help deliver this seismic vote to help our generation. 
There’s a deal on the table that respects; 1. The referendum result. 2. The Lancaster house speech. 3. Manifesto and election promises. 4. The EUs red lines. 5. The UKs red lines. The EU made the offer in March, we should take it as a starting point. #StandUp4Brexit 
“As I’ve always said, the October #EUCO will be the moment of truth. It’s then when we’ll see whether the agreement we’re hoping for is within our grasp.” @MichelBarnier speaking after the #GAC50 this evening in Brussels:  #Brexit @EU2018AT  
Not one of the 8 xenophobic Tories (that have turned up to the BREXIT debate to grumble about migrants) has a Scottish accent. Scotland embraces freedom of movement. 
Been saying this for a year: It's the #NHS or #Brexit-we cannot have both.The NHS is this country's premium asset. There is nothing equal to it.Anyone who thinks that the NHS can exist as is in post #BrexitBritain ..is seriously deluded.#USUKTradeDeal 
Exiting the EU Committee in apocalyptic mood. No Deal #Brexit would be "chaotic and damaging". Given the choice between Chequers and trading under WTO rules, the latter ("no deal") infinitely preferable.    
Thanks Werner for the name check. Pity it's taken Brexit for mainstream UK to recognise that not all MEPs are in the swivel eye nationalist populist genre

The Irvine Unionist Club transferred £100,000 to the North Ayrshire  Conservative and Unionist Association. Little is known of the club whose registered address is a cottage in Ayrshire. A further £318,000 of unaccountable money is in Conservative coffers.

4 years ago today I was one of 2 million Scots that voted No. Brexit doesn't change my sense of solidarity with folk living in other parts of the UK—it reinforces it. To defeat this shambolic Tory govt and to end austerity, we need to unite the working class not divide them

Michel Barnier plots to 'force UK into Brexit deal that can NEVER be changed'  
We desperately need more @UKLabour MP's to challenge Tory Brexit and support a #PeoplesVote. Here's a question:What would the country look like after 8 years of Tory rule outside the European Union?If your answer is unrecognisable, what's stopping you? 
It’s interesting that Brexit risk is overwhelmingly privatised.This actually allows government to wield the reckless ‘no Deal’ threat.It’s the small people who will pay, business will adapt to slower growth & government will simply tax the individual.The People will pay. 
Ah, the good old days when Brexit was easy...  
24 hours that sum up Brexit- The referendum was won on a pack of lies- Brexit has already impacted on peoples jobs and lives- There's much, much worse to come- The real Brexiter goals are a disaster for working peopleStill time to stop it, @UKLabour must lead#PeoplesVote 
Could the #DigiByte #Blockchain be worth $2.1tn? Well yes!After today's news regarding #Brexit, I will be sharing a video shortly explaining exactly why the #DigiByte #Blockchain could be worth $2.1tn. You don't want to miss this one!#DGB #DGBAT @DGBAT_Official @DigiByteCoin 
It's amazing. All these people, organisations, agencies and businesses that will be totally hamstrung by Brexit.The police, now. Why aren't they screaming? Why are they putting up with it? They should all be DEMANDING a stop to it.Rabbits in fucking headlights. 
This is a typical leave voter in #Brexit Britain. They used to be just like you or I. Then one day the vote leave bus went by. They saw the promise of £350 million for the NHS and were converted to fascism.

Jeremy Hunt has been accused of having "more faces than a town clock" after executing a screeching U-turn on the effects of a no-deal Brexit  
I mean, what she said doesn't even make sense. As @mrjamesob famously said, "Please name me the European country which is majority non-white".If anything, due to the report that came out today, post-Brexit immigration would likely come with a lot more melanin... 
If Littlejohn keeps on writing in this vein in the @MailOnline, he won't last long under new editor Geordie Greig's changed editorial policy of opposing a clean-Brexit & supporting May's duplicitous Soft-Remain BRINO.      
Brexit is well supported by settled migrants in the UK.  
Never Trumper @DanielJHannan and Never Trumper Koch Bros trying to turn Brexit into a corporatist, pseudo-free market endeavour. If POTUS gets wind of this he’ll torpedo the deal.  
I like @Keir_Starmer, he’s an intelligent person & will probably hold senior positions in Corbyn’s Government.However, if he doesn’t respect the referendum result he will be sacked, just like anybody else.#CollectiveResponsibility is back in operation.

The fatal flaw of Brexit is the act of putting the UK outside the European Union – its markets, its customs union, its institutions, its law, its leadership, its future. Working out the “least worst” option is unworthy and dangerous

Dear UK public, anyone who uses the NHS, Say goodbye to your NHS with Brexit.This is what your Brexiteer-Bannon-Trump friends in govt have had their eye on - a US-UK Brexit trade deal - opening up your NHS to American private healthcare companies...

You know the half-witted cretins clamouring for a 2nd referendum cos they didn’t like the result of the 1st referendum? Yeah, that’s it... the duplicitous @LibDems Here’s what they were demanding just a few years agoAbsolute bunch of anti-democratic wankers@vincecable 
I always knew Brexit would be bad.  Yet the damage it's done NOW, before it even happened, is worse than I thought the total effect would be: economically, government paralysis, loss of influence, exodus of good people, and enabling of the far right. 
I see the lights have gone up on that Julie Burchill Brexit play  
This, on the day that BMW have announced they will shut their plant in the UK due to Brexit.Happy union day indeed.  
Theresa May has failed the British people at every point. May has never fought for Brexit, May has never been tough in Brexit talks & May has never stood up to the EU on our behalf. The Chequers deal represents May’s total surrenders & betrays everything Brits voted for!  
I’m glad the Migration Advisory Committee says the UK should not favour EU workers after Brexit. I’ve been saying this for years. #FarageOnLBC 
Creepy new proposals for a US-UK Brexit trade deal include opening up the NHS & British healthcare to US private firms, the Guardian reports today.As I warned 18 months ago >  
The dishonesty of promising more money for NHS whilst wanting Brexit so you can sell it off is breath-taking.... still, hard Brexit #hardbrexit 
ALL the forces that lobbied against Brexit are now part of the hysterical drive to accept #ChequersPlan Conservative MPs who oppose this must realise that May and Hammond are co-ordinating all of this. They BOTH need removed. Or else they will remove Brexit. 
It’s amazing how weak the second referendum argument is “this is a vote on how we leave” - so no need for a Remain option then! IDS clearly enjoyed watching @ChukaUmunna fail to convince the remain supporting @piersmorgan#StandUp4Brexit 
Plenty of time for a Canada-style free trade deal.It’s ridiculous for civil servants to say there isn’t time between now & March.Frankly, if they don’t think they can do it, step aside &Let competent business Brexiteers come in & do the job.#Brexit #EU 
Piers Morgan - "What I cannot accept democratically is an option to just ignore the result of the referendum and stay in the EU,“Any second vote which allows that as an option to me is anti-democracy. Even though I would like it, I think it’s anti-democracy." #Brexit  
Govt's chaotic approach to Brexit is already forcing manufacturers to put contingency plans in place. They simply can't depend on crucial trade with our EU neighbours continuing after March.We urgently need the clarity that a #PeoplesVote would bring. 
"It is time for an open and honest debate on immigration that does not give any more oxygen to the myths. Even if it is three years too late" says @maikebohn on the publication of the MAC report which dispelled many of the Brexit referendum migration myths

Be under no illusion. If you favour Brexit our NHS will be annihilated..  
Debit and credit authorisation & settlement are covered by Visa and MasterCard rules predominantly & so can't see what rule brexit would cause other than availability of comms.  I'm a remainer, love what you're doing but desperately keen that you don't get things wrong. 
The Govt are going ahead with their #BrexitShambles, imposing it on young people & their futures. They have been ignored -- they should all be given a voice to speak out against #Brexit, including 16 & 17 year olds. #VotesAt16

The fundamental difference we have with the Brexiters, who aim to take from the Many and hand over to the Few.Our rights, freedoms, protections and public services all deconstructed and repossessed.All made possible by Brexit. We resist.#PeoplesVote 
Here’s the “betrayal” narrative getting another stoke from the Charlatan-in-Chief.You cannot beat this evil in our politics by pandering to it.Brexit is the gateway the far-right always wanted to wreck our country.Don’t let them get away with it.  
Gisela Stuart - "The Lib Dems were the only ones at the election who were saying we will not accept the EU referendum outcome and you got hammered at the polls.“The public out there wants #Brexit to be implemented.”

Independence would be eight times as costly to the Scottish economy as Brexit, campaigners against a second referendum have warned.

Which will cause the most harm? Forcing through an incompetent/no deal #Brexit because a public vote 2 years ago says we have to. Or checking with the public this is what they voted for? As Churchill put it; 'Those who never change their mind never change anything' #DarkestBrexit 
Wait til Brits realise that their UK bank issued debit and credit cards WILL NOT WORK inside the EU after a no deal Brexit!  Direct from the horses mouth today...  that's the thing about Rules based economies.. they play by the RULES!  
There's still time to stop this disastrous Brexit. Our country needs jobs, investment and working public services. Brexit threatens all of that. I've signed a letter to tell Jeremy Corbyn to give us the final say. Sign it here   
*Brexit Explained*  
Theresa May continues to deceitfully indulge in word play and economy of information. Chequers is not Brexit.Some of us have read the expert analysis by Martin Howe QC on the Chequers Agreement proposal- She fails to value and understand autonomy. 
It’s a shame David Davies was too scared of having his Brexit myths challenged to debate me at the weekend. You would have thought the man who was in charge of Brexit for two years might have more confidence in his arguments, but apparently not.  
Leavers said BMW would make sure there's a post-Brexit deal. In the words of David Davis, the UK is "too valuable a market for Europe to shut off."Working people are already having to suffer for the arrogance of the Brextremist ideological project. It makes the blood boil!

Really pleased that @NWiltsLabour's motion on Brexit, calling for a People's Vote has been accepted as a Contemporary Motion for #Lab18. It's increasingly looking like this will be the only way out of Brexit Shambles. @Remain_Labour 
Four years ago people voted ‘No’ to Scottish independence after being told it was the best way to protect Scotland’s place in Europe. Now both ‘No’ and ‘Yes’ supporters are being taken out of Europe after voting by 62% to remain! #Brexit #Scotland 
German MEP's aide photographed holding notes on 'general election' and 'public vote' after Brexit meeting with Theresa May  
Incredible that No10 offers only this excuse for putting the UK in ‘Military EU’ since the referendum and keeping us there after Brexit.Giving growing budgetary and policy control to Juncker and Barnier, as ministers have done, does not keep us safe.NATO does.  
WATCH: Emily will be marching for her future on October 20th - to protect rights and for more opportunities. Demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal - join our march in London on October 20th  
More than 8 in 10 people aged 18-20 want to #Remain in the EU.By offering the country a #PeoplesVote @UKLabour can prove we are on their side.We can only stand up for young people if we stand against #Brexit 
We are at risk of a Wile E. Coyote Brexit – running so fast over the edge that we don’t notice, until it is too late, that there’s nothing holding us up  
Sir Vince Cable calls for Jeremy Corbyn's removal if he denies second EU referendum  
The Good Law Project is going to court to find  out who was behind a huge donation that paid for Leave's Brexit campaigning.It could have huge implications 
Surprises me that people don’t get May is a power addict. She took it when no one is watching and will keep it at all costs. If we end up with no deal Brexit, not only does she shut down the ERG coup, but she can access all manner of permanent through emergency legislation. 
Does anyone else feel like they know a lot more about referendums and how they are run than they did say 4 or 5 years ago?Good, now we've all had a practice run, it's time we held the referendum that counts, win it, and #DissolveTheUnion... 
Call me a stickler, but if an MP wants to take us out of the EU, remove our rights and risk our livelihoods, I’d say it’s incumbent on them NOT to be brain-achingly clueless.If they can’t answer these 15 Qs, Brexit can get in the bin.(It can anyway)  
4 years ago, voters participated in a once in a generation independence referendum. After weeks of campaigning, the majority of people in Scotland voted to remain part of the U.K. For economic, social and cultural reasons they wanted to stay in that bigger family of nations.  
•BMW to shut Mini plant for a month after Brexit day to minimise the impact of a shortage of parts•Honda warns no-deal Brexit would cost it tens of millions•Jaguar Land Rover moved 2,000 staff to 3-day week until Christmas, citing Brexit uncertainty 
Brexit was never really about taking back control. It's about handing over the NHS to foreign competition, starting a bonfire of consumer and environmental regulations, and taking rights away from workers. We do not have to do this.  
Good to catch up today with @simoncoveney ahead of #Salzburgsummit18. Progress on backstop absolutely essential in the run up to October #EUCO #Brexit   
The Brexit elite (the Tory ERG led by Boris Johnson, Jacob Rees-Mogg & co) will be fine with the 'no deal' Brexit they argue for - it won't hurt them. But this just shows how hard their ideology is already hurting working people - they, not the Brexit elite, are paying the price.

"BREXIT CAN AND SHOULD BE STOPPED"#PeoplesVote 
NEW: "BMW will shut its main manufacturing factory immediately after Brexit day next year for several weeks, because of the rising risk of a 'no-deal' divorce"> This is not Project Fear, it is now Project Reality,hitting thousands of workers hard before Brexit has even happened..  
Excellent points from Barry Gardiner - a 2nd referendum throws May a lifeline.It gets her out of a GE the Government will likely lose and puts her in charge of the questions put to the people, which will be chequers deal or crash out, not chequers deal or stay in the EU.  
A no deal Brexit means no deal on cancer drugs that people in this country rely upon. This is not playing political games or a political football, this is a serious issue. If we don’t have a deal on the future of cancer drugs, cancer patients in this country are going to suffer  
BREAKING. Report reveals what Rees-Mogg and co really have in mind for post-Brexit Britain: An “ideal” UK-US trade deal that would “open up the NHS to foreign competion.” Absolutely terrifying. Our NHS - in Donald Trump’s hands.  
After today’s announcement that the BMW Cowley plant will shut down early due to concerns over Brexit - what more is it going to take for government to wake up to reality? Totally unacceptable that govt ministers talking up no deal & blocking customs union...  
1. Read every single word & inwardly digest. Now's the time 4 every citizen to step up in defence of our Democracy. Don't be silent.#Fighback vs this debased Govt & Complicit Opposition & their invalid #BrexitFight 4 a #FinalSay & a #PeoplesVote #Remain 
"Brexit can and should be stopped. MPs must act to demand a people’s vote on the final deal."  
BMW shutting Mini car plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit date . Actually simply rescheduling normal refurb closure period to cover possible supply chain problems. Not quite the drama some are portraying . 
What has torn the country apart is a Tory government readily accepting the result of a criminally procured referendum due to members of their own government being involved up to their necks.  
London Mayor Calls For Second Brexit Referendum  #WhatDoYouThink? 
Amazing stat: Honda relies on 350 truckloads of parts delivered from the continent every day. The whole of the British auto industry relies on ‘just in time’ deliveries. Brexit border checks would be catastrophic!   
All day long Sky News has trotted out an endless stream of Remainers telling us why Brexit is all too difficult to achieve. Dreary, defeatist drivel. Now unwatchable. Just as Pravda was unreadable in the old Soviet Union.  
Today's Migration Advisory Committee report is a missed opportunity to protect jobs and economic growth that are at grave risk from Theresa May’s appallingly mishandled approach to Brexit.  
It’s actually fascinating how little progress Remain have made since the referendum. 2 years on and they have converted noone, so now spend their time shouting into a contracting echo chamber about how stupid everyone is, whilst fretting over their post-Brexit supply of avocados. 
Truly the most heinous thing Brexit has wrought is getting me to agree with Alastair Campbell. 
The UK should have no “future place in the EU’s foreign policy and defence architecture”. We should cooperate together as we have in the past but there should be no integration, which would be negative for the UK’s defence & security. This is not Brexit.  
German MEP's aide photographed holding notes on 'general election' and 'public vote' after Brexit meeting with Theresa May - The Independent  
Before the scaremongering starts BMW shut down at the same time every year for maintenance, they've simply brought it forward to coincide with Brexit to minimise disruption. More mistruths from mainstream media #bmw #brexit 
.@vincecable supports @theresa_may & calls on @jeremycorbyn to resign. Again & again these @LibDems prove why they can never be trusted. Brexit, & all its ruinous mess, is thanks to @CONservatives with a little help from @nick_clegg. We’ll take no lectures from you, Vince. 
Can you give facts why we are we are better off economically, politically and socially in the UK please? I’m struggling to find any!Doubt even you can deny the UKgov is in a shambolic State.Brexit an economical mess already and it hasn’t happened yet.Socially - cheap WM bevvy? 
Talking about listening, didn't Jeremy Corbyn say something about listening to the members and voters to form policy?I can't help but notice that he seems to be selectively deaf as far as #brexit goes and also mute. 
Brexit haters' instinct is to hector, dictate and direct, which clashes with one essential part of campaigning – listening. Asserting a monopoly on logic and morality, and insulting others in the process, is not the way to win people over, writes @Lugey6 
Voters prefer no deal to Theresa May's Brexit. Project Fear won't change their minds  
.@jeremycorbyn Please please commit to a people's vote on the results of the Brexit negotiations - including giving us the opportunity to stay in the EU now that we all know how many lies we were told by the Leave campaign. Thank you. 
Vince Cable's speech summed up the state of #Brexit & the state of Britain more accurately than anything I've heard in the past year.Yes - the LibDems are a comparatively small party.But they are the voice of true sense & it is the sense that must prevail at the end of the day. 
The latest in a string of interventions warning against Brexit uncertainty. Govt needs to listen hard.  
Kopparberg to produce cider in the UK over Brexit fears  
Just listened to Vince Cables speech what a load of clap trap. His speech made the rest sound good and that's an under statement. He should retire babbling on about another referendum, and he dosen't look outside London. Lib Dems are a spent party in British politics finished. 
4 yrs today I voted for my country to take her place in the world. A brave step, which I took for my children and grandchildren to come. Sadly a lot of my countrymen bottled it  Thank you unionists for lumbering us with Brexit!! It's all going beautifully!! Not. 
Here's a wee story you missed today @faisalislam.Obviously you'll give this the same coverage as your BMW non-story?#Brexit is for honest people.  
Bad news for the DUP: their secretive Brexit donors may be forced by the High Court to reveal where they got their cash from:  
“Vince Cable’s gag shows why the Lib Dems are so out of touch. They’d rather see Brexit as a Tory putsch than a bottom-up revolt; as a rumbling in Jacob Rees-Mogg’s loins than a real demand for change”Me in the @spectator 
When you forget that the Lib Dems didn't lessen austerity, they enabled it and thus paved the way for Brexit.  
Rightwing thinktanks unveil radical plan for US-UK Brexit trade dealThis is the #BrexitSyndicate at work: the wealthy are funding fake thinktanks to undermine democracy and sell #OurNHS to US corporationsNot on my watch! #BrexitReality 
This represents a remarkable turnaround for Marc. He and I have clashed on Brexit for many years. I’m delighted by his change of mind. “Hurrah for brave Belgian who dares cry Leave” 
Listen as this Brexiteer goes silent when asked a series of important questions about his post-Brexit plans for Ireland.  
Barneir says @theresa_may successor will not be able to change the Brexit agreement. Just how is he going to stop them? 
If ONLY UK investigative journalists understood what we #3blokesinapub are finding out about the consequences of no deal Brexit ... the next referendum would be 99% remain!!!!! 
Parliament has a ‘golden moment’ to halt Brexit before it’s too late | Andrew Adonis  
"Breaking up is hard to do. Rather than rubbing her hands with glee that Brexit could help her win independence, Nicola Sturgeon must surely see the obvious."Willie Rennie MSP asks why the SNP thinks "the response to the break-up of Europe should be the break-up of Britain".  
CHEERS: Kopparberg to start producing cider in UK post-Brexit. We’ll drink to that! #JOBS

Faisal Reverse-Ferrets on BMW Brexit Doom  via @GuidoFawkesIs Faisal Islam from Sky an incompetent Journalist or a Project fear spreader??My guess is he’s both.I noticed he’s one of only a few Journos that Gina Millerfollows.Faisal we are onto you. 
"We must be clear that the goal must be to stop Brexit entirely. Brexit is a cliff not a gradient. The mistake we are in danger of making is to believe that some Brexits are better than others when the fundamental problem is Brexit"  @Andrew_Adonis itself. 
“#Brexit is not inevitable, it can and it must be stopped,” Sir Vince Cable tells Lib Dem conference 
This is the sort of dreadful state I feared would happen if we let the likes of Liam Fox and Jacob Rees-Mogg drive our Brexit agenda. Flippin’ heck!  
No Vince, that's not how democracy works. 17.4 Million people voted to leave the EU.Liberal, really? Democrats, really?  Democracy Demands Brexit #ForTheNation  
It's Brexit not @peoplesvote_uk  that would tear the country apart. We mustn't appease extremists by denying people chance to pull back from brink. My @NewStatesman column 
So the thing that happens every year is because of Brexit? This is what a ferret reversing shyly looks like:  
Vince Cable - "There is now a growing realisation that Brexit will be very costly and very painful". #LibDemConf #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
In his patronising and delusional speech Vince Cable said not all Brexiteers were racists but simply nostalgists. He then looked forward to winning a second referendum and renegotiating Britain’s place at the heart of Europe.Pigs were flying all round the conference hall. 
BMW plans to shut Mini plant for a month after Brexit day  
Explain 'better off' Ross.Being dragged against our democratic will out of the EU by you and your corrupt mates doesn't sound like 'better' to me.Let's ditch the divisive Brexit shall we ?#DissolveTheUnion 
I finally muted Ian Dunt. Sure he talks sense about Brexit, but his anti-Scottishness and his blind & naive faith in Ruth Davidson, has made me lose all respect for him, and his views now ring hollow. 
If only the utterly subservient British press would routinely hold Theresa May and the ERG Brextremists to account like this when it comes to their nonsensical Brexit pronouncements. 
Oh crap.  As we know at the moment the most likely scenario of Brexit is that no Withdrawal Agreement is going to be settled.  TM the PM had  
Vince Cable: Corbyn is currently letting down the many people in Labour’s heartland who now see #Brexit for what it is - a Tory project, pursued for Tory ends, of which working people will be the victims. @vincecable #LDConf 
The chart below shows the evolution of real wages in Ireland & the UK over the past decade. It really is exceptional how poor the UK performance has been relative to us, despite an enormous financial crisis. Also, that divergence since the Brexit vote!  
Vince Cable, late 2016: We must accept the public have voted on the matter. The second referendum raises a lot of fundamental problems. What happens if you win? Is that binding? Do you have to do a third?He was right the first time. This is why ordinary folk hate politicians.  
So:• EU workers are not a burden on economy• UK will be worse off after Brexit• UK on losing side in EU votes only 2% of time since 2009Myths on immigration, economy and sovereignty won the referendum. If I’d voted Brexit, I’d want a #PeoplesVote 
Voters prefer no deal to Theresa May's Brexit. Project Fear won't change their minds  Spot on from @asabenn in @Telegraph 
David Davis, 2016: "Within minutes of a vote for Brexit the CEO’s of Mercedes, BMW, VW and Audi will be knocking down Chancellor Merkel’s door demanding that there be no barriers to German access to the British market."Reality, 2018:  
The Chancellor is not risking negotiations and it is not scaremongering. The EU27 has it’s own preparedness notices and analysis, as does UKGov, that confirms what he says. It is not news to anyone but a few crackpot MPs applying the method of climate-change denial to Brexit. 2/ 
I urge you to listen to Lord @Andrew_Adonis ‘s Chatham House Lecture on why we need to stop Brexit and have a People’s Vote. It’s compelling stuff.  
"Brexit is not inevitable. It can and it must be stopped." Pleasant to hear a party leader say that. 
In the conference speech Sir Vince Cable is delivering right now, he will call for Jeremy Corbyn to back a People’s Vote or resign as Labour leader, and declare Brexit “can and must be stopped.” 
The news about a no deal Brexit scenario forcing BMW in Oxford to have a 1 month plant shutdown from Brexit day on 29 March 2019 is extremely alarming. I demand better than this Tory hard Brexit agenda which is putting jobs and the economy in Oxford and across the country at risk  
Hard to make out the writing, but looks like May is discussing Commons vote for another referendum as a possible development which could be forced on her.  
Alan Oxley, former Australian ambassador to the GATT, is scathing about May's warped Brexit plan. He says we must dump Chequers and "reach out into the rest of the global economy with other open market agreements". Common sense!Support us at  
It is what Liam Fox was appointed to do. With the #DarkMoney-funded thinktanks, he is using #Brexit to deliver what the billionaires want, but no one else voted for:  
Disaster capitalism can only be applied in the wake of a disaster—natural or fabricated, hurricane or coup.Brexit is a bespoke fabricated disaster for the UK.Here's what its architects intend for us: Destroying the NHS is just the start. 
put my cat in charge of brexit, he has more gravitas than the entire government  
Jeremy Corbyn likes to promote himself as a protector of workers. So @jeremycorbyn, as a tide of major businesses warn of huge job losses due to Brexit, isn’t it about time that you did something to protect workers - like calling for a second EU referendum?#PeoplesVote 
Former Nurse of the Year, Joan Pons Laplana, writes for NHS Against Brexit on why leaving the EU is killing UK healthcare.Read his article "Happy Birthday NHS?" here  
Three bogus Brexit disaster stories retracted on the trot...  
The question is, Theresa @theresa_may would he tell us one thing, like Brexit meaning Brexit, and then betray us into being governed by a foreign power? Would he lie to us as blatantly as you have? Would he sell out his own people in favour of Merkel & Juncker like you have?

Living wage, cracking down on exploitation, tougher job rights, stronger trade unions, improving skills & ending public tendering/privatisation all superior to quitting Europe when the leaving bill will hit low paid skilled workers conned into voting for Brexit  
Rees-Mogg claims Theresa May has NO support for her 'Dirty Harry' Brexit. May has gone as far as she can go. She is incompetent, unpatriotic, timid and at best does not understand the terrible damage she has done to our country.   
Sounds sensible, so cue howling. Company brings forward its annual shutdown, in case there is a no deal Brexit. Better be a deal then. Perhaps BMW could phone the German government.  
LOL - Trading on the worst possible terms of any country globally is suddenly best for UK... Brexit has sent people nuts. 
But Brexit is a lie with no air left in it and it will make us poorer, sicker, angrier, stupider and less free, and I hate it and so should you. /ends 
Brexit MPs Bullshit tracker1 It's just Project Fear2 The UK will flourish when free of the rotting EU corpse3 They need us more than we need them4 No deal is better than a bad deal5 Business who blame Brexit are making it up6 Its not our fault you have no jobs 
My husband is Belgian. Due to Brexit his disability, paid by Belgium, ends in March. He must leave Scotland, and me, to protect it. Please tell me how we are better off in the UK. I voted Yes. So did he. We would again if WM wasn't exiling us. Better together? Aye right. 
EU workers should not enjoy free movement to the UK after Brexit, an official migration report has recommended. 
If @JamesCleverly were so keen on Brexit as a boon for innovation, why did he not talk to the UK's science community and/or tech community? Both communities were ~90% for Remain. This is not evidence-based policy here. It's lazy personal wishes unfettered by evidence.  
A no deal Brexit would be a disaster and Theresa May’s Chequers Deal is unworkable. So, there’s only one Brexit deal that is remotely workable: EEA/EFTA membership. Because this is the only way in which the free trade of the single market and the Irish border question are solved. 
“Gina Miller’s nasty elitism sums up the backlash against Brexit. This is Victorian-style paternalism: wealthy people telling the great unwashed that we got it wrong and must vote again.”Brendan O’Neill on Sky  
 more positives from brexit - are you listening @theresa_may @Conservatives @bernardjenkin or maybe it’s “ project fear “ eh 
Might have used different words. But the thrust is right. We need to break through the learned helplessness, bullying & groupthink that blights our politics and is pushing our country to the brink. A new vote to give people a #FinalSay on #Brexit is the only way through I can see  
Car giant #BMW will shut its main British manufacturing factory immediately after #Brexit day  
After a damning BBC report on EU citizens leaving important jobs in Scotland after Brexit, a BBC Reporting Scotland presenter then says "A key report into UK immigration policy has said Scotland does not need a very different migration policy to the rest of the UK".  Um?  
Despite repeated warnings from businesses on the impact of Brexit, this is still described as “Project Fear” by influential Brexiters. This is gross negligence against the best interests of the country simply to play pathetic little ideological games. 
Refreshingly direct. Not often you see the #LibDems forced to confront their role in #Brexit  
This is a bit odd from BBC to have Brexit going well in red - and Brexit going badly in blue...Either way - it's fairly clear what people think.  
Rachel Sylvester nails it yet again. Buy today’s Times if only for this oh so true, brilliant and brutally honest column “Politicians are conditioned to lie about Brexit” but not this one - I’ll continue to tell it as it is #BrexitReality @peoplesvote_uk 
I know the @BMW plant well, one of the finest car plants anywhere in the world producing the ever popular Mini. This is the latest example of the looming #Brexit disaster facing Britain’s Automotive industry. @bernardjenkin, is @BMW ‘making it up’? @SkyNews @DailyMirror 
I`ve been speaking to lots of people too who voted Remain and they are getting frustrated with you and others who are trying to get a second referendum and undermine democracy. The people voted and Parliament said it would respect the decision of the people. 
May again promised last night on Panorama that we’d take control of money, borders and laws post-Brexit. That’s not so under her plans. Former UK ambassador to the EU and UN David Hannay explains 
Theresa May has wrecked brexit talks by offering to pay a brexit bill when she got absolutely nothing in return. We owe the EU nothing anyway but May made the offer without getting anything for the UK..  
Brexit isn't anti-establishment - it is run and paid for by a bunch of toffs and millionaires. But it sure is anti-jobs, anti-prosperity, anti-youth and anti-reason.  
Brexiteers have relaunched the Leave campaign and will stop at nothing to ensure the Prime Minister chucks Chequers and delivers Brexit in its entirety..  
Spain wants a special chapter on Gibraltar in Brexit deal, seen as a good moment to make progress on long-standing claims involving taxes, environmental issues and smuggling in the British Rock. Spain has veto power on it. 
Does Philip Hammond have any inkling of the damage he is doing as he lurches ineptly from one gaffe to another?His boss, the Prime Minister, insists we will thrive whether there’s a Brexit deal or not. Hammond needs to be sacked..  
For their ANNUAL shutdown, why are you spinning this to suit? Brexit is a touchy subject anyway, people are arguing from both sides, stop putting out half info in your "headlines" and tell us the whole truth, not just the bit you want to here, each year BMW do this. BAD REPORTING 
Remoaners can’t explain why we should accept the result of a 2nd EU referendum. We have already voted to leave the EU so if remain did win we would require a 3rd referendum 2 years later after the impact of mass migration & plans for a EUSSR become clear..  
The videos can "suggest" what you like but the facts speak for themselves. Three-line whip on Art 50. Calling for art 50 to be triggered the day after the referendum. Hoey claiming Corbs and Mac were always anti-EU. But above all the foot dragging, the delay the reluctance... 
Mini plant to close for a month post-#Brexit  
You can't claim that multiculturalism has failed and you've voted for Brexit to clamp down on immigration and simultaneously say you want Indian and African doctors to come to the UK after Brexit. That is genuinely mental behaviour. 
And people wonder why Ireland is doubtful about Brexit. Listen to Conservative MP, Andrew Bridgen on RTE's Morning Ireland today. Listen and weep, that is..... #brexit 
With Tory provisional wing member Daniel Hannan's launch of a radical blueprint for a UK/US free trade deal that would see the NHS opened to foreign competition....one's mind is inevitably drawn to..... 
This is what it’s all about. For the elite who led us into it, Brexit was always a plan to take us out of the EU regulated space and turn us into an American run money laundry, a financialised Puerto Rico.  
4 Labour MPs out of 229 voted against a customs union which would have guaranteed the softest brexit available. 3 of those 4 MPs have now had no confidence votes from their CLPs to attempt to deselect them. Labour is overwhelmingly a pro-EU party. 
I'm really disappointed that Remainers are not picking up on the fact that even without #Brexit the migration surge from Eastern Europe was a transitory phenomenon destined to soon tail-off #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit 
I was happy to meet with Italy’s Prime Minister @GiuseppeConteIT in #Rome today to prepare tomorrow’s informal Summit in #Salzburg. We discussed the main issues on the agenda of the #SalzburgSummit18, ie #Brexit and #migration. 
Arch hard core #Brexit ERG Tory MP Bernhard Jenkin now claiming..“..I never actually wanted to leave the EU”.Jesus wept. Won’t somebody stop this madness. A nation that wants to remain, even brexit MPs want to remain, everyone knows its a mess. So why are we still doing this?  
I think you might find a brexit ultra currently leading the opposition. Both parties need to fight back against the ultras… Time for rebalance. 
Broken Govt’s #Brexit disaster looms.Their disastrous policies will put our NHS, economy, public services, & security in jeopardy.We demand better for the country -- we need to give the people a #FinalSayOnTheDeal. 
/2 Industry sources have expressed fears of an effective closure of the Channel Tunnel immediately after a No Deal Brexit lasting two weeks, and then it taking a further two weeks’ emergency diplomacy to reestablish free flowing supply lines 
Let me rephrase that: Brexit has lowered real wages more than migration has in past 14 years!!!!! 
Agreed. For example, Sky leads 1:00 news today with exclusive on BMW ceasing production of the Mini in Oxford because of Brexit. It turns out that all they are actually doing is changing the time of a scheduled maintenance shutdown: & they wonder why nobody trusts them?  
Tory MPs: You have to bring your government down for the wellbeing of the country. Whatever you think a Corbyn gov might do, it'll be nothing compared to what will happen with the ERG calling the shots.Your party is now a puppet. Save the UK from the brexit ultras. 
Four years on from the referendum and Bob has started to mellow...

Breaking #RockAndRollFarming exclusive: @DefraGovUK release latest pictures to go with the new Agriculture Bill of how post-Brexit British farming will look in practice.. ;-)  
 @PiersMorgan: “If the People’s Vote was on whether there should be no deal or Chequers, I’d get it.“What I cannot accept, as a Remain voter myself, is an option to ignore the result of the referendum and stay in the EU. Even though I'd like it, I think it’s anti-democracy!"  
In a lazy moment of work avoidance I just watched Nick Clegg saying why we should stop Brexit. If Remainers want any chance, I suggest they stop him saying anything, to anyone, including farmyard animals. 
International Day of Democracy : my thoughts on #Democracy in the UK, and why there is clamour for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal:

So rather than sparking unicorns and the libido of all xenophobes restored to how it was when they were 17, Brexit will lead to selling the NHS generations built - for some bleached chicken - while exceptional EU clinicians can't come in to help salvage something of the NHS 
#OTD: 4 years ago, Scotland went to the polls, and told the Nationalists they wanted to maintain the Union. 4 years later, @NicolaSturgeon continues to play politics - threatening to rip us out of our United Kingdom with a Second Independence Referendum. #IndyRef

"It'll be OK after Brexit. Britain was fine before we joined the EU." Yeah but this is what a night out seeing the most glamorous and impossible life changing rock band in the world looked like in 1972. #warningfromhistory 
The cost of the Brexit referendum. What a graph from this paper:  Doppelganger is the weighted average of 30 OECD countries. Cumulative loss of £25 billion. Could have spent this on the NHS instead. 
Just think if Scotland had voted YES four years ago, Brexit most likely would not be happening. Because let's face it, how could rUK Brexit without the only net exporting part of the UK. 
The country will be poorer - Leavers - "Don't care"Most vulnerable will be hardest hit - "Don't care"NHS will be sold off -"Still don't care"People's lives will be ruined - "Don't care"But, manufacturing & farming... - "Don't care"What exactly will make them care? #Brexit 
Fascinating interviews about Brexit planning w/small businesses on @BBCRadio4. One coach company owner voted Leave because German border control kept stopping his coaches. Brexit will certainly solve that.... 
After Brexit, we need a fair immigration system that treats everyone equally whether from the EU or anywhere else in the World. A system that works to meet the needs of our country for skilled workers & talented people who are going to work hard and invest  
Taxes will have to rise if Brexit brings strict curbs on EU workers as they pay far more to public purse than British-born residents.EU Migrants contribute £2,300 more to exchequer each year in net terms than average adult, analysis has found. 
There's only one reason why Leavers are so strongly opposed to a new referendum, and it's that they *know* they'll lose. They're quite right, of course, and that's the very reason why we absolutely *must* have one. 
The antisemitism issue is a huge distraction from #Brexit. The real reason to be worried by the Tories' backing for Orban, is not Orban's antisemitism, but that it shows them to have little care for democracy & the rule of law. And that should deeply trouble us. #PeoplesVote

Captain Corbyn is going to lead the Labour Party to oblivion. We should let him. Time for a new left wing party free of Brexit & racism.  
Idea that Blair, Major et al are to blame because they didn’t ‘help to negotiate an optimal exit’ really, really bizarre. May’s Government is negotiating Brexit, its failures have nothing to do with Blair, Major etc. Problems mainly because Uk has so little leverage. End of  
Four years ago today, I had done my duty. I had almost single-handedly won the Scottish independence referendum. In one of my most brutal campaigns since Rorke’s Drift, I had once again repelled thousands of angry tribesmen in skirts. EtcEtc

He absolutely nails the state of #Brexit today. Brilliant from @mrjamesob No wonder everyone’s talking about a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay referendum leading to an #ExitFromBrexit 
If you want to understand why right wing US money poured into the nexus of dodgy think tanks around Brexit - look no further.A fire sale of social and environmental protections Rightwing thinktanks unveil radical plan for US-UK Brexit trade deal  
Four years ago, leading No figures were at pains to stress that they felt the referendum process had been a positive experience, a "festival of democracy", etc.  Now they regard it as a national trauma on a par with a small war.  Were they lying then, or are they lying now? 
#BBCNews has just graciously allocated a wee bit of time to #Scotland and #Brexit - and implications of a #PeoplesVote and #indyref2.Who do they choose to talk about this? Some #Leaver touting Britain's trading wonders and #Kezia.From #SNP or #YES - zilch.This is balance, BBC? 
Yet another anniversary of the independence referendum - the one day we were truly sovereign, and then handed it back... But there is hope for a better future, and we are going to make it happen! #ScotlandCan #SNP 
Kenya had a total of 416MPs at the expense of the taxpayer, unbearable, we really need a referendum to see into this issue. Need to downsize and mostly do away with nomination seats in my view. A lot of idle members there #BadLeadershipKE 
ICYMI. Pls watch this .              One of the most despicable side-effects of the #EUref has been the license for political thuggery embodied by UKIP rallying here with violent rightwing thugs. Too few sensible Brexiteers realise that for many this is what Brexit looks like  
Police officers face being deprived of some of their most effective digital tools as a result of #Brexit.This is not what we voted for. This is yet another reason for a #PeoplesVote 
Despite its full-on Apprentice moments, this really is worth watching.  Nick Robinson exposes the absolute ineptitude of the whole thing.  In the PM's own words, the most important thing for business is that things stay exactly the same....  Brexit is worse than pointless.  
They are getting desperate now with this counter-intuitive nonsense. Brexit was not a Far Right victory, over half the country voted to Leave the EU. If you want to fuel the rise of the (currently very small) ACTUAL Far Right, carry on and ignore the mandate. It won't end well.  
The government can have its cake and eat it on this point.They will argue NOW they are introducing a global system with similar rules for EEA and non EEA migrants.Then they will be "tweaked" in the EU-UK trade negotiation after brexit. And "tweaks" = substantial open door 
No offence intended to @kezdugdale but what is a back bench MSP who refused to lift a finger to support @NicolaSturgeon in protecting Scotland’s place in the EU doing on the BBC telling us how bad Brexit is for Scotland? You had your chance to help Kez & you bailed on it, & us.

Another EU referendum would be a vote for humiliation which would weaken Britain's negotiating position and encourage the EU to punish the UK to discourage its other disgruntled members.  #BrexitBetrayal 
People's vote my arse. The people already had a vote.In fact why are you calling it a People's vote ? To gain sympathy ? A branding exercise ? It's a second referendum, a recount for losers.

#Brexit migration report: 'No preference' for EU workers  
Whatever United Kingdom Labour wants after any Brexit - obviously a different country to that the Tory right wants - it is *logically impossible* to deny that leaving the EU removes (and is intended to remove) legal safeguards against the Tory right remaking the UK in its image.

A lot has been said about the Chequers agreement, the White Paper and what it actually means for Brexit. PM @Theresa_May explains what the government has agreed, and what this means for us leaving the EU. 
WATCH: We're heading for a blindfold Brexit - leaving the EU with no idea where we're going. Brextremists like Gove back this as it will enable the hardest of Brexit after March 2019.Nobody voted for a blindfold Brexit. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote. Please RT:

Honda has warned a 'no-deal' Brexit would cost it tens of millions of pounds in additional tariffs and damage its competitiveness  
Theresa May has decided that we either have a Brexit that is based on her completely unworkable Chequers plan (that both the EU and Parliament will reject) or no deal. So when the country has to ensure a bad deal or no deal, always remember that it’s Theresa May who got us here.

Good to see both @EmmanuelMacron and @MichelBarnier alive to the dangers of the @michaelgove ‘blind Brexit’ plan. Fudge a deal. Get it thru. Heave out @theresa_may then get in a Brextremist to unpick and do hard hard Brexit. Govey got too excited and blurted it all out. Silly boy 
Whilst in Spain talking to expat Gammons that live there in their thousands, I asked why they voted for BrexitThe answer was simple, racism. They hated foreigners and immigrants. The irony was lost on them. 
Following UK MP Andrew Bridgen’s #Brexit interview earlier this morning on @morningireland, a few points...The EU’s Single Market is Ireland’s largest export market.  Take July 2018,  €5.65bn or 51% of our exports went to continental EU while €1.16bn went to the UK. 
Four years after #indyref, with Brexit + Trump in between, the polls on indy have remained almost exactly the same. That's a massively advantageous foundation for #indyref2 and quite an amazing thing. Upheaval + fear could have sent people retreating, but instead they still hope. 
Meeting with EU Commissioner Julian King to discuss the threats which Brexit poses to Ireland. Brexit has swept away all the previous economic, political and cultural assumptions.  
Ministers should allow only very limited immigration by low-skilled workers after Brexit but considerably relax routes for medium-skilled and high-skilled workers. Finally, some sensible guidance from the Migration Advisory Committee  via @RKWinvisibleman 
Report from Migration Advisory Committee calls on government to 'make it easier' for high-skilled workers to settle in the UK after Brexit, but says EU citizens should get no preference over those from outside the bloc. Get live reaction to the report:  
The UK does not understand the EU and does not deserve (with the current leadership) to be part of it. "Brexit should end EU citizens' special access to UK" says the MAC report.We don't have special access. It's a reciprocal right! UK citizens have just as much right. 
The EU has ruthlessly hyped the Irish border as a way of blocking full Brexit, with I am afraid the tacit support at least of some Conservative ministers and Whitehall staff. A disgrace.  
"Indy will be EIGHT times worse than Brexit"Scream the desperate panicky Unionists as the UK goes down the sink-hole

EU is willing now to admit that the Northern Ireland border issues can of course be resolved by technology and checks away from the borders - just as the Eurosceptics have always claimed, and as the UK government argued at the beginning of the Brexit process.

Migration Advisory Committee's massive report into European migration says more highly-skilled migration, while controlling low-skilled, would best benefit the country post-Brexit. The experts find there's no evidence increased European migration has damaged life in the UK. 
I will be doing a @reddit AMA tomorrow 5pm for @Independent Final Say on Brexit campaign aka @peoplesvote_uk But you can ask me about anything. 
That is absurd.There was NO democratic mandate to cause us harm.  None.The promises were for something very different than can be delivered.The referendum itself was based on broken rules that were there to ensure fair play.The harm cannot be “managed away”.

1. Centrist politicians enabled ruinous Tory austerity dogma2. Brextremists used public anger at the dire consequences of austerity to drive the Brexit vote3. The centrist austerity collaborators couldn't point out the truth due to their complicityCentrism caused austerity. 
I think one of the biggest problems with the Brexit debate is that the anti-Brexit obsessives really do believe this is the truth (or something like it) whereas in reality the split would be more like  45/10/45. Almost everyone who voted for Brexit still wants Brexit.

Willie Rennie is happy for Scotland to go down with the Brexit ship with all the attendant disaster that it would bring. Such is the Liberal’s all consuming unionism that even though we have rejected their Brexit he would still have it imposed on us.

Wow. Four years since Scottish independence referendum. Hard to fathom how much has changed, and how much has stayed the same. Personally speaking, it was a fantastic story to cover. I enjoyed almost every minute of. (Plug: my #indyref book is still available ;)) 
Here’s the LibDem petition for an EU referendum, back in 2008, chastising other parties for not letting the people have their say. Tories upbraided for not being bold enough to support making Brexit a referendum option.  
Was there a moment for you when Indy became your path or have you always known Indy was for you? Personally I was interested in the idea for a decade or so prior to 2014 and voted YES in the referendum but it was the VOW and the lies and deceit from that which made me 100%

If Michael Gove is right, we face a 'neverending' Brexit, something that few, on either side of the argument, will relish. My latest Brexit Blog post:  
How about we have one day a year when politicians tell us the truth, not just about the facts of Brexit but how they honestly feel about it? Forcing MPs to defend something they don't believe in is nonsense, pretending there are only two options is a lie. Just one day of truth...

Easy to forget that the Liberal Democrats were the first party to call for an EU in-or-out referendum. In 2008 Ed Davey was thrown out of Commons for demanding one. Fair enough, but hard for them to now blame all this on Tories.  
And this is the stable genius we plan on trading with after Brexit. 
Brexit started as an internal argument within the Tory party - it was never about the national interest - just petty bigotry and selfish profiteering. The Tory in-fight is dragging the UK off the cliff - we have to stop it! #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #r4today

Apples and pears John. Given the stated position of the two main parties and the FPTP system, a General Election would still result in Brexit. A #peoplesvote would stop it. But when you crave power at any cost...

Poor UK/US centrists, blamed for the 20-odd years of gathering inequality they oversaw, punctuated by a crash partially caused by their deregulatory bash at using 'easy' credit to take the edge off turbo-capitalism, which led to austerity, disillusion, alienation, Brexit & Trump.  
In a Panorama interview, Theresa May twice refused to say that she "believes in Brexit" - so, she is pushing through with Brexit when she knows it is wrong and will be disastrous for the UK. We need some honest politicians to step forward & #StopBrexit #r4today 
ANGELA Merkel was quoted as saying “the UK must suffer a little bit” in the Brexit negotiations, the same day Theresa May warned MPs that if her Chequers proposal is not supported in the House of Commons the UK will face a ‘no deal’ Brexit - Express

The morning of 24th June 2016, I tweeted that the heart of Brexit was to transform the UK into a one party totalitarian Tory state. As normal lives are wrecked, it's the government's only excuse to continue.Sadly, opposition leadership wants a one party Labour state themselves.

The Governor of the BOE, the CBI, Whitehall, big businesses.. everyone is wrong about #Brexit except @Jacob_Rees_Mogg

Rung into LBC and pointed out that there has been a drop in car sales across Europe since the Diesel emissions scandal. Producer said that they were more interested in discussing possible job losses as a result of Brexit.Pretty clear what kind of debate they want. #Remoanathon 
Why concede a massive scandal involving Diesel emissions happened when you can dump all blame for failure on Brexit.Love how the lady you just had on dismissed McLaren as not really being a common household car company. Meanwhile we are focusing on Jaguar like they are?!  
1. The now infamous Copyright Directive is a solid example of why we should leave the EU. Not of itself as some suggest but it gives us an insight into how the rest of the EU functions. (#Brexit thread)

May promised a clean Brexit, but now offers continued fealty to EU rules, while insisting ‘nothing has changed’ & she hasn’t crossed her own red lines. Unacceptable. The Tories should unite around a Canada-style Brexit deal, one the EU is willing to offer  
He talketh in tongues of dull logic... and not in songs of Brexit glory.Burn him as a witch.  
Let me stop you right there.You say "that deal being undermined by pro remain MPs"That deal would be Chequers, right? I presume you're aware that it's being actively undermined by Johnson, Rees-Mogg & allegedly 80 pro-no-deal Brexit diehards?How does that make you feel? 
The threat of civil unrest is now used to avoid a 2nd referendum. That's not democracy, that's British political corruption. 
The referendum on changing BC's voting system starts next month. John Horgan wants to leave voters in the dark and just fill in key details on how #proprep would work later. Add your name if you aren't willing to give him a blank cheque with our democracy:

Oh dear, sounds like Moggy  has a rather large bet ... on #brexit chaos ! I wonder how much he'll lose if we #StopBrexit ???  
Hi Ryan. Because before doing something as momentous and irreversible as Brexit, it’s right to get people’s informed consent. It’s one thing to decide to have surgery, quite another to go ahead once the risks & benefits have been explained. This won’t be politically managed away  
Vince warned you about the Banking crisis, Labour didn't listen.Kennedy warned you about Iraq, Labour didn't listen.We are warning you now about Brexit, Labour still aren't listening. 
When politicians insist that a #PeoplesVote is impossible because cancelling #Brexit might provoke civil unrest, this is what they have in mind.A small rabble of racist thugs is being used as an excuse to deny us a #finalsay on our future. 
Brexit was never about the UK leaving the EU It was only about England leaving and it's subordinates beings dragged out with it 
16 year olds were allowed to vote in the Scottish referendum in 2014 Simon, as were anyone who lived in Scotland whatever their nationality. The difference between the Brexit vote couldn’t be more stark 
May & her cronies are the biggest threat to UK democracy. They never supported #Brexit, never believed in leaving & still don’t. They are EU infiltrators working against the UK to stop us becoming a truly sovereign nation again. #Chequers is a stitch up that is why the EU back it 
Brendan O'Neill when asked if he has any concerns about a no-deal Brexit :'I think there is definitely going to be practical problems& a lot of pain as well.' Then when asked about if the UK will leave with a no-deal :'I hope so.' Arrogant beyond belief. @spikedonline #skypapers

Why did you let the Tories trigger Article 50? Why did you let the Tories exclude British people from the Referendum? Why did you let the Tories run a Referendum at all and at that with no Thresholds and no demands to first produce an thoroughly scrutinised plan? 
I’m calling this right now @theresa_may  will get a deal from the EU,it will be nothing what people voted for in reality,she will make it out to be a tremendous success,the EU will tell you she drove a hard bargain & how fortunate you are,that’s your BREXIT 
It’s called staying in the Single Market.  You said in @ScotParl on 30th June 2016 (a week after the #Brexit referendum) that retaining our place in it should be “the overriding priority”.  Why won’t you say it now ?

Why does the BBC keep broadcasting street interviews with people saying 'I don't understand why we don't just come out.' That folk are still saying this shows how hopeless BBC has been at explaining complexities of Brexit. BBC revelling in the ignorance its coverage has caused. 
Jaguar Landrover have put 1000 workers on 3 day week, largely as result of economic uncertainty arising from Brexit. This sort of thing was described as Project Fear by @michaelgove & @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, and now the workers must pay for their mistake.#newsnight #skypapers 
The BBC asked Norman Lamont this morning if statements about Jaguar Landrover job losses were shroud waving. He dismissed the CEO's concerns as relating only to Hard Brexit. 12 hours later Jaguar Landrover has gone onto a 3 day week. Brexit hasn't even happened yet. 
Can you imagine the Brexiteer reaction if Tony Blair and Nick Clegg had offered to help negotiate Brexit?  
Despite the best attempts from a toadying Nick Robinson on #Panorama, let’s not feel the slightest bit of sympathy for Theresa May.She’s achieved nothing as PM. She trapped herself by messing up an election that she didn’t need to call. She’s in a Brexit hell of her own making.

That is not true as Enoch Powell swore he would never accept the 1975 result and I remember in 1976 meeting Peter Shore at Oxford who was very much an antimarketeer still. Also 75 Referendum had much more decisive 2:1 majority & less disenfranchised impacted people from result.

Just finished watching #Panorama. Left with the overwhelming impression that Theresa May, the Brexiteer convert, has been to Brussels, tried to make Brexit work and realises that none of it - No Deal, Chequers, Max Fac - actually works. She's trapped in a hell of her own making. 
Europhiles had over 40 yrs to convince the UK to stay in the EU & failed.  They had most of the media, academia, public sector & big businesses on their side & they still lost the argument. So, get over it Remainers - give us Brexit or move aside for someone who will.

#TheresaMay revives on #Panorama the discredited line that we pay “vast amounts” of money to EU. In fact, the 2% of public spending that we do jointly at EUlevel often saves us money at national level by sharing costs &avoiding duplication. Anyway, it’s less than cost of #Brexit

So why are you supporting it?Tom, labour said they would oppose any brexit which would cost jobs. Any brexit would do that, we know this now. It is the time to oppose this - loudly and vigorously- as per the promises upon which several of your MPs were elected  
Brexit is really a process of elimination. We can’t have no-deal because disaster would manifest itself too early. That means a deal. That means we accept EU red lines.That means fully soft Brexit, barriers in Irish Sea or people’s vote.And that means government falls.

Christine Largarde was found guilty of negligence in 2016 for misusing public funds.  She predicted a recession after the Brexit referendum which never materialised.I don't know about you but I will not be listening to this diatribe.  
Pleased to be speaking at the @brexit_advance Conference @bowgroup at the #Conservative Party Conference. An excellent line-up of Brexiteers. 
Every politician who has facilitated Brexit should be made to stand outside every place of work where jobs are lost and apologise in person to each of those affected. 
One depressing thing to come out of the #brexit referendum is the idea that the elderly are all selfish, reactionary bigots. They were a radical generation that defeated Nazism, built the NHS, nationalised industry and established the welfare state.They deserve our gratitude.  
I guess we can't win with Mr (so-called Lord) Adonis.  If he gets his way and Brexit is finally sunk because of fears of a wrecked British economy, we face the prospect of his Labour Government winning power, borrowing trillions ... and a wrecked British economy. 
Mark Carney and Christine Lagarde came out with almost the same dire contra Brexit stuff before our national referendum. They got it completely wrong, yet the media continue to give what many will see as blatant anti-Brexit propaganda wall to wall coverage. #ProjectFearMarkTwo 
Sickening and shameful deceit from Daniel Hannan. The post-referendum resistance began as an entirely unorganised grassroots movement and only gradually & after a huge effort has it picked up support from more than a handful of politicians. #PeoplesVote #Brexit  
Deutsche could eventually move about 75% of its estimated €600bn balance sheet back home. Any transfer of the German bank’s assets, equivalent to almost half the total held by European lenders in the UK, would be a big blow to the City of London. 
The solution isn't replacing Tory Brexit with Labour Brexit. Or an uncertain Brexit for a certain Brexit. Or a Hard Brexit for a Soft Brexit.ANY Brexit means fewer jobs, less investment, lower living standards.The solution is No Brexit.#PeoplesVote

On tonight’s Panorama, shadow #Brexit secretary @Keir_Starmer says a new #referendum should be considered as an option in the event of a no-deal. 'Inside No 10: Deal or No Deal?' is on @BBCOne in half an hour. #InsideNo10 #BBCPanorama 
"Claims"? The @BBC treats brexit drivel as gospel yet this self-evident fact is a "claim"? Look out the window and tell us it's raining, BBC. You're not trying to be accurate and you're not trying to be balanced.  
This is an exceptionally important thread on how and why Parliament will have more options than May's absurd Hobson's choice between the Withdrawal Agreement as negotiated and No Deal Brexit. The Q is whether Parliament is responsible enough to chart a better course than either.  
Brexit stuck between a rock & hard place. It’s screwed. I told you so.  
Useful entrant in the Brexit Bonehead of the Week Competition - any more? (We have until Friday and multiple entries for Boris “history man” Johnson remain a possibility)  
A damning indictment of the entire #Brexit process.The government has taken us to the brink of our darkest hour in peace time.The only way out is a #PeoplesVote. #Labour can lead us there if we listen to our members and change party policy at #Lab18. 
Health board says #Brexit poses 'very high' risk of disruption to #NHS 
Here are the #Brexit options available to the UK, and the order in which they are best for us:1. Remain in the EU.2. EFTA-EEA ('Norway plus').3. The Norway option.4. Ukraine-style.5. The Turkey option.6. Canada-style.------------------ 100. No deal. 
Absolutely. The @BBCNews approach to Brexit has been old old old. And dominated by the Brextremists  
- “Are you sure it’s ok to jump out of this plane with no parachute?” - “You were on the ground before and you were fine. Plenty of people on the ground right now and they manage. The ground won’t hurt you. Unless the ground is being unreasonable.” #Brexit  
It's hard for moderate Brexiters to change their minds without feeling they lose face. Let's reassure them it's not their fault; it's the Leave campaigners who lied to them. RT these quotes...remind Leave voters that Brexit is not as promised; it's ok to rethink. #PeoplesVote 
This is reality not scaremongering. 2,000 families with a ruined Christmas, our auto and manufacturing sectors in jeopardy. The architects of a No Deal Brexitaren't clueless. Like Thatcher and co, who destroyed our coal mines, they simply don't care. 
This morning: Brexiteer MP accuses car firm warning of job losses after Brexit of "making it up".This afternoon: same car firm moves staff at one of its plants to a three-day week. 
There's no such thing as a 'No Deal Brexit'. 45 Non-EU countries want free trade deals with the UK and many more that have trade arrangements now with Brussels want to morph these into deals with the UK when we leave.With the rest — including the EU — it's trade on WTO terms. 
Tory dickhead and hard right brexiteer Bernard Jenkin accused JLR of scaremongering and 'making it up' over the damage #Brexit will cause.... This afternoon a large chunk of their workers were put on a 3 day week, another Brexit benefit hey Bernard? #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit. 
Remember these are the people who forced #Brexit onto the  mainstream parties and are still driving that agenda with the support & co-operation of lots of Tory & even some Labour MPs  
Not one single journalist thought to ask Lagarde why she chose to speak about the risks of no deal Brexit today. All stage managed, to follow May saying it's no deal or her deal and Jaguar announcing a 3 day week. We are being manipulated.  
I see a lot of tweets about why you should start stockpiling food for Brexit. Better idea, make a relationship with a farmer you trust. They will still be there producing food in the future. It’s better for everyone to buy direct from the farm.  
It doesn't look to me like Jaguar Land Rover are "making it up", Mr Jenkins.It looks to me like they're putting their money where their mouth is and waving goodbye to the sh*tshow that is brexit.  
I voted LEAVE. I voted Tory to implement my vote. If you don't want to do it then resign your seat or call a general election. I don't want another referendum so you people can shout lies at each other. The people have spoken. Do your job or get off the playing field.  
Just landed in Brussels ahead of tomorrow's special @BBCBreakfast 6 months to Brexit...We'll get the view from the rest of EUSee you bright and early!  
The Brextremists don't want an informed referendum for one reason, bc they know they'd lose it... The 'democracy' argument doesn't stand up at all when the side that narrowly won did so by criminally cheating. #StopBrexitSaveBritain 
Theresa May is wrong. There is an alternative: #suspendA50 & give people a #FinalSay between a viable Brexit & new Remain. She should stop bullying @Conservatives colleagues into accepting a deal that is the worst of both worlds & give Parliament the meaningful vote she promised 
Mad Brexit Disease  
Older people much more likely to hold pro-Brexit views, younger ones pro-EU. And everyone agrees we are an ageing society. Yet pro-EU types think the passage of time will create an anti-Brexit demographic. Go figure. 
SOROS ELECTION MEDDLINGA Soros NGO is attempting to stop a traditional family marriage referendum in Romania. 
So basically, Philip Hammond has said today that a no deal brexit means TEN YEARS OF AUSTERITY WOULD HAVE BEEN ALL FOR NOTHING! 
Ah, good old Christine, a true European. She is right that #Brexit will be a disaster. We should all listen. After all, she was spot on with the referendum.

The great thing about being a remoaner. When your grand kids ask you what you did to fight against Brexit, you can tell them honestly you did all that you could.Imagine though if you have to look at them and as the horror spreads over their faces say you "did it for them" 
What used to be on the news before Brexit? 
"[Blind Brexit] would make an absolute mockery of parliamentary democracy. It makes the meaningful vote entirely meaningless by being a ‘choice’ between a catastrophic no deal & a future scenario to which it is openly understood the British government has no commitment to at all"  
Research conducted by YouGov on behalf of Peoples Vote show 84 % of Guardian readers would back Remain if a referendum today. So would nearly half the Telegraph readership.  
May hasn't figured out that brexiteer rebels prefer a no deal Brexit to her sham of a brexit deal.  No Deal is far better than a bad deal..  
"Brexit will only be stopped if members of parliament show courage and leadership at this golden moment." 
Brexit can and must be stopped democratically; ‘no deal’ is a concept that doesn’t exist; any agreed deal could be sent to each household to compare what will happen with the current benefits of being in the EU says @Andrew_Adonis #peoplesvote #CHEvents 
The IMF has no credibility & is an anti Brexit propaganda tool that has repeatedly been proven wrong.  Partly funded by the EU so what else do you expect..  
The sheer arrogance and ignorance of @BenPBradshaw to claim (falsely) there’s an alternative to the referendum we’ve already had. There isn’t, we’ve had one and 17.4 million people voted to leave. Time you anti-democratic militants get over losing and respect the 23rd June 2016  
"A new survey from YouGov shows that by March 29, it will be difficult to sustain the argument that the British electorate want Brexit to take place. And that's why voters should have a Final Say."#PeoplesVote 
“The mistake we make is thinking some Brexits are better than others, while it is clear that the problem is with Brexit itself.” - Lord Adonis at @ChathamHouse on why Brexit can and should be stopped. 
Roll up! Roll up! All the prophets of Doom! We had Mark Carney last week, though I don't think he said what he was purported to have said and today the turn of Christine Lagarde and Chancellor Hammond to peddle their depressing tales of woe about BREXIT - any more for any more? 
"It is now crystal clear that the fatal flaw of Brexit is the act of putting the United Kingdom outside the European Union – its markets, its customs union, its institutions, its law, its leadership, its future." 
Because we're still in the EU.You absolute fucking shitwit.Also.  Over 100,000 jobs have already gone down the shitter with Brexit blamed.You deluded fuck.  
The CEO of @PimlicoPlumbers is doing so much to #stopbrexit. He used to donate to the Tory party but won't now as brexit is so anti business. He now displays a a *bollo£&# to brexit'" sign from his London HQ that's seen from trains.Thank you for fighting and taking a stand.  
WAKE UP, BRITAIN !!!Jaguar Land Rover has warned workers that they are moving to a three-day week.The number of employees at the plant has fallen from 3,000 to 2,000 in 12 months. Demand has been falling due to Brexit and uncertainty over diesel cars.  
Politicians typically overpromise and underdeliver. Usually they get away with a fudge.Brexit is different.Before they can try to deliver, our politicians must first destroy decades of progress. We have to stop this pointless destruction. 
Since then Leavers have:1. Made no effort to understand or accommodate the concerns of Remainers (especially @The3Million and business);2. Dismissed them as scaremongers, elitists and traitors;3. Made no positive case for Brexit at allAdvice is always easier to give than take 
After the referendum, the papers filled with pieces saying Remainers:1. Didn’t try to understand Leavers’ concerns;2. Dismissed them disrespectfully; and3. Failed to make a positive case for the EU /1

WATCH: Nigel Farage embarrassed by New European editor on national TV /#EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
For May to sign a brexit agreement now and refuse to tell the public what she has signed in their name is another outrage from this treacherous woman. I suspect a patriot somewhere will leak it long before November 
Sir James Dyson, Britain’s greatest engineer and industrialist, is all for a hard, no deal, Brexit. He has set up his own university for engineers and is designing his own brand of electric car. Next time you are told Brexiteers are dumb, use him as a counter-example. 
How lucky is Theresa May! On #Panorama the BBC are giving her 30 minutes of prime-time tv to sell her Brexit plan & Nick Robinson will be asking the questions.  
The quote refers to ‘Europe’ not the ‘EU’ so looks like a legitimate point. It also highlights one of the great Remain fallacies that Brexit means ‘leaving Europe’. It doesn’t whatever your views on it 
Come on guys we should be bombarding the news organisations getting @JasonJHunter all all these panels,To count the lies being told on a on Deal Brexit 
If you truly believe that Brits are better than people from other countries and that the United Kingdom should re-assert its imperial control over the world AND you're rich enough to ride out any economic disaster...Then of course you'll push for Brexit at any cost...  
Nigel Farage was left rattled in a televised debate as he was forced to admit that the Brexit vote was a political move that had little to do with economics  
If Michael Gove is right, we face a 'neverending' Brexit, something that few, on other side of the argument, will relish. My latest Brexit Blog post, just up:  
Discussed #Brexit and #Malta #UK bilateral relations with @theresa_may at @10DowningStreet -JM

Trust me, the Latvian government's new web page about Brexit is a lot more useful than the UK government's.  
Disappointing that Sadiq Khan has chosen to call for a divisive and unwanted second referendum. He should remember the promise he made at the Great Debate, just before polling day.  
Nigel Farage - "We’re not the slowest growing economy in the G7. Italy are slower than us. Stop lying, "No one cares about the economics, no one believes the economics. It’s about do we govern our own country or don’t we? That is what #Brexit is about."  
In last week's Sunday Times @dominiclawson claimed that I support an #EEA-based #Brexit because I see it as a revolving door back into the EU. Not true! An EEA-based Brexit would in fact be the launch-pad for creating a more flexible, multi-tier Europe. My reply:  
Gina Miller has told the Lib Dems ‘to put values before vanity’! She badly needs to heed her own advice and stop putting Gina Miller before democracy. Brexit has not even been implemented and she wants another referendum to stop it. She is an arch-hypocrite. 
It's ironic in 10 years time, I can predict with absolute certainty REGARDLESS of whether we leave or remain1. Noone will have voted for Brexit2. It will be the worst idea anyone had3. It will be the thing everyone blamesBrexit is doomed before it ever begins. So why begin? 
The IMF has said that any Brexit will be bad for Britain. What a surprise after its intervention in the referendum debate. But since then the country has being doing well. And it will do even better after Brexit. 
Brexiter Lord Lawson on @LBC with @eddiemair, saying that JLR hasn't slashed staff hours because of Brexit, despite JLR saying that this is the case.Brexiters are not even pretending to be attached to reality these days. 
Today, I chaired a positive and constructive meeting, on Brexit, with the Government’s Business Advisory Group -inc CBI, FSB, BCC, IoD, EEF. Valuable discussion on progress in negotiations as well as business and government plans to ensure we are ready and prepared for Brexit.  
Independence for Scotland isn't a choice between independence and the status quo, it's being independent versus the double disasters of Brexit and a Tory immigration cap.

Breaking: Jaguar announces 3,000 staff will go to three-day week as a result of difficult conditions in the automotive industry, caused by Brexit and slumping sales of diesel-powered cars.So much for Bernard Jenkin accusing them of scaremongering  
"A new survey from YouGov shows that by March 29, it will be difficult to sustain the argument that the British electorate want Brexit to take place. And that's why voters should have a final say."  
Nigel Lawson tells LBC that Brexit is a great big opportunity that means Britain joining the rest of the world and that Jaguar quitting the UK has nothing to do with the EU...... from his home in France @lbc 
Lawson, the con man, is saying on @eddiemair that worst  effects of brexit will be over in a year. You could tell he just plucked a timescale from the air, based on nothing.  He should be introduced as 'well known climate chance denier, who isn't a scientist....Nigel Lawson'

Likely outcomes of a 'no-deal' #Brexit: NHS could run out of drugs  Ambulances stopped at border  Spiralling costs for business  Huge lorry queues  Empty shelves  Increased credit card costs  Planes grounded  Manufacturing collapse  
What it means Theresa is that you're continuing on a damaging course of action which you know you've no mandate for and which is predicated on the result of a referendum that was demonstrably procured illegally by the Leave campaign many of whom you've welcomed into your cabinet.  
If some MPs voted against the deal because they wanted a new political declaration signalling a softer Brexit, others because they wanted a harder one, and others because they wanted to hold another ref, there would be a majority against everything and a majority for nothing. 15/

It is being claimed that May has concluded a brexit deal with the EU. Anyone want to deny that she has not given away our fishing grounds and our right to govern ourselves and that Britain won´t be taking in EU economic migrants in an attempt to break the benefits system ?

Today’s report from the International Monetary Fund is a bleak reminder of the disastrous consequences a ‘no-deal’ Brexit could have. The Government should heed this warning and agree to a public vote so that the people can take back control.

Burnley voted 66% to leave in 2016. The BBC have gone to Burnley to sound out the people there. They found there is no appetite for a so called "peoples vote" or 2nd referendum. That is true for Mansfield & all the leave areas in the Midlands & North.

People excitedly doing a Brexit countdown to March 2019 should add another 21 months, the unnecessary 'implementation period' (where we can't freely implement new trade deals) isn't Brexit. What May intends to sign us up to after that probably won't much look like Brexit either. 
This interview statement from the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund should send a cold shiver down the back of every Brit. She's describing the inevitability of a shrinking British economy post Brexit. That means, recession, unemployment, inflation, devaluation

A majority of people in the UK don't have a problem with immigrants and value their contribution.A minority of bigots believe the lies the Mail/Express print about immigration. Their votes swung the referendum. That bigoted minority are the only reason the UK is leaving the EU. 
Again the thoroughly discredited IMF spews more laughable predictions of #Brexit doom and gloom. No Deal [on WTO terms] would require a period of adjustment but to say it would shrink Britain’s economy and cause “substantial costs” is wide of the mark 
Having read the WGD on a referendum. My point has never been whether it is legal or not but more that after March 2019, the Tories will ensure Scotland is indeed absorbed into Britain. They will use the exit from the EU,  to end devolution. If people can't see this they're blind.

Takeaways from David Sterling speech at @epc_eu 1) Unambiguous that a no-deal Brexit would be economically damaging to NI2) Brexit policy for NI is guided by two sides of A4 which was written two years ago3) Senior civil service v nervous about prospect of taking on new powers 
IMF chief warns no-deal Brexit means reduced growth, increased deficit, depreciation of sterling, reduction in the size of the UK economy—“The larger the impediments to trade in the new relationship, the costlier it will be. This should be fairly obvious” 
Taking on board the current and forthcoming damning evidence of the Leave campaign's disregard for the law, along with the close referendum result and the rejection of May's call for a mandate in 2017; the only safe course of action is to suspend Brexit and call a public inquiry.

Spend Sunday watching non-Giants games and you see a lot of bad OL play.Still, teams (and QBs) find a way to make plays #Giants are not making. That falls on the QB.Not referendum on Eli's legacy. It's about where he is right now, what needs to improve.  
Today's 18, 19 and 20-year-olds were not allowed to vote in 2016. 84% of them want to remain in the EU. To ignore these young voices, who have the most to lose from Brexit, would be nothing less than a betrayal. 
If the SNP had won their ill-fated referendum in 2014, Scotland would now be a basket case economy.  
Still can't believe I talked about politics on the telly!!! Was awesome discussing brexit on BBC news this morning xx  
Did Leavers sell Brexit as hugely beneficial? YESDid Leavers sell Brexit as easy to achieve? YESDid Leavers make a host of promises? YESIf the Government, acting solely on Leave's AGENDA, fails to meet the expectations they generated, are they to blame?Abso-bloody-lutely! 
This morning Bernard Jenkin told the Today prog the Jaguar LandRover boss was "making it up" and "scaremongering" over his claim Brexit will cost them £1.2bn a year. This afternoon they announced Jaguar LandRover plant staff in the midlands are going down to a 3-day week.  
Jaguar slash staff hours - moments after Tory calls their Brexit fears 'made up'  
Theresa May was today warned that Brexit will “betray an entire generation of young people” as a new poll showed teenagers who have now gained the vote back staying in the EU by more than five to one  
84% of 18-20-year-olds — too young to take part in the June 2016 referendum — support remaining in the EU. Based on demographic predictions alone, the Leave majority of 2016 will be wiped out in Jan 2019, two months before the UK is due to quit the EU. 
Meanwhile the Tories consolidated their position; and exploited the tsunami of nationalistic xenophobia which followed their referendum. Putting them on 43% of the vote - which is roughly where they've been ever since. 
Disorderly Brexit could have 'dire consequences', says IMF chief – video  
As someone who spent two years shouting about "subverting democracy" why haven't you been demanding a 2nd referendum since it emerged your side "subverted democracy"?  
If our presidential aspirants know that they aren't disimilative elements,let them address the critical quest of a #referendum by IPOB. 
Careful ⁦@Nigel_Farage⁩ - backpedal any further and you will find yourself in the same century as the ERG. @endthechaosuk #peoplesvote. Farage forced to admit Brexit isn't about the UK being better off  
There was even a bizarre conspiracy theory that Corbyn had secretly voted Leave And what with the referendum being decided by just the one vote (plus a million or so more), that could not have been more significant:  
NEW Jaguar Land Rover cuts staff to a three-day week, it's revealed - just hours after Tory Bernard Jenkin accused the car giant of "making up" fears about Brexit 
Jaguar Land Rover has announced that more than 3,000 staff will move to a three-day week at its Castle Bromwich plant in the West Midland.The news came hours after the carmaker was accused of “scaremongering” about the impact of Brexit by a Conservative MP  
We need people like Jason on TV to explain Brexit, not celebrity journalists worried about their vast BBC salaries.  
VIDEO: Britain's economy would face 'a very large cost' if it leaves the EU next March with no Brexit deal in place, the IMF's Christine #Lagarde warns in a speech at the UK Treasury #nodeal 
Nonetheless, in the event of Brexit plunging the UK into political uncertainty, the Labour Right clearly thought it wise to Launch a coup, regardless:  
"Fascism of the left is every bit as terrifying as the destructive fascism of the right."Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller says that "centrist politics throughout Europe and the United States is really struggling to make headway" - but she's not "your leader-in-waiting"

UK PM May tells rebels: It's my Brexit deal or no deal  
The chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover was "making it up" when he warned that a Hard Brexit would wipe out profits and cost tens of thousands of jobs, a Tory Brexiteer has claimed  
Clear your diary: Join the @peoplesvote_uk March for the Future on 20th October in Westminster to call for a People's Vote on the final Brexit deal.  
"The government is running short of time to implement a successful Brexit"  - we think that even with more time, the best option is a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal! 
We're at the "Blame each other" stage of Brexit. As @seanjonesqc says, if Brexit were going well, we'd be at the "claiming credit" phase.  
It’s interesting the only thing Remainers like @susannareid100 ever throw at @Nigel_Farage is a campaign slogan he had nothing to do with, and which had very little impact on the referendum.  
Soros NGO blocks Traditional Family, Marriage Referendum  
Voters prefer no deal to Theresa May's Brexit, says @asabenn, and Project Fear won't change their minds 
Credit where credit is due: @DanielJHannan is one of the few Brexitons to attempt to outline a positive vision for Brexit. The problem is, his vision is set in a fantasy universe where Britain is still an imperial power and the rest of the world is populated by backward savages. 
Every day we will be releasing a video from a young person demanding a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit. Young people, who have the most at risk from #Brexit, will be leading the March for the Future on October 20th. Make sure you sign up:  
NI is part of the UK, the majority want it to stay this way. NI may not have voted for Brexit, but the UK did. We joined as 1 nation and will leave as 1 nation. Boris is absolutely correct in his analysis, there is nothing in the Belfast Agreement regarding border controls. 
“Brexit would be the greatest act of national self-harm in postwar history”, Ian Kershaw, the leading historian of Nazi Germany, tells @georgeeaton: 
Record a video message to your MP telling them that if they let the country just fall off a cliff with either a bad Brexit deal or no deal without giving us a #PeoplesVote they lose your vote for good. Get the young people in your life to do the same. Make sure to tag them and me 
Death of the Conservative Party is  one of the extremely few silver linings of the Brexit chaos: “May's attempt to unite the Conservatives before the party conference has been dealt a severe blow by Brexiteers setting up a rival event 10 miles from the main setup in Birmingham.” 
Gina Miller says the anti-Brexit campaign is failing to convince the public to hold a second referendum - Business Insider  
I was talking about Searfarers just last week.... every day Brexit brings us a new problem. 
“The financial system is already operating on the assumption that there is no agreement” on Brexit, says UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti  
Such contempt for democracy! The country has swung against Brexit now that cheating referendum has been exposed as fraud & the disaster of any Brexit is clear, but she claims dictatorial powers. “Brexit: PM says 'it's either my deal or no deal' - BBC News  
There are, apparently, about 400 MPs who think #Brexit is a bad idea.It would appear they are all too drunk to stand up, or have no spines.  
Lord Alan Sugar says #Brexit is 'going to be a complete and utter mess' and has called for those who promised £350 million a week for the NHS to be prosecuted. Perhaps, but even more urgent is to make sure that there is a #PeoplesVote on any final deal. 
Clegg asked by candidate for North East Fife If Brexit will lead to independent Scotland & united Ireland - he says Tories are now an English nationalist, rural & suburban party, “indifferent to other parts of the Union” #libdemconf 
The EU is terrified that other member states will follow Britain. If the UK succeeds after Brexit other nations will also quit & the EU begins to collapse. That’s why the EU will agree May's Chequers deal, because it is bad for the U.K..

Someone's going to get fired at BBC News they are having a whole day on #Brexit and they've been highlighting the flaws! Showing the head of the IMF saying even with a deal the UK will be worse off.This can't be officiall! They've gone rogue!#Brexit #FBPE #BBC 
In the Brexit referendum in the UK in 2016, Remain campaigners struggled to make a positive case for EU membership. So they resorted to a campaign of fear and scaremongering. A strategy that ultimately failed. 
"Stop saying 'stop Brexit'" — Gina Miller says anti-Brexit campaigners are failing to convince the public of the need for a second referendum.  
I'm not being patronising. I'm not being part of the Metropolitan elite. But I am prepared to wager that most non political people in Britain on both sides of the Brexit divide would fail to get 5 right.

55% of all motions submitted to Labour Conference are about Brexit, with a big majority calling for a #PeoplesVote"The push for a referendum is being led by left-wing activists who want to see Corbyn walk into No 10" says Momentum member @bungeeless_jump 
After her speech to Conference @vincecable and @thatginamiller catch up to talk about the fight against Brexit.  
Vote for Brexit and ruin my future did you?  
At what point will decent MPs stand up to this dreadful PM May and say enough, stop A50. The referendum was clearly “won” by illegal means. 
NO DEAL: Sajid Javid calls for tax cuts to boost economy in case of WTO Brexit. Saj is right, let's make the UK more competitive and prepare for No Deal.  
The Conservatives made a grave error in protecting Viktor Orban. Britain’s foreign policy interests have clearly changed with Brexit, but at what cost? This foolish error will create problems at home and abroad. Me for @FinancialTimes

Where to start with this comment piece which seems to ignore the law and the political reality of Brexit being only 6 months away? /1  
IMF chief highlights recession risk of no-deal Brexit ........ but don't worry Remainers it's only bad for the UK not the EU.PS What happened to that recession, house price crash & mass unemployment the IMF said we'd suffer for merely voting for Brexit? 
The IMF has publicly contradicted Theresa May's claims there will be a Brexit NHS dividend. They've said that May is "comparing apples with oranges". 
Brexit is stupid - IMF. Oh, and embedded in this is a masterly trolling of xenophobic gammons.  
Women’s rights were won by freedom-fighting women, not balding bureaucrats in Brussels. The idea that women’s rights will disappear after Brexit is an elitist, anti-democratic myth, says @Ella_M_Whelan 
Time to go full throttle for a Canada style agreement. It is superior to the awful Chequers Plan in every conceivable way. #Brexit #StandUp4Brexit 
I often get told "You only care about Brexit, there are other problems! Homelessness, poverty, food banks". Yes, there are. But nothing (other than possibly spiders) exists in a vacuum. All things are in some way interconnected. Brexit *will* exacerbate, not mitigate, the bad.

So @BBCNews up to old tricks on Brexit. Told me yesterday clear majority for Remain among Burnley fans they travelled with to Wolves. Package on just now suggesting otherwise. 
Labour absolutely right to hammer the SNP for their continuing dishonesty about the economic impact of independence. How much more powerful this criticism would be if we weren't simultaneously misleading folk that a "jobs first Brexit" is possible. 
A general election should be held to allow voters to choose between Theresa May’s Chequers proposals and Labour’s Brexit proposals.

If there's one thing we should take from Brexit, it's that Westminster will never, ever, ever devolve control of immigration. So if folk want Scotland to control it, we need independence.  
IMF chief highlights recession risk of no-deal Brexit  
We are being given Brexit advice from failed politicians, dumb bankers, sham IMF leaders and imposters that don't even live in the UK. 
There is a simple, easy solution to the NI border issue that suits what everyone voted for in the EU referendum - but which Westminster won’t consider because it’s happy, as are @ScotTories, to shaft Scotland - again.

"The part of the UK which delivered the most resounding vote in the referendum would be the only one that DIDN’T get what it voted for."  
I think a lot of MPs believe that pushing on with #brexit will help their careers. We must make it clear that there will be no impunity for forcing through a destructive #Brexit built on lies & crime against the will of a majority that will grow, and will demand retribution.

Fact1. Any achievable form of #Brexit is going to be a car crash for UK. It’s just a question of how bad. Fact 2. @BorisJohnson is much more to blame for this sorry situation than @theresa_may. 
Deal or no deal, #Brexit will take a sledgehammer to jobs, NHS, economy…Govt are blindly going ahead with their #BrexitShambles, and as @jeremycorbyn continues to dodge supporting a #FinalSay, he is just letting it happen. Be it Tories or Labour, it is all the same mess. 
A fresh wave of young people turning 18 means that if the Brexit vote was re-run the UK would remain in the EU.

BBC Lunchtime News doing a special on BREXIT and broadcasting from?  Salford university as it the obvious place you would expect to have a neutral point of view not like a university to be left wing or Remain biased.  More project fear on hyper drive now 
Public trust in politicians on immigration is at an all-time low of just 13%.Brexit must ensure that Britain takes back control of its borders and addresses the issue of uncontrolled mass migration. To not do so would be a huge betrayal of the vote! 
The outrageous and barely concealed racism and misogyny that is hurled towards #GinaMiller exposes the real reason why many people voted for Brexit - they just can't handle intelligent people who are in any way different from them. 
Woah. Have just seen detail of how the EC handled an apparent (and serious) DUP referendum related failure. Complete. Joke. More to follow…  
How many times have I heard the cliche 'our children are our future' used by a variety of people to claim a variety of things. Don't speak in their name: LET THEM SPEAK! Let them decide about their future!They (78%) want to be part of the #EU!!#Brexit @Femi_Sorry 
Best Brexit analysis ever?  
Thousands of @UKLabour members have voted to submit 150+ Conference motions on Brexit, 100+ calling for a #PeoplesVoteThere can be no watering down, kicking the can down the road or amending to fit current policy.They were submitted to change Policy. 
Femi went on #BBCBreakfast to explain why young people don't want Brexit (78% in today's YouGov poll) and why even Brexit voters don't want THIS Brexit. @Femi_Sorry 
What a wondrous thing to hear our English colonial friends warn Scotland we have no gumption nor enterprise to get ourselves out of economic chaos after reinstating independence, yet now boast how easily Brits will get themselves out of economic chaos after Brexit. @thehistoryguy 
The #IMF says 'all Brexit outcomes' will entail costs for the UK economy, and that closing a deal with the #EU will be 'critical' 
The real reason Brexiters are desperate to avoid a #PeoplesVote on any final #Brexit deal is very simple.They think that they would lose it.This is usually the reason why people wish to avoid a vote, but they will come up with all sorts of nonsense to disguise it. 
REPORT: Public trust in politicians on immigration has collapsed to just 13%. Brexit is an opportunity to take back control of our borders, and stick to the 10,000s net migration promise!  
Remaining in the EU would be better for UK economy than any kind of Brexit deal, IMF says  
Whatever happens with Brexit, Scotland will always be able to hold a vote on its future, says @weegingerdug.I applaud his optimism, but can't shake the feeling that delaying is going to make life an awful lot harder for us...

I'm just astonished by the utter failure of any of either major party to step up and take a decisive stand on the critical issues of how to manage (or delay, or stop) Brexit. The whole thing is like a fever dream where you can't seem to affect the outcome of events. 
My guess is he'll be telling Spain to up the aggression on the UK re Gibraltar, because of Brexit, without even mentioning the bits of land Spain has on the North African coast.  
He has fucked up London and now he wants to fuck up Brexit too. What a turd!

#TelegraphView: Sadiq Khan should stop talking about a second referendum and step back into obscurity 
A Brexit deal between the UK & EU has been reached with the deal to be unveiled in November. Our only hope is brexiteer Tory MPs make a leadership challenge or Parliament votes down the deal. May has sold us out & colluded with the EU to stop a real Brexit  
Bernard Jenkin is a LIAR: if he never wanted the #EURef, why did he vote for it and then spend the past three years telling us how great Brexit would be? These people should be in jail. #PeoplesVote 
The People's Vote campaign and the fight against Brexit is on the march and The New European has been there every step of the way. But we need your help in the battle.  
So basically, Theresa, @theresa_may not only does Brexit NOT mean Brexit, but 'no deal' is not better (according to you) than a 'bad deal' (according to everyone). You really are a lying disgrace to this country aren't you?  
Nick Clegg wants to stop #Brexit.Nick Clegg is negotiating with the EU behind UK's back.Nick Clegg wants leaders to have a TV debate.Nick Clegg...Nick Clegg...Here's Nick Clegg, the hypocrite, laid bare.  
Labour's position on Brexit is indistinguishable from the Tories, says @thatginamiller at #LDConf #PeoplesVote #ExitFromBrexit 
Basically, Michael Gove is suggesting a cobbled together bad Brexit deal and then tear it all up after we leave the EU. A typically mendacious statement from Gove. He’s sugggesting a hard Brexit by surreptitious, disingenuous, underhand scheming.  
Looking forward to chairing this brilliant event on Sunday at #Lab18, hearing from a whole host of speakers on how we stop a Tory #Brexit

Outrageous that John Major has been meeting EU leaders to persuade them to keep Britain in the EU. Doesn't he remember what he said before the referendum?  
Let’s stop the nonsense and admit this phoney war is really about Brexit. Then all sides can come out and fight to the finish, writes Mick Hume.  
It seems the Political Establishment never accepted the Referendum result. 
UK economy will shrink without Brexit deal: IMF  
A huge majority of UK voters say Brexit negotiations have been handled badly. What did we expect with Remainers flooding Whitehall & No 10?The referendum result was only half the revolution. The Westminster swamp must be drained to ensure we see the radical change we voted for!  
Farage and co keep repeating "people know what they voted for"And yet.....The most Googled question in the UK about the issue in THE LAST TWO weeks was “when is Brexit?” followed by “what is Brexit?”  
Christine Lagarde: "All the likely Brexit scenarios will have costs for the UK economy, and to a lesser extent the EU"IMF chief warns no-deal #Brexit carries greatest risk to UK economy  
With a Brexit deal, it really is quite simple: A no deal is worse than a bad deal. A bad deal is worse than a good deal.Any deal is worse than the current deal. 
Nigel Farage likening the Brexit to marriage vows. In other news, Farage's first marriage ended in divorce and he's currently separated from his second wife.  
Everyone - including the BBC - must see that the choice is between Remaining in the EU with the excellent deal we already have, and ANY form of Brexit, the most optimistic of which is seriously harmful. #PeoplesVote

Another interesting legal challenge from @GoodLawProject. We know the DUP's referendum donation is shrouded in murk thanks to excellent digging by @openDemocracy & @BBCSpotlightNI...so why has @ElectoralCommUK refused to investigate it? This aims to force them to do just that.. 
FARAGE: Lord Adonis is an 'extreme EU nationalist'.Adonis wants a public inquiry into the people behind Brexit, that'll be 17.4m people then!  
Demand that @peoplesvote_uk⁩...                     or as I just said Emperor Brexit is stark bollock naked!                            No clothes, no plan, no Brexit.  
Great to hear @catherinemep at #LibDemConf saying that British people should not only "call for" but "demand" a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal - @peoplesvote_uk 
An exclusive @YouGov poll for #DRUGSTORECULTURE has revealed that Britain will become a Remain-supporting nation two months before #Brexit. Today, we launch proudly supporting @peoplesvote_uk, @FFSake_ and @OFOCBrexit. A change is coming. #StartHere 
The Labour leadership, like the Tory hard right, sees a No Deal Brexit and the misery it would inflict on millions of ordinary people as a political opportunity. When they tell you how much they care about the poor, the vulnerable and the left behind, just remember that.

Maybot appears to be stuck on two rubbish options. Fortunately, the country has many more options, including ditching Brexit entirely. 
IMF says 'all Brexit outcomes' will entail costs for the UK  
This is what I don't get...WHY???...why would the boss of Jaguar/ Landrover "make it up"? How does he or his company benefit? These #Brexit nuts are outnumbered a 1000 to one by experts in every field and all they can retort is #projectfear. 
UK must heed IMF's 'clear warnings' on no-deal Brexit: Hammond  
For the past two years, the sore losers in the Remain camp have been allowed to whine, to stamp their little petulant feet, and to keep the illusion Brexit can be stopped. It cannot. We ARE leaving the EU and its every edifice. 
#LBC  Now we’ve got that halfwit James I hate Brexit O’ Brien on LBC. 5 days a week Brexit bashing morning, noon, & night. The worst radio presenter on anywhere on the radio. Don’t you ever shut up you bloody bore about Brexit. Worth voting leave see you cry everyday.

UK faces 'significantly worse' outlook if no Brexit deal: IMF  
.@theresa_may says we will leave with ‘no-deal’ if Parliament doesn’t back her ‘Chequers Deal’.What she fails to say is that there’s a third way: a General Election..@UKLabour are not at #Brexit war & will negotiate a deal for the 52 AND the 48.Let @Keir_Starmer take over. 
UK economy would suffer ‘substantial costs’ in no-deal Brexit, IMF says  
International Monetary Fund says the range of Brexit issues left to prepare for is "daunting" and all Brexit outcomes will entail costs for the UK economy 
Excellent article by @BorisJohnson "We are heading for a car crash Brexit under Theresa May's Chequers plan" 
Tony Blair, Nick Clegg & John Major met EU leaders in secret attempting to prevent brexit. Hard to believe that so much dross and failure could be assembled in one place. Major cost Britain 14 billion pounds, Clegg bored it to death and Blair flooded us with immigrants. 
EU must do all it can to avoid hard Brexit: Austrian chancellor  
Friends, colleagues, comrades, heroes.I’m off for a couple of weeks holiday. You know the drill: be good to each other, fight Brexit, fight the Tories, fight Trump, make some good jokes.Till soon x  
Breaking: @IMF warns “a ‘no deal’ Brexit on WTO terms would entail substantial costs for the UK economy - and to a lesser extent the EU economies”. Says challenges getting a deal done are “daunting” and warns against further interest rate rises. Ireland issue “remains unanswered” 
It's Chequers or no deal, says Theresa May, as Boris Johnson warns Brexit will be 'total write-off' unless she ditches Irish backstop 
1. In 2016 Scotland voted to give parties supporting a 2nd indyref in these circumstances a majority in @ScotParl2. In 2017 most constituencies voted for SNP MPs.So no, Scotland didn't ever vote for Brexit.  
The idea that the Brexit vote could have been tipped over the edge due to a small minority who think that the British Empire was our golden years....  
Brexit should be on CBeebies. 
President of NUS Wales: "I am calling on politicians at all levels to get their act together and make sure that we avoid the worst effects of Brexit."  
You begged us to lead, not leave in 2014.Then you shut all of our elected representatives out of law-making and debate.You were warned - repeatedly - that Brexit = indyref2. You don't get to whine now. 
"Uncertainty about future visa arrangements and the “right to remain” for EU citizens has left many employers concerned about access to international talent, with 48 per cent of those polled saying they expect Brexit to further restrict availability."  
Should we instead take Rees-Mogg seriously: a man who advocates no-deal Brexit and sanctions against Ireland, while his investment outfit opens operations in Dublin due to the impact of no-deal Brexit?  
Can you believe Nick Clegg said this just before the referendum campaign?  
Theresa May says it's either my deal or a no-deal. This is the stance of a gangster threatening to inflict massive harm on the British people if she doesn't get her own way. The British people are being treated as hostages by a criminal government #Brexit 
Scotland voted to:1. Remain in the UK The UK then voted to:2. Leave the EUSo yes, we did vote for #Brexit.  
imagine if they were wrong completely separate to their relation to brexit?  
“Chequers prevents us from deviating or innovating in so many key policy areas that the advantages of Brexit are simply removed. Unlike EU membership, where we had the right to leave, the backstop is eternal.”  
I'm worried that this whole Brexit thing might descend into farce. 
Bank of England governor Mark Carney is a wailing banshee who can’t be trusted on Brexit, says Jacob Rees-Mogg. #RingReesMogg  
There should be a fight between the man from Pimlico Plumbers and the man from Wetherspoons to decide whether we Brexit. 
Theresa May on Brexit: “It gives the United Kingdom opportunities as an independent and sovereign state to build a better future for all our people... I believe that our best days are ahead of us.”   
". . .those directly responsible. . ."That's 17.4 million of us to be  dragged before a Stalinist/Hitlerian mass show trial in the (Elite) People's Court & harangued for hours by unelected & self-appointed Brexit Votefinder-General Adonis, before being designated non-persons?  
NHS Lanarkshire: Brexit has the "potential to adversely disrupt continuity of delivery of healthcare services"  
This weekend, from Devon to Lincolnshire, to Talbot Green, we had stalls across the country campaigning for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Don't miss out on our National Action Day on Sept 29. Sign up now:  
Hey, @BBCBreakfast until you’re prepared to have actual trade experts on your show, I am not interested in what joe-public has to say. Get @JasonJHunter on and let’s get to core of the issue. #brexit #bbcbrexitBS 
Here is Michael Gove on Marr saying he will not challenge Viktor Orban, an anti-semite and a fascist, because it would make Brexit harder.  
A man on BBC Breakfast saying Brexit will be a big success because his wife grew some very nice tomatoes in the garden. The ideal poster boy for Brexit – all noisy self-confidence, absolutely no idea how international food supply chains work. 
New #AnywhereButWestminster series Brexit Breakdown begins! Simple question: in the midst of cuts & Brexit chaos, why are the Tories winning Walsall?  
First Minister @NicolaSturgeon has been urged to apologise over £30 billion North Sea oil 'lie' four years on from independence referendum.Read more here:  
The public will not accept the Prime Minister's cynical gerrymandering over Brexit. The alternative to whatever deal she negotiates is remaining in the EU, through a #PeoplesVoteIf May had any faith in Chequers, she'd ask the public to consent. 
Brilliant from @nuswales here - elected reps of 350,000 students  in Wales coming out in favour of a #PeoplesVote, and warn of dangers of No Deal Brexit. Brexit isn’t inevitable and students in Wales are joining growing calls for People’s Vote#FFS 
Overheard from Brexit supporter who has been on TV today: "Investment in Africa was higher under the British empire".Words... I don't have any... 
Brexit in name only or Brexit. The latter, please. 
Why should we listen to objections to a #PeoplesVote from people who kept fighting for a rerun of the 1975 referendum until they got the result they wanted?  
Followers of the increasingly desperate attempt to build #brexit myths will note a historical regressionFirst, the BlitzThen Empire, nextAn invocation to AgincourtNow 1066…Back where next?Expect the Witangemot  in next week’s farcical Johnson piece@jonlis1@GuitarMoog 
Why is @BBCr4today and MSM giving airtime to minority issues from unelected, undemocratic forces such as Clegg, Blair, Major and Miller? 85% of people at last GE voted for Leave parties. #BBCR4today We are Global Britain, let's unite behind #Brexit and our brilliant future. 
The. People. Voted. Out.When Brexit is over, there should be an enquiry into all the anti-democratic, unelected flotsam currently in positions of power  
Not impressed with Theresa May's 12 point Brexit plan tbh  
The Brexit vote is but the beginning. The rumblings of discontent in Hungary, Italy, Greece, and the rise of right-wing parties in Germany, Austria and Sweden, are all a response to the tyranny of the mad cult that is the EU, writes @patrickxwest 
Ok everyone, it is becoming clearer that Brexit is indeed going to be catastrophic. Should we really wait until the full effects are felt in Scotland? Out of the EU, no protection against a WM power grab. EU nationals deported, Scotland once more under Tory rule. Do we want this?  
350 million per week was promised. A so-called Brexit Dividend is promised. Meanwhile, NHS hospitals throughout the country continue to sit underfunded & understaffed. Remaining staff are leaving in droves.Brexit will make this worse. The evidence is already here to see:  
READ: Brexit poses a 'very high' risk of disruption, warns major Health board - rather than getting a boost from Brexit, our NHS is being damaged by Brexit. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote. Please RT: 
A welcome optimistic read to start the week! @BBC Why Brexit is a gift to the world  
#bbcbreakfast guest talking about #Brexit “We’re the envy of the world” and we can manufacture and grow our own crops if need be. Absolute. Fucking. Idiots. 
An excellent summary of the ahistorical drivel we've been subjected to in the name of Brexit.  
A Brexit deal is within sight - if the Tories could stop fighting for long enough to look. Leading article in the new @spectator: 
No deal it is then!Suits me.Bring it on!Viva Brexit! 
Brextremists like Bernard Jenkin dismiss concerns of a business that employs tens of thousands of people in Britain in pursuit of their ideological damaging, hard Brexit. This is exactly why we're demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal:  
U.S. defense chief warns against Russian meddling in Macedonian referendum | Reuters  
When YOUR child has had 17 surgeries in 3yrs, THEN you will 100% understand that having the BEST people for the job is infinitely more important than what country they come from. #Brexit will deprive us of a multitude of medical talent - it's a tragedy that WILL cost lives. 
Your occasional reminder, there is an alternative to a 'no-deal Brexit' or a 'Brexit deal' ... it's called stay in the EU. For the love of sanity, let's do that ... (As you were ...) 
There is a massive propaganda campaign underway at the moment to bring about a second referendum towards the interests of the hidden Establishment. They are trying to bend the heads of weak people with fear. We must do all we can to counter this. #ProjectFearLeadsToProjectTyranny 
Great to hear @bbcnickrobinson on BBC Radio 4 asking: “And what about those who just want to see Brexit stopped... ?”  Very pleased that BBC finally engaging with this option — which is important to many people & increasing rapidly in likelihood. 
This only happens in places like Macedonia & the US, never of course in a UK referendum: “Voters have been besieged by a flurry of social media fakery that Macedonian and Western officials say is directed by Russian-backed groups and aimed at depressing the vote.” 
75% of Britons don't know who their MP is. And yet the Brexiteers insist that everyone who voted in the EU referendum knew what they were voting for. It's a nonsense.  
Theresa May now on @BBCr4today still peddling the ‘Brexit dividend’ for NHS lie.We do not send ‘vast sums’ to the EU. Our net contribution is 0.5% GDP... We’ve already lost 2% GDP growth thru Brexit. We’ll not have money to give to NHS, we’ll have debt & cuts to spread. 
We are heading for a car crash Brexit under Theresa May's Chequers plan.  If May won’t change her mind, and she won’t, No Deal WTO is by far the best option..  
Predictably, Nick Robinson fails utterly to challenge May on her (twice repeated) claim we send (and will be able to redirect) vast sums to Brussels. It’s 1% of govt spending and every Brexit scenario painted by the govt itself says we’ll be worse off. #r4today @BBCRadio4 
May repeats outrageous lie UK will become a ‘fully independent state’.1) Why on earth did she support the ‘subordination’ of membership?2) Why won’t she say she’d vote for Brexit now?3) How does becoming a lobbyist & rule-taker under Chequers give us independence?#r4today 
Tory MP Sir Bernard Jenkin just simultaneously dismissed warnings from the boss of Jaguar who said that a no-deal Brexit would lead to job losses by saying he was "making it up" - while also carrying on the pretense that the Tories are the party of business. Can't do both... 
A Full Brexit can revive democratic politics, transform our economic model and forge a true internationalism  
Your arrogance is staggering & extreme to say the least. May I remind you that it was the largest voter participation in history with a clear majority of parliamentary constituencies voting leave even after a £9 million Cameron leaflet campaign.Try &show a little respect! #Brexit  
So this rotten, divided Brexit imposing party are saying that if they can’t get their rotten hard Brexit deal through they will just leave the EU in a cloud of no deal chaos. If they can’t get it through we should resort to the status quo. We stay.  
We’re calling on Government & Parliament to support a touring visa for musicians post-Brexit.    Any EU touring visa must be affordable, multi-entry, admin-light and cover all EU member states.     #WorkingInTheEU

It’s Monday.Good morning, @theresa_may.73% of the British population didn’t vote for #Brexit.I know, I know, Leave won the referendum vote.But you know the result was criminally procured.Digest that with your cornflakes.Ask the people again.#PeoplesVote 
Brexit could hit opportunities to study and work overseas, claims @nuswales 
One immense frustration about Brexit is how the Brexiteers have been able to own patriotism. What's patriotic about wilfully putting people on the dole and unleashing social division? This is the opposite of patriotism, it's the selfishness of a distant elite. 
As Prime Minister, Theresa May has endlessly repeated 4 entirely false and dishonest mantras: 1) No Early Election 2) Brexit Means Brexit 3) Strong And Stable and now 4) No Alternative to Chequers. That last one does not stand up to even the most cursory scrutiny. #chuckchequers 
Why should we listen to a man who said “no one is talking about leaving the single market” during the referendum campaign and then reneged on it afterwards? #PeoplesVote 
The arrogance of @theresa_may (amplified by @bbcnews in saying only choice is her deal v no deal. The country wants neither and if her deal is defeated there has to be @peoplesvote_uk and more and more want no Brexit 
After weaponising the Irish border for two years in order to derail Brexit, the EU now agrees that a high tech customs solution is possible.  
BORIS: Chequers means foreign rule, total write-off of Brexit.“Swallowing the camel of EU membership in all but name.” 
Embarrassing. The Conservative Party is the party of business. I’m backing Raif Speth & all the other business leaders & trade unions who are being honest about the disaster of a #NoDeal hard  #Brexit & are increasingly backing @peoplesvote_uk 
Brexit latest: *any* deal agreed with the EU will be vastly inferior to membership but vastly superior to ‘no deal’. What a bloody mess. 
U.S. defense chief warns against Russian meddling in Macedonian referendum  
“@theresa_may has just 3 months to replace her controversial Chequers plan for Brexit” @DavidDavisMP has warnedWith the noises coming out of EU, re NI border, it would be much better if No.10 chucked Chequers now, delivering great news for Conference  
That is democracy in action. The only time that one vote ends debate is in a dictatorship. These folk know Brexit is disastrous for the U.K. That you and your cohort have been entirely incapable of putting forward a rational argument and exit strategy is your fault,not theirs.  
Boris writes,“If the Brexit negotiations continue on this path they will end, I am afraid, in a spectacular political car crash.”He’s right. The future for the UK alongside the EU must be based on an advanced FTA plus a range of agreements   
...likewise on Brexit. The Labour membership is not a bunch of extras: they send delegates to conference to vote and debate the issues. 150 branches want to debate Brexit. Democracy is what makes us strong. 
'We have voted to run our own country, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, 'til death do us part' says Nigel Farage, insisting the last two years of #Brexit negotiations have been good for Great Britain.  
One of the reasons why consultations with industry and citizens are broken over #Brexit: If you say something people don’t want to hear, you are dismissed as making things up. To say it bluntly: this way there won’t be FTAs that work, nor laws. This way, the UK will fail.  
#Brexit is the perfect deflector shield. While our A&Es and ambulance service and mental health services collapse; while homelessness rockets; while working people have to go to food banks and children go hungry, the Tories squabble over #Brexit and our media report the squabbles 
You turn up one day saying, "I'm leaving my job".Your kids say, what's the plan? "I don't have one"What's the benefit, "none"How to pay the mortgage, "no idea"Why, "I want my independence"You're a selfish irresponsible idiot. Now scale that to a country. Brexit 
The real story in this is that there is anybody who believes the Tories have handled their Brexit ‘well’. Never before has an issue of such huge importance been handled with such chaotic, clueless abandon.  
Makes me weep. Westminster twiddling around with this Brexit debacle and internal petty party squabbles while innocents suffer.   
#r4today used to be a programme that started my day with. I can no longer do so. How can they allow Bernard Jenkin to go unchallenged with his comments on Janguar landrover are "making it up" on the effects of brexit. V poor journalism. This is now a daily occurance. 
Let’s go “no deal” then as #ChequersPlan is worthless and a betrayal of Brexit  
Experts & facts:Brexit is increasingly seen as a potential calamity with which the UK gov has failed to engage. Likelihood of disruption to our food supply, incl unharvested produce & empty supermarket shelves; likely to have the quickest & most direct impact on the UK populace.  
He then went on to say that no-deal Brexit would be better than Chequers... and the hit wouldn’t be that bad.But then why did he begin the interview with his disclaimer? Maybe they know they’re in too deep... and are feeling uncomfortable with their two bad options. 
As usual, Boris is right on the money, describing Theresa May's obsessive pursuit of Chequers as a “spectacular political car crash” and a “total write-off of Brexit".Support us at  
@BBCr4today doing its usual #BrexitBroadcastingCorporation job today - all about ‘fight’ between Mrs May and Mr Johnson. But what about the people’s vote, with the option to stop Brexit, which is where the public now is? 
Andrew Adonis is no Democrat.Andrew Adonis wants people involved with Brexit to be barred from public office.I agree with AdonisThe first person to be barred should be Adonis who has tried to weaken our position in the talks.Adonis the weasel should be barred from  tv screens  
Tory Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin sayd Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralph Speth is "making up" warnings over the consequences of a no-deal Brexit. #r4today 
LOL! Lead Brexit advocate Bernard Jenkin *just said* on @BBCr4today that he never wanted to leave the EU - he had always wanted to reform it from inside.Amazing. He actually started the interview by saying that... 
This is English history he is referring to. Underlining credible theory Brexit is an English nationalist project, ignorant of Irish and Scottish concerns. The Act of Union was signed 7 centuries after 1066. 
Torygraph the Daily Johnson Theresa May’s Chequers Brexit means our leaders would accept Foreign Rule for the first time since William the Conquerer and Harold lost his eye in 1066... Hahahaha!!!!!!

For 3 yrs+ Remoaners told us we HAD to have a hard border in Northern Ireland.For 3 yrs+ #Brexit supporters said this was utter nonsense.Today the EU have said it can be sorted with technology & trusted trader status.Chalk that up to another Remain lie.....like we always KNEW.

There's only one reason why Leavers are so strongly opposed to a new referendum, and that's that they think they'll lose. They're quite right, and that's the very reason why we absolutely have to have one.

"What is brexit" most googled question. Not 2 years ago, but NOW. When you have found out the consequences,  we welcome you to be a #RemainerNow 
The big problem is our media, in particular the BBC, which allows a torrent of brexit/leave nonsense from the ERG, without holding them to account. The interviewers, with a few exceptions are useless, or complicit. 
This is the demographic of those who still think Brexit is a good idea. It’s not just an age thing. I made this a few months ago as an easy to follow distillation.

Don’t “regret” it, Vince, OWN it. You’re the one in the party that went into coalition with the Tories & pushed through brutal austerity that subsequently, yes, led to Brexit vote. We will never forget what you helped orchestrate & push through. You had a choice & that was it.  
Just like Brexit, all roads in #Bodyguard lead back to David Cameron 
This is a superb piece of reporting. Our food industry inextricably interdependent with EU. Shortages inevitable post Brexit. Food and Brexit: will our cupboards be bare?

If you haven't connected the dots between Tory/Lib Dem coalition government before Theresa May, austerity, child poverty and how this contributed to UK's #Brexit vote - then you need to pay attention.  
On Tuesday. Not often you will get a public debate between a Tory Brexit facilitator and an SNP MP who believes the whole project is the most destructive cluelessness.  
This is significant. @RachelReevesMP was one of those Remainer MPs who was saying immediately after the referendum that we must "respect the vote" & "listen to people's valid concerns on immigration"Expect more repositioning from Labour MPs before conference  
When brexit is ratified please can the deal include deporting extreme remainers to Brussels. 
Respecting' the referendum result means supporting a result won by cheating, lies and undeliverable promises.  There is nothing democratic about that - nothing.@UKLabour @Conservatives

In seven weeks, that's it. The Brexit negotiations are over. There will be no more "I wonder what deal we'll get".So let's have a think: 
Hey @AndrewMarr9 Why didn't you mention on your show that the #Brexit vote was even more tainted than we thought & ask how a vote won with such illegality & lies can be allowed to stand?.. Oh yes, I forgot you blocked me for asking awkward questions.  
Theresa May’s Brexit plan is to keep the whole of the UK in the EU... without any say or any rights, the worst deal ever and the Tories will swallow it just to stay in power, they’ll lie and cheat to everyone  
The front page of tomorrow's Daily Telegraph: 'May's Irish Brexit plan is a disaster, warns Boris' #tomorrowspaperstoday 
Is astonishing.For Brexiteers to get an In/Out EU Referendum in 2015. They had to vote for parties pledging it.The vote was honoured and Referendum carried out.Remainers think that they can bypass that process in General Election and just go straight to a repeat Referendum. 
Gove is right. A future PM can suggest a change of EU relationship (further out or back in) - first they'll need to get it past their party, put it (probably with a referendum) in a manifesto, and win a general election and get it through. Can't see why this is controversial. 
4.5 million children are living in poverty in the U.K. >> There’s tough competition to pick the worst thing Cameron and May have done but, Brexit aside, rolling back hard fought gains on child poverty has to be it.

Boris Johnson: "We are heading for a car crash Brexit. And you know what's funny? I'm actually the main person responsible for the mess we are in now."#Brexit  
“It’s too soon for people to have changed their minds…”A reminder that by the time Article 50 comes into effect, 2 years 9 months will have elapsed since the referendum.The time between the last two general elections was 2 years and 1 month.

The Anti- BREXIT Campaign by Sky TV News continues. This time it interviews a foreign politician SF to state that Btexit would result in NI leaving the UK. Of course SF would say that. But time to interview an UK politician from NI on the same issue. NI will remain in UK! 
I hugely admire Gavin’s stand on Brexit. I also LOVE Canterbury - not just that cathedral, uni & Labour MP - it was a lecture at the uni in 2009 where I set out the case for high-speed rail linking our major cities, following the Treaty of Canterbury between Thatcher & Mitterrand  
As a Philosopher, I would like to remind you all, that a correlation doesn’t neccessary yet mean causality.#Brexit  
Hi @RobertSyms we would really appreciate it if you’d join our campaign to #StandUp4Brexit The referendum must be respected as well as the Conservative party manifesto. Please let us know.

"Brexit is more damaging than the financial crisis, and the damage will be more lasting."  
Even if the worst forecasts about Brexit prove untrue, and it's not as severe as that, the fact remains that the government, who are doing this on purpose, can only list potential problems and not a single benefit.  Our political system has failed.

BBC news are currently reporting that "Sadiq Khan has called for a second EU referendum." does anyone have a source on that? his piece in the Guardian refers to a "final say;" there's no talk of re-running the 2016 referendum.  #PeoplesVote #FinalSay 
Co-ordinated soft-soap media messages which ignores the central point - No UK Govt could accept NI being locked into a separate regulatory, customs &  jurisdictional regime from GB. Beware May’s Brexit & unionist betrayal.  
The current British government may agree to honour what they agreed to in the Brexit negotiations. But who knows what the next government will do?  
Deutsche to shift more assets to Frankfurt, ringfence UK operations after Brexit: source  
I had a hard time watching Darkest Hour. Churchill's was the England I grew up in. Imperfect, eccentric, but willing to stand up against fascism. Brexit makes it seem like we've rebooted history, and kept the appeasers Chamberlain, Halifax and Edward VIII in charge.  
"EU protects UK jobs" is the biggest lie we've been told during this whole #Brexit furore.Here's @FT in 2010, before they became an EU propaganda rag.@UKLabour used to be unhappy about this, before they abandoned the Working Class. 
As Gove has confirmed that a future Govt could renege on any negotiated deal, it effectively rules one out as an option in a People’s Vote. It’s now a straight choice between a No Deal Brexit or Remain and reform. Thanks, Mr Gove, for making the choice a simpler one! 
I’ve just found a page in my notebook that says: “JOURNALISM IDEAS” then the sentence: “Deliveroo in a post-Brexit world?” and nothing else. 
Dear Leavers, starting from tomorrow morning in your tweets, please can we have:*no adjectives*no swearing*no diversions*no ranting about "EU tyranny" etc*just numbers and their assumptions about Brexit's costs or gains.Thank you. The UK. 
Austria, Germany agree on need to avoid hard Brexit: Kurz  
Replace 'Brexit' with HS2 and I'm with you.  
Today on #Marr, Michael Gove basically accepted that the Brexit deal was going to be bad, telling us not to worry because we'll renegotiate later.These people lied to you that Brexit would go well, and they're still asking you to just trust them!!Aren't you smarter than that?  
In Feb 2017, 5,000 @UKLabour Members signed our letter calling for opposition to Brexit.We asked Jeremy Corbyn, as a democratic socialist, to hear our voices.At #Lab18, with over 100 #PeoplesVote motions, it is now or never to prove the Members count. 
The mayor said the U.K. currently faces two “incredibly risky” options -- either a bad or a "no deal" Brexit.  
The more desperate Remain gets the more it panders to the cult of the NHS and virtue signalling lefty causes. It's almost like there was a message at the referendum and they didn't hear it at all.

The UK has more in common with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and even America than it does with the EU. We have deep and historic links with India, Malaysia, Kenya and Ghana. We are in the Commonwealth club with Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Brexit is a release. 
If the Senate majority does not handle this fairly & ethically, the election will become a referendum on the fairness of the process, esp. to women.  If that happens, the Senate majority will very shortly no longer be the Senate majority.  
There are many in this country who doubt the virtues of voting. Many who voted in the referendum for the first time. What do we say to them if we do not act on the result - indeed, if we reverse it - because the likes of this elite think we voted “the wrong way”?  
In this article, I tell @MetroUK that after years of austerity, #Brexit is adding devastation to the NHS and paving the way for £multi-billion healthcare firms (incl US) to accelerate privatisation. The NHS community is now fiercely against Brexit. 
Catch me on BBC Breakfast tomorrow at 9am talking all things Brexit. 
The thought of not being able to drive your car to France, because your driving licence will no longer be valid in the EU, will alarm Britons wondering what a no-deal Brexit would mean  
‘So you’re saying leaving the EU is impossible,’ he says. No. Not impossible. Just incredibly damaging. Argue for Brexit if you want, but have the decency to be honest about what it means. And don’t ever call me unpatriotic or undemocratic for calling you out on it. (3/3)  
Yes it will Liam Fox. EU said no cherry picking. Leave campaign said they'd do as we told them as they need us more than we need them. That was a lie.All EU has done has stuck to its word, unlike UK. No deal is fault of Brexit fantasists.

Brexit will rip ‘the soul out of the NHS’ says SfEU’s Dr Mike Galsworthy, as record number of NHS/health workers demand a #PeoplesVote ...and the @NHSvBrexit campaign launches. 
When I point out to the editor of Brexit Central that no-deal = grounded aircraft, things really kick off. He argues we can sign 27 bilateral agreements. I point out that will take years if indeed we do it at all. This isn’t taking back control. This is out of control. (2/3)  
The 544 MPs who voted for the referendum to happen, or the 17.4million voters who backed Brexit?  
Why doesn’t Sadiq Khan do what he’s paid to do and look after London. Young black men are being murdered on the city’s streets and he’s bleating  about a 2nd referendum.

Someone help here. Indy1 - a consensual plan to a *fault* - was rendered as a near-systemic meltdown. No-deal Brexit - where *food/medical supply chains BREAKDOWN* - is rendered as a kind of festive, character-building experience. When do we walk away from these idiot buccaneers? 
London mayor calls for second referendum on Brexit, says negotiations are 'mired in confusion'  
There is a reason why people of ALL parties have come out in support of a #PeoplesVote: We may disagree on the type of house we want our society to be... but we all know we need bricks!A general election wouldn't solve this. Brexit is beyond party politics. 
Stop fighting against Brexit and start fighting for what happens next  
All done quietly, systematically and with the full intention of stitching the UK so far into the EU political project that we could never escape. Brexit is our last & only chance! #brexit  
.@BrandonLewis seems to forget the @CONservatives have a (bought) majority. Instead of attacking @UKLabour, Brandon, get your own house in order. If @Theresa_May can't get her Brexit deal through Parliament, that's her problem.Maybe she shouldn't have called that election!

Let's never forget what was said by @UKLabour at the time of the #EURef, when they were campaigning to remain in the EU.#Brexit is freedom for the Working Class.Remain is our slavery, continued & enhanced.  
If a Labour MP had argued that collusion with the most notorious anti-Semite in Europe was somehow 'necessary for Brexit' the resignation demands would be deafening by now.The mainstream media silence on Gove's comments speak volumes.  
There. Will. Not. Be. A. Second. Referendum.*So get used to it & move on *For at least 40 years 
I remember during the referendum when Gove cited the rise of the far-right in Europe as an earnest reason for Brexit...Right at the same time his Vote Leave campaign had all that propaganda about 75m Turks coming from Arab regions to flood our country & plague our NHS.  
Whilst Gove is right that we can exit a treaty with the EU whenever we fancy post-Brexit, it's pretty bad form if the UK govt is seeking to enter a Treaty with the EU *already intending* to withdraw from it within, say, 5 yrs! What does the EU side think of that? 
'The only people coming out and calling for a second referendum are those who backed Remain in the first one...most people just want the government to get on with delivering Brexit' says @isaby 
Refusing a #PeoplesVote on Brexit is like buying a Timeshare apartment under duress, and refusing to make use of your cancellation period because you gave the sales-team your word. 
Absolutely. Will never forget reading @carolecadwalla expose of the crimes behind Brexit. Uncovering the cesspit beneath the referendum was amazing and showed how Brexitbnever was the people's will. #Countthewins #StopBrexit

Chequers deal could be undone after Britain leaves the EU says Gove. Why should anyone trust a Brexiter? Especially this one, who sat on the committee of the law-breaking Vote Leave campaign. #PeoplesVote #brexit #StopBrexit 
The 2016 referendum was anything but 'undemocratic' Ben & the biggest mandate ever delivered in British history, people across the political divide turned out in large numbers to vote, many had never voted previously. Parliamentary procedure approved the vote & triggered Art50.  
I don't mind @Andrew_Adonis demanding a public enquiry (Twitter?), but a public inquiry (if that's what he means) is different. Those directly responsible include 544 MPs & 293 Peers who passed the European Union Referendum Bill 2015, and Her Majesty the Queen, who made it an Act  
I don't like referendums. If May gets a deal with EU and then through Parliament I'll go with that. But to insist that we must slavishly follow result of one referendum even to disaster while dismissing another - with different question - as undemocratic is absurd and cowardly. 
So I've been chatting with Brexit supporters today. Almost without exception, their responses have been patronising, gloating, sneering & dismissive. Not one has tried to explain their reason for voting Leave, or why they believe we're better off out.Oh well.#PeoplesVote 
But I’ll finish on a positive note. Today @ObserverUK called for a second referendum and I’m proud to write for that newspaper. I believe the mood is turning. Brexit has been recognised as a self inflicted national disaster. We need to stop it. We shall.  
I am left with the impression that the leavers voted for Brexit not because they had analysed the facgs, but just out of some knee jerk reaction to something that didn’t quite suit their narrow antiquated world view. Today has been another just like that. It’s depressing 3/ 
For the past 2 years I’ve been writing detailed, reported pieces about the negative impact of Brexit. I make sure to gather robust evidence, precisely because it’s so complex. None of the rabid tweets from brexiteers in response has ever contained a verifiable or accurate fact 1/ 
U.S Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is soon wheels up to Skopje, Macedonia ahead of a key referendum that would open the door for the Balkan country to join NATO. Media on the plane is @Reuters @AP @AFP 
Doing a Brexit world tour with a restored Spitfire is just another example of the Tories trying to solve 21st century problem with 20th century nostalgia. 
The bureaucrats of Brussels and the politicians in Berlin and Paris are terrified of one thing: having a massive, high-consumer-spending, globally competitive economy right on their doorstep. EU27 companies will flock into the UK, post-Brexit. It is in OUR interests to Leave. 
Corbyn made the wrong call. If he has any grace, he'll admit he made a mistake, and back a #PeoplesVote. Personally, I suspect his ego is too big, and he'd rather go down trying to save his precious Brexit.

Murdo as a so called politician, if you don't know how much more damaging Brexit will be,  compared to an iScotland in the single market. Then you absolutely,  unequivocally are a waste of a salary and should not be in our parliament!! 
Maybe Ruth Davidson has realised she's peaked? She'll never be PM, she'll never be FM and Brexit will destroy her party. For someone so clearly lacking in talent or political skill, she's gotten remarkably far. She'd be wise to walk away now, before she has to *actually* work. 
The UK’s jobless rate is now down to 4% ( a forty year low) with wages growing at 2.9% thus outstripping inflation. These figures and the possibility this year of greater growth than in France and Germany all come of course ‘despite Brexit’.So why isn’t Carney talking about them? 
Independence negates damage that Brexit will cause. We did not vote for Brexit, we can reflect on the mandate to let Scotland determine its future. Cannot be ripped out of Europe against our will. Westminster accepts the principle of claim of right, we can decide our own future.  
What @michaelgove is admitting here is that whatever his PM sells to us will be made even nastier once they've got rid of her. Let's stop the Brexit Establishment giving us a blindfold Brexit where we don't know the consequences until too late.

‘Attention to detail is noticeable by its absence’ that’s the core of how #UK is approaching #Brexit- lots of grandstanding but little attention to detail. The society not well served.   
So, our post-Brexit position will be so strong that we cannot speak truth to power but have to kowtow to anti-semites and the like for fear of not finding the economic shelter we need to weather the storm we brought on ourselves. What a fabulous way to take back control.  
Sir Vince Cable admits 'regret' coalition austerity policies may have led to Brexit vote  
Think Sadiq Khan is desperately hoping that backing a 2nd referendum will distract from the fact that he has utterly failed to address the crime wave in London 
Why should anyone who voted Remain lift a finger to help Brexit? You broke it you fix it, don't start trying to shift the blame because you've finally realised there are consequences to Brexit. Remember how easy it was all going to be? What went wrong, clue it wasn't Remainers.  
Yet again misguided UK negotiating ‘strategy’. Clearly Gove et al want bare bones Brexit deal - w/Irish border fudged - that can push further after WA. Many in EU would even accept this. But saying this so publicly is awful strategy. Dublin watching on, doubtless calling friends

Over two years since the Brexit vote and the Tory Brextremists STILL haven't come up with a workable Brexit plan, and now Gove is accusing other people of wanting to cause "chaos".The absolute brass neck on him! 
Ie, the enormous damage to working people Brexit will occasion is a price worth paying to accelerate the moment of a general election which we could win.  
Not really we had a people's vote - it was called the EU referendum.If you want a '2nd referendum' on how to leave go for it i.e. deal or no dealAnything else is l smoke and mirrors by bad losers who can't get over the result of the first 'people vote' aka the EU referendum 
“midterms..will be the clearest referendum on a president in..80 years. Republicans scrambling to hold the House & Senate have been struggling in vain to make the election about other issues..to avoid [it] being about Trump. This has failed, bigly.”

Sadiq Khan has been criticised for calling for a new Brexit referendum to allow the British public a "fresh say on our future", but the London Mayor previously told LBC after the 2016 vote that the result should be respected. 
If there were a second referendum there would be a 101 attack ads like this. And they’d be right. I still think too many politicians don’t recognise the low esteem in which politics is held. It’s like they actively want it to fall lower. Staggering.

Gove has let the cat out of the bag, noting a future PM can "choose to alter the relationship" with the EU after Brexit.  Let's not kid ourselves that the Brextremists will accept Chequers EVEN IF they vote it through. Their 2nd push would begin a day later for a Hard Brexit. 
Should be breaking news and trending everywhere the Gove has effectively admitted he’s selling out Brexit to “compromise” with the hope to change later. Shameful. He should resign and #StandUp4Brexit

I get the impression there is always some truth within the unionist lies.Scottish independence may compound the economic damage the rUK suffers due to brexit: we didn't want it.How about the words of a seasoned economist who has worked for decades shaping government policy?  
"But we're not Greece" may well end up being Brexit's epitaph. 
Just seen someone responding to Sadiq's call for a second EU referendum by saying 'I suppose there'll be another mayoral election in case we've changed our mind about him too, then??', and it's like... literally yes? Every few years? 
Every day, a second EU referendum looks more vital and more popular.  A growing tide of support will soon become unstoppable. For Britain’s sake, Labour and Tory MPs should demand a People’s Vote 
This is crucial...the ERG Tories will break the #Brexit deal in future..#Labour even if in power (unlikely atm IMHO) won't always be. There is no good dealThe only option that retains Rights, Jobs, Influence, Control & prevents us getting Poorer is to #Remain in the EU & #Reform 
Here's the clip if you haven't seen it. Confirmation that Brexit has so weakened us we have to bend our knee even to far right, anti-semitic islamophobes "to get the best deal for Britain" (0.50 secs)  
#OTD 1974. Wilson launches Oct 74 manifesto: Britain Will Win With Labour. Commits to:- Planning Agreements - Nat Enterprise Board- Nationalisation of shipbuilding & aircraft - EEC Referendum- Elimination of NHS charges - Funding for Mental Health- Private rental cap  
BBC world news covers Brexit with interviews with May and Gove defending Chequers before a very long interview with Tom Baldwin of the People’s Vote demanding a second referendum. Those against Chequers are unrepresented but insulted by Baldwin. Just more BBC propaganda.

>@jeremycorbyn tweeted:"Our high streets used to be thriving. Labour will revive our towns and rebuild communities."Jeremy, here's what one shopworker in Truro has to say about what #Brexit is doing to our high streets.#PeoplesVote @Labour4EU @peoplesvote_uk @_Britain4Europe 
Do we have time?The EU position has been clear. We can stop this whenever we want.That's why the only circumstances under which they would extend the article 50 deadline past March 2019 would be if it was to hold a referendum where staying was an option. 
We asked Tory MP @ABridgen (who previously said 'negotiations with the EU have deteriorated into a state of complete capitulation') what part of #Brexit is going well. After asking who pays us - he said we'd have to 'wait & see' - which is clearly code for badly. #StopBrexit 
LIVE: “Brexit will hit the economy... any small changes in GDP will hit the lowest paid first and as we know women tend to be less well paid than men.”#WomenAgainstBrexit#PeoplesVote 
So proud of that flag flying over Westminster Abbey - view from my office window as I write my Chatham House lecture for tomorrow on ‘why we can and should stop Brexit’  
Oi Brexiters!! Ever heard of 'CAUSE and EFFECT'? Without #Brexit, we wouldn't have CAUSE to fight it. Without #Leavers, there would be no #Remainers. You made us, dipshits - we're the EFFECT. Deal with it. We're there right till the bitter end. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FinalSay 
Michael Gove ducks criticising Orban on anti-semitism and press freedom.  Tories are turning into the excuseniks party... #Brexit-friend-in-need  
Gove’s Chequers comments this morning add weight to something I’ve always believed.Soft #Brexit would never have been an ending. Just a step.A few years of rule taking with no say would just anger the Brextremist and off we would go.Better to #Remain and keep our influence 
Key recurring theme of Brexit is that the truth doesn’t stop staring us in the face just because May declares it isn’t there. There is now nowhere left for her to hide and she has lost any power to resolve this chaos. Let the people do it for her. 
It's a fact that 95% of UK businesses do not trade with the EU. Their voice is rarely heard above the calls from the multi nationals who unsurprisingly want to protect their own profits even if that means democracy is denied. #Brexit has to consider the majority, not the minority  
Failing mayor of London now calls for second Brexit referendum  
In St Austell, Lesley told us that she is worried about the impact of #Brexit on the social enterprise that she runs, and that the most vulnerable in #Cornwall will be hurt most.#PeoplesVote 
From the very moment Britain voted to leave these individuals have been working to keep us in the EU. None have lifted a finger to help negotiate an optimal exit. Their defeat is essential - not so much for delivering #Brexit but to rescue the idea that voting can change anything  
Anyone notice this bombshell today? May tells BBC only way of keeping open border on island of Ireland and Irish Sea is Chequers. But it takes two to tango and EU has definitively rejected that.PM has actually just confirmed that we must have full CU and SM or no Brexit at all pic.twitter.com/4Oa3323l8M 
Deadline for that period, according to withdrawal agreement, is end of 2020, but in truth that isn't enough time for soft or hard Brexit proposition so it'll somehow have to be extended. 
Brexiters could undo Chequers after Britain leaves EU, claims Gove.Gove’s #BlindBrexit plan is dangerous:- do a deal- win a Parliamentary vote- drop out of the EU- rip up the deal= get hard BrexitMPs must call a #PeoplesVote with an #OptionToStay. 
If they succeed, Brexit battle then restarts on other side of March 2019, with Remainers making case for another referendum, soft Brexiters for Chequers+, which includes services, & hard Brexiters making case for scrapping Chequers & focusing on an FTA 
Interesting that Khan realises he needs to represent the interests of London to keep his job - and a pity that his competitors from our side think that Londoners will be happy to vote for someone who wont let them have a #FinalSay on Brexit.Will any of them change their stance?  
Now normally arguably the last thing I'd advise you to do is listen to Sadiq Khan.But seeing as he's trending, here's a little clip of him from before the EU Referendum.#AManOfHisWord 
In calling for a second vote on Brexit, Mr Khan appears to have suffered a sudden amnesia attack...  
So just like we warned, countries which we now deal with through the EU will be offered immigration deals as bait for replacement trade deals after Brexit.In other words, Brexit means MORE immigration, not LESS.#FBPE 
The RESPONSIBILITY of an MP is, in this order - * COUNTRY* PEOPLE* PARTY * SELF The MPs in this country have completely reversed this and as such are FAILING in their duty as GUARDIANS of the State. #Brexit is just ONE result of this gross failure. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote 
Remainers are determined to release ever mor ridiculous project fear 2 stories to scare the public away from a no deal Brexit. They are trying to manipulate voters into backing May's Brexit deal as they know it would give us Brexit in name only. No deal Brexit is the best option.  
Awful to hear members of the public on Radio 4 saying they’re pleased about Brexit because “it’ll get rid of immigrants”. EU immigration will  be replaced by people from the developing world. Our economy depends on it. Tragic that so many have been conned. 
Remember when you hear SNP politicians like ⁦⁦@Feorlean⁩ warning of the dangers of a ‘No Deal’ Brexit, how much more damaging independence would be   
What the hell have I just heard on the news SADIQ KHAN CALLING FOR A SECOND REFERENDUM ................what a twat , crawl back under your stone moron !!!!it’s people like you that’s causing all the unrest in the country 
Sorry that this Brexit process is a bit irritating for May.It's bloody terrifying for EU citizens in UK & Brits in EU.It's sad, shameful, disgraceful, shocking, divisive, humiliating, scary, ruinous but as long as May is just a teensy bit irritated, who cares, right?  
The Observer comes out for a second referendum 
Busted. Watch as Sadiq Khan, having called for a second referendum is then confronted with what he said after the first one.What a shameful, duplicitous snake this man is.  Zero credibility.  
Public think that leaving the EU will solve all of our problems, it won't.  We need to escape from the Tories not the EU.  Tories are the real threat to our NHS, education, welfare, jobs, lifestyle, security, etc.  That is why we need a general election NOT a second referendum 
It's really this simple. Should the British People get to decide whether what the government has done in response to the 2016 Brexit vote is good enough for their children's futures?#Marr 
For god sake i voted to leave the EU, i voted Brexit. You stupid Leftie bastards i knew what i boted for. Stop uncontrolled immigration, take our borders back, make our own laws, sovereignty, our fishing waters reclaimed, that is just my view. But I don't need a second vote. 
London Mayor Sadiq Khan is calling for a public vote on any deal — or lack thereof — that the British government negotiates on Brexit, one that will include the option to remain in the EU.  
Sober assessment by @jayrayner1 reminds UK consumers that current political mess and drift has immense implications for food.  My view is: forget the ideology; unless there's a clear food plan, forget Brexit. Chequers + new Ag Bill aren't a Food Plan. 
Now hearing 150 CLP motions on Brexit submitted to Labout conference, of a total of 272. That compositing meeting next weekend is going to be quite something. 
How did Michael Gove go from being a leading Brexiteer to this duplicitous turncoat pushing through Theresa May's BINO, #Chequers plan for #Brexit that brings only economic vassalage with the EU? 
Never forget that many Remainers are actively working with the European Union to thwart  Brexit. That includes MEP's and parliamentarians as well as Mayors who are colluding with our enemies. DO Not TRUST Them On Any Level. 
"@michaelgove admits PM’s plan for #Brexit is temporary – and could be changed in years to come"Unbelievable, so why are Brexiteers in government backing this #Chequers nonsense If #Chequers is no good, stand by your principles and #StandUp4Brexit 
Interestingly muted applause at Jo Swinson's attempt to lump the SNP in the same camp as the Tories and Labour over Brexit at the Lib Dem conference. Clearly even their own delegates know it's pish. 
It's easy to understand how so many in England were duped into voting for Brexit, when they actually believe Ruth Davidson is a principled politician.  
Can someone tell me how these things are compatible?Today Michael Gove said it's OK to be bound by EU rules post Brexit because they don't change.#MarrThis year he said the UK has been changing EU rules"The UK has no control over EU rules""EU rules are bad" 
"Rather than having a 'bad deal' or 'no deal', let’s put that to the British public with the option of staying in the EU"London mayor Sadiq Khan calls for second #Brexit vote   #Marr 
"Labour are backing the government every step of the way. Jeremy Corbyn is letting the Prime Minister off the hook. My message to him is very clear.So, Jeremy, grow a backbone, stand up for the millions of people who voted for you and help us stop Brexit." @joswinson #LDConf 
"Brexit is taking longer than David Davis ever told us it would. It is costing us more than Michael Gove ever told us it would. It will make us poorer than Boris Johnson ever told us it would." @joswinson #LDconf 
This is why @MichelBarnier has to be very cautious about talking the word of the Brexit zealots, they will promise anything right now but have no intention of sticking to what they say.  
Constructive ambiguity on Brexit must end. Labour should back a people's vote now, says @_ImogenEllis 
Voters choose Brexit. The British political class delays, blocks, drags feet. Now has nerve to say, it's been so long, we need another vote. London mayor: 'The British people should have the final say on Brexit.' But didn't that happen two years ago?  
@MichaelGove on how our plan is all about "honouring the referendum mandate" and "taking back control" 
"I've always believed the British people should have a #FinalSay on #Brexit but since #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw I think it is the democratic right of the people to have a #PeoplesVote"  #EUsupergirl #LibDemConference #StopBrexit 
This suggestion that a #PeoplesVote would be a betrayal of the first Brexit referendum is ridiculous. How can the British people betray themselves by voting again? 
When Brexit is stopped, there will have to be a public enquiry and in my view those directly responsible should never hold office again 
The idea Brexit is failing because it is being betrayed must be strongly resisted, says STEVE RICHARDS. Brexit is failing because it cannot be delivered - Without seriously hurting our country and the lives of ordinary people!  
That’s true. One of the most important facts of the post-Lehman crash is that those who helped cause it have got richer (thanks QE) and those who did not cause it have not prospered (thanks wage stagnation). Political fallout includes Brexit, Trump, populist revolts acros Europe.  
It’s called the Trojan Horse Brexit - 1.) get Chequers fudge over the line 2.) Replace Maybot with a Brexiter fanatic e.g. 1 Michael Gove3.) Set up low tax low services high unemployment tax haven4.) Celebrate alt right coup over chlorinated chicken & English “champagne” 
Let's not forget that Michael Gove, Boris Johnson, Steve Bannon and Putin are among the biggest advocates of a hard Brexit. I wouldn't trust them to buy me crisps much less shape my future. These are miscreant scum. #ScumFloats 
I'm a member of the Conservatives, but it doesn't mean I sit idly by & watch the #Brexit promises be sold down the river.Watch @michaelgove on #Marr earlier today imply that we accept the #Chequers fudge & then someone else changes it later.Unbelievable, & very dissapointing. 
Lord Alan Sugar says #Brexit is 'going to be a complete and utter mess' and has called for those who promised £350million for the NHS to be prosecuted.  
BFE: Most people now DEMAND a #PeoplesVote on Brexit. One of them is Mayor of London, @SadiqKhan featured this morning on @MarrShow & in @guardian Will you join him? It takes just 30 seconds to sign the petition! Sign up to march with us on Oct 20th too!  
Think @SadiqKhan is desperately hoping that backing a 2nd referendum will distract from the fact that he has utterly failed to address the crime wave in London 
#Brexit is about a lying, cheating gang of rich bastards who will use any trick and cause any amount of suffering in order to slash their tax bills and tear up the health, safety, environmental and workplace regulations which eat into their profits.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
815 days since the UK returned a #Brexit result.815 days later, we're STILL having to fight the same battle.815 days & we still have a govt incapable of enacting the simplest binary decision we've ever handed them.Yet it's UK *voters* who didn't know what they were doing?  
“The great recklessness of Brexit from an Irish point of view is that it forces people to think again about all of the big existential questions that have caused so much grief and that had been successfully suspended” 
BREXIT - I was one of the 17.4 million people who didn´t know what I was voting for. Together with the other millions, I thought I was voting to leave the EU. Every last miserable vestige. I was voting for a completely independent, free of the EU Britain. And would do it again ! 
Gove saying we must show "a generosity of spirit" towards the racist, anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim Orban regime is just a foretaste of the kind of country the Tories want to see post-Brexit. If you're a person of colour, it will be hell on earth. 
The only “People’s Vote” I want is a General Election. That is what everyone in @UKLabour should be calling for. A 2nd referendum would be extremely damaging- more so than the 1st.What we need are these nasty, lying, cheating @CONservatives out.#SocialistSunday 
Did Brexit fan #Marr point out to Gove or anyone else on his show who insisted we respect the EU ref result that Vote Leave criminally cheated or that is was interfered with and funded by a hostile foreign power? - Did he fuck! pic.twitter.com/kbSEMQOdpM 
Theresa Villiers - It would be "so undemocratic to ask people to vote again" in a #PeoplesVote... we need to listen to the result of the referendum & implement it however catastrophic it would be for the country. #FBPE #marr #ridge 
Ahh yes!! The famous Brexit dividend!! All that Brussels money the NHS is supposed to get from Brexit.My friend, it's 2018, lies don't go in the recycling, they go in the bin! 
London mayor calls for second referendum on Brexit  
London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for a new vote on the final Brexit deal. This is him in 2016 explaining why the establishment should respect the result of the referendum. 
Tony Blair, Nick Clegg and John Major have been working on a diplomatic mission to stop Brexit  
London mayor calls for second EU referendum: 'the people must get a final say'  
2016: Brexit will glorious! Sunny days ahead on HMS Brexit!2018: there will be adequate food2019: see when we said "adequate",  
#MichaelGove soft-pedalling support of the #Tories for  odious #ViktorOrban  a 100% xenophobe & Jew-hater (he's channeled that to just #Soros ) shows you all you need to know re: how far #Ultras  like Gove will go to achieve their goal. He's  given us the  #VichyBrexit#Brexit  
“The British public should have the final say on Brexit" - today on #Marr I spoke about why with no general election and time running out, I’m backing a public vote with the option to stay in the EU. 
Theresa May is not going to resign, brexiteer Tory MPs need to wake up, May is going to collude with remainers to pass her Chequers deal. Brexiteers must oust her now if they want a real Brexit..  
Memo to Theresa May: The Northern Ireland question is a paper tiger: you have allowed the whole Brexit process to be hijacked by a non-issue. 
Sadiq Khan on Marr.Such a glib liar.Such a toad.He seems incapable of truth telling.Sitting there uneasily spouting hisverbal diarrhoea.Using the referendum as a tool for a GE.Labour have no regard for the wishes of 17.4m ppl.The fight is on. 
"No, it ['Despite Repeated Warnings'] was written before Brexit!"  Learn more in Paul's @Twitter Q&A from earlier this week: #EgyptStation is in stores now:  
IDS: "Over two years since the referendum and with endless twists and turns inside Parliament you’d be forgiven for wondering why we haven’t left the EU already"  
I don't get @willie_rennie at all.  He supports staying in the EU but opposes Scottish independence. But Brexit is going to happen so if he continues to oppose independence he's committing Scotland to something he says he doesn't want. Bizarre mindset 
This.This is what really worries me.Gove has now told us.If we leave the EU on any terms there will be no stopping the hard line Brexiteers.Any form of #Brexit will become a No Deal Brexit.Very very quickly.A #PeoplesVote is imperative to #StopBrexit. #Marr 
The Home Secretary’s ‘shock-and-awe’ strategy means workers’ rights would be early casualties of a Tory Brexit. Don’t let the Tories take your rights away - working people need to have their say  
3 days to go, 7 reasons to oust Ian Paisley. Day 5: His party has become synonymous with discrimination, scandal and corruption, from RHI to Red Sky, Nama and Brexit Dark Money #SignThePetition #PaisleyOut

I understand that of 272 motions received for Labour conference 150 are on Brexit including more than 100 calling for general election/second referendum 
.@SadiqKhan joins our campaign to call for a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. Please RT:  
Celia Imrie says Brexit is a 'disaster' and that she would 'love' to reverse it  
Brexit now offers two alternatives: Devastating No Deal Slightly less devastating Canada style deal Neither fulfil cake and eat it deal promised in the rerendum. Both will makes us worse off. Sadiq Khan is right. It's common sense. #PeoplesVote #Marr 
'@michaelgove accuses @SadiqKhan of trying to "frustrate the vote we had two and a half years ago...[a second referendum] would be a profound mistake."  
In other words, the government is driving us towards an undemocratic blind Brexit  
"We must be given the chance to deliver our verdict on the terms of departure. We must have a referendum on the deal."Amazing case in @ObserverUK for a #PeoplesVote#OFOC 
Just heard Theresa villiers on Sunday politics say there shouldn’t be a 2nd ref on brexit as the “ elites “ didn’t like the first result .. well .. im certainly not one of the elites .. is Theresa on twitter ? 
John Major said of the Tory Brexiters, "The NHS is about as safe with them as a pet hamster would be with a hungry python."#Brexit #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote 
Bernard Jenkin MP - "We need a free trade agreement with the EU if we can possibly get it, or we need to leave the EU on WTO terms without an agreement. "We cannot be held prisoner by the EU." #Brexit  
In other words get over the line, get rid of May and undo whatever fudge was cooked up. This is the blind Brexit we have to beware. It is as bad as no deal. @peoplesvote_hq 
Nearly spat my tea out. Michael Gove telling #Marr how “we” need solidarity in order to obtain the best deal for #Brexit. #Solidarity? This from a #Tory government who have robbed from our most vulnerable to line the pockets of the rich under a punishing austerity regime. #GTTO

There is NO GOOD BREXIT DEAL. It shouldn't matter if 'some' people voted for it - it's BAD for the country. If a government forces through change which is KNOWINGLY destructive it is TREASON - whether the 'people' want it or not - their job is to PROTECT, not DESTROY #PeoplesVote 
NEW: Michael Gove virtually admits he’s sold out on Brexit: “I’ve compromised - some of the things I argued for passionately during the referendum, as a result of Chequers, I’ve had to qualify one or two of my views.”

Sad to see @michaelgove flogging the dead horse of #ChequersPlan on #Marr. I used to respect him but his pirouette on Brexit is beyond the pale. I hope Boris sacks him. 
So #Marr reminded us of what @SadiqKhan said in the past. Thank you. Let's now see if he reminds us of what @michaelgove said about how great Brexit would be.  
#Brexit: London mayor Sadiq Khan has called for another referendum on Britain’s European Union membership, adding his backing to an idea known as a “People’s Vote”. 
For some reason, Brexit seems even more ridiculous from outside the country. The rest of the world getting on trying to make their countries better, sometimes failing but not *deliberately* trying to wreck things.

'@AndrewMarr9 confronts London Mayor @SadiqKhan with a video of him previously speaking out against a second referendum.  
Sunday Competition.Name ONE positive thing Sadiq khan has done that has improved your life as a Londoner. Just one. he is obsessed with Donald trump and Brexit it seems to me, but that's not what we pay him for.  
“You say ‘Brexit’, I say ‘shitshow’. You say ‘Brexit’, I say ‘shitshow’. ‘Brexit’, ‘shitshow’, ‘shitshow’, ‘Brexit’, let’s call the whole thing off.” 
The BBC narrative on #Marr is so tiresome.1. Brexit must be stopped.2. Trump must be stopped3. Socialism is the answer.Imagine paying £3.8bn a year to the Comrades for this garbage. You don't have to. We already do. 
After 10 years of austerity and the deficit cut by 81% its time for the Govt to invest in the UK to ready for Brexit.There should also be a root&branch review of the overseas aid budget. 84% of the public think it should be partially redirected back home. 
The case for a second referendum is: if you choose a route because people tell you it is the best one but then you find they lied to you, and that it is leading you off a cliff, you have the right to think again. Don't you? Not complicated. 
#Marr Sadiq Khan on Marr Show. Who’s listening to this clown . Hopeless Mayor, we’ve had a Referendum 17 million voted leave the EU. Get it through your thick skull. Your boring  the 17 million who voted leave to death. Yawn, Yawn, Yawn, Yawn, Yawn, Yawn, Yawn.  
#Marr and the BBC doing a magnificent job of promoting the second referendum.  Of course, for balance they could interview someone who is against a second referendum, but hey the issue is way bigger than balance and balance is soooooooo last year at the BBC. 
Second referendum on its own won't arm Labour activists to win battle of ideas in pro-Leave communities: here I explain why a positive Norway-style proposal is important...  
Sadiq Khan is now flatly in denial and calling for yet another referendum but to Remain ?? So apparently there never really was a Leave alternative on the ballot after all, only a pretence.#Marr 
Sadiq on 2nd referendum ‘No-one said there would be job losses.’Actually you did mate.Meanwhile....  
The language of a ‘people’s vote’, and claims that it would ‘not be a re-run’ are cynical, elitist, and dangerous. It is totally extraordinary that those apparently committed to democracy are attempting to overturn the EU referendum. We should utterly reject their arguments. 
“The British public should have a say on the outcome of the negotiations” - London Mayor @SadiqKhan calls for second #Brexit vote  #Marr 
.@SadiqKhan bang on on the #Marr show that the British public should have a say on the deal which the Government brings back from the EU and there should be no "blindfold #Brexit" spot on! #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk

No @SarahbaxterSTM Ruth Davidson is NOT Scotland’s golden girl.  She is of the party that gave us the Rape Clause, huge increase in food banks and Brexit. I do not recognise this Pollyanna you present. 
London mayor calls for second referendum on Brexit  
Amanda Platell: "I do wish we'd stop calling it a 'people's vote' and call it a 'second people's vote', because we've already had a 'people's vote' which was the original referendum."

Sadiq Khan calls for second Brexit vote slamming government’s ‘failure’ in negotiations  
On #Marr, you'll hear Michael Gove trying to justify the harm #Brexit is doing to our country.What you won't hear is the voices of the many ordinary people, like this lady from Truro, who now realise that Gove and Johnson lied to them.#PeoplesVote 
DISGRACEFUL: @SadiqKhan calls for second referendum. Pro-EU political class still desperate to overrule the British public!  
The crime record in London under one year of Khan:•70% more Youth Homicide•27% more Homicide•18% more Rape•31% more Knife Crime•16% more Gun Crime.Sadiq Khan should focus on his job rather than Brexit, he might then stop people dying. #Marr 
You are kidding right? Don’t you have journeys and breaks and days off and evenings? The damage Brexit will do to SMEs is immeasurable.. I think I owe it to my SMEs to fight for a decent deal or a #PeoplesVote 
Is the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan right to call for a second referendum? @Nigel_Farage is live. #FarageOnLBC 
I voted for brexit on the basis of the underfunding of the NHS and as the £350m claim proved to be a total fabrication then I am ashamed to have fallen for it. If there is a second referendum (and I hope there will be) then I would be as strong a remainer as I can. 
Don't worry Khan at the rate of London's stabbings on your watch, there won't be many people left to worry about Brexit. Now shut it you muppet.

BREXIT PLOT Tony Blair, Nick Clegg and John Major meet with European leaders in secret plot to keep Britain in the EU.The Remainers want to extend Article 50 and strike a deal for the UK to remain.They are all traitors to their country. 
Hi @SadiqKhan, not sure if you were asleep for the whole of 2016, but I’m pretty sure the British people already had the final say on Brexit back when we were asked, you know, to have the final say on Brexit in that referendum thing. Does that ring any bells?  
The British people should have the final say on Brexit. Watch me talk about why on @Marrshow from 10am, or read here: 
This is treason & an absolute outrage that unelected has beens are trying to overthrow the Brexit vote. Clegg & Blair should both be put on trial for trying to subvert UK democracy..

On #Marr shortly speaking about how Govt is failing in its Brexit negotiations. We now face the real risk of a bad deal, or no deal. Both would cause huge damage to London & the UK.With no election & time running out, I’m backing a public vote with the option to stay in the EU.  
Jo Swinson - Momentum is building to have a #PeoplesVote on the final deal... it is important that people have the chance to have their say on the final deal... the important thing to remember is #brexit can still be stopped. #FBPE #ridge #marr #LibDemConference @joswinson

London Mayor Sadiq Khan calls for second referendum on Brexit  
Every day, the weight of opinion shifts heavily towards a new referendum.It’s not betraying democracy. It’s not voting til we get “the right result”.It’s a natural consequence of an abstract q that now can be properly asked & answered,in the face of massive political failure.  
BBC Poll"BBC Bias against Brexit is out of control. Left wing bias, gender bias, & even discrimination against white job applicants, are sharply on the rise. The BBC is not impartial or representative of the majority."Is it time to boycott BBC News and Politics?RETWEET 
Can I ask a question please @jeremycorbyn @johnmcdonnellMP @EmilyThornberry @Keir_Starmer If there is a general election soon, what is your Brexit policy going to be? Please say something more meaningful than ‘we will negotiate better than the Tories.’ 
The Observer view: we’ve been failed by both main parties on the biggest question facing Britain in decades. Both have embraced the deceit of the Leave campaign. We must be given a referendum on the terms of our exit from the EU. 
Now @sadiqkhan shows his contempt for the will of the British people and the democratic result of the referendum in calling for a second 'People's Vote'. The people voted on 23rd June 2016 and the people voted to leave the EU. It's time to stop remoaning.

This is really sad but we all know it's true. People will need to feel the effects of Brexit before independence is recognised as the safer option. Thing is for a lot of people, myself included, won't be able to withstand the financial implications.   
When the Tories are proposing major tax cuts & a bonfire of regulations covering workers' rights and the environment to 'cope with Brexit', it's time for @UKLabour to step up & support a #PeoplesVote to #endthechaos. @thatginamiller #Marr #SundayMorning 
I see former radio presenter Jon Gaunt has taken the Putin rouble and is spinning the general RT narrative on Sputnik. This is another one of those "straight talking" pro Brexit people like Galloway essentially working as latterday Lord Haw Haws. 
Err @DavidLammy lol, you do realise outside of the metropolitan elite of London @SadiqKhan like you and other anti Brexit, anti democratic lunatics mean nothing to ordinary people so quite frankly who gives a f**k about him joining #PeoplesVote 
PLOT: Blair, Clegg 'meeting with EU leaders to stop Brexit'. They are still trying to subvert British democracy!  
The Government has failed on Brexit negotiations. We now face the risk of either a bad deal, or no deal. Both would cause huge damage to London and the UK.That’s why I’m backing a public vote.  
Sadiq Khan has issued a dramatic call for another referendum on EU membership, saying that the people must be given the chance to reject a Brexit deal that will be bad for the economy, jobs and the NHS. @AndrewCastle asks: would you welcome a People's Vote?

Sadiq Khan’s London has seen a +44% boom in homicide, +22% knife crime; now he ignores will of 40% of Londoners (inc me) and calls for a second Brexit referendum. Perhaps fix our bloody streets and don’t meddle with democracy?   
One of the reasons why the UK cannot make progress on Brexit: every option has more people against it than in favour (except for the first, which little sense given the other choices and the sequencing that will happen anyway)  
Spot on @SamTarry @guardian “sheer weight of anti-Brexit motions going to Labour conference..we, the socialist left, simply cannot stand by and watch while workers and communities are sacrificed at the altar of Tory dogma and imperial nostalgia.” @LabPeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk 
Why Conservative Brexiteers are so keen on a no-deal Brexit: It would give them an excuse to do all the things they’ve wanted to do for decades but never thought they could get away with.  
The NHS functioned - rather better than it does today, as it happens - for a full 25 years before Britain joined the (then) EEC in 1973.So why should Brexit be "bad for the NHS"? And btw, why are most EU countries' health systems superior to ours? Couldn't we learn from them?  
Listening to IDS and @MatthewParris on @Lbc - interesting Duncan Smith no longer even bothers to rebut the idea that he and his have no Brexit plan of their own. As to ‘no reason for another vote, no pressure for it’ - get real @peoplesvote_uk Dumky 
What a week - The Times revealed itself to be The Sun with a thesaurus, the BBC didn't notice the Tories voted to protect a racist government and once more zero progress was made on Brexit, low pay, food bank use, homelessness, prisons, education or the NHS.#SocialistSunday

“Mrs May told the BBC the debate should be about the country's future rather than her own” - Absolutely agree, it is about our future. The reasons May gave during the referendum for staying in the EU are still valid today, she has never denied them.  
#PeoplesVoteLondon does not represent the rest of the UK. It has more or less become a foreign enclave in the heart of the United Kingdom. The Midlands and North need there own autonomy after Brexit 
Jeremy Corbyn is referring here to a direct attack on him last year in which Morgan Stanley called Labour 'a bigger risk than Brexit', specifically citing our policies to help low paid and end outsourcing.But Stephen Pollard reads anti-Semitism into it!! 
Coming soon - the impact of Brexit on 6% of the population. Forget the undeliverable promises of the leave campaign and begin to consider the impact on people who've made their home here and are still used as bargaining chips.

Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has called for another Brexit vote, saying the British public should get a "fresh say on our future".  
To all MPs: It’s not too late to put national interest first. We are being led to the brink of disaster as we prepare to leave the EU & must be given chance to deliver our verdict on terms of departure. We must have a referendum on the deal.#PeoplesVote 
Great detail in superb @ShippersUnbound and @cazjwheeler Sunday Times long read on Tory Brexit meltdown. Sajid Javid unveiled “shock and awe strategy” to boost economy if there’s no deal including tax cuts, weakening workers’ rights and ditching environmental regulations.  
“I’m a petulant prick who got less votes from Londoners than the margin of victory in the EU referendum but I still DEMAND that the #Brexit result be overturnedI’m a #PeoplesVote halfwitI’m @SadiqKhan & I’m a hapless, anti-democratic Leftist”

This is sad. Trying to drum up jingoism and thoughts of victory in WW2 to deflect the public from the catastrophe of #Brexit. They must think we're all fools.  
Sadiq Khan has called for a second referendum on #Brexit.  
The Observer calling for a referendum on #Brexit urges that: “Those advocating staying in the EU would need to run an altogether different campaign from the project fear of 2016, centred around a positive case for EU membership”. We agree wholeheartedly.  
.⁦@theresa_may⁩ stop acting like a wannabe Henry VIII & give us a say on #Brexit. The idea that the 2016 referendum is binding and we must leave at all costs makes a travesty of democracy! We were told there would only be upsides. Lie.  #PeoplesVote

The Observer view on giving voters a chance to deliver their verdict on Brexit terms | Observer editorial  
#OTD 1982. Barbara Castle urges Labour to ditch their policy on European withdrawal. Having once campaigned for it, she claims #Brexit alienates the party from its traditional supporter base:"Anyone who believes withdrawal is a vote winner is living on cloud cuckoo land"  
With respect, Priti, words won't fix this.What is needed *now* is to get a Brexiteer PM into No 10 so the disastrous #ChequersPlan can be dropped + better arrangements made. WTO, if need be. We will hold @Conservatives responsible if a full clean Brexit is not delivered. End of.  
The referendum year was toughCos I had to run the whole Tory Party and the Labour PartyDo a whole season as Buttons at the King'sTeach John Barrowman EnglishAnd do StrictlyAnd BakeOffAnd Dr WhoAnd write the ArchersI went through a lot of painkillers  
I'm proud to be at #LDConf. What a plucky party. @LibDems called the 2008 crash. And Iraq. And it wasn't simply a cop-out blanket anti-war stance: it also called Bosnia right. And now, when Tory & Labour have caved into Brexit, Lib Dems are steadfast against. Join us if you agree 
There is a growing movement in Australia to honour the Uluru Statement from the heart. Pretty awesome to see it grow. You should get involved! Write your MP and ask them to back the referendum to enshrine a first nations voice in the constitution.  
That is an unfair proposition at the least.Having a referendum to leave a Pro-Shariah EU twice, and not having at least once a referendum on banning or not the immigration of Shariah Proponents?  
Before the referendum, saying we would be leaving the single market or CU if the UK voted to leave the EU was dismissed by the quitters as lies and scaremongering by the remainers. Now tho, its apparently what they actually want! and wanted all along!These people are idiots!

London mayor Sadiq Khan calls for second Brexit vote  
Brexit is a huge smokescreen to all the other shit that’s going on 
The unlikely survival of May’s Chequers plan for Brexit  
Can't believe people would still vote Tory after how they've treated disabled people, the poor, black people, tripled debt, starved resources, increased homelessness, destroyed the NHS. Guess some people see them as the Brexit party and look at the mess they've made of that too 
Just a reminder that the Royal College of Nurses, the Royal College of Midwives and the British Medical Association all oppose #Brexit and want a #PeoplesVote, because Brexit will trash the NHS. 
Theresa May has humiliated herself & the country in Brexit talks. We have so much leverage to use but remainer May hasn’t even tried.  Instead May is happy to tie us to the EU forever, concession after concession, of course a deal will be struck when May surrenders on everything.  
Carney & Hammond need to be replaced.  The 2 men running the economy are anti Brexit fanatics who sabotaged plans from the beginning. Carney & Hammond have run project fear incessantly with ever more ludicrous propaganda, tried to manipulate voters & now want Brexit postponed..  
Sadiq Khan has stolen a march on @uk labour front bench and says it as it is.  Courage, principle and leadership.  Bravo  #peoplesvote #FBPE #FinalSayForAll Give Britain a new referendum on Brexit, says Sadiq Khan  
A #PeoplesVote was a foolish fantasy only a few months ago.Now it's emerging as the only way out of this #Brexit mess for Leavers *and* RemainersThe Tories are eating themselves & Corbyn is hiding.  A vote on the deal is the only way forward  
We have been asking @theresa_may to ring fence #CitizensRights since the referendum, how can the EU be blamed when she has mistreated EU Nationals so badly!! 
Hammond is demanding not only that Brexit should be delayed but that ministers should prepare cuts of 5% in real terms in case of no deal. A real Tory kamikaze. But May cannot get rid of him. At some stage this government must implode. Or better still, be overthrown by a revolt. 
#ThankEU for moving to the right side of history...just hope the maj of your membership & Labour voters who now wish to #Remain can get your Party Leadership to back this stance.Labour will lose millions of votes if not & #Brexit Removes Rights, Jobs, Control & makes us Poorer.

In case useful, here’s a quick explanation for anyone unclear about what people mean by “Blind Brexit”.Remember that during a transition period, EU law would apply largely as if UK was still a member, but UK will have definitively left the EU.  
This is absolutely true. A journalist friend can't find any NHS staff who admit to supporting #Brexit. If there are any, they're few and far between. It's my duty as an NHS doctor to make clear: Brexit will screw the NHS. Your NHS. Brexit must be stopped.

It's a matter of logic. The medical community is screaming that Brexit is bad for the NHS. Ignoring that means we consider our views on Brexit to be more important.  
Michael Bloomberg: Brexit is the stupidest thing any country has ever done  
There is no longer any distinction between having a new referendum, with an option to Remain, and aborting Brexit. The two are effectively equivalent, which is of course the very reason why a new referendum absolutely must take place. 
No one gave a shit about Brexit until 2016 and no one will again a few months after we dump it. #PeoplesVote pic.twitter.com/C5fPid516F 
No doubt @michaelgove intends to apologise to the nation on #Marr for all the lies he & his colleagues told, the laws his campaign broke, and the economic uncertainty & pain his Brexit irresponsibility is causing. If he had a shred of integrity, he’d resign from public life.

The Electoral Commission and now the High Court both determined that Vote Leave broke the law. But according to Mr Paterson the rules the rest of us accept and are happy to live by don't apply to Mr Paterson and his brexit chums. They betray their contempt for the rule of law.  
If you support Brexit you’ll be pleased to know taxpayers’ cash is being used to support the 80 strong group of MPs who want it to be hard even though it is against the rules  
The country is having a Brexit “light bulb” moment. Light is now being shed on the real impact of a fraudulent vote which was advisory. If I were a Brexit pushing politician, I would be feeling a little less secure in my job. How did advisory become mandatory? 
Proper blue passport tackle. Lad took a walloping and got straight back up. Not like any of these nancyboys in the First Division. Hard Brexit needed.  
Carney risks damaging the Bank of England’s credibility with his Brexit warnings:  
What Brexit comes down to is that none of the EU's imperfections are worth the economic, social and political carnage that it will cause 
More than 100 constituency Labour parties have submitted people’s vote resolutions to conference, & in quick succession Sadiq Khan has backed them & Emily Thornberry has declared that Jeremy will be voting against Mrs May’s deal. The people’s vote is on its way - to stop Brexit

Fantastic that Labour's Mayor of London @SadiqKhan now sees the People's Vote as the only way of stopping a bad deal or no deal Brexit - and that he supports giving us all the chance of staying in the EU.  
We can’t sign any trade deals but we can try to capitalise on the sacrifices made by previous generations.Liam Fox’s department appears to think nostalgia earns money abroad. Absolutely unbelievable. Or perhaps just another day in the Brexit Nonsense Factory.

FUCKING BREXIT. jhad email from agent..said European acoustic tour penciled in..but because Brexit in March &  VISA issues all tours are packed into end of this year..no room..brexit is gonna destroy uk musicians..if it isn't difficult enough these days...already lost one tour 
You disingenuous goon. Brexit will harm the poor and the vulnerable in a way they may never recover from. Your disaster socialism is a gamble with people's lives and thoroughly deceitful  
“The Irish Government has not altered course throughout these talks&the EU has backed us all the way. It has been humbling for me .. to hear solidarity from European leaders which is as forceful in private as it is in public” - Ireland’s Tánaiste @simoncoveney on #brexit talks. 
The Tory government under May have retained the services of Mark Carney. Carney is not committed to Brexit at all. I believe he will do all he can to frustrate a smooth financial transition which is vital to a successful Brexit. Can't trust the Tories. 
If the UK suffers a hard #Brexit, I wonder if the EU will send an Armada of small bots to rescue those that want to leave and who are stranded on the beaches because there's no way off the island? 
No wonder neither of the main parties want to address the real elephant in the room....our democracy has been hijacked by people who are not only prepared to cheat the electorate but do so with impunity....laughing at all evidence and findings. 
Wow. Anti-Brexit clown @Andrew_Adonis admits he thinks of his own country — the UK — as a dilapidated building.#ThisIsRemain. 
Translation: "Don't you dare remind me I'm clearly in opposition to the 2015/2017 General Election results and 2016 EU Referendum result. I'm now going to conflate Vote Leave with Nazism, Putin, defame Vote Leave with false accusations and mention something unrelated to deflect."  
Secret plot to keep Britain in EU: Blair, Major and Clegg travel Europe in bid to stop Brexit by asking leaders to allow UK more time to hold a second vote  
She said she had a lot of time for @NicolaSturgeon and @MhairiBlack. We chatted a wee bit longer about what SNP has done in Govt - and as the time came to go separate ways she said she now knows next time we have a referendum, she’ll put her X for YES  
Highly informative article here. We're well beyond predicting the adverse effects of Brexit, they are already clearly happening. What is still unknown is only how adverse they will be.

Right… as opposed to the entirely fair and democratic 2016 gerrymandered and fraudulent referendum.   
Fantastic spirit & energy at the @SouthwarkLabour conference today - thanks for inviting me. Great discussion on challenges of Brexit.  
I'm on @BBCRadio4 #looseends at 18.15, 26 years after my first appearance, still trying to save the NHS but now also trying to stop @Jacob_Rees_Mogg's #Brexit. Even better, there's Joan Armatrading, @profmcscott, Emma Freud , Clive Anderson & Arinze Kene

I feel like too many folk are still in denial about Brexit. Either they think it won't happen. Or if it does, it won't really be that bad. I suspect it's going to have to actually impact on most people's lives, before there is a real backlash. 
Absolute rubbish. There was nothing wrong with the referendum. Despite the Remain campaign hugely outspending Leave, backed by massive - and false - government propaganda provided for free, Remain lost. And pathetic cry-babies like Maugham can’t handle it.    
The future of our relationship with the EU is being decided now - a decision that will last for generations. If you want a say on the final Brexit deal, then sign the #PeoplesVote petition: 
In the two years since the ref. Not one leaver has ever tried to convince me that leaving is the right thing to do. Nor have I seen any benefit of leaving. Nothing. #brexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE 
I mean, seriously. How can any logical person who cares about the NHS look at THIS and still support Brexit?Is Boris Johnson really a better source of medical advice than actual doctors?!?!  
Absolutely unprecedented: over 100 CLPs have submitted anti-Brexit motions to Labour Conference.  
I’ll be speaking to @LBC around 6pm on why a general election should be the priority when it comes to Brexit.We should have an election where all parties should put their Brexit plans to the country for the people to vote on (instead of another divisive referendum). 
A very successful stint in #PottersBar today with lots of interest in our #Brexitometer & enthusiasm for a #PeoplesVote on the Brexit deal. Add this result to those from #Radlett & #Borehamwood and you can see a definite pattern emerging in Hertsmere. Thanks to all involved! 
59% to 41% would vote to stay in the EU according to poll. No wonder the Brexiters are running scared of a #PeoplesVote. #brexit #StopBrexit

In terms of food, Brexit isn't something happening in 6 months time. It's already here. For months I've been reporting the state of Britain's supply chain for this piece. The view from the front line of the battle to keep Britain fed is less than cheery 1/  
"The Irish government's attitude towards #Brexit talks is completely baffling" says former Irish ambassador @ray_basssett after new #Irexit party @IrexitFreedom is up against little support for leaving the EU.Could you imagine Ireland following the UK out of the bloc? 
THERESA May must deliver a “Canada plus-plus-plus” Brexit deal or risk being ousted as Prime Minister, a backbench Tory MP has warned, as pressure mounts after rumours of growing dissatisfaction among her party colleagues..  
I would prefer to jump to conclusions, actually. #Brexit  
The EU has done nothing in any region of the UK that a sovereign self governing UK gov. could not have done The EU has no money, this is UK taxpayers money returned after a 50% tax by the EU institutions; often spent on vanity projects!#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit 
Brexiteers: we know exactly what 17.4million people voted forAlso Brexiteers: we cant tell you what our Brexit plan isSo if you are so certain the people know what they voted for why not clarify it with a referendum on type of EU relationship UK is to have? 
Gerry Adams urges Irish America Trade Union support for referendum on Unity  
Please... Brexit is not about to destroy the NHS like planes are not about to fall out of the skies and we are not going to run out of food. I suggest you DO NOT use the NHS as a political football to garner support for a #peoplesvote. 
Worth reading - although I suppose given their delusional state the Brexit Bunch will argue that after Brexit no one will get sick. NHS after Brexit. Not a happy picture - despite the lies on the bus. Thank you ⁦@TheLancet⁩ 
Well i will certainly not be insulting people with that emotive tweet.! The NHS had issues long before #brexit so please don't insult our intelligence. The NHS needs a long term cohesive package rather than the short term reactive policies that have predominated recently. 
Femi, sorry you are getting so much abuse. Our Lancet paper sets out in detail why Brexit is a massively serious threat to the NHS. Brexiteers have no answers to these problems  
I care about the NHS but voted #brexit. Your tweet suggests that somehow I give no shits about the NHS because I don't support a #peoplesvote. I think you need to to go for a very long walk and think about how rude and offensive your tweet is. #rude 
We have a new stupidest Brexit idea yet.

If France can cope with an independence referendum on the future of New Caledonia, why is it a crime in Spain to hold an independence referendum on the future of Catalonia? Perhaps Emmanuel Macron could have a word with Pedro Sanchez and explain the principles of democracy.

Brexiteers Say They're "In Despair" After Their Challenge To Theresa May's Brexit Plan Backfired   via @alexwickham 
How did Arron Banks who lives in a £900,000 house with a £500,000 mortgage who is known to have had numerous meetings with the Russians before the EU referendum make a £9m donation to Leave EU? Where do you think he got £9m from? 
The People's Vote claims to be a vote on the deal. How can Remain be an option that would just be running the referendum again except the leave vote would be split. No reason to have a 2nd referendum, first was a clear result. 
Superb analysis Ben, the "existential threat" is to the 1%'s bank balances and tax returns, hence the obsession with a no deal Brexit and smearing the Labour party for daring to challenge their rigged system... 
Zara is so overpriced these days that we should have a referendum to rename it Zarar. 
Ex-CBI chief lambasts EU leaders and UK over citizens' rights post-Brexit. They should be "ashamed" that all - Brits and EU citizens - still don't have rights ringfenced from Brexit.  
She's pushing ahead with the Brexit catastrophe knowing most people don't want it, it was advisory, the outcome was vague, it was won with criminality, plus a hostile foreign power interfered in it & funded it, bc a grateful party & country will keep her in No 10 for 20 years LOL  
Farage acting as a faithful little Putin tool, attacking Putin's enemy Soros and supporting the antisemitic Hungarian government which is undermining democracy in Hungary. Farage - loyal servant of Putin, enemy of democracy. #PeoplesVote #brexit #StopBrexit 
We had a long conversation with two Leave voters today. They were kicking themselves, and now the impact of Brexit on ordinary working people is clear, they want an opportunity to vote on the deal.Many in Nottingham feel the same.#PeoplesVote 
You know who does have the absolute power to stop Brexit: @Theresa_May & @CONservatives. NOT @JeremyCorbyn. All those attacking Jeremy are wasting time, which is running out, & energy. Maybe if they turned their attack on the right people they might get somewhere. 
Presumably this will come form the magic money tree?BREXIT BONUS: Give every adult CASH HANDOUT when UK leaves EU, says Grayling  
May has emphatically ruled out another ref; like she ruled out snap election, the 1 she then had which eroded her authority & lost her mandate for hard Brexit. The more she says a ref on the final deal won’t happen the more people think that it should.  
I agree with @weegingerdug here. #indyref2 will probably not be held till after Brexit hits. It's (sadly) the wake up call that undecideds will need to move to YES. As far as full blown unionists, I'm convinced they'd rather starve.  
A pity you didn’t say that before last referendum which got us into this mess Rory @RoryStewartUK 
It's still fascinating how #FBPE accounts spin everything to relate to brexit.For example:*MP tweets something about Bake Off* *FBPE account reply* - "Thanks to this brexshit fudge cake I've completely lost my sweet tooth, I hope you're happy. My kids will live with this." 
Lol. Points for creativity on this talking point. The Ontario election was practically a referendum on the carbon tax. The message to legislators to nix it was pretty clear.  
Listening to the disingenuous calls for a so-called people's vote from @Andrew_Adonis & @Wera_Hobhouse on @BBCAnyQuestions I'm yet to hear a single argument that wasn't aired during 2016 referendum. The claim is often made that facts have changed. This debate didn't suggest that 
On trade deals on Any Questions. Bernard Jenkin in fantasy land on how easy it’s all going to be because EU & rest of world will replicate existing deals outside EU on nod. I say this is ludicrous imperial mindset undermining trade & jobs - & we need people’s vote to stop Brexit 
You hear that? Anyone who accepts the result of the EU referendum hates the NHS.  
On Irish border on Any Questions. Bernard Jenkin saying we shouldn’t worry because there’s already lots of smuggling. I backed the Chief Constable of Police Service of Northern Ireland who said Brexit border would be really serious - & smuggling would fund paramilitaries 
Loving Grayling’s plan to send everyone a Brexit cheque. It’s basically a quick offset to try and stay economic damage for a week or two, a bribe, a PR stunt, and golden parachute from the government all in one. 
Basically, John McDonnell doesn’t have a alternative plan for Brexit either.  
"It doesn't matter who is in the driving seat of Brexit if the steering wheel is broken" says @mikegalsworthy of @NHSvBrexit as he repeats the need for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal at today's #PeoplesVoteNHS rally. 
Perfect summation for #Brexit Britain. Something to cheer as we turn our gardens into allotments and open a tin of Spam. 
Cutting NHS beds, chronic underfunding, gross understaffing (42,000 nurses short, 11,500 Drs down), Brexit —-> poorer patient care. This could be avoided if there was the political will to do so.  
Interesting take on why there is such a growing momentum against #Brexit :  
The NHS has been lying on a hospital bed, screaming for help, for doctors, nurses, medicines and support, all of which Brexit is stealing.Do you care?  
There’s been 40,000 hours since the EU Referendum.I cuid hae watched 440 solid fitba matches or 1300 dreary episodes of Eastenders in that time. Yet, the numpties in oor government still havenae had the time tae work oot what Brexit means.It’s simple: Brexit means Buckfast.  
"In a democracy, we have the chance to change our minds... We will not remain silent. Let's make our voices heard and ensure that the final vote on the Brexit deal is ours - a People's Vote" #PeoplesVoteNHS @TheBMA 
Just a reminder:"Brexit: People voted to leave EU because they feared immigration, a major survey finds. Claims that the Leave vote was a result of general disenchantment with politics are 'widely off the mark', according to the report."  
After Brexit when Spoons sponsor the military to help unite the country  
The #Brexit bill is £38billion the population is 65million, that's just over £5million each. Let's cancel Brexit, stay in the EU and give everyone £5million each. Don't think anyone would care about respecting the referendum then. 
Packed rally #PeoplesVoteNHS in central London. I shall be speaking for @MidwivesRCM alongside health professionals and NHS users. We know the effect of crashing out or a bad Brexit deal are disastrous for our NHS and the UK. Give the people a vote on the no deal or deal. 
Dr Clair Gerada takes to the stage to rapturous applause. "We are now clearer what Brexit means for us and it is not good news for the NHS"  
Suspending or extending #Article50 also way to rule out #NoDeal #Brexit too -but PM terrified of the extremists and can’t act in the national interest...Chancellor Philip Hammond angers Theresa May with idea to delay Brexit to fully prepare for No Deal

A reminder - if Labour votes down government's Brexit deal *there will not be a general election*. The terms of the Fixed Term Parliament Act will *still apply*. What would happen is Britain would end up leaving the EU without a deal - which is what Farage, Johnson, Mogg etc want 
Clear message on Ireland’s Brexit position from Tánaiste @simoncoveney in today’s Irish Independent. “We are never going back to dark and divisive days of decades past. “ 
Labour still counting Brexit motions submitted for conference but one party source says could be as high as 120. At least 25 from London but also double figures from Yorkshire, West Mids, South West and Scotland. 
If the Brit Est cheated in the EU referendum it would be very naïve to think they didn't cheat in Scotland's independence referendum!  
I’ve always been against the EU. I knew which way I would be voting long before the referendum was announced. Nothing in the campaign influenced or changed my opinion. I also had to wait 30 years for any say on our membership. The arguments for a second vote do not represent me. 
Cons dip with liberal voters from 32% 2015 to 22% 2017 cost them decisive seats (as the geography of their Brexit vote gains didnt work out in seats). Massively underdiscussed. As important as Labour Leavers/the mirror challenge of each party's soft flank.  
“This is far too complex for a referendum” is an incredibly fucking irritating opinion to suddenly develop two years after the first one   
Despite Brexit.  
WATCH | Italian Deputy PM @matteosalvinimi confirms that he stands with the British people on Brexit and opposes the EU's stubborn negotiating position. "The people's mandate must be followed!" Support us at  
Hi Jess. I admire you. But the people who "need" a labour gov are those Brexit will harm the most: the disadvantaged, the poorest and most vulnerable. Labour's failure to scream opposition from the rooftops has disappointed me and many others profoundly. #howwillbrexithelp 
The cost of Brexit Holidays:You need 2 driving permits if you drive, say, in Spain & France. So if you're a couple, that's suddenly £22. Then visas could cost anything from £11 to £52 per person. So suddenly, for a couple, it's £126 ... Before tickets etc  
Change is happening across Ireland and Brexit is driving that change, and we must prepare for that change - economist Paul Gosling tells #UnitedIreland conference

'EU is like the Titanic!' Top economist uses brilliant analogy to describe Brexit  
Remainer Mark Carney must go: His predictions prior to the referendum were wrong and it is incredible that he is talking down the future of the country.  #BrexitBetrayal

Roger Scully focus groups in Welsh Valleys with Labour Leavers finds that they are willing to absorb economic costs in order to pursue Brexit, which they felt would bring things back to a better state. Felt little to lose #EPOP2018 
Iain, 51.8% vs 48.2% is clear majority but not strong majority, a more prudent government than ours would have acted accordingly, as would wiser Brexit campaign. But never mind, reality is closing in on them with every passing day - as is the scale of Leave team’s self deception

There are some who say the EU is not central to our security. Why is it then that Putin is trying to undermine and break up the EU? He understands that these days the main form of war in Europe is political & social, not military, and #Brexit helps him in that war. #PeoplesVote 
“What would make the UK look like a modern, forward-looking nation, ready to trade with the world [which we’ve always done] after Brexit?”“How about sending a World War 2 plane around the world?”“Bingo.”#ExportingIsGREAT 
If Brexit is 'too complicated for a referendum,' it was too complicated for a referendum back in 2016 too. But in fact the choice is simple: we have an excellent deal with EU membership right now. So choose: keep it, or get into a multiple car crash lasting for years. Hard, eh?  
Top economist“I used the analogy in the referendum of the EU being like the Titanic. It looked big so everyone thinks ‘great let’s be on it’"But, like the Titanic, it didn’t change direction. Continued to head into impending problems."

Lord Alan Sugar says #Brexit is 'going to be a complete and utter mess' and has called for those who promised £350million for the NHS to be prosecuted.  
If Brexit was abandoned tomorrow there would be a collective sigh of relief around the country, we could concentrate on improving schools & NHS, sorting out prisons & much more. Only the speculators would grieve. 
Congratulations to the exceptional  @tconnellyRTE & RTÉ generally on their coverage of brexit, juxtaposed to the dumbed down biased BBC. Irish people complain about RTÉ but it's head & shoulders above similar national broadcasters on serious issues  
to celebrate 6000 followers (LOL, madness) i'd like to give a shout-out to some of my favourite EU nationals! we are all EU citizens, but these people are not in the same boat as we Brits, and it's important we acknowledge that; the UK is their home & Brexit puts that at risk! 1/ 
Come and take part in what will be the biggest pro-EU march yet on the 20th October - if you support a vote on the final Brexit deal then join the #PeoplesVote March for the Future: 
"I want an independence referendum when we’re going to win it." // Wee Ginger Dug 
This is how rabid the "Brexit At Any Cost" mob have now become.. Their ideological tribalism and false patriotism will sink us all. #Brexit  
The pressure for a #PeoplesVote will become overwhelming, because there is no chance of attaining unity for any #Brexit plans in the Commons.The only realistic and democratic compromise is to give the vote back to the people. Our MPs would be wise not to rule it out completely.  
Standing up to racism is crucially important so why anyone campaigning for it would deliberately schedule this event on the same day as the People's Vote march is beyond me. Brexit has empowered racists in this country. Dividing the fight against them is utter madness.  
Theresa, I would Brexit quick on WTO rules. Scrap HS2. Reform income tax, benefits system, fairer pensions, council tax, business rates. Deport illegals, many foreign prisoners+their dependents, with strict border control. Money saved spend on social care, police, army, schools. 
#Leavers claim a #PeoplesVote would cause rioting.People can now see #Brexit is an act of monumental stupidity that will damage the economy, jobs and people lives. I doubt if #Leave could muster enough rioters to fill a minibus in the event of #Brexit being overturned. 
Carney, BBC and Sky News. Hired by Brussels to scare the shit out you with endless fear projections over a no deal Brexit. Remember this. Everything they have predicted so far has been wrong. They are paid hacks of the Brussels elite. It's pure and simple propaganda. 
Does it explain why you’re reneging on your own post-election promise to ban live exports after Brexit? Asking for a ruminant  
Doubly misleading from @bernardjenkin. Commons vote will be on the A50 withdrawal package, not Chequers. Chequers is UK opening bid in a second negotiation about the future relationship which will come later in 2019 after #Brexit. And not true British people voted for an FTA.  
Oh, sod off @Telegraph. Mark Carney is one of the few adults in the Brexit room. The future is only bright and jolly for disaster capitalists, charlatan politicians and unethical scumbags with money safely hidden away in tax havens, like your owners.  
Politicians of all parties need to stop pretending their Brexit will be better and come clean - the only good Brexit is #StopBrexit.MPs must call for a #PeoplesVote and give the public a say, with the #OptionToStay. 
Thank you so much to @bernardjenkin for pledging to #StandUp4Brexit "The British people voted very clearly to leave the EU and that was the policy of the British Government, but the so-called Chequers proposals will not deliver the Brexit that the British people voted for"  
"To achieve impartiality, you do not need to include outright deniers of climate change in BBC coverage" - if only they'd taken this approach with the EU referendum.  
We’re calling on Government & Parliament to support a touring visa for musicians post-Brexit.    Any EU touring visa must be affordable, multi-entry, admin-light & cover all EU member states.     #WorkingInTheEU 
Why have you chosen to do this on the same day as @peoplesvote_uk march.  Supporting #peoplesvote would show you care about the EU27 citizens who have been treated abominably by the brexit glitterati and their followers on the basis of their place of birth #FinalSayForAll 
High Court judgement confirms that the Electoral Commission acted unlawfully on its handling of the EU referendum. The #Brexit debacle just gets worse and worse.  
The bankers and those with money will seek to profit from the misery of a post-Brexit Britain. Exploiting the poor and vulnerable for financial gain. This needs to stop - #StopBrexit and let's get on with saving the NHS and providing a future for the next generation... #r4today 
Some inaccurate Brexit headlines+coverage in today’s papers. EU & Ireland couldn’t be clearer: there will be no agreement without a backstop that guarantees no hard border and delivers on UK commitments of Dec & March. You can read my latest position here:  
We're still casting 'Carry On Brexit' and every one seems agreed: Charles Hawtrey IS Jacob Rees-Mogg.  Kenneth Williams is the front-runner for Barnier and either Sid James or Peter Butterworth for Farage.  
Businessman @LanceForman gives 7 reasons why business should embrace Brexit.  
I support IPOB's advocacy for a #referendum as well as allied calls for a reassessment of our over a century & 14yrs political wedlock.This doesn't make me or other advocates less patriotic. 
Sensible from Former Irish ambassador Ray Bassett: “Ireland needs to look after its own self-interest...There is no need for the Irish border question to...derail the EU/UK Brexit discussions” & “no need for any new physical infrastructure on the border”  
In the time since the Referendum, I could've walked from Land's End to John O'Groats 58 times, flown around the world 429 times & read War and Peace 598 times, yet the Gov't still haven't been able to even define Brexit. Time to #endthechaos & #StopBrexit#LDConf #FBPE #parkrun

May helps Orbán because Brexit has turned Britain into "perfidious Albion". Europe needs liberal conservatism to start defending democracy   
Shortly before he became leader of the Liberal Democrats, Vince Cable admitted that Brexit could drive up people's pay. #LDconf 
Interesting to see Theresa May’s former policy chief contemplating the case for a People’s Vote. Growing realisation among many Conservative MPs that a referendum may be the best way to resolve the mess the Govt are blundering into  
Patience is running out with Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn and his 'respect the vote' achieved by cheating and breaking the law Mr Starmer @Keir_Starmer. You know #Brexit will fail your 6 tests. Stand up and oppose it and support a #PeoplesVote 
Yes it could. And let's remember , it's not just saving us from #brexit, more importantly it is halting the march of fascism. And if anyone thinks that is not the case they need only to look at the backers and chief protagonists and their backers Bannon and Mercer. #FBPE

No your duty is to tell your constituents the truth - which YOU KNOW is that Brexit will be a disaster & there should be a people’s vote to stop it  
Hammond has attempted to sabotage Brexit every step of the way. A constant barrage of Project Fear, extending Mark Carney's tenure at the BoE, and now calling for Brexit to be delayed altogether. He should be sacked!Support us at

‘May will hold ANOTHER REFERENDUM to avoid election HUMILIATION,’ says Rachel Johnson - Express  
This is Brexit all over: no facts, no evidence, just a victim narrative, and not even a coherent one. When you leave most clubs they say: "off you go then. Bye". If they take time to talk to you about extending some membership benefits, you're being treated rather well.  
You can resolve it by not treating the result of an*advisory* referendum as being mandatory. You can resolve it by not treating a very narrow 'win' as 'the will of the people' You can resolve it by opposing a referendum 'won' on proven lies & breaking of the law. @Andrew_Adonis 
I share your concerns about the impact of no-deal Brexit on EU-UK defence cooperation: the bad blood would poison relations. But at this stage, my answer to your 'what should NATO do?' question is: exactly nothing. Let's keep NATO clear of the Brexit acrimony as much as possible  
Now the judges agree – the vote for Brexit was clearly tainted | Jolyon Maugham  
Remoaners are screaming for a second referendum in the name of democracy, but where were these people when Maastricht was signed without a referendum? 
This petition is particularly close to my heart. In 2016 the UK govt chose to disenfranchise Brits abroad 15yrs+, so that they didn’t even get a say on #Brexit How unjust could that be? To be unable to have a say when your rights & future are at stake?  
.@vincecable"- Whether you see yourself as a liberal, social democrat, progressive, or centrist there is a home for you here, particularly as we fight Brexit together"   
.......some effective opposition to Brexit would be a start. He must know that the real ‘Brexit dividend’ is the wholesale deregulation of banking and finance and the slashing of taxation. 
Some FACTS to share with those obstinate Brexiters who are still insisting that the EU will suffer more than the UK with a no-deal Brexit.@thatginamiller @Women_4_Europe @GMB @LeaveEUOfficial @TheSun @MumsnetTowers #EndTheChaos #SaturdayMorning #StopBrexit 
Former UK ambassador and Remain voter Sir Christopher Meyer gets behind Brexit - telling fellow remainers to accept the result and not try to reverse it, or go for a second referendum.  
Total Referendum spending:Leave campaign : £13,000,000Remain campaign : £28,000,000Just saying.@CarolineLucas 
If reports are true tonight and £7billion perfume empire Chanel is snubbing Paris to set up it’s HQ in London for the future after Brexit then surely even the gloomiest of Remainers will reach for their little Union Jack flags, no? 
In case you missed it, Mark Carney has confirmed my point from the night before last: the @bankofengland is NOT forecasting a 35% house price crash if there’s a hard Brexit. These were stress tests  
This is a witch hunt against Nicola Sturgeon and the whole of the SNP They know the lies at the last referendum will not work again This is all part of the new dirty tricks campaign Labour and Tory working in secret to smear Scotland and the SNP  
The Electoral Commission, the body in charge of ensuring the Referendum was fair ensured it was unfair.Gave permission to Vote Leave to spend more than Parliament had allowed.  
Choose *any* claim made by #brexiters. Pick at it, and it comes apart in your hands within seconds. Brexit's threat to our nation survives only by the efforts of the easily-duped, those happy to lie for personal reward, those working for compromised media sources and the evil.  
A very good speech from Hungarian Prime Minister, where he basically say to the EU Mafia Screw you, we will defend our country, even from you if we have to. More countries in Europe need to get a backbone like Hungary and adopt the Brexit spirit  
Philip Hammond demands Brexit is delayed! this has been his plan all along. Hammond needs to be sacked now, he is working against the UK..  
The main border in Ireland, so I am. Geographically, anyway. At first ad hoc, then accidentally semi-permanent. Once very policed, now very sexy. Threatened by Brexit, laughing at Brexit. Bit tired but not giving up  
Correction. Following yesterday's lame puff piece with @BBCandrewkerr which technically is an "interview", I have had 1 interview with the BBC in the last 116 days. #indyref2 #Brexit The same number as the Salisbury assasins by their state broadcaster.  
With a shattered low wage & low skill economy - a post-Brexit Britain could find people having to work all of their lives just to get by. The Bank of England have analysed the scenarios and are genuinely worried. We need to stop this #BrexitShambles with a #PeoplesVote #r4today

Just for a second, imagine what we could be doing as a country if we hadn’t been pissing away our future for the last two years with Brexit. 
Corbyn has finally worked out if he rejects May’s Brexit he will then be able to impose his own from No 10. This is nothing to celebrate. 
‘The time to start thinking of new ways through this crisis is now. A new referendum is undoubtedly one of them.’ Powerful endorsement from the doyen of political commentators Matthew Parris  
Oh but surely your very newspaper (under previous editorship until last week) has spent years telling its readers a no-deal Brexit would be nirvana on speed and that only "traitors" could think otherwise.  If I were them, I'd ask for my money back  
Try as they might, Hard-Brexiters like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson have still failed to come up with a single tangible benefit for Brexit. It is an unmitigated disaster which will damage the UK for generations. We need to #StopBrexit with a #PeoplesVote 
Labour will Vote Against Theresa May’s Basketcase Tory Brexit  
The ERG are a campaigning group, campaigning for a specific Eurosceptic Conservative wingpolicy relating to Brexit. I say that if they are going to campaign for the hardest of Brexits, or even a No Deal Brexit, then I should not be paying for it. 1/2  
Watch this clip. It’s a kind of weather report version of fake Brexit news.

So many leave voters who are #RemainerNow I've liaised with have said one of the reasons or their leave vote in 2016 was as it was difficult to decipher clear facts on brexit with all political rhetoric.This is why I think #EndTheChaos campaign is vital.

In some ways, the real story of Brexit is not so much what it says about the EU and its need to improve its democratic fibre (which it very much does need to do), but the fundamental challenges it is generating for UK democracy.  
You know? It's really difficult to do anything when Labour and the Tories both want the referendum result. That fact is the datum for everything. So you have to shift Labour because you can't shift the Tories (and the Tories tbf have a mandate for their stance on Brexit). 
By recording 100% compliance in today’s sit-at-home Biafrans have passed a vote of no confidence on their governors n saboteurs, a clear indication that if a referendum is conducted anytime soon close to 100% Biafrans will opt out of this abominable entity called Nigeria @UN @EU 
The Labour front bench are as much about damaging ideology right now as the Tories. They see a chance to get Brexit via the Tories and then ride into No 10 in the resulting chaos.Neither party is fit to govern and I'm not sure the rest of parliament is much better. 
Boris insists that he is only against Theresa May’s Brexit Plan not against the PM personally. Why not? She’s a disaster. 
Now here's a chap in custody who is close to Semion Mogilevich and who could explain a lot....he can also put some flesh on interference in UK Brexit elections...Meet Dmitry Firtash  
Hammond has said that Brexit should be delayed to prepare for a no deal. He would use any excuse but this one is highly ironic. 
Romanian rights groups challenge 'homophobic' marriage referendum: 
I think my Bond story, if I were to do one these days, would involve a plot to buy up massive amounts of UK assets in the wake of a Putin ordered cyber attack on UK banks in the wake of Brexit.  Plenty of action, globe-trotting & believeable enough to scare the shit out of you. 
Despite Brexit.  
It's time to make everyone's vote count. Vote 'yes' for proportional representation in the referendum.  
British businesses are worried about a no deal Brexit. @GuyReuters breaks down why. More:  
10/ It's 2016. There's a referendum on Brexit. British media is saturated with racist dog whistles by right wing Europhobes. The BBC continually platforms a man who makes the referendum about blaming the EU for immigrants. Britain votes Leave. Corbyn is blamed, not David Cameron. 
Hmmm... that’s exactly what they said about Brexit and Trump. 
Now Governor Carney belatedly says he didn’t predict house prices would collapse with no-deal Brexit, sometime after the claim makes most front pages and becomes “fact”. From Dublin, he now claims he didn’t make prediction, just that Bank could cope if it happened #looselips 
Emmanuel Macron will have been choking on his croissant this morning as Chanel announced that – despite Brexit – they were snubbing Paris to set up their global office in London. Sacré bleu!  
My take away from Geneva: However bad you think #Brexit is going to be, it'll be much, much worse. 
Come off it Boris.  When she has shown monumental incompetence on the greatest issue of our times, and championed a plan that rides roughshod over the referendum result, she cannot be defended.  @telegraph 
New evidence shows that the midterm elections will be the clearest referendum on a president in at least 80 years.  
When the Brexit implosion comes, as it's sure to do, it'll see the simultaneous end of Brexit, the collapse of the Tory government, the end of the political careers of both May and Corbyn, the recovery of sterling, the demise of the Tory party and the final humiliation of Farage. 
Labour have never had a remotely credible or coherent Brexit policy of their own. They have instead simply voted to try & score political points and taken their supporters for fools, lying and obfuscating from the start. They will be found out in the end.  
If the EU rejects the Chequers deal - as some think is inevitable - then what’s the alternative? The softest imaginable Brexit - where we stay INSIDE the Single Market and INSIDE the Customs Union - a border down the Irish Sea or no Brexit at all? Join me from 1 on @LBC 
You can't take back control if you won't accept responsibility, and you can't accept responsibility unless you are willing to accept the blame. There is not a single Brexiter who will do that. They are cowards, con-men, charlatans & liars.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit 
What a load of rubbish @bernardjenkin - You are lying to the British public as are your colleagues in the ERG.#Brexit is the biggest con job on the British people in the history of our politics.You provide no verifiable proof of your claims. All you have is hot air. #bbcaq 
But now that the High Court, the Electoral Commission, and all independent judgements have shown that one side cheated in referendum and the polls confirm that most people now wish to remain should we not be seeking to give all constituents the chance to say what they now think?

So sick now of the EU. A day does not go by where they don't threaten air travel, sea travel, rail travel through the tunnel or demand that we give them 40 billion for no reason at all. I really want a hard brexit to show these arseholes they are wrong in everything they say !!!

Excl: PM’s senior aide accused by MPs of branding Brexit Secretary “a f***ing nightmare” as tensions spiral over negotiations strategy; 
I tore up my Labour membership over it. Brexit is a lie. Labour’s leaders are facilitating it. As such they back the lie. Oh and Brexit is also very bloody fascist in its aims...That added some vigour to the tearing (in truth it was a pair of scissors and a membership card).

My electricity is going up by 10%, gas by 13%. This is due to the weakness of sterling, which is due to to Brexit. My salary is just about back to what it was 10 yrs ago. It’s about time @UKLabour got off their ass & opposes this bullshit. 
With the success of IPOB's sit-at-home campaign,one expected  our presidential aspirants to take a stand on the matter. Advocates of today's defiance aren't asking 4 restructuring,they are asking 4 a #referendum. We need know their views on this popular quest by IPOB. 
Conservative MP @bernardjenkin tells Any Questions? that the UK will see the economic benefits "within months" of Brexit.Listen to the whole programme here:

I’m not impressed with government’s handling of Brexit, but Labour are no better. How can you have the ‘exact same benefits’ as being in the EU without being in? I can’t have the exact same benefits of flying across the Atlantic in a plane without actually being in the plane. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg’s hard Brexit group questioned over funding. When did British politics become so dirty? 
Lord Adonis - Can I make the obvious point in all this... by far the best way of handling this is to scrap this whole #brexit nonsense & not to do it at all... we should have a #PeoplesVote & stay in the European Union. #FBPE #bbcaq @Andrew_Adonis

I read history from secondary school up to university. Didn't see a place where our colonial masters got the go-ahead from our forefathers to amalgamate the N & S protectorates in 1914. So, it's no crime for IPOB or any group to ask for a referendum,over century  later.

I spent a few days north in our Island. I encountered towns and communities vulnerable and not as prosperous with hope or amenities. Brexit promises to intensify disadvantage. More than ever time for United Island embracing all traditions.  
This makes no sense. If the ‘greater number of unionists’ voted for Brexit surely it would have been a leave vote? (Aside: the sectarianisation of Brexit in NI has been v grim to watch)

Tories are born liars....Raab: "It is clear our teams are closing in on workable solutions to the outstanding issues in the withdrawal agreement."EU: "Diplomats suggest that in reality there was a complete impasse." 
Even if we don't leave the EU, #Brexit has at least brought to light that the UK is NOT a democratic country ... and from that realisation, revolutions can happen.

In New York speaking to a packed meeting of the Irish American James Connolly Labour Coalition. Talking about Connolly, ending partition, a unity referendum and Irish Unity.  
#Brexit Britain is about to be destroyed by a mega-cyclone. It's no doubt been attracted by all the hate crimes since the advisory referendum. Luckily, the diversity and unity of the EU means it will be repelled away from our citizens. 
Above and beyond the foreign residences/EU passport for Brextremists like Lawson, Farage, Chandler, Ashcroft, Wigmore etc, key figures from the YBF Brexit origins have US partners. It's almost like they have a safety net for when things go badly wrong (i.e. Soon) 
Brexit was a vote to leave the EU, it was not a vote to stay half in half out, it was not a vote to leave part of the EU, it was not a vote to negotiate a deal to water down our vote & it was not a vote for a transition period to keep us in the EU to 2021. We need a clean break 
Love this website, thanks ⁦@thatginamiller⁩If you’ve any questions about Brexit - what it means for you and your job or the jargon explained - you’ll love this site too.  
Mr Starmer, you will be aware that the Electoral Commission made public on 17 July 2018 that the leave vote was procured by electoral crimes. Can you explain to us all why you are not now insisting - as an MP - that "brexit" is simply now ended ? Isn't this a matter of law now ? 
Given what we now know about #Brexit it's time ALL politicians admit it's not the right thing for the country and back a #PeoplesVote.Do the right thing. The rest doesn’t matter. Doing the right thing isn’t free. Doing the right thing might even cost you everything. 
I'm curious, do @theSNP and their supporters support a 2nd referendum on Brexit, given it's potential to scupper any hopes for#indyref2? 
The risk to house prices could be a Brexit game changer for middle England. As Brexit voters are largely older and more likely to own homes, it's ironic that in all of this mess, the biggest gift they give to the younger generations is a housing crash - a spectacular own goal.

The brilliance of this?Vote Leave and all others can get off free because the Electoral Commission is so dysfunctional it doesn’t understand the law it enforces.And subsequently Brexit carries on with a free pass and we move to a new electoral normal.  
has anyone actually done any research into the effects of the Brexit vote on people with pre-existing mental health issues? we're suffering massively and nobody's talking about it. obviously Brexit will decimate the NHS & mental healthcare services, but it's harming us already.

Read my latest blog, now online @An_Phoblacht on partition, #Brexit & setting out a road map towards an agreed, united Ireland.  
Bananas. The EC gave incorrect guidance to Vote Leave, for which it is fining Vote Leave. So rerun the referendum? Both sides lied their socks off. One with public money BTW. There was a vote. Turnout was huge. Leave won by a clear margin.  
We are being held to ransom by a percentage of 27% of the electorate who voted to leave based on a campaign that cheated & broke the law. Even if all of the leave voters went out on the streets if #Brexit was stopped, that's still 63% of the electorate who wouldn't. #PeoplesVote

Shadow foreign secretary @EmilyThornberry says Labour would likely vote down any Brexit deal @theresa_may agrees with Brussels 
Well, well, who’s surprised?Tory Rory Stewart now telling us that there can’t be a referendum on the final deal ‘because it’s too complicated’.The country has been well and truly had.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote 
What does Brexit mean 'on the ground' for ordinary people and businesses? A highly informative compilation of examples, from just one small area of the country, by @susanvandeven here:  
What is everyone's favorite Brexit scare story?Space asteroids is probably my fav to date. Anyone got something more funny and why? 
Brexit poll finds voters 59-41 in favour of staying in the EU  
Paralysed and incompetent government is unable to negotiate a deal that works for Britain. We need a #PeoplesVote so we can reject this mess of a Brexit. #OFOC 
On 14 July 2016, David Davis said by September 2016 Prime Minister would "trigger a large round of global trade deals... to be concluded within 12 to 24 months." Times up and we have zero, zilch, 0, #trade deals. #Brexit @Feorlean 
It turns out not all international relocation decisions are about Brexit. It also turns out that firms relocate *into* Britain as well as out of it - often with no discussion in the UK press before the decision is announced. Might be worth remembering that  
A #Brexit young people did not ask for is being imposed on them -- and their voices and futures have been ignored. 16 and 17 year olds should be given a voice too. #VotesAt16 
MPs and the public are backing a #PeoplesVote on Brexit.Let’s do this.Give the public a say, with an #optiontostay. #StopBrexit. 
On Wednesday Govt set out its "green Brexit" plan.Yesterday ministers announced 42,000 badgers will be killed next year, and we'll have no environmental regulator for months after Brexit.Next Saturday we walk with @ChrisGPackham in defence of wildlife.#PeoplesWalkforWildlife 
 Yesterday @DominicRaab said: "It is rather easy for a business to blame Brexit and politicians rather than to take responsibility for their own situation."@theSNP MSP James Dornan (@glasgowcathcart) raised these worrying comments with @NicolaSturgeon during this week's #FMQs

France has been leading a concerted effort to pinch British business ahead of Brexit for years but not even major French companies like ⁦@CHANEL⁩ think Paris can offer what London can. Sacré bleu!

We agree with @PimlicoPlumbers. It’s time to stop Brexit! #peoplesvote #BollocksToBrexit Fantastic giant Bollocks to Brexit sticker seen by thousands of commuters arriving at Waterloo every day!  
Don't think this is entirely correct but broadly (lab balancing its coalition, left see economic transformation as project & will compromise on most things to get there, will almost certainly reject tory brexit) it's right. If Sunny Hundal can grasp this the rest have no excuse  
I am a passionate European and always believed the EU referendum should have been a two-stage process, with a vote on the principle and one on how leaving could be achieved in practice.Under my leadership, Plaid Cymru will campaign to remain in the EU in a second referendum.  
Aaah, now I understand what Jeremy Corbyn meant by his “Not a single job lost” Brexit. He actually meant it literally, as in there’ll be hundreds and thousands, not just one.  
ICYMI: Roaming charges aren't going to go up because of Brexit. All the major providers have already committed to keep EU roaming free, and Three already proved that the market was there for free roaming BEFORE the EU passed any laws on it  
Maybe Dominic Raab will tell British Steel not to hide behind Brexit excuses... stiff upper lip and just make it work better. 
If you want to stop Brexit...Get behind Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour  
Brexit idiot of the week poll. 
HMA open letter to British citizens in Spain on Brexit negotiations .British Embassy says not to worry, cos they're going to get a "positive & ambitious deal". So relieved, as we mistakenly thought it was all going rather Pete Tong.@Bremaininspain 
The right response from the Electoral Commission would not be to pretend all is fine and dandy but to (1) accept that there were serious failings in its management of the Referendum and (2) commission external advice on whether they could reasonably have affected the outcome. 
What are we doing, !You wanted more trade with the world. Brexit pulls us out of the largest free trade area in the world, along with the 70 or so deals the EU has with other countries and meanwhile the EU increases its trade...continent by continent. 
Well you know what? I'm 35 and I've been in the EU/EEC my whole life and no one asked me until 2016 whether I wanted to be part of it. We voted leave and it would be crazy to re-run the vote without enacting it first. #BBCQT #Brexit #StandUp4Brexit 
Mr Barnier, we know that Brexit was procured by crime. We are fairly certain it was interfered with by Russia. We are certain that the UK was lied to over & over again. Mrs May knew about the fraud when she sent her letter. I am an EU citizen. How can this be right?#endthechaos 
"Prominent remain supporters including former British prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major have been working with Nick Clegg and Lord Mandelson on a parallel diplomatic mission to persuade European leaders to stop Brexit." 
How ON EARTH is this not even mentioned on BBC news?I’m constantly GOBSMACKED by how uninterested @bbcnews has been in opposition to Brexit.@bbclaurak - you surely have an interest in covering this?A US hurricane is NOT the day’s top story. 
REMOANER HQ:The Leave campaign cheated on their expenditure.COURT:The Electoral System gave misleading advice to Leave.REMOANER HQ: The referendum is such a shambles it must be stopped.NORMAL PEOPLE:????? 
3) We always knew Corbyn & McDonnell were ambivalent towards Brexit. They are behaving exactly as they think (in contrast to Cameron/Blair/May, who u-turned constantly). In other words, Remainers are attacking Corbyn/McD for being the kind of politicians their supporters love.

Just heard Murdo Fraser parrot Ruth’s line about “we used to be #Brexit Remainers but…”. As Remain voters they knew - and still know - the damage that even the #Chequers proposals will do to Scotland.  Their duty as Scottish representatives is to stand against that,not accept it 
This is part of the current Tory establishment ‘s hard sell of the Chequers proposals as a “good deal”. They aren’t and nor is a blind #Brexit. SM & CU membership only possible alternative . Davidson: Theresa May's critics must 'quit the noise' - BBC News

@IainDale tried clinging on to that notion too, desperation is kicking in because their argument about a #PeoplesVote #DealorStayinEU is somehow undemocratic, but sticking to a vote ‘won’ by lying and cheating by Brexit elites isn’t, is getting more and more laughable by the day! 
Eurostar will not run if there is a no-deal Brexit, French Europe minister warns  
Ok. *deep breath* a thread on Labour and Brexit. As a strong Remainer I find it odd when fellow Remainers attack the Labour leadership (Corbyn / McDonnell) for not being against Brexit enough. Its unnecessary and misguided. Here's why 
Hey @OwenJones84 fwiw I want a labour government too and find it hard now we have seen what Brexit will entail to see what kind of deal we could negotiate that could benefit the country at all as opposed to have negative consequences? What would you seek that would be different?  
The British public have been lied to about #Brexit and the Leave campaign broke the law.  Important findings out today. These people simply cannot be trusted. They flout the rules and are now trying to spin their way out. 
Mark Carney has issued a grave warning to government that a No Deal Brexit would likely mean a huge disruption in trade, significant contraction in the economy comparable to 2008, higher unemployment, and rising inflation. We need a People's Vote.  
Walk away    Brexit LIVE: GIVE US YOUR MONEY or it's NO-DEAL threatens EU  
Now that #Brexit is going so badly & #Brexiters are losing the argument terminally I honestly think the term #Remoaner needs 2B superceded by #Bremoaner. Poor dears really are struggling to see their debased Brexit invalidated by reality & a majority in favour of #Remain. 
Congratulations to @SadiqKhan on being reselected as @UKLabour candidate for Mayor of London in 2020 - Labour mayor delivering for our city in the face of Tory austerity and Brexit chaos 
BOE Carney continues his publicly evident hostility to any form of Brexit, ill suiting an unelected central bank leader who is not even British, like many other central bankers convinced he knows what is best for"the people"  
Think moderate Tory rebels will be cancelled out by Labour pro-Brexit rebels. Can't see ERG lot actually voting against deal. Reckon when it comes down to vote they'll bank Brexit then relaunch fight from outside EU. 
Clegg leads pro-remain grandees on diplomatic mission to stop Brexit  
U.K. house prices are headed for a no-deal Brexit crash  
Hate to say I told you so but looking back at what I've been saying for two years everything I've predicted about EU unity of purpose and tough Brexit negotiations' resolve so far has been correct.  
60% of Brexit headlines are things we've known for months. 
Latest EU warning:-  if Brexit carrys on then the UK will be invaded by aliens! The whole Country will be wiped out in minutes!!  
On @BBCQuestionTime Prisons Minister @RoryStewartUK said we couldn’t have a #PeoplesVote on the #BrexitDeal because, basically, it’s too complicated for a referendum. So, we were given a simple question, but now we’re not allowed any say on the complicated answer. #FinalSay 
Emily Thornberry has just said Labour would vote down Govt Brexit deal. Excellent. This kills a major route to Brex…  
This was always going to happen. It could have worked had anti-Corbyn melts not transmogrified into second referendum fanatics thereby nearly destroying any chance of a soft Brexit. All so predictable.  
#ProjectFear #brexitProject Fear projections are coming in waves now. There are *many*people doing their utmost to block a clean Brexit.Take a look at this anti-Project-Fear "moment" page. It has some VERY useful info. Remember how Project Fear ramped up, before the Referendum.  
If you watch all of this Brexit chaos and do nothing,  you're going to have to answer to your kids and grandkids pretty soon...  
Send in the clowns - my latest Brexit Blog post, on this week's Economists for Free Trade and ERG reports, just up:  
We agree that we need significant Electoral Commission reform so that bad faith actors like @Matthew_Elliott and @darrengrimes_ cannot take advantage of the system again. We must right these wrongs and reform the @ElectoralCommUK before another election or referendum is tainted. 
This is a very good omen for @UKEUchallenge as it has now been confirmed that the Electoral Commission regulated the Referendum on the basis of an error of law. See here for more info on the case and how to support it:  
Wow, this just so laughable! How you expect ANYONE to come up with post-Brexit Policies when you Tories can’t even decide/agree what #Brexit will look like! You are all fighting like #CatsinaSack #BrassNeck #BrexitChaos 
I’m away right now and can only get CNN. Listening to reports of Paul Manafort’s guilty plea and hearing reporters asking the right questions openly. Thinking how silent UK tv is on the dirty, corrupt underbelly of Brexit. 
The Tories are so utterly petrified by their own incompetence on Brexit they're doing their damndest to eradicate all debate of the subject at conference. 
In the last week, Boris Johnson and his band of Brexiteer supporters have steadfastly refused to accept any responsibility for the unfolding chaos they have visited upon Britain. Brexit is a project by the elites for the elites. My @Independent column: 
In their ruling, the High Court found that @ElectoralCommUK misguided Vote Leave about referendum expenditure. But they are careful to note that this does NOT negate Vote Leave's violation of common plan expense law.  
Useful dialogue w/ @DominicRaab this morning on the progress our teams have made this week on the #Brexit WA. But substantive differences remain on the Protocol for IE/NI, governance and GIs. We are also continuing our discussions to find common ground on the future relationship. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg's European Research Group, a hard-Brexit faction of Tory MPs, has been censured for using taxpayers’ money to carry out party political activity. This is in flagrant breach of rules. MPs have been funnelling their expenses into the group... #Dodgy #StopBrexit 
This is explosive if the Brit Est. cheated in the EU referendum they sure as hell cheated in Scotland's independence referendum!  
I don’t want Brexit Lexit or anything like it. The clear alternative to this utter shambles is #remain. I’d rather Parliament sorted it but it looks like we have no leaders, so #peoplesvote it is 
Gina Miller poses for greatest photo ever taken in new campaign to stop Brexit 
This young lady looks around 19/20So probably was just below 18 at the time of the referendumAnd @Jacob_Rees_Mogg tells her that she will be almost 70 Before we see any Brexit benefitThat's right almost 70we need a #PeoplesVote and we need it now

''That's my whole lifetime and I didn't vote on this''This audience member says she should not have to deal with the consequences of Brexit for the rest of her life #bbcqt 
Bank of England governor Mark Carney now denies he said house prices will fall by 1/3 if there is no deal Brexit. Same old Project Fear 
Jeremy's going to stop Brexit by causing a no-deal Brexit. It's actually very nuanced  
Amused to see the British papers during my 36 hours in London. For more than a year, headlines have reflected a permanent crisis over PM @theresa_may's managing of #Brexit. Whatever the date on the calendar, every day seems to be the (imminent) end of May! 
but then what? she says she'd prefer an election over a People's Vote because "I'm a democrat," thus implying that a #PeoplesVote isn't democratic. but 3 elections in 3 years is fine, you're allowed to change your mind about the government constantly, but NEVER about Brexit.  
Labour isn't ever going to leave Britain in the lurch when it comes to Brexit; they will vote against the madness and incompetence of Theresa May's govt.  #emilythornberry 
I am flying the Pimlico red and blue flag at the @LibDems annual conference in Brighton this year, in support of the Lib Dems determination to stop the UK leaving the EU. #LibDemConference #Brexit #LibDems 
Leavers should not be under any illusion that Brexit is in any way remotely patriotic. It is the most unpatriotic act of all because Brexit will only harm our country. 
OK, you and I have had a few hum-dingers in our time, but this is out there. You're literally saying Labour should veto any Brexit deal put forward by a Conservative Prime Minister, regardless of whether it's in the national interest. Jobs, investment, NI peace-deal. Irrelevant. 
"Wouldn't a new EU referendum be a two-way choice and therefore too simplistic for such a complicated issue?"A referendum is a hell of a lot more appropriate for judging the deal than judging Leave-Remain in 2016. In 2016 the options were infinite. By November there'll only be 3 
Inside the EU the UK had high employment, a stable jobs market, strong workers rights, relatively low inflation, low food prices, high quality imports and a good standard of living for most.Remind me, why is this being risked on the alter of #Brexit. How will UK lives improve? 
Another day of @bbc automatically going for the Brextremist spin on Brexit.  
Imagine what a win it’d be for Labour if:- they beat Brexit plan in Parl- then the public also booted Brexit - then the Govt falls after 2.5y of Brexit time-wasting - then Lab have a GE manifesto on addressing all areas that were neglected, with Brexit well out of way. 
Check this out, we inspired Charlie so much @PimlicoPlumbers by our #bollockstobrexit #tee that it now adorns @PimlicoPlumbers #London business! ‘Shout it from the rooftops’ Love #wordupdesign Creators of Pro-EU & Anti-Brexit apparel & accessories   
Sorry? Your personal red lines are Labour should vote down any deal, no matter what it is? Because it's a Conservative government that has negotiated it? Even though you also fear blocking Brexit will embolden the far-right? 
Brexiter demands for a successful Brexit:1. Full & seamless trade with EU272. Immigration for NHS, farming & all jobs Brits can't/won't do3. Trade deals with RoW4. No hard border btwn Ireland & NI5. Full security cooperation with EU27Ever heard of REMAINING? #endthechaos 
Mark Carney, the Bank of England's governor has said that house prices could fall by as much as 35% in a no-deal Brexit scenario. @ShelaghFogarty asks: Is this the Brexit warning you'll finally listen to?  
NEW Labour set to vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal, says Emily Thornberry 
“What’s now clear is that the referendum was won on points by a crooked fighter with the help of a hapless umpire. This is the stuff of tin pot potentates. Our democracy will be an international laughing stock if we continue to pretend there is a proper mandate to leave the EU”  
9 ways Brexit could be really, really irritating  
Reminder, my first Brexit SOS public meeting is at Downham Market Town Hall on Tuesday, 7-9pm. Free entry. Everyone welcome. Special guest speaker @SuzanneEvans1 will be joining me to talk about saving a genuine Brexit and ditching May's Chequers sell-out. 
Emily Thornberry has announced that Labour will oppose any Brexit deal that is made.Just announced this and it shows the Labour Party doesn’t support Democracy and has no intention of honouring the Referendum.So the choice of 17.4m ppl means nothing to the Labour Party. 
I have to ask this simple question: is there a single intelligent person who genuinely supports Brexit for any reason other than personal enrichment, political career advancement, fear of civil uprising, party loyalty or racial prejudice, all of which I consider invalid reasons? 
The dispiriting thing is that, having been an out-spoken remainer, @RuthDavidsonMSP knows full well how monumentally damaging Brexit will be yet she is complicit in its prosecution for party fealty when her personal dissension could prove pivotal. It’s not too late yet, Ruth   
EEA / EFTA membership is the only solution to Brexit that keeps us in the single market and solves the Irish border question.Hard Brexiters don’t want that, because it means freedom of movement. They are ignoring the best interests of the country for selfish ideological dogma.  
More Tory cheating, caught once again but laughing at us as nothing happens, nobody held to account. 
Remember the discussion I had with @OwenJones84 the other day, about the extent Corbyn supporting commentators take their lines from the leadership. Up until now, they have backed the line Brexit should not be blocked, and there should be no second referendum. Watch this space. 
We need to think long and hard about how we have allowed a Quango which doesn't understand the law itself, to persecute a young person who just wanted to get stuck into the referendum.  
We already knew #VoteLeave cheated. Now the High Court rules that they were also wrongly allowed by the Electoral Commission do things they shouldn’t. The basis for #Brexit looking ever dodgier   
PROJECT FEAR: Westmonster's @StevenEdginton shut down Remainers on BBC. 'They said we were going to lose 500,000 jobs after the referendum, yet we have the lowest unemployment in 40 years!' 
So @RuthDavidsonMSP has finally given an interview to @BBCScotlandNews, and we are told it was "wide-ranging". So how come all I'm hearing about is her support of Theresa May? Her support for Brexit? That's it. No mention of #darkmoney? Beyond the joke. 
Very well said by @faizashaheen. While we’ve gone round in circles on Brexit, discovering that the referendum promises were unworkable... ... our schools, housing, police, NHS, environment have been squeezed out and fallen behind.   
Emily Thornberry has gone on record saying that Theresa May cannot get a deal through, cannot meet Labour's six tests, based on the Tories own assertions & as such will be voting against May's Brexit deal. On that basis, May will fall. Government too? We can only hope!  
Gina Miller, the anti-Brexit campaigner, has pledged to help “end the chaos” in British politics, with a new website offering “unbiased information” about leaving the EU  
The Parliament cannot simply reject Brexit. Our democracy demands that whatever deal the government delivers in response to the 2016 vote MUST be judged by the people of the United Kingdom.That means Labour must support a public vote on the deal. 
We keep talking about the 52% and 48%. Well @UKLabour seems to be backing the 89% who think the government's Brexit deal won't be good. I must tentatively say: Nice one!(Sorry, there's a 'but' coming...) 
It's like Yoon parties have been taking advice from Steve BannonTories: SNP need to sort out farming - after Tories bring about its collapse with BrexitLabour: Scotland's economy is broken - few days after figures show Scotland is outperforming the rUKHypocritical lies 
With respect to Vince Cable, Reese-Mogg etc. if Scotland votes Yes in a referendum its not up to MPs from rUK to decide what happens in Scotland next. What Scotland does afterwards is the sole remit of Scottish Parliament & electorate.That's what independence means.#ScotRef 
Gina Miller launches campaign to 'end the Brexit chaos' #endthechaos 
If you have a problem w/the fact that what MPs will be voting on in the next few months will have little detail on the future relationship and is a so-called "blind Brexit", take it up w/Brussels and Article 50. This vote was always predominantly going to be on orderly exit deal 
Labour’s answer to Brexit is a General Election but they support the same Brexit as the Tories except for the customs union fantasy where they pretend we will have a customs union because the EU will allow us to negotiate our own trade deals.Bonkers. 
Blimey. UK High Court rules the Brexit referendum was crooked  
Emily Thornberry says Labour will probably vote against Theresa May's Brexit deal, which is precisely the opposite of what she said six months ago ...  
There are plenty of losers where #Brexit is concerned & none greater than the UK economy. I am not prepared to sit back & let Theresa May’s unhinged & frankly, dangerous #Government blindly walk Britain into a recession.  It's time to stop Brexit! #PeoplesVote #BollocksToBrexit 
 Fantastic that @UKLabour are seeing the catastrophic impacts that a Tory Brexit would have on Britain. Next step: a #PeoplesVote#OFOC 
Many MPs think the UK’s commitment to new EU Commission military structures ends on Brexit Day.It doesn’t.The transition continues it, giving Olly Robbins time to create a defence treaty which replaces the Lisbon Treaty as the UK’s long-term commitment to the EU defence acquis.  
Almost 1500 MPs and Lords. How many are under the age of 30? From my estimations, 14. That's not even 1%!!Yet as parliament debates and determines Brexit, it's the generation who will deal with the consequences for the longest period of time who have no say at all. Unreal. 
Dover. A town where 62% voted to lave the EU. The sight of a wealthy London-based remainer strutting around on the cliffs will be sure to win a few of them over to a second referendum... 
Ah yes, @BorisJohnson gets the coveted “Jared Kushner’s Backchannel” endorsement from Russia’s Embassy in America.It may be unclear to Britons why Russia’s Embassy *in the United States* should be boosting BoJo  amidst SteeplechaserGate   #Brexit #Skripal 
Emily Thornberry implying that a #FinalSay referendum would be somehow undemocratic, but 3 general elections in 3 years is fine. so people are allowed to constantly change their minds on the government, but never on Brexit  selective democracy. 
Gina Miller claims she will TAKE BACK CONTROL of Brexit with new 'end the chaos' campaign. It's the same every month. She goes into withdrawal without publicity and has to create another 15 minutes of fame.  
The Brexit vote is only the beginning. Rumblings of discontent against the EU cult are spreading across Europe. The EU will no doubt respond with more diktats, says @patrickxwest 
Never belief the lie that the Tories are good stewards of the economy because they've left the British economy dying on the vine with Brexit. #britishsteel 
Great news for @UKEUchallenge. Their claim just became stronger. There was no constitutionally lawful decision to leave the EU. The PM made the decision to notify the EU of our departure as a direct result of an unlawful referendum process. #RescindA50 #PeoplesVote @Suewilson91 
Labour would likely vote down any Brexit deal - Emily Thornberry  
.⁦@RuthDavidsonMSP⁩ has called on the Prime Minister’s critics to “quit the noises off” to allow Theresa May to deliver a Brexit deal at a “crucial moment” in the country’s history.  
Labour plan to vote against the Chequers Deal and try and defeat Govt - but then fight a general election supporting Brexit... #brexitinevitable 
Gina Miller launches campaign to end Brexit divisions and anxiety  
UK credit rating at risk if it fails to pay Brexit bill. UK gov source confirms threat is a bluff.  But Brussels thinks it is all for the domestic audience. A dangerous game w/ repurcussions for Global Britain & tradeLatest from me @Annaisaac  & a thread 
Hull voted leave in 2016 but (according to recent focaldata study) in 3 of its constituencies it's had a 12% plus swing to remain as leave voters see the reality of what brexit means. They are becoming #RemainerNowThe people of Hull for reassessing! 
For the last four months I've been out reporting the impact of Brexit on the UK's food supply chain: not just what's to come, but what's already happening. And it ain't pretty. It's in the new #OFM with @ObserverUK this Sunday. 
I've suddenly realised why there are so few Tory MPs standing up and speaking the truth about Brexit.  If this is what the Tory party does to outsiders, it must be terrifying to be an insider who wants to debate and even to disagree #trotskytories 
I was arguing long before 2016 that house prices were artificially high and due for a correction. You can agree or disagree, obviously. What is odd, though, is how many people suddenly change their tune simply because the word "Brexit" has been added.  
Labour to vote against Brexit deal, Thornberry says  
Main reasons for a #PeoplesVote now proven wrong:- @ElectoralCommUK confirmed #VoteLeave's actions- £350m/week will go to the #NHS- Roaming charges unchanged after #Brexit ... but don't worry, utlra-Remainers will find another 'democratic' reason to try to overturn #Brexit 
Well this is interesting. Tories now *in favour* of falling house prices and negative equity. Wonder how that goes down with their base? Is there any Tory value that they will not sacrifice at the altar of xenophobic Brexit?  
The High Court has ruled that the Electoral Commission got the law wrong over Vote Leave's EU Referendum spending. They found donations made by Vote Leave were not permitted under electoral law.Any credibility of the Brexit vote is gone - we need to #StopBrexit now! #PeoplesVote 
Did you hear? We’re supporting a People’s Vote so that we all get a say on the final Brexit deal  @peoplesvote_uk #BehindEveryMusician #WorkingInTheEU #KeepMusicLive 
Nicola sturgeon got bullied at school (and the band played beleive it if you like) is that why she’s turned into a horrible bully, like trying to force a referendum on the majority, who don’t want one 
4. And this is not because of perceived "abuse", but the left realized after #Brexit & #Trump that it is losing in the war of ideas!But the good news: You can kill (ban) users, but you can't kill ideas!#Twitter #Censorship #AlexJones #InfoWars 
Trying to prosecute Boris Johnson for his "Brexit lies" is an ill-conceived publicity stunt.  
Today’s Brexit “Dividend” explained by a top Brexiteer. It’s a “correction” if you end up losing your house - but the blue passport thing is still happening.  
This is good news for the @UKEUchallengeLooks like a further overspend by Vote Leave. The High Court ruled that the Electoral Commission interpreted the law wrongly re "referendum expenses"@Bremaininspain @A50Challenge @wolchover @RobertCPalmer13 
The U.K. is heading toward “Brex-suicide,” according to key anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller  
Breaking: High Court has ruled that the Electoral Commission is "not fit for purpose" and its regulation of the #Brexit referendum was a complete shambles. In Scotland we should be asking if the same is true of the #Indyref referendum. Which we know it is! 
BBC News - Electoral Commission got Brexit law wrong over Vote Leave, court rules  
As it's revealed UK driving licence may not be valid in EU after no-deal Brexit, Jacob Rees Mogg’s European Research Group propose a perfectly adequate solution:  
My interview on @BBCRadioFoyle with @markyptweets about the possibility of EU mobile roaming charges returning if there is a “no-deal” #Brexit.  
The irony of French-made blue passports that cannot be imported to the UK because a no deal Brexit means that no trade agreement will be in place to allow the blue passports to enter the UK. 
Give me strength. Daniel Hannan, often referred to as the "brains behind Brexit," is now advocating a no-deal economic crisis to lower house prices.Or, you know, we could avoid recession and just build more social and affordable housing?  
Gina Miller launches campaign to ‘end the chaos’ of Brexit  #endthechaos @Women_4_Europe @Labour4EU @W_A_T_O_N 
It looks like we just had our first public referendum on the #TakeAKnee controversy. Donald Trump and his racist MAGAts LOST big time, and fighters against racial injustice WON!! 
The Electoral Commission has succeeded where all others have failed: both Leavers and Remainers now agree it presided over a shambles of a referendum.There is no mandate.  
Sure it's wrong to involve @Jacob_Rees_Mogg children, but what about all the untold stories of EU nationals' children in unseen playgrounds, told they should "go home" because of his Brexit ? Who cries for them in the media ? 
"Labour has been flooded with an estimated 100-plus motions from constituency parties calling for a “people’s vote” on the final Brexit deal to be debated at its annual conference in Liverpool."  
Even the pound has shrugged off Carney’s no deal Brexit warning and stayed on course to deliver its best week in seven months #StandUp4Brexit 
We are now in the absurd situation of going ahead with brexit based on an advisory referendum which would have been declared void had it been binding 
This is a game changer.“It is extraordinary that the body charged by parliament with ensuring the referendum was fair, acted unlawfully to ensure it was unfair.” @JolyonMaugham 
Self determination is a right. I support IPOB's advocacy for a referendum.Until victory, always.

Tory MEPs are NOT left to their own devices. Two Tory MEPs had the whip withdrawn by Tory HQ when they voted that significant process had not been made on Brexit.Says volumes that Theresa May didnt direct her MEP’s to oppose the fascist Hungarian president Viktor Orban. 
Two thirds of people in Dover voted to Leave the EU. We need to show political courage and deliver on that vote. Not try to block Brexit and undermine democracy.  
2.5 yrs spent on Brexit, seems like we’re either going to leave with no deal  or a deal which means we have some of what we had before but no longer any say in the rules  Meanwhile we’ve ignored big issues like academisation and climate change   
Noooo. But the Tory leadership have been so keen to engage in honest and open debate with the public throughout the Brexit process... 
And therein lies the Brexit riddle.If we leave, we would need to reconstruct many of the policies we have as a memberTime for MPs to catch up with the people of this country who are changing their minds on Brexit. It’s September 2018, 196 Days to go, give people the final say  
The EU is an Orwellian nightmare which creates mass migration, high taxes, dissolution of sovereign freedom and internet censorship! I know why people voted Brexit and other countries want OUT! As an American, I will always defend our Constitution and cherish it! #FuckTheEU

No deal Brexit could be as devastating to the UK economy as the 2008 financial crash according to BoE governor Mark Carney.Remember, when recession hits, it's our poorest communities who feel the impact most. Is this really the future we want? 
I doubt we'll see much if any detail on @BBCNews - Let's hope @SkyNews @itvnews and @Channel4News fill the void that is @BBCPolitics concerning #Brexit 
No-deal #Brexit: UK-made cars will not be 'valid for sale' in EU, government document admits.This is the pro-brexit government admitting that the UK car industry will (not may, but will) be screwed in the event of a no deal. It is not #ProjectFear 
Clearly must be a very slow news day in the UK. I mean, it's not like the Tory party are on the verge of imploding, that May will be ousted within the month, that psychopaths are driving us over a Brexit cliff edge, or anything. Corbyn asked a cameraman to turn his camera off.   
Two things:1. I'm SNP, so I'm no big fan of Corbyn.2. WTF are you doing doorstepping Corbyn?? He's not the one in government, he's not leading us off the Brexit cliff. WHY aren't you doorstepping Tories who *ARE* in government and who are avoiding all scrutiny??? 
1947 – Apparently the world’s first Brexit.  
@thatginamiller has spent the summer travelling the UK listening to people from all walks of life to understand how they feel about #Brexit 2 years on from the referendum. None of them voted for chaos. Time to #endthechaos. @endthechaosuk

Don't be. Hungary are suffering the EU at the moment, but we'll show them a better alternative after we brexit and soar as a result. More will quit the EU, just don't get knocked down in the rush. 
Why @bankofengland governor Carney must share with all of us precisely what he told ministers about impact of no-deal Brexit AND May’s Chequers plan  
We cannot give Theresa May and her chaotic Tory Government a blank cheque on Brexit. The British people deserve the final say on the deal and a chance to exit from Brexit. Join our campaign today >

Help take the Conservative party back to its roots - a focus on the military, family and more traditional conservative values.Only by joining the Tory party can you have a direct influence on Brexit, by electing a Brexit PM!  
When a caller asked @Nigel_Farage to put a number on how much Brexit is worth to the UK, his booming response: "What is freedom worth? I can't monetise democracy."  
It’s time to #endthechaos! With new #brexit facts and information coming to light every day, it is morally and democratically right for MPs to let the people decide their future.

MOST WATCHED on @TheRebelTV: What happens when you ask anti-Brexit campaigners @peoplesvote_hq a simple question 
There are many consequences of a 'no-deal' Brexit. Here's another:- UK driving licences no longer valid in EUWith this comes more bureaucracy, paperwork/permits, uncertainty around insurance and rental costs, driving licences for multiple countries 
Do you want a #FinalSay on Brexit? Join @Independent and @peoplesvote_uk to march for a fresh referendum  
What’s now clear is that the referendum was won on points by a crooked fighter with the help of a hapless umpire. This is the stuff of tin pot potentates. Our democracy will be an international laughing stock if we continue to pretend there is a proper mandate to leave the EU. /5 
Two faced traitor Gina Miller on #SkyNews #AllOutPolitics on her trying to stop #Brexit, in the background a hypocritical image of "Stop the chaos".... that's be the chaos the remainers like Mark Carnage Carney are LYING about in effort to stop Brexit.  
800,000 people are demanding the #FinalSay on Brexit - add your name to our petition now  
Third, the shady ‘Constitutional Research Council’ – which donated to DUP – is likely also to have broken the law. This excellent BBC investigation  suggests the CRC controlled the DUP’s spending. If so, it will have huge and unlawful referendum spending /3 
First, the Electoral Commission unlawfully gave permission to Vote Leave to spend more than Parliament had allowed. It gave that permission to VL but there is no suggestion it gave it to Stronger In. The body in charge of ensuring the Referendum was fair ensured it was unfair. /1 
Brexit breaks the generational promise. It means that for the first time, children will be worse off than their parents were. Fewer opportunities and bleaker job prospects. This video explains why it's vital that young people get the final say on the government's Brexit deal.  
A conference debate on Brexit  can’t be ducked again this year.  
Brexiteers who say, no deal is fine because the point of Brexit is so we can do trade deals with the whole world: you do know Europe’s quite a big part of the world? 
And instead of that we have Jeremy Corbyn, who spent the summer before Brexit arguing for the right to say the creation of Israel was a racist endeavour (in other words it shouldn’t exist) and the right to call Jews Nazis.  
Brexit is a monumental act of self harm that will take generations to heal. It is based on xenophobia and a pathetic little Englander mentality that believed the propaganda and deceit messaging from political chancers who are hedging their own personal investments against Brexit.

Have you noticed how Project Fear is being ramped up by the day?They are all at it. Politicians,The Lords, civil servants, the BoE, Remainers, Hungarian billionaires, The EU and their useful idiots of course - the BBC & mainstream media.The people of Britain will have Brexit.  
I've heard the Army being mentioned in different contexts to help dealing with the consequences of a No Deal Brexit. It brings icy chill to my heart. Once the military is on the streets you can only hope it will be used for good. Not expect it. 
So what's happening in UK trade policy, beyond Brexit? A thread round-up. Starting with what DIT has as their main focus, the consultations on trade agreements with US, Australia, NZ, and joining CPTPP. 1/

A 'no-deal' Brexit...- means house prices fall by 35% in 3 yrs- could lead to an economic crash on scale of 2008 financial crisis- means massive trade disruption - brings higher unemployment- means rising inflation- comes with rising interest rates 
Was listening to Handel’s Dixit Dominus on the wireless but kept hearing the repeated Dixit! as Brexit! 
MPs voted to hold a referendum and to implement the result, they voted to leave the EU and held an election where 86% of the electorate voted for parties committed to leaving the EU, SM & CU.  What are they planning to deliver?  BRINO.  Contemptible.. pic.twitter.com/tjIJR7jF1l

Changed the habit of a lifetime this morning and listened to @BBCRadio3 over breakfast instead of @BBCRadio4 . Chopin piano concerto instead of no deal Brexit. Bliss. 
You're not kidding. Today's Mail Online front page Brexit stories:  
Macron’s Europe minister suggests that PM’s latest plan to deceive the public with Blindfold Brexit may be hard to realise.  
New Brexit dividend announced: a 35% fall in house prices. Brexiters saying this is normal or even a good thing. I suppose they own their houses so would be unaffected by negative equity & increased interest rates to deal with inflation caused by £ crash. 
“The architects of Brexit want to destroy the protections and rights of millions of workers”  
Arlene Foster doesn't just face career defining pressure of RHI Inquiry, she will also be defined by her alienation of nationalists & support for Brexit. Leading unionism & wider community out of this is the challenge, not micromanaging DUP. Who'd replace her? Donaldson, Wilson? 
@Scientists4EU The EU is cancelling H2020 High Performance Computing calls in favour of a new programme. Guess what? The UK is not in the new programme. So much for no Brexit effects on science funding...  
And this week's #Brexit breakthrough: the UK has handed over data about trade flows between GB and Northern Ireland, as requested by @MichelBarnier a few weeks ago.

Friends! Yeah, but!The Fascist Rees-Mogg LIED on TV yesterday, claiming that "Britain will be able to trade with other countries post-Brexit", even though this has been totally disproved, i.e. Fascist Switzerland which is - literally - a nightmare!Talk about Our Customs Hell!  
I've just had a text from Mark Carney showing #Brexit Britain.  
Heading to @DHSCgovuk with @FionaCLoud to discuss holiday #dialysis especially crucial role of #EHIC & what might happen after #brexit If we lose EHIC then it’s ~£800 or more for 1 weeks EU treatment it’s not covered by #travelinsurance & UK holiday spaces barely exist #trapped 
With Trump tearing up the international order, this is the worst possible time to isolate ourselves through leaving the EU.No-deal would be an economic disaster, but every form of Brexit will leave us poorer, less influential and on track for decline. 
In 2010, my wife and I bought our first family home for £166,000.  Last year it was valued at £205,000, an increase of 23%.Brexit will decimate that within 3 years.  My house, in 3 years time will be worth £143,500 - £22,500 less than i paid for it.But i get a Blue Passport! 
Can you deliver leaflets in your local community as part of the National Action Day on 29th September and help spread the word about a #peoplesvote on the final #Brexit deal?Sign-up here: 
Some of the criticism of Tim Martin is quite snobbish in tone and it's not wholly hypocritical of him to stress that Brexit Britain will need lots of immigration, but I still can't quite believe that any sentient being would take his economic counsel over Mark Carney's. 
I have an article in the Irish Times arguing that the rule of law crisis in Poland and Hungary represents a bigger threat to the EU than Brexit 
EU citizens! Another disaster story from #Brexit Britain. House prices may fall, allowing young people to afford their own home, And since youth unemployment in the UK is much lower than the EU, they have money to buy them. Shocking. 
Bank of England chief: No-deal #Brexit worse than 2008 financial crisis  
Unlike the 2008 crisis, no-deal Brexit would be a deliberate political choice.Do not forget there are two options if the government fails to get a deal. Leave & make everyone poorer, or extend Article 50 and campaign in a #PeoplesVote to stay in the EU. 
If Brexit is going to be so wonderful why are all the rich Brexiters moving their money/business offshore? 
Today's @guardian cartoon...#Brexit #NoDealBrexit 
THE ONLY way to do Brexit fairly, reflecting what was said, how countries voted and the close result:N Ireland stay IN (with Ireland)Scotland stay IN (independence)England & Wales EEA Brexit (Norway option)No? Thought not. In which case Remain as UK then. 
Brexit was decision by committee. The committee was about 35 million, reduced now to 650 MPs plus power brokers, all still bickering over what the sodding decision was. There is no common will, no clear mandate and no plan.Until there is, there should be no Brexit.  
"The 'people’s vote' is nothing more than a Trojan horse to a second EU referendum. That would lead to social unrest. If I went back to my members with a deal they had already rejected, I would get unrest as well." RMT general secretary Mick Cash to TUC Annual Congress this week. 
The youngest in our society will have to deal with the consequences of this botched Brexit for the longest. That's why we're calling for a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal - please RT:  
Never forget: Brexit is COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY “No-deal Brexit could be as bad as 2008 financial crash, Carney says  
So I did a presentation on a no deal Brexit to the heads of the business units in our company. The content was grim.My leave voting boss said it was the clearest presentation on Brexit he had yet heard. Well done he said.Not sure he has his priorities straight 
UK house prices would crash by a third after chaotic no-deal #Brexit, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney says  
House prices rising because available housing stock not increasing with demand.If hundreds of thousands were to lose their jobs post Hard Brexit as companies shift their EU operations back to the EU - no demand =lower prices.Disaster capitalists like Rees Mogg licking their lips. 
This is what Brexit Britain will look like. The chances of a trade deal with the EU, were a million to one, they said.  
I’m sick of hearing the British people voted for Brexit...they didn’t. The English voted for Brexit and the English population in Wales tipped that vote too.  This is an English policy and it is dragging Scotland and NI to destruction. We need Indy to survive.. 
Friday September 14, 2018.The 2 Salisbury Russian assasins have been interviewed by their State Broadcaster more times then I have in the last 115 days.Just sayin.#Brexit#Salisbury#Russia#Indyref2#DarkMoney 
Arlene Foster & DUP are promoting Brexit in defiance of majority unionist & nationalist opinion, to force a new border between Northern Ireland & Ireland. If they succeed, I suspect NI will soon decide, democratically, to join a single Irish state with devolution in north 
EU leaders will not give Michel Barnier new Brexit instructions  Unlike some of the rhetoric in the UK, he is not some kind of rogue agent but the embodiment of the EU27's political interests. 
What Happens Next? Some of the many possible political scenarios, some more likely, some less likely, as the #Brexit drama reaches crunch time:  
Carney, BBC and Sky News. Hired by Brussels to scare the shit out you with endless fear projections over a no deal Brexit. Remember this. Everything they have predicted so far has been wrong. They are paid hacks of the Brussels elite. It's pure and simple propaganda. 
Mark Carney accused of spreading gloom with no-deal Brexit prediction of 35pc house price crash: Brexit News for Friday 14th September 
1. As the governor of the Bank of England warns of what disorderly No Deal Brexit may lead to I decided to share a personal story from similar situation I've had the misfortune of living trough.  
“I don’t care” if there isn’t a majority for Brexit in the House of Commons.  Julia Hartley Brewer totally nails it on #bbcqt. 
Just got myself and the kids an Irish passport. Won't be renewing my British passport. Here's hoping one day I'm getting my Scottish passport after independence #IndyRef2 #Brexit 
A catastrophic "No Deal" #Brexit would not even be a possibility if Theresa May had not imposed an artificial deadline on negotiations ruling out the option of negotiating until we get a deal. Remember this when, inevitably, Tories blame the EU, Hurricane Florence, killer bees...

16 year old audience member says she should not have to deal with the consequences of Brexit for the rest of her life. #BBCQT 
The BoE's Mark Carney suggests house prices could fall 30% on Brexit.He's not been right on a single forecast yet but it gives hope to millions of youngsters wanting to buy their own homes.If it happens it won't be Brexit but an international banking crash. 
It makes you wonder what will happen to the Minimum Wage post-Brexit doesn't it? And how doezs this solve the "Foreigners are under-cutting us" problem? In contrast, the EU has now put laws in place to stop those practices. 
British planes and Eurostar trains will be STOPPED in a no deal BrexitThat will happen to EU planes, Boats coming to UK then?800,000 German Cars pa will be stopped at the Ports! I don’t think EU could be so stupid! Holiday in Italy, Greece, avoid France   
FEAR: Bank of England's Carney warns of No Deal Brexit 'crash'. @nigelmp: “Guy who irritated us all with Projeft Fear last time and got it comprehensively wrong is at it again - and we have to put up with his drivel for another 2 years.....Why?” 
It’s Friday.Could somebody please prod May firmly and remind her that #Brexit is not some noble mission to boldly go where others fear to tread. It is demonstrably harmful.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote 
I doubt any house in this country will sell now until after the Brexit fallout has settled. How many buyers will be now asking the seller for a discount. What a fucking mess. 
I wonder if people will still be shouting "project fear" when their homes are in negative equity. #Brexit 
David Davis was an utterly shit Brexit secretary, wasn't he? 
Of course this is an area , presently devolved, in which the Tories are  insisting there has to be a UK framework, limiting the powers of @ScotParl post #Brexit....#powergrab 
I hadn't even considered horse trading or horse racing being impacted by Brexit.... 
Is NATO ready for a no deal Brexit? If UK exits EU without a Withdrawal Agreement, political relationships between European NATO allies will be extremely strained:Would NATO remain “Brexit-proof”? Would UK public support for defending EU allies fall? What should NATO do? 
Apparently, Bank of England Governor, Mark Carney told a cabinet meeting on Brexit preparations, that leaving on bad terms could mean dire consequences for the UK, and leaving the EU without a deal could be as big a disaster as the 2008 financial crash.Who do you trust? Pls RT. 
Why on earth is someone as thick, misleading and ill-informed as Tim Martin allowed to go unchallenged as an 'expert' on international trade. It's like interviewing an out of date bag of mince with a mullet. The fact that he's the face of Brexit tells you a lot. 
A lovely Italian vet bandaged my paw.  What will happen after #brexit will there be enough vets and pet medicines? Cats support the #Wooferendum we want a #peoplesvote #CatsOfTwitter #eucats 
Bank of England governor in "Houses could become quite a lot more affordable due to No-deal Brexit" shocker.  
Eurostar will not run if there is a no-deal Brexit, French Europe minister warns  See the bulling undemocratic EU in full flow, this is the very best reason to Brexit. 
What planet is Carney on? Following the #ProjectFear farce during the Referendum, the public knows not to trust politically motivated forecasts. He's running our currency and our financial sector, and he's just had his contract extended. Madness! 
Brexit, the will of the people...it most certainly is not. After one crude, corrupt and illegitimate advisory referendum, Brexit is now the will of the politicians...and they haven’t the faintest clue what they are doing. 
.@ChrisLeslieMP is  correct. So so many leave voters did not vote for the #Brexit that is on offer and as a result they have changed their minds. They are #remainernow Democracy demands that they have a chance to reconsider now they see reality.#PeoplesVote #FinalSay 
Fantasy politics from @GeorgeFreemanMP on #r4today. The idea that a new Tory leader will be enough to make younger generations support Brexit is laughable. If you want to properly represent young people, give them a say on the final deal and support a #PeoplesVote 
So disgusted by this Govt. The Tories were the ONLY governing conservative party in western Europe to support the Hungarian far-right in EU vote. Theresa May's MEPs isolated amongst conservatives amid claims of trading favours for support on Brexit.  
George Freeman utterly irresponsible on @BBCr4today. Mrs May should ‘get Brexit over line’ in March & then a new generation can decide our ‘long-term future.’Brexit - or stopping Brexit - is the foundation for ANY long term future for this country. @GeorgeFreemanMP

I don’t know about you, but I’m beginning to get the impression that this Brexit thing isn’t quite going to plan, and that it might not be as good as an idea as first proposed. Anyone else thinking this or is it just me?

A new centre right pro-EU unionist party plans to contests a forthcoming North Antrim by-election. Both Unions Party, which registered with the Electoral Commission this week, believes Brexit poses an existential threat to the UK and advocates a second EU referendum @irish_news 
Moody's ratings agency has warned that UK would face falling into a devastating recession, the £pound will plunge & prices will soar in the event of a no deal Brexit. They say that the chance of crashing out with out an agreement had “risen materially” in recent months. #r4today 
Michael Gove's reforms could see horsemeat reappear in the British food chain after Brexit farmers warn  
When the realities of Brexit loom ever larger, with the potential to damage lives, living standards and public services why is there even a question about it being debated at @UKLabour conference? 
Mark Carney, “No-deal Brexit could be as bad as the 2008 financial crash.”Jacob Rees-Mogg, “No-deal Brexit will make Britain £1 trillion better off.” Who do you believe? The Governor of the Bank of England or an eccentric Tory MP for the 18th century? 
Workers are still unfairly paying the price of the 2008 crash.Now they’re told a no deal #Brexit could be just as bad.No one voted for this.So if May can’t deliver a deal that protects jobs, rights and peace in Ireland, we’ll demand a popular vote. 
The fact its so narrow is why we should not have a 2nd ref. The threshold should have been set at over 60% last time. Narrow victories just keep the wound festering, it doesn't heal them. A narrow remain win WILL boost the far right. We need a GE, not a divisive 2nd referendum!  
Why do I blame politicians for Brexit and not voters?Our MPs and MEPs are our legal representatives. We entrust them with the power to make our laws.So if our legal representatives lie to us about our legal position, that's on them. 
Probably the best point made on #BBCQT last night. While the Tories are knee-deep in a Brexit shambles of their own making, it’s your schools, your hospitals and your vital services going down the pan.  
Brexit update:Government publish technical advice, remainers quote technical advice, government accuses remainers of scaremongering.Got it!#PeoplesVote 
Maybe @BBCr4today will ask George Freeman about this at 7.30. His latest diversionary tactic - Tories needs new leadership ‘after Brexit’- misses the elephant in the room: WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP TO STOP BREXIT  
The grim reaper is at it again, thankfully, the only things that tend to crash are his predictions...@bankofengland #MarkCarney No deal Brexit may be as bad as 2008 financial crash, BoE boss warns  
This government brought with it a new level of arrogance and disdain for the country which shows itself once again as one of their number dismisses John Lewis. John Lewis have been around for a lot longer than this idiot. If they say it's brexit related, it's brexit related.  
UK will be kicked out of programme keeping us safe from space debris after no-deal Brexit  
The Government has said free movement will end after Brexit. #RussellGroup is calling for a #EuropeanSkillsPermit to attract European talent and help rebuild confidence in the immigration system 
CBI director-general tells @BBCr4today ‘we should be getting behind Chequers.’ No, we should be getting behind a people’s vote to stop Brexit. ‘We have the beginnings a framework for a plan,’ says Carolyn Fairbairn. WTF! No wonder CBI irrelevant to the Brexit debate 
#brexit  Bored out of my head everyday Brexit bashing & Donald Trump bashing. Morning noon & night in  give it a rest FFS. Same bloody bores out everywhere on TV & Radio. 17 million voted to leave EU. Donald Trump doing brilliant job in . Brexit & Donald Trump.   
It seems as if the Gov't is manipulating us: if we freak out at the thought of crashing out with No Deal, we will be grateful when we Leave with some deal. It doesn't work for me. The only sane option is No Brexit. Any Brexit is bad for Britain.  
The Guy who irritated us all with project fear last time and got it comprehensively wrong is at it again- and we have to put up with his drivel for another 2 years.....why?  BBC News - Brexit: Carney warns no-deal could see house prices plunge  
I think Carney has more experience and qualifications than any MPs to talk realistically about the impacts of a no deal brexit on house prices and other matters   
Looking forward to welcoming an Tanaiste @simoncoveney to Kinsale this morning where he will address a full to capacity audience on a Brexit Briefing Breakfast @rte @irishexaminer @SouthernStarIRL @Carrigdhounnews @voteTimLombard 
No-deal Brexit could be as bad as 2008 financial crash, Carney says  
Bow to Trump and Brexit no more: Australia is now a world-leading political shitshow of ego, malice and stupidity led by a hollow man bereft of policy or authority  
I’m not surprised anymore at just how seriously bad things are predicted to be for NI post Brexit. I read this and although it angers me, I hardly flinched. We need to say to ourselves ‘what if this was known before the referendum as it should’ve been?’  
Pat Condell Returns: "Brexit Morons""Nobody’s feelings were consulted during the making of this video. Anyone who has a problem with that can drop dead."Mark my words they will redo #Brexit and it will not be pretty. The elite always win it seems  
It's unfair for the DWP and Jobcentres to bully sick and disabled benefit claimants to find employment when many British businesses are already planning hiring freezes, redundancies, investment  cuts, & company relocations as a result of the Brexit vote and no-deal Brexit fears. 
Is this an ironic post? None of us know anything about what post Brexit will look like. The UK Government still doesn't bloody know!  
Given that Lib Dems entered government without securing a referendum on a proper PR system, I'm surprised that Vince Cable thinks he has something to contribute on how #IndyRef2 should be conducted. 
Nice reply Alice - Its a paid Brexit Troll so its opinion counts for nothing at all - hired to boost Brexit because its falling apart at the seems. Tories can forget ever being in Gov again if Brexit happens  
You lying sack, where's the EU money that was meant for Scottish farmers? What have you done to keep the Scottish brand? What will happen to farmers after Brexit? That brexit you are pushing against the Scottish electorate? You piece of ....

#Brexit was a vote to leave the #EU, it was not a vote to stay half in half out, it was not a vote to leave part of the EU, it was not a vote to negotiate a deal to water down our vote & it was not a vote for a transition period to keep us in the EU to 2021. We need a clean break

No deal Brexit is going to be a right laugh 
Mark Carney, Bank of England governor, just delivered a "chilling" warning. He thinks a no-deal Brexit could lead to economic chaos, including a property crash that could see house prices fall by a third.   
It’s amazing what Brexit can do, affordable housing after all that artificial QE that just inflated assets beyond their real value . Fuck Carney & Osborne , but not necessarily in that order.  
All of Carney’s predictions about the Brexit economy have so far been wrong. He is playing politics & is being paid by the remainers to support their position. The @bankofengland is no longer independent, it is a political pawn & it is undermining UK economic stability. 
#brexitAbsolutely first class from Julia Hartley-Brewer.  Somebody needed to spell it out and she's done exactly that.  90 seconds of pure gold.  Watch.  
So why didn't you advocate a house price downward correction of 35% in the brexit campaign? 
And there’s more Brexit reality news Eurostar will not run if there is a no-deal Brexit, French Europe minister warns#Unityref 
So, this Brexit scaremongering. Your drivers license may be invalid if you're British but if you're American or Canadian it will be perfectly fine.Jesus fucking Christ when will you ppl waken up and realise how controlling and manipulative the EU and their propaganda machine is? 
The sect steering Brexit is turning into a cargo cult of ancestor worship. The difficulty of Brexit is part of the appeal: only a great tribe can renew itself through sacrifice, threatened by non-believers — They can ruin things by angering the ancestors  
Brexit: Carney warns a chaotic Brexit could see house prices plunge  
Feeling quite encouraged by tonight’s @bbcquestiontime. The Brexit debate clearly exposed:- the mess we’re in- the lying politicians who haven’t / can’t deliver what they promised- growing demand for a #PeoplesVote, especially for the young. #bbcqt

16 year old says that she wasn't allowed to vote but will have to deal with the repercussions of #Brexit the next 50 years of her life.Older #Brexiteer shouts her down rather than listen to her concerns. Classic #Brexit. #bbcqt 
Yet when the independence referendum happened in Scotland, it included those under 18.Regardless of what the voting age is, Alice is quite correct in saying that Brexit is a mess, and her generation should not have to pick up the pieces created by the current 'government'. 
It’s the same problem as happened before the referendum. Most of the economic community produced sensible analysis warning of risks around Brexit. But (& @George_Osborne deserves some of the blame for this) in the end all everyone remembers was that scary HMT recession warning 8/ 
Love seeing old Tom Nook working into the early hours on how to fully exploit the effects of Brexit.  
''The Chequers deal is credible for Europe, it's not credible for the people of Great Britain''This audience member says that Michel Barnier has 'changed his tune' over Brexit following the Chequers deal #bbcqt

It's interesting that Julie Hartley-Brewer complains about Leave voters being regarded as ignorant, especially considering that as recently as last night she once again refused to engage with an actual trade expert who's been trying to call into her show to discuss Brexit #bbcqt 
People’s vote is the most striking form of cognitive dissonance I have seen in a long while. The mind games remainers play on themselves to reject Brexit. Accept reality please #bbcqt 
If we have a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal & the people still want to leave the EU, that will be the result.There will only be a different result from the 2016 referendum if the electorate has changed its mind.Common sense!And entirely democratic.#bbcqt 
#BBCQT None of the panellists  articulating clearly the point that the emerging #brexit bears no resemblance to what was promised, so people should have the chance to vote on it 
And I don’t want 50 years of my life still sorting out the brexit shit show when the NHS, education and other public services are going to suffer which and this is going to negatively impact my generations life. We should’ve known the brexit proposal before the referendum #bbcqt 
The only thing the Prime Minister and the #Tories have created Rory Stewart is chaos, uncertainty and suffering. It will be ordinary people who face the consequences of her appalling leadership. It’s time for a #GeneralElection Theresa May.  #BBCQT #GTTO #Brexit #BrexitShambles 
MUST WATCH | Fantastic defence of Brexit from @JuliaHB1 on #BBCQT: "There isn't a majority in the House of Commons - I don't care! They asked us the question, we gave the answer and we want the Brexit that we were promised. If Theresa May can't deliver it, she should go!"

(I’m the 16 yr old) I’m not having a moan bc I didn’t get to vote and saying poor me I just want to get across that what happens with brexit my generation is going to have to live with this. Surely that gives us a right to have an opinion with what brexit looks like #bbcqt 
Excellent points made by @JuliaHB1 on #BBCQT on #Brexit.The rebels in the Party are actually those rebelling against the Conservative manifesto. The decision on Brexit has already been made   
"The most generous explanation for the Chequers agreement I can think of is that Theresa May was taken hostage" @JuliaHB1 says the Prime Minister is leading a 'mutiny' against her own manifesto over Brexit #bbcqt 
All-round idiot Digby Jones hopes there'll be a Brexit benefit in "100 years time" #BBCQT

Special relationship!? EU will stop warning UK about SPACE JUNK if there’s no Brexit deal. Which patriot in his or her right mind can tolerate these constant threats from the EU. We need them like a hole in the head. We should leave, do well and crap on them from a great height. 
#BBCQT Interesting that @JuliaHB1 Hartley-Brewer says the #brexit decision is not a matter for Parliament but for the people. So, presume she supports #PeoplesVote on the deal... 
Chris Leslie wants a #PeoplesVote instead of a #GeneralElection He wants to stop #Brexit yet keep the Tories in power.He should cross the floor as soon as possible. #BBCQT 
The cost of an elite Brexit for hedge funders will be born by the poorest. We all need a #PeoplesVote to take back control of our future. 
I miss EU. I am being dragged away against my will for no good reason, only to make Britain poorer, derisory, irrelevant. @guyverhofstadt wants a Mueller-type inquiry for the EU. Would the UK gov't tolerate an inquiry? Doubt it. We might discover that Brexit is the will of Putin.  
"Brexit is a decision for the British people"Julia Hartley-Brewer here, inadvertently making an argument for a People's Vote. I guess that's what happens when your ideology is riddled with inherent contradictions.#bbcqt 
Steve Richards nailed the #Brexit scaremongering on #SkyPapers.It is ALL coming from UK Gov.Because they are weak, they're trying to scare us into accepting whatever crappy deal they can come up with, simply because they are incapable (& unwilling) to deliver #Brexit.  
All the talk is of civil disturbances if there is a peoples vote that overturns the first vote. But as we learn more about no deal Brexit, what of the monumental protests against the mad Tory right and May government that landed us in this mess - and veto’d a #peoplesvote ? 
Yes Julia Hartley-brewer you gilt edged moron, Russia IS a hostile power.....and they interfered in our referendum. YOU are on the SAME side as Russia

Friday's Times: "House prices 'to crash by a third' if no-deal #Brexit" (via @AllieHBNews) #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday 
Brexit inducing a house price crash? As my colleague @LaraPrendergast wrote two years ago, quite a lot of young people would welcome that 
Lots of excitement over Carney’s cabinet briefing on no-deal Brexit. But he said this publicly last month:  “House prices going down by more than a third ... unemployment going to nine per cent, and the economy going into a four per cent recession.” 
While we're all banging on about no-deal Brexit, let's not let Chequers sneak by and drag us out... It's the least popular option for everyone, but ironically the most likely Brexit path. Kill it with fire. 
In the event of a no deal Brexit, the EU is going to make it so difficult for British tourists to holiday in EU countries that they'll find other places to spend their money. #Genius 
I have said many times there are no upsides to Brexit and yet now I’ve seen Mick Hucknall giving Dan Hannan a proper smackdown.  
Brexiteer argues that Brexit will be no worse for house prices than the financial crisis of 2008. Which is comforting.  
Getting the feeling that there's too much #brexit #backstop bravado and too little sense? Howsabout a 4 slide summary from @DPhinnemore & me setting out what we can be pretty sure of and what the UK/EU (dis)agree on - as viewed from Northern Ireland.1/5 
Tonight, German car manufacturers are absolutely shittimg themselves, that their exports, amounting to 20% of total production, won't meet UK standards after Brexit.   
The Bank of England has warned the impact of a no-deal Brexit could be as catastrophic as the financial crisis that crippled the UK economy in 2008. A bleak economic picture has emerged that should serve as warning that we need to avoid Brexit to save the UK! #PeoplesVote #bbcqt 
Mark Carney gave May’s cabinet a presentation today where he warned of a 35% house price crash in the event of no deal Brexit: The property crash would be driven by rising unemployment, depressed economic growth, higher inflation and higher interest rates, Mr Carney warned.  
You're invited! Please join us for a Town Hall Meeting to learn more about the education referendum on the Nov. 6th ballot. Supt. @Jeff_Eakins will answer your questions & talk about the positive impact the 1/2-penny sales tax would have on our students, schools and community. 
So a No Deal Brexit means house prices will crash, we won't be able to fly or drive abroad, our car industry will cease to exist, we'll run out of sandwiches, we won't have passports, we'll suffer bubonic plague etc., etc. . . . but nobody believes a word of it. #StandUp4Brexit 
“Nothing to worry about with Brexit, it’ll be just like **checks notes** having a massive recession”

Exclusive story by @openDemocracy tonight, which could turn very interesting The UK Parliament watchdog is now probing Jacob Rees Mogg’s hard Brexit lobby group (the ERG) over its "other sources of funding" 
Brexit papers: What no deal could mean  
At #JMC today serious politicians - from 3 governments - discussed  how difficulties in Agriculture Bill might be resolved.  Douglas Ross just wants to deflect blame from  Tory disaster that is #Brexit and try to save  his seat, under threat as voters discover what he really is  
Carney: House prices may fall by a third in 'no-deal' Brexit. The stark warning came during a briefing to the prime minister and her cabinet  
When you’re actually quite happy the headlines are about your Brexit catastrofuck because at least people aren’t talking about all those dying due to your policies.  
Latest @openDemocracy scoop: UK parliament watchdog is investigating Jacob Rees-Mogg's secretive hard-Brexit ERG lobby group - over a 'second bank account' and 'other sources of funding'.  
Presumably this will be covered in the next batch of Brexit no deal ‘technical notices’?

The Lib Dem’s position on a 2nd Indy ref is that they are against one but for a 2nd EU ref, but if we do get a 2nd Indy referendum we would then need a 2nd referendum on independence......  And they wonder why no one takes them seriously. 
Liberal Democrats now doing everything possible to try and ensure that the SNP and independence supporters don’t back their calls for a ‘second’ EU referendum.   
Where do you stand nowadays on #Brexit Given the choice againPlease vote and retweet 
PLEASE POST YOUR FAVOURITE PROJECT FEAR STORY ON THIS THREAD! IT WOULD BE GREAT IF WE COULD GET A DOZEN OF THE FUNNIEST!!Here's mine, unsurprisingly from BBC News - the "Brexit threat to sandwiches"   
Aftermath of World War I and the Rise of Nazism, 1918–1933 "Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party offered simple solutions to Germany’s problems, exploiting people’s fears, frustrations, and hopes to win broad support." Remind you of someone?

Things the Tories leavers think you should uncomplainingly give up to make Brexit work:1. EU Citizenship;2. FoM;3. Your job;4. Etc.Things they shouldn’t have to give up:1. Ceaseless infighting;2. Personal ambition;3. Tax cuts;4. Hedge fund gains.

Fishers in #Cornwall & elsewhere were promised that #Brexit would transform their lives for the better.Those promises are now ringing hollow - and their problems were largely the result of UK government decisions, as @MollyMEP points out.#PeoplesVote 
TWEET OF THE DAYLizard lips Kay Burley scaremongers over end to free roaming in EU post #Brexit.She just got owned by Three  
Dominic Raab’s Czech father came to the UK as a six year old. His family was fleeing the Nazis. Britain welcomed them.Raab is now Brexit secretary.His party is now supporting the far right in Hungary.I wonder how Raab manages to look himself in the mirror each day. 
The BBC now seems to be avoiding the terms “crashing out” and “cliff edge” in their Brexit coverage, and saying “no deal Brexit” instead. That’s progress.  Now we need to get them to switch to “WTO Brexit”. 
Democracy Demands Brexit - but the VIP class are losing it over our vote to leave the EU. Who has gone the furthest off the deep end?  #OutNow  #ForTheNation 
Are you bored of the constant negativity surrounding Brexit? It is no surprise when the people in charge don’t believe in it. #FarageOnLBC 
Brexit: back to the futureDriving via France to Spain after the big day? You need both 1949 & 1968 versions of International Driving PermitTaking a mobile phone? Data could cost you £45 per monthAnd beware having too little or too much passport validity 
1/ So, I have had a look at the new government notice on travel to the EU after no deal Brexit. With great respect, it's shoddy work.

Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab tells ITV News a no-deal Brexit will lead to ‘significant risks and short-term disruption’ for the UK Watch more of @Peston's interview:  
Despite Vodaphone and "Three" guaranteeing Free Roaming post Brexit the BBC continues to peddle the fear that it will not be. How far has the BBC sunk in the name of Project Fear?  
well obviously. but is this going to change anyone's mind? surely we've heard enough terrible consequences of every kind of Brexit now to know what we're getting ourselves into, and yet millions of people still support it! how do we get through to people?? 
Raab: "I think there will be some temptation from businesses that are not doing so well to blame Brexit."Quite right Dom, some unscrupulous scoundrels will blame anyone but themselves for their own incompetence. 
So why did Labour vote to trigger A50 then? Why are you not opposing Brexit? You think if Brexit does happen we'll all just roll over and vote Labour because you're not the Tories? Dream on.#peoplesvote No Deal Brexit 
Yes! America stands ready to deepen and strengthen our trade ties with a post-#Brexit Britain!  
Driving, flying and mobile roaming these are the things that would be impacted in the event of a no-deal Brexit  
 Increasing fuel costs More expensive holidays Return of data roaming chargesThe latest news from the Tories about the effects of a Tory no deal #Brexit. Read more here.   
After 2008 crash capitalists used control of gov't to recover at the expense of austerity for the masses. Little done to curb capitalists. As another crisis looms, so does mass anger (via Brexit, Trump, Salvini). Capitalism's deepening mess. 
The more we hear about the risks of a No Deal Brexit – delays to lorries at Dover, invalid driving licences and disruption to rail transport and aviation – the more it becomes clear how damaging it would be for the British economy. 1/3 
Oh and btw I voted #Brexit and because of people like @albawhitewolf I have changed my mind to #Remain and want a #peoplesvote Without people like her, I may never have changed my mind. You see I was open to reason. 
We’ll have to resume ‘boat trains’ to Dover Western Docks...  “Eurostar will not run if there is a no-deal Brexit, leading French minister warns”  
We've taken a quick look at the "highlights" from today's no deal Brexit papersIt's becoming clearer and clearer we need a #peoplesvote 
Brexit Secretary Raab picks row with John Lewis in latest attempt to duck responsibility for Government's mess.The Westminster equivalent of "look over there!"  
This screams "we've totally messed this Brexit thing up, let's now bring the devolved parliaments into this so they can get the blame".  
Hungry is saving itself a long negotiation process, an expensive referendum and the tedious debate about exiting the EU that is gonna dominate the news for months and months diverting public attention from the real problems. Easier get kicked out!  #fo2eu 
Just to be clear the "divorce settlement" agreed with the EU refers to costs to which we had signed up pre Referendum.  Why would anyone trust a government who reneged on it? 
Tory source says concerns were raised by MEPs in a meeting before the Orban vote. But whipping went ahead because they need Hungary's support on Brexit and some MEPs privately support Orban...   
BREAKING NEWS: EU is furious at the Brexit Secretary's demands. The UK Government will only agree to paying the Brexit Bill in return for a deal. 
Instead of persuading Angela Merkel to do what UK wants as Leave campaigners promised, German businesses are trying to persuade Theresa May to do what the EU wants.What a con trick Brexit is turning out to be. #PeoplesVote

UK drivers could need permits to drive in Europe under 'no-deal' Brexit scenario  
As the Tories bitterly attack the Church of England (for their basic moral objection to the exploitation of the poor) & the UK business sector (for their worries about the dangerous game of Brexit brinkmanship the Tories are playing) the media paint Labour as deranged extremists!

Corbyn is totally rattled by any criticism of Brexit. He is totally disrespectful to Liz Saville-Roberts, just look at his expression and gestures. He is determined to take us out of the EU whatever the damage, no respect for the people he claims to care passionately about.#FBPE 
Brexit Blue Passports Back Next Year  
In case not seen - here is the @peoplesvote_uk assessment of the latest batch of no deal preparation documents this afternoon   today’s documents demonstrate the grave consequences which Brexit will have for ordinary people across the country. 
Got it , people who don’t like the EU are simpletons. Bad news for you Seb , the nation state is back and Brexit is the first brick in the wall.  
Is that an admission that they were prevented from engaging with devolved administrations on Brexit for the past 2 years? 
Brexit is stupid. It makes no economic sense. It makes no social sense. The list of reasons it is stupid is endless. The big question for Britain is, will sense prevail or will we continue to be lead by a bunch of idiots, towards total collapse. 
Let's stop mincing words. By treating an advisory referendum marred by lies and hate, a gerrymandered electorate and electoral crime as blocking any right to a #PeoplesVote the Brexiters are acting as enemies of democracy. #Brexit #StopBrexit 
The Government must accept the Irish border is no barrier to a proper Brexit, writes former Northern Ireland Secretary @OwenPaterson

  @FedericaMog in Skopje. My message to all the citizens: remember that on 30/9 when you go and vote at the referendum, you hold the keys to the future of your country. It’s in your hands and nobody else can do it for you. and you cannot afford to stay silent @Zoran_Zaev 
I know Brexit is taking up much of our anger and rage these days but I don’t think we should let adults who cut about London on kids scooters off the hook so easily. Just had one tut at me for not getting out his way. I did it on purpose, dickhead. 
If our driving licenses’ wont be valid in EU after Brexit, that surely applies to the NI / rep Ireland border - And vice verse. Or have I missed something? #StopBrexitSaveBritain 
Private Eye now write about me at least once an issue. Like a jilted lover with a column full of weekly attacks on my faith, incorrect facts about my life and attacks on my friends.It's really rather sweet in a way – Brexit has driven many of these people quite mad. 
Owen Paterson - "If you get outside the M25, you hear five words - just get on with it.The public are miles beyond the Government and the establishment on all this. They want us to get on with it." #Brexit

This photo is a great picture of unity. All of the islands of the Torres Strait, marching together with the Uluru Statement. A Statement that calls for the same unity for all First Nations throughout the vast Australian continent. Labor, LNP, put this to referendum. We will win!  
UK media going through today's no-deal Brexit plans, highlighting problems of roaming charges and driving in Croatia etc, but nowhere a mention of more than 1 million GB citizens who overnight could lose residency, healthcare and working rights in countries they live in #skynews

The UK Government Brexit Negotiations 2016-2018.   
I’ve noticed that the most fanatically anti-Russian people out there are self-styled ‘Remainiacs’. They really seemed to have swallowed the line that ‘Russia fixed Brexit’. The British public did that. 
Dear @MichelBarnier,I have now arrived in La Rochelle and await your confirmation of details for our Brexit meeting this weekend. I am unarmed and would request the same courtesy be extended in return. #NaeChibsRegards,@MajorDMalpas 
USA is 28% of Global GDP and a Free Trade Agreement with US will boost UK GDP by 0.2%. BUT By leaving EU on FTA deal or hard Brexit & UK GDP is harmed by 6% or 8% THUS To make up the difference the UK needs an FTA with 8.4times or 11.2times Global GDP!!Spot the problem? 
Why don't businesses come out and say, 'I'm sorry, I run this business. I know more than Dominic Raab about the business I RUN! And I'm telling you, brexit is bad for business!'  
No-deal Brexit could tip UK into recession, warns Moody's  
Ugh, Brexit is sounding like more and more of a bad idea with every headline  
Our main Brexit negotiator, Dominic Raab, is saying the exact same thing as Jacob Rees-Mogg.... Terrifying.Both are blaming the British people for the damage they're inflicting upon them.  
Andrew Crawford, a central character in the RHI Inquiry, is now a DUP strategist on Brexit.  I don’t think I need to say anything else!

*The BBC Have Appointed A New Brexit Correspondent*  
The EU’s decision to censure Viktor Orbán is a step in the right direction to stamp out such islamophobia & anti-semitism.  It's therefore shocking that Tory MEPs voted against this, just for the sake of getting some support in #Brexit negotiations.   
Despite............................................ Oh I give up.  The Doom-mongers will just never accept that #Brexit has brought a breath of optimism to the UK economy.

How would a no-deal Brexit affect you?From flying to driving and buying medication to roaming charges, a no-deal Brexit could have a significant impact on the way we interact with the EU. 
Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini has declared that Italy “stands with” Brexit Britain.May the EU die and rot in hell!           #fo2eu 
It was bad enough 'paying' the DUP to keep a majority, but 'buying' a racist and authoritarian leader like Viktor Orban for future brexit proofing is a step too far, surely? 
11/ further than that - who knows?May will Possibly one day be due a revisionist comeback. Seen as delivering the best of a bad job. A different fate awaits Farage. #Brexit itself will pass into language as a dull, stupid thing of little worth & even less point./ends 
In the UK Brexit debate still a lot of faith put in the argument that free trade agreements = lower consumer prices. Reality is more nuanced. Evidence finds FTAs have little impact on prices, but increase quality. 
Ironic that brexiteers still use the line ‘democratic’ when vote was charged with electoral fraud for the referendum vote.

Great to see French Europe Minister ⁦@NathalieLoiseau⁩ this afternoon. We discussed progress in the Brexit negotiations, and our mutual determination to reach a strong deal for the UK and the EU.  
If UK driving licenses are going to be invalid in the EU after Brexit, then the British government must reciprocate.  
The far-right Three network are offering roaming for free after #Brexit. They clearly did it deliberately to make this hard working reporter look foolish, as though she hadn't done any real research. Shocking. I suspect Three is owned by Putin.  
Here's a turn up. Hardline pro- Brexit CON MPs now being branded as traitors by the Daily Mail which has recently changed editors  
For 45 years they have been banging on about leaving the EU. And here we are, just 6 months away from Brexit, and they still have no plan, no details and just a bunch of lies to misinform people. Influential Brexiters - you are a bunch of self serving chancers. Shame on you. 
UK-made cars could no longer be sold in EU after no-deal Brexit  
Small thread to confidently predict the #Brexit end game. Quite simply there is no other plausible scenario then this..1/  increasingly clear what will happen with #Brexit. The EU will take the #Chequers deal, tweak it, likely beyond recognition, so it fits them. 
Oh no, Sky scare story on post-Brexit roaming charges goes down in flames.  
Gina Miller will be announcing her new national programme of #Brexit-focused action tomorrow morning at Dover Town Hall! If you’d like to attend, then let us know!! Travel is being provided from London.Contact me for further details!  
Agree with @lisanandy ‘Take back control’ caught the mood in towns like Wigan & Doncaster ‘like no other slogan in my lifetime.’ More focus on the challenges Lisa identifies and less on overturning that referendum wouldn’t go amiss.  
Young people and their futures are being ignored by @BorisJohnson and @Theresa_May. Who knows how the Tories' calamitous #Brexit will affect them? We can still turn this around, whilst also including young people in the decision #ExitFromBrexit 
UK driving licence 'may not be valid in EU' after no-deal #Brexit

Driving licences may be invalid in EU if no Brexit deal, UK warns  
UK can't guarantee British citizens won't be hit with painful roaming charges after no-deal Brexit.  True, but given reciprocal arrangements & the popularity of UK as a tourist destination, it won’t happen.  EU turkeys won’t vote for Christmas..  
Brexit is, without a shadow of a doubt, the greatest entirely unnecessary act of self-harm ever carried out. And the greatest tragedy is that those enabling it, especially those pushing for no-deal, won’t be, for the most part, the ones who’ll be paying the price. 4/4 
As the Daily Mail, under new editorship, softens its line on brexit and calls Tory rebels traitors, fears grow for the paper's readers who are believed to be incapable of considering two opposing views in their brains at the same time 
God I wish this woman was negotiating BREXIT!  
Scaremongers over Brexit and mobile phone roaming better think again as most telecom firms have already given assurances roaming will end irrespective of Brexit 
EU tells Britain it won't renegotiate Brexit divorce bill!  The EU can't believe their luck with May in charge & her simply giving into their every demand. Sorry but if no deal is agreed no part of May's agreement applies. We must give the EU nothing..  
Anti-Brexit campaigners voice concerns that British and French Fishermen could come into conflict over scallops, and that’s just for starters.

Today we’ve published the next batch of Technical Notices informing citizens and businesses on how to prepare for the unlikely event of a no deal #Brexit  
Dear @RossThomson_MP, I have just received a leaflet from you. I have two comments; there is no mention of Brexit. Maybe because you are pursuing a hard Brexit that will damage our city. Also what is the source of funding for the leaflet? I hear a lot about #darkmoney 
Brexit is the sovereign choice of a sovereign nation. We respect that. And we regret it as much as we respect it. But it is what the British people have chosen for themselves, not for others.This is why there is no reason for the EU to change its principles. #CHEvents #LoiseauUK 
The Government's Brexit contingency papers say free mobile roaming can no longer be guaranteed in the event of a 'no-deal' Brexit 
.@theresa_may, will you condemn your Tory MEPs for voting to support a far-right antisemitic, Islamophobic regime, which disdains the rule of law?Or have you made a deal with the devil in a vain attempt to find support for your pathetic Brexit deal? 
Tories - actively supporting a far right government to win support for their Brexit. Not content with leaving the EU, this is now trying destabilise it from within.Have they no shame? The Tories have hit a new low. #DangerousTimes 
Contingency plans in the Government's Brexit papers say Irish citizens will continue to have the right to enter and remain in the UK in the event of a 'no-deal' Brexit and there will be no routine immigration controls on journeys between Ireland and the UK 
Now hearing the number of CLP Brexit/second referendum motions squeaked past 100 before the noon deadline. One old party hand tells me they reckon that’s unprecedented - anyone know?

The same bots, the same commercial electioneering companies, the same Russian interference, dark money and cheating were involved in #Brexit. Let's not pretend we weren't gamed too.  
All  brexiters need to do to get brexit is just keep the clock ticking, they don't need to make it happen, they just need to let the date come. If we want to stop brexit we need to actually stop brexit. Time is running out! 
When Sky journalists pump out their anti Brexit propaganda and then along comes Three and basically just shows them up.Well done Three.   
Will Corbyn finally take the opportunity to listen to his voters & back giving the people a deserved #FinalSayOnTheDeal? He keeps side-stepping the question. As @GMB_union have warned that a hard #Brexit would be a disaster & are joining our fight, Labour must now respond. 
A reminder that the primary threat to democracy, liberty and human rights almost always comes from sovereign governments and never from international organisations like the EU. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
Separate Church and State! @solidarityie have submitted amendments to Blasphemy Referendum Bill to remove all religious oaths, preamble & references. Why should we stop at just the blasphemy provision? It'll be in #Dáil next week. Ask your TDs to support. #dubw 
What a massive & inexplicable own-goal. The Conservatives the only party in power in Western Europe to defend Viktor Orban undoubtedly done because we are so desperate & weak thanks to Brexit that we need even the shabbiest of allies.  
Germany RUNNING SCARED over Brexit as banks admit no deal 'WORSE than US trade war'  Good to see a story that a German economist says that a hard Brexit would have a devastating effect on the Germans.Our MSM never puts the other side of the debate. 
When did O'brien become David Frost I missed it?All I see is someone regurgitating 'facts' about Brexit to people who don't understand Brexit and the odd rant about Russia  .Only other thing he does is bash Corbyn and block ppl on twitter. 
We are the only Parliament in the world to have a ‘conference recess’. We will be rising today, as their no deal Brexit looms closer, to accommodate the Liberal Democrats in Brighton. 
Oh. This isn't quite what the red Boris bus promised. Not only is #Brexit going to make people poorer, it may actually kill them. #BrexitReality @NHSvBrexit 
The cost of a hard Brexit on British travellers is becoming abundantly clear. Millions of people are facing higher costs to make calls and texts abroad because of the Prime Minister's botched Brexit plans. 
And let's not forget the time he became a worldwide name with an anti church gospel song during the marriage equality referendum  
A No-Deal Brexit may cause huge unrest, possibly a national emergency.The UK Government in Scotland would then likely assume the role of protecting citizens in Scotland during this state of emergency.There will then be no second referendum, we must vote before we leave the EU 
Great line from @MattChorley on #politicslive about the Brexit Secretary's spat with John Lewis today: "more people in this country love John Lewis than they do Dominic Raab" 
The illegal Brexit vote has murdered democracy, Appoint a Mueller style judicial investigation  into Criminal and treacherous acts concerning  #EU Referendum  as suggested  by .@guyverhofstadt  yesterday. #Article50  must be suspended .@vincecable .@thomasbrake Do Your Job ! 
The Brexit transition period is tantamount to an admission of failure by Brussels, given that Article 50 (Lisbon) states that exiting the EU should be completed within 2 years of invocation and Article 8 (Lisbon) says the EU 'SHALL develop a special relationship' with neighbours! 
Ministers are discussing the frighteningly real prospect of a no-deal #Brexit in Cabinet this morning.Yet no one from @DefraGovUK has met with @wto.DEFRA could soon be responsible for 41% of food imports. Failure to discuss Brexit plans with WTO is grotesquely irresponsible.  
My cartoon Thursday @TheTimes on #MichaelGove's post-Brexit vision for farming. #ReesMogg 
We love our NHS - and that's why we want a People's Vote to ensure we don't fall into a Brexit that irreparably damages it.  
In her Lancaster House speech the Prime Minister stated that the U.K. would seek “a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement”. Given the EU is offering this can we now #ChuckChequers and unite around a free trade #Brexit deal that works for both sides.  
John Lewis at war with minister over Brexit chaos after 99% profits slump - Evening Standard  
While you are on about fair play — the referendum was fraudulent and the constitution hasn’t been followed to get this brexit. The unpleasantness to you family was inexcusable. But we gotta see consistency in those principals.

No-deal Brexit could leave UK unable to kick out 1,000 foreign criminals a year due to being forced out of the European Arrest Warrant.

The EU are terrified of a WTO Brexit and we should take advantage of this. 
Their god Buhari promised to secure the lives of Nigerians but has failed woefully.Instead of them to tell us his achievements, they go about attacking his likely challengers but make no mistake:2019 is a referendum on Buhari’s Four Years of Failure and APC Broken Promises.  
"Someone who leaves the union cannot be in the same privileged position as a member state." says Junker  - This is why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal! 
Eddie you are attacking the most prominent Jewish supporter of Jeremy Corbyn and fabricating things about me. This kind of silliness makes a hard Brexit more likely.Just be honest - you don’t like a left wing Labour Party. That’s okay, it’s a free country.  
Juncker: “Certain tax measures should be decided by QMV”.  Clearly we are getting out just in time.  His words remind us that while Brexit involves uncertainty, staying in the EU also involves uncertainty. The EU is not a Status Quo. It’s a moving target. 
Bernard Jenkin.. like Dominic Raab.. rubbishes  #JohnLewis's claim that #Brexit was partly to blame for their fall in profits. He also says there maybe a little short term disruption if we have a #NoDealBrexit but he doesn't think people will notice #peoplesvote #VictoriaLIVE 
There’s something in the air. The mood in Britain is changing. Here's how to support The New European in the fight against Brexit.  
When a potential no deal Brexit looks very likely, it makes me wonder even more why there aren't more and louder outcries from the British public and business sector? After industry specific no deal checklists I received emails from HMRC (look at wording!!!) and accountant today  
There was no reason to mire the Labour Party in the IHRA controversy this summer, just as we are heading into Brexit. Corbyn sacrificed opposition to a disastrous Brexit & holding the Tories to account just to argue the right to question whether Israel should actually exist. 
A binary choice between a deal no one likes and something even worse. The Brexit diet: Eat your broccoli or I’ll feed you grass.  
If you set down the daydreams and disinformation, the reality is this:By October the government either has to underwrite every issue Brexit will cause, destroying the public purse for generations and affecting quality of life, or the companies leave, services stop, same result. 
The ERG are just picking up where Vote Leave left off, lying to a confused electorate....the evidence is already here for all to see, it's as if people want to actually see the disaster that is Brexit.....  
The Tories are quite happy for you to become a member until they find out you voted for Brexit... Reminder:-Remainer PM-Remainer Chancellor-Remainer Home Secretary -Remainer Foreign Secretary -Remainer Party Chairman -Remainer run CCHQ 
Tired of this stupid Tory play-acting on Brexit. May said UK would ‘honour its commitments’ re divorce bill. Just 2 days ago minister Callanan told Lords ‘of course we will respect our legal obligations’. Now Raab disowns.What a shower; can’t be trusted by Brits or by Brussels 
I don'tIt has 84% of the seats at Westminster and can outvote Scotland on any subjectSee also: Brexit  
"The immediate impact would likely be seen first in a sharp fall in the value of the pound, leading to temporarily higher inflation and a squeeze on real wages over the two or three years following Brexit."  
The parallels between the climate change and No-Deal Brexit consequences debates are getting a bit on the nose.- Increasingly visible warning signs - Overwhelming expert consensus- "Equal time" on news shows for fringe opposition views- Ever shifting opposition goal posts 
There is an underlying issure that is keeping the Tories and Labour together here. this all points to a terrible failing of the FPTP electoral system, which neither wishes to surrender. Brexit is one thing, electoral reform must come next and they'll do their utmost to stop it. 
Former Leader & Deputy Leader of UKIP Thurrock join Conservative Party. “We got into politics to fight for Brexit. Only the Conservatives can deliver.”  
Refusing to pay #Brexit divorce bill is irresponsible and probably illegal. At very least its counter-productive, as Brexiteers seek to head off into the big wide world in search of trading partners. Who do they think will trust them?   
Bernard Jenkin on the consequences of crashing out with no deal: “I don’t think people would notice.” I’m glad we have these words on record. #Brexit @bernardjenkin 
Yesterday Scottish Tories farcically tried to blame @theSNP for #Brexit chaos.   Today UK Tories blaming  business for the problems .   Time  @GovUK blamed  its self for its own utter incompetence & the Tory party for the damage caused by its 40 year long civil war over Europe 
What annoys me most about this is that Raab’s position is itself an unforgivable dereliction of his responsibilities. He has a responsibility to be straight with the electorate about the consequences of  Brexit and he’d sooner scold business instead.  
Tories were only governing conservative party in western Europe to support Hungarian far-right in EU voteMore evidence that #Brexit is a threat to democratic standards and the rule of lawI’m quoted  
We're not stupid enough to vote for Brexit. It won't happen.America isn't stupid enough to vote for Trump. It won't happen.The Government isn't stupid enough to fall out of the EU with no deal. It won't happen. 
I understand that @CCHQPress has confirmed my application to join the Conservative Party has been rejected, despite previous confirmatory email & no communication of this to me.  I am of course disappointed when the Party needs all Brexit supporting conservatives behind them.  
'Only Brexit options are Chequers or no deal' - Dominic RaabSo it’s cake or death.  
Sky News' Brexit scaremongering falls flat for the second time in as many days  
New episode of ⁦@CakeWatchCast⁩ is out now. Me and ⁦@ottocrat⁩ widely mock the ERG, dissect what their apparent downfall as a serious political force may mean for Brexit, and if you listen long enough, you may hear us have a bit of a sing-song.  
Today is local byelection for #Petersfield, Cambridge. We have Sarah Brown,a previous cllr. She’s anti brexit, lives in the area & immensely hard working, AND she’s Trans which means a lot here considering the Labour cllr resigned because trans ppl need to use toilets.Go Sarah!  
I feel like I'm at my wit's end. Again, Brexit is chugging along unimpeded. People's Vote is a lovely idea but we have a parliament that refuses to grant it to us.So tell me, what is going to stop Brexit? 
UK Govt raises stakes on Brexit. Threatens non-payment. Prepares for no-deal Brexit. Reply to @CarolineLucas WrittenParliamentaryQuestion (WPQ 171332) confirms no DEFRA Minister has visited Geneva to meet WTO to discuss joining WTO! Arrogance or incompetence? Still no Food Plan! 
Sky News Brexit Phone Scaremongering Gets Bad Reception  
Woolfe left UKIP in 2016, was aligned to Vote Leave during the EU referendum, and served as a Tory councillor before joining UKIP in 2010.CCHQ still rejected him. 
UK businesses using Brexit as an excuse for poor performance - Raab  
Now Raab says that no-deal Brexit won't bring back data roaming charges.a) he has absolutely no grounds for saying thatb) phone bills will be way down the list of horrorsc) he'd better ensure planes, trains and driving licences work too, or else no-one's going anywhere. 
Are there 22,000 tory voters? What's wrong with those people? Voting to kill fellow citizens through your austerity and DWP, for food banks, for a disastrous Brexit, for trashing the NHS, for discrimination against everyone but the rich? Shocking. 
grim report here that Tory MEPs en masse tried to block a censure motion against Viktor Orban in an attempt to buy Hungarian regime's support on Brexit  via @joncstone 
Hearing so many CLP motions backing a second Brexit referendum have poured in to Labour HQ in past few days they've had to allocate two staff this morning just to sort through and analyse them. 
'No-deal' Brexit? UK sets out the damage for consumers and business  
John Lewis say Brexit is part of the reason for slumping profits. When it's damaging a great British business, we can definitely say that Brexit was knowingly oversold. 
Govt comments this morning, as long predicted, will not offer a remain option. So yes, no confidence is the only outcome beyond two crap choices. Then what? GE? Corbyn? BoJo? Neither path solves the Brexit issues. 
*Brexit Fans*  ....You can't fix stupid!  
Brexit can’t be ‘detoxed’ by definition - because it is poisonous and turning the whole country sick. Only way to detox Brexit is to abandon it - as you & @TomTugendhat know but don’t want to admit out of political ambition, which is why you are engaged this silly avoiding action 
Britain will REFUSE to pay the #EU's £39billion #Brexit divorce bill unless a deal is done, Dominic Raab warns as he puts pressure on European leaders  
Bored with Brexit?Then demand a #PeoplesVote!If Brexit gets cancelled, the UK can get back to concentrating on the issues that really matter. But if it goes ahead, Brexit will continue to dominate every area of politics for the next 10-20 years until we apply to rejoin. 
I'm sending you 2 invitations to my Twitter Brexit Party on 29th March - bring Lord Adonis as your plus one.  
Increasingly obvious that that Tory parliamentary strategy on Brexit is to leave it right down to the wire and effectively hold a gun to MPs' heads. For all the yammer about parliamentary sovereignty, this is a profoundly anti-democratic move:  
Breathtaking hypocrisy & the brassiest of brass necks.  The Tories landed us in this mess, are doing their very best to make it 100 times worse & look set to deliver a chaotic, cliff edge blind Brexit that will be a disaster for everyone #Brexit #BlindBrexit 
Brexit. Making sure we have no choice but to hold hands with racists, prop up fascists, and dance for trade deals.  
The full text of @Econs4FreeTrade's report on Brexit on WTO terms is available here  
The House of Commons still has the capacity to override the Government. They do not have to agree to a Kamikaze #BrexitWhat @DominicRaab is trying to impose is quite obviously Parliamentary blackmail by Government. There *can* be a vote of no confidence. #Brexit #FinalSay 
Rabid Brexiter Dominic Raab’s positioning as “pragmatic”, “collaborative “ and “flexible” against an EU that is not all those things sticks in the craw. He lives in a parallel universe. What is collaborative about any element of Brexit? Flexibility? He is an unself-knowing fool 
Observing Brexit is like watching the dying seconds of a round of Countdown; where the only word anyone can make is, “clusterfuck”.Du   du      du   du   du du du duuuuh 
BBC News - No deal Brexit won't bring back mobile roaming charges - minister I TAKE MOST OF WHAT RAAB SAYS - WITH A HUGE BARREL OF SALT ! 
17:13: ‘EU roaming charges will return in event of No Deal Brexit.’22:02: ‘Free mobile roaming to continue across EU even under No Deal.’Project Fear getting smashed to pieces by reality on a daily basis.  
Yeah, if you think about it, Brexit is all the SNP's fault.  
The partnership, which also owns Waitrose, said it was struggling with uncertainty over the economy and Brexit  
BBC invite Dominic Raab in to rubbish the comments made by Charlie Mayfield after profits at Waitrose and John Lewis fall 99%. No one can criticise Brexit without the BBC arranging for them to be attacked, without the right to reply. Disgusting BBC right wing agenda.#FBPE 
Brexit would be "the greatest act of self-harm by any country in post-war history". My interview with Ian Kershaw, the world's pre-eminent historian of Nazi Germany.  
Shame a good speech is wasted. Both main parties refuse to recognise that the referendum result was delivered through proven subterfuge and criminal enterprise. May, due to being held hostage by the far-right and Corbyn due to the delusion he'll be elected premier.  
So Tory policy on Brexit is expected to lead to 25% bankruptcy to farms in England, near 40% in ScotlandTories also decided not to give Scottish farms their EU payments, instead WM keptAnd now Scottish Tories have the cheek to moan about farming policy in ScotlandJog on! 
Ah, really, Brexit not to blame, folks.  
Let’s listen to our members and put the Brexit Deal to @peoplesvote_uk 
“May promised a clean Brexit, but now offers continued fealty to EU rules, while insisting that ‘nothing has changed’ & that she hasn’t crossed her own red linesIf Tories could unite around Canada+ this issue could be neatly resolved”#StandUp4Brexit 
Sky’s anti-Brexit Faisal Islam caught out propagating scare stories about Brexit. How can people trust MSM when senior journalists routinely allow their own bias to infect stories?  
As the ERG seem not to have seen this, perhaps someone could direct them to it.... #Brexit... cc @BorderIrish 
I've really had enough of this Brexit nonsense now. It has to stop!I've got an overgrown garden, a dwindling bank balance, a neglected husband, family & friends & 2 years worth of sleep that needs catching up on.Please donate & share! Thanks! 
And again... this would screw UK science, wiping our access to 45% of the Horizon 2020 funding lines - including the world-famous ERC grants.Wth Brexit date due in March & new grants taking 6-8 months to approve, this discourages applications right now. 
This directive is overwhelmingly supported by the UK's world-class music industry and by the professional bodies representing composers, who seek this greater degree of protection. What your ignorant tweet reveals is that we will have even less under your Brexit junta.  
There’s going to be an action day in Preston on the 29th September too so it will be good to listen to what the good people of Preston think of brexit so far   
It's apparently easy for a politician to blame businesses than take responsibility for Brexit.  
‘In the beginning was a figure - £350m. But the figure was a lie. All things in Brexit were made by this and other lies, and without them was nothing made. The darkness shined in the light and the light comprehended it not ....’. Gospel according to Jacob, Ch 1, verse 350  
There is an 8th option.Govt chooses to rescind Art 50 and UK remains an EU member.After all the 2016 referendum was advisory and there is no law that says we HAVE to leave or that requires another vote for us to remain. 
Another day of #BrexitShambles & both Govt & Opposition continue to ignore the bleeding obvious.#Brexit is harming & will continue to harm the UK & its cits irreparably.It undermines JobsIt steals Rights.It leaves us PoorerIt diminishes our InfluenceJust STOP IT#FinalSay 
It's quite surprising that Dominic Raab feels in any way qualified to make such a statement, especially given that he recently admitted to not even bothering to look into his own government's Brexit impact reports.I'm sure it's not important. He's only the Brexit Secretary.  
This is what we want to be, not miserable Little England #Brexit fanatics.  
This is a good performance from Corbyn. If he would only fight Brexit and Putin with the same fervour we’d have something to vote for.  
RAAB: No Deal means no £40 billion Brexit bill. “We could negotiate and bring into force new free-trade deals straight away.“We would see the immediate return of full legislative and regulatory control – including over immigration.” 
Twa years on fae the Brexit vote, and we are still squabbling over this?Never trust a man who tries to wriggle oot of paying the bill. 
We don’t have a hero to rescue us. Scotland doesn’t need one... We have hundreds of thousands of them in the shape of the grassroots independence movement. That’s how we’ll save Scotland from Brexit. We’ll dae it oursels.'@weegingerdug, via @ScotNational 
Absolutely Disgusting the barage of abuse JRM took outside his Westminster home whilst being with his children. Shouting to him "your daddy is a horrible person" how far will the Remoaner Left degrade themselves in the so called shame of their plight for a second referendum Scum. 
Experiment: Remain types only, please.One thing you would welcome, that Britain can not do while in the EU. (Dull snark about blue passports will be ignored, as will people who obviously want Brexit anyway). 
Brexit is not the will of the people. Britain does not want Brexit. It is being manipulated through the system - a #PeoplesVote is essential. What are we prepared to do if this democratic right to a final say is denied? 
Have you ever heard anything so disrespectful?The very idea that business owners who have been asking the UK government for clarity for 2 YEARS are somehow to blame for difficulties caused by Brexit.This is getting to be a dangerous habit for the Tories:”It wisnae me!” Shocking.  
A no-deal Brexit will not only kneecap the British economy, disproportionately hurting the poorest. It will also create mountains of new red tape for our passports, driving licences, phone bills and more...Regular reminder: we do not have to do this. 
Brexit is not the only cause of UK retail woes, but £ weakness did have a significant impact on real incomes, import costs. So dismissal of concerns by ministers not a good look.  
PM to discuss no-deal Brexit plans  
These proposals are common sense. But reform is necessary regardless of Brexit.Why have an immigration cap, which is never met, and does not meet demand? Why prevent nurses and doctors from coming to the UK, when the NHS is in need? 
Brexit is like that scene in Father Ted where Ted tries to knock out a tiny dent in a car, and ends up completely destroying the car.In trying to fix a tiny problem in their own party, the Tories are demolishing the country. 
Why were two men at the heart of allegations over Brexit referendum cheating invited to Downing Street for a secret meeting? 
I don’t often swear on Twitter but I am livid with this...FUCK OFF @DominicRaab!!!! Brexit is KILLING RETAIL.STOP PRETENDING (aka LYING) that it isn’t.Any retailer will tell you that costs are up MASSIVELY b/c of #Brexit & profit wiped out.#PeoplesVote#StopBrexit 
He's not wrong. Jamie Oliver also does a good line in blaming Brexit for difficulties at his muddled and overpriced restaurant empire.  
Nothing is ever the Brexiters fault. Nothing. #Brexit  
So many major domestic problems to solve - NHS, housing, transport, legal aid, pollution etc.So many major global problems to solve - climate change, migration etc.But for 2.5 years, we’re wedged in the Tory In-fighting Show, inhaling & exhaling Brexit. National interest? 
Raab demonstrates the delusion level of Brexiters and why he is not fit to negotiate a roundabout let alone #Brexit.

Dominic Raab tells #r4today that business "should take responsibility" for any problems they have when asked if Brexit is damaging British business.

Britain will refuse to pay the EU's £39billion Brexit divorce bill unless a deal is done, warns Dominic Raab: Brexit News for Thursday 13th September  
There is a temptation for Brexiteers not doing well not to blame Brexit.  
Tories & Labour say we have to go through with #Brexit otherwise 'the far Right will rise up.'No - they're only worried about supporters going back to UKIP. This is solely about votes. They're doing it for the good of their own parties, not the good of the country.Shameful. 
The Tories who caused Brexit are demanding that the SNP explain what it means. The same Tories whose power grab means decisions about agriculture policy will be taken by Westminster, not Holyrood.  
Dominic Raab is quite right to say we won't pay our Brexit divorce bill. We want open, honest relationships with all EU countries, so it's best that they know we're a bunch of untrustworthy thieves. 
“Local authorities across the country have warned that Brexit could lead to billions of pounds of funding shortfalls, infrastructure projects unable to be signed off, threats to public services and projected rises in homelessness, poverty and unemployment”  
John Lewis blame massive fall in profits .."in part due to ongoing Brexit negotiations"

A BBC presenter inadvertently called the Breakfast Programme the #Brexit Programme - @Andrew_Adonis has been right all along! 
Reassuring also to know that David Davis is part of “The European Research Group.”No doubt he’ll add his magic Brexit Impact Reports to the library of “research” 
So, the #Government is again talking about a No-deal #Brexit. Here is my list of some of the practical consequences. It’s pretty horrible:  
You CAN be both a Jeremy Corbyn supporting Labour Member and want a parliamentary/peoples vote on the final Brexit dealThat's Lucky Heron's position, though a leftwing UK Government is priority number 1#ThursdayThoughts 
Keep calm and press for a fresh referendum! Dominic Raab's threat not to pay for past UK commitments significantly increases the risk of no EU agreement by exit day. #r4today 
It is reassuring that “The European Research Group” has begun it’s so-called “research” at the 11th hour of the #Brexit proceedings. From the lot who weren’t so keen on experts anymore, it becomes more credible by the day. 
“Even after the child has declared that there are no magic clothes....the naked, shivering emperor does not turn back. He suspects the jeering crowd is right but he feels the procession must go on. He walks “more proudly than ever”.#Brexit #BrexitShambles 
Stark message to ⁦@DominicRaab⁩’s opposite number Michel Barnier that Britain will not be handing over the agreed £39-billion Brexit divorce bill if an agreement cannot be reached - quite bloody right too  
Can someone direct me to the option for:Hokey-Cokey Deal: neither in nor out. #Brexit  
Yes Kevin, mainly because of his rather arrogant and anti-democratic, Brexit-blocking activities...  
#Brexit means workers lose protections like minimum wages, protection from unsafe working practices and protection from cheap immigrant labour. No wonder the Tories are foaming at the mouth at the thought.#Leavers, thar's another one of your arguments that has evaporated. #Mugs 
Brexit will lead to a nationwide clampdown on basic freedoms and civil rights. I don't think people have really caught on to what's happening.

Theresa May seems determined to deliver Brexit purely so she can say she 'honoured' a wafer-thin vote made two years ago on a rainy day. And damn the consequences.That's fucking infantile. 
Great that @JustinWelby speaking out so strongly for social justice. Just like David Sheppard against Margaret Thatcher in Faith in the City. He was right then; the archbishop is right now. V clear he is anti Brexit too 
Transport minister Chris Grayling struggles with the train set that he already has. The challenges of keeping planes flying and Brexit are too much to ask.#StopBrexit 
At last the Brexit Secretary @dominicraab has threatened to withhold £39bn divorce payout unless there is a proper deal. 
Europe referendum result would’ve been different had Leavers put “Bring Back Mobile Phone Roaming Charges” down the side of their bus. Discussing Brexit on @GMB in a mo 
'No deal Brexit' will bring back mobile phone roaming and data charges for Brits in Europe  
At last the UK grows a pair over Brexit: “No deal” means no £39bn divorce bill to EU  
Is Brexit the greatest act of self-harm by any major country in postwar history? “I can’t see another example where a country volunteers, on scanty evidence, to make itself poorer.” 
Never thought to give that a go while you were, er, Brexit Secretary? Or is this the plan you put to officials who told you it was rubbish?  
Been predicting this for 2 years. The Tories will use May to drag Brexit across the March finishing line, tell the country to blame the fallout on her then replace her with their preferred dictator with monarch level powers.And Labour are letting this happen.  
EU Votes to Ban Memes"Every amendment passed will have to go through behind-closed-doors negotiations between EU bureaucrats & EU member states. We can expect another vote on this ludicrous legislation in January 2019. Brexit can’t come soon enough…"

Tory Brexiteers are still dithering about when to ditch May. Next April is even being discussed. It beggars belief. Nick Timothy actually argues in today’s Telegraph that getting rid of her now could scupper a Clean Brexit. As Churchill used to say, we need ‘action this day!’ 
Brexiters love to tell us how a #FinalSay ref on Brexit would undermine people’s confidence in politics.Do they really think anyone has any anyway when they see our lawmakers, our representatives, doing this?

Brexit not only means another country is dragging Scotland out of Europe against it's will. It also is removing democracy also. This must end Now!! 
“Now is the time to think about workable alternatives”...You, er, don’t think your days as Brexit Minister were the right time?  
Scottish Conservatives are desperately & farcically - trying to blame @theSNP for the consequences of #Brexit.  Reflects their falling poll ratings and increasing public anger at the #Brexit mess created solely by the Tories and made worse by their continuing civil war  
A message to Lib Dem Members:We will be submitting an amendment to Tom Brake's motion to conference on Stop Brexit. Many of you have a good idea from my tweets what the nature of amendment will be. If you wish to support, can you kindly DM me for further details? Thank you. Ros 
*Fuck Brexit*  
This is just embarrassing now. Time to sort this country out. Brexit’s gotta get buried and the Tory party needs to be booted out. Then we need to look at how our politics got into such a shoddy state & build a better way.

There’s a “myth” that before 1967 the aboriginals were listed as flora and fauna. Everyone says it’s a myth but the referendum was to include aboriginals in determining the population of Australia. SO BEFORE THE 1960’s THEY WERE NOT EVEN COUNTED AS PEOPLE. 
I dreamed a dream in time gone byWhen #Brexit hope was highI dreamed that Brexit would never dieI dreamed the people would be forgivingBut the Remainers come at nightWith their #PeoplesVote voices soft as thunderAs they tear your hope apartAs they turn your dream to shame

It is vital after Brexit that we introduce a new controlled immigration system. Many politicians will plot to keep free movement by another name but the only way we can end the housing crisis, NHS crisis, schools crisis & save struggling public services is to control immigration.  
I do wish Remainers would grasp Remain was never a static option. The EU is a vast, constantly evolving blob. In or Out was a binary choice but there was no status quo on offer; it was about choosing our future. Brexit is a safer future because it restores our self-determination. 
Conservatives accused of seeking Brexit favours after backing Hungary's authoritarian leader Viktor Orban  
Sorry, it wasn't the Scottish that voted for brexit, it wasn't the Scots that voted for Tories, it isn't the Scots that put up with a pathetic Labour. So why should they bother with a 2nd vote when Indy would rid them of all this crap anyway? 
Not really an accurate version of 89/90. Thatcher opposed further integration, which is not the same as Brexit. Many other issues after a decade in power. It is true Brexiteers never got over killing Mummy.  
So our farms only produce 60% of our food&farmers who get 60% of their funding from the #EU voted overwhelmingly to leave are about to lose all that money £3billion & have nowhere to sell their produce if they can even afford to produce it? #Brexit is going well don’t ya think? 
Please can someone add me to an interesting Brexit thread, where the debate is factual and there are some leavers who actually have some real information, expertise and well argued positives about Brexit? 
The Irish border was checkmate for instant hard Brexit back in December 2017.The ERG are still in checkmate nearly a year later and arguing that they are not. 
JRM and the ERG have come up with a "solution" to the NI border issue that will not be acceptable to the EU.TM is pushing ahead with Chequers but runs the risk of being unseated.No matter what, expect a General Election soon and a hard no-deal Brexit.There is no more time! 
Salvini blasts EU for punishing UK in Brexit negotiations – Italy is 'on Britain's side'  
When your own party is split down the middle between two proposals for a Brexit deal (Chequers & the ERG plan by Rees-Mogg, Davis &Johnson), and both have been essentially rejected by the EU, it's perhaps best to keep schtum rather than accuse others of lacking Brexit clarity...

Peers seek to send hard Brexit amendments back to Commons. The House of Lords are at it again, thankfully! 
A couple of points beyond the headlines: 1. Chequers is a start; but it does require more work - a start not a good enough end. I represent a heavily BREXIT city; I have a duty to make sure it is delivered properly. Currently I couldn’t vote for it. Reasonable stance in my book.. 
it's cool, Kay. we offered this before the EU regs changed. and we'll be offering it free - deal or no deal. #Brexit 
 Tories across the UK need to start owning Brexit. They’ve put their own party’s interests before the national interests since #EUref, they’ve treated it like a game. It’s about time they started owning their own mess instead of trying to point the finger elsewhere.

“I’m glad I live in Britain so I don’t have to deal with Article 13. Brexit is happening!” Don’t forget to report non-criminal speech offenses to the police.  
When you became Brexit Secretary, you thought you would be negotiating with individual Member States. Now you repudiate your own record. Why on earth should anyone take you seriously ever again?  
So the EU succeeded in doing away with roaming charges & now the UK is leaving that very same EU, it is a surprise that #brexit will force the return of these charges? I am shocked!   
Most of Gladstone's criticism would be aimed at Brexit. Why a 19th-century British prime minister matters now more than ever #OpenFuture 
A sovereign EU, with abolition of national vetoes on tax and foreign policy, should surely be shouted from the roof tops by those in Parliament espousing the reversal of the referendum, no?  
Nothing bigger than Brexit.  
Msg to @MichelBarnier : yes we know it's for us to stop Brexit, not you. But the problem is, our govt & even our own parliament aren't representing us. They're actually at war with us.You KNOW Brexit's illegit. We NEED you to demand a legal mandate & to stop the clock till then. 
Key to understanding ERG:1/ despite undue prominence, they’re relatively powerless2/ they’re cowardsIf they thought Brexit really was utopia, they’d be scrambling to run it now. They don’t. But they’ll go for May in the end.Those compliments in full on BBC London today:  
The Tories who kept £160m of EU funds targeted at Scottish farmers, who is leading this Brexit farce, who failed to issue impact reports (& lies about them), who failed to support Scotland devolutition settlement in Brexit Bills...blame the SNP. Seriously. How much longer..

Absolutely HILARIOUS! Tories, who thought of brexit, held a fraudulent referendum on Brexit and are now executing Brexit..... quite literally try to blame a party that was anti Brexit for the complete and utter national chaos, they THEMSELVES created

Oh damn, might as well forget about Brexit then.  
So then. #Brexit. Convince me.Let's assume that I'm not a race-hating, ultra-nationalist extremist, and let's assume that I don't need to squirrel away my cash in a tax haven. Let's therefore assume that I won't be swayed by appeals to either of the above.What's in it for me? 
A party at war with itself over Brexit with a government boasting Fox, Grayling, Leadsom & Bradley, led by the worst PM in history, on course to win the next GE because 300,000 Labour members believe only an anti-Semite can bring austerity to an end. What a time to be alive.

If the moderates in the Labour Party are waiting for Corbyn to oppose Brexit, it’s not happening. If the moderates in the Tory party think May’s Chequers plan is going to deliver, it’s not. Surely it’s time to put party loyalty aside and do something, what do they have to lose? 
Another disgraceful display of anti-Brexit bias by BBC in Newsline's coverage of ERG proposals on border: no opportunity to expound them, but lengthy interview with FG senator to rubbish them. 
How disgusting. Is this how low the Brexit debate has now fallen, where it’s deemed OK to abuse children like this? I admire @Jacob_Rees_Mogg’s calmness but honestly, this is repulsive.

Europe needs another brexit  
Slide from @MichelBarnier demonstrates the futility of Brexit.Clout in the world matters. It shouldn’t - but it does.UK currently among biggest economies in world. By 2030 it won’t be.In EU, we would stay among top 5. Outside it, we fall out of the top 10.  
There is no Brexit plan.And they know it.  
Mr Barnier, there was no ‘British decision to leave the EU.’ There was a flawed referendum in which crimes & lies persuaded 37% of the (restricted) electorate to vote Leave. As polls emphatically show, a genuine majority of the British people wish to remain in the EU.  
Let's hurt the poor to stop the UKIPs getting our votesYou dismal fools. This is so much bigger than party politics. You know brexit will harm poor communities and you are complicit

Good to be in Macedonia marking 25 years of diplomatic relations & friendship. Met with PM @Zoran_Zaev, Vice PM @Bujar_O & my colleague @Dimitrov_Nikola. Discussed Rule of Law & Reforms & upcoming referendum. Also in that context the EU & NATO and further cooperation with   
We’re going to support an illegal & advisory referendum that will seriously damage the U.K. economy & hurt poor communities the most because UKIP might get a few more votes.  
First real laugh I've had since the Brexit nightmare started... here are the Brexit leaders at the launch of their great idea yesterday... Just look at them. Plonkers.  @mikegalsworthy @CloughOlive @BrexitBin 
'The damage will be huge, the benefits illusory' - Peer demolishes govt's Brexit trade plans  
A blind Brexit that damages our businesses and our NHS appeals to nobody. Nobody voted for this mess, that's why there has been a shift towards a People's Vote on the Brexit deal across the political spectrum. @RidgeOnSunday 
A friend of mine just found this leaflet from the 1975 EU referendum in his mum's stuff:   
At PMQ's, Theresa May said she wanted to keep the European Arrest Warrant after Brexit, but just last week, a report from the IfG warned that this was all but impossible.The best way to keep our current benefits is to stay in the EU. Please RT 
I don't know how many wake up calls @UKLabour needs to see that Brexit is not a progressive project. It is a project of the far right (pretending to be centre-right) seeking allies with other far right. It will diminish rights, make life worse for refugees and much more.  
Article 13 passed. some of you STILL think the EU is great. still think Brexit was a bad idea. I give up. some people not only want their freedom to be taken away but cry out and beg to be oppressed and controlled. it'd be hilarious if you weren't dragging me down with ya 
Brexit means lose, lose and lose. 
Brexit priors:1. ERG are loud but don’t have the numbers to replace May.2. They perhaps do have enough votes to defeat a Withdrawal Agreement.3. But when push comes to shove there’ll be enough Labour votes to pass it.4. No cliff edge.5. Final deal is a post 2019 problem. 
Things it ignores:- Non-EU trade into UK- Businesses too small to carry Trusted Trader status/new admin costs- Sensitivity & security issues re: 'inspections' for traders across border, no matter where they take place- Most substantive research on Brexit+NI/border/trade.5/5 
A reheat of ideas already shown to be unworkable. EU & UK negotiating teams are rightly focused on a #Brexit that delivers on the commitments of last Dec. & March and the guarantee of no hard border. Time is short, we don’t need distractions like this.  
I utterly condemn ppl targeting Rees-Moggs children. Shame Rees-Mogg couldn't share that consideration of our children, happy as he is to throw them on the brexit bonfire 
"The ERG plan is trash because you need regulatory alignment for the GFA." If anyone can tell me where that is in the text of the GFA I'd be grateful, because I can't find it. It's almost like opponents of Brexit are just making stuff up... 
 Yet another huge post-referendum investment, this time £50m into Wales from Aston Martin to produce electric vehicles   
If you're in any way, blaming any negative aspect of Brexit in Scotland on the SNP. You're an idiot. End of. 
If this doesn't calll for a massive campaign of civil disobedience against the EU then I don't know what will. The EU is an authoritarian undemocratic free-speech-killing dictatorship of bland faceless grey-suited grey-faced Eurocrats. Give us the 'Hard' Brexit we voted for NOW  
@julie4nw was an Election Observer at the Kenyan Presidential election where #CambridgeAnalytica was used as in the referendum.@carolecadwalla There the Supreme court annulled the gerrymandered election result. Why not in UK known as a founding democracy?

Brexit would be "the greatest act of self-harm by any country in post-war history". My interview with Ian Kershaw, the world's leading historian of Nazi Germany.  
Wanting the NHS fixed. Wanting the UK to have as much control as possible. Wanting to rebalance the country so that London isn't the only land of opportunity. Having zero trust in politicians, including when it comes to Brexit itself.

Britain deserves better than the Conservative infighting over Brexit. The Brexit deal will have a huge impact the future of our country - we must make sure the people have the final say on the deal and a chance to #ExitfromBrexit. Join our campaign today:  
In the last few days, Boris Johnson and his band of Brexiteer supporters have steadfastly refused to accept any responsibility for the unfolding chaos they have visited upon Britain. Brexit is a project by the elites for the elites. My @Independent column: 
Indeed. Taking away the political part, I am amazed that it is possible to use public money to fund a group with no constitution, no accountability, no visible elections and no transparent membership.Wasn't Brexit about getting rid of "unelected, unaccountable politicians"? 
What if Johnson’s hard #Brexit dreams come to nought and the PM brings back some “son of Chequers” deal which is even more miserable than the one she's already proposed?Since he knows that’s far worse than the status quo, he should back a #PeoplesVote 
Friends! Some Brexiter claims that weren't fact-checked:"I don't remember voting for Juncker, Verhofstadt or Barnier!" "WW3 hasn't broken out yet!"and even"Leave actually won the Referendum, you know!"Talk about the Far-Right bias of the Brexit Broadcasting Corporation!  
EU should suspend negotiations pending result of an independent Mueller-style Inquiry into illegalities proven & suspected in the referendum. PM may be in legal jeopardy on A50. Would you buy a home if the right of sale was in doubt? @MichelBarnier @guyverhofstadt @eucopresident 
The Tories own Brexit lock stock and barrel. Stop trying to assign the blame elsewhere, especially in Scotland where we voted by an overwhelming majority to remain. We are not buying it sunshine! 
IScottish Conservatives are desperately - and farcically -  trying to blame @theSNP for the consequences of #Brexit.  Reflects their falling poll ratings and increasing public anger at the #Brexit mess created solely by the Tories , and made worse by their continuing civil war.

What would a no deal Brexit mean for UK fisheries? Comments from fishers in Brixham, @FishStock1, @NFFO_UK, and a @NEF report on coastal communities I wrote with @FeBalata: 
I'm not one to post my views often, but as someone who was indifferent on Brexit, this Article 13 passing has now influenced me to go to hope leaving is the best outcome for us. 
ultimately Brexit wasn't really about the EU, trade, legislation & democracyit was (possibly) the last gasp of British nationalism - the people asserting their will and telling their leaders they do not consent with the direction of this countrythe details are superfluous 
>Pass sweeping regulation of internet>Stall Brexit to prevent UK from avoiding said lawChrist. It's the political equivalent of ripping a righteous fart, then locking your dog in the car.  
Absolutely desperate stuff from Scottish Tories. Voters are not stupid. They know the Tories caused Brexit due to their infighting and will cause a hard Brexi due to their ineptitude. The charge of incompetence lies solidly at their door.  
Who says young people aren't engaged in politics?!Dozens of young people have already left their thoughts on how Brexit is going for @KarenLeeMP in Lincoln today!

EU Internet Censorship is on its way. Article 11 and 13 will impact everyone and your ability to see: News, video content, opinion pieces. It will impact your finances and increase prices while reducing free content. More reasons for #Brexit

The UK gov doesn't seem to know if a no deal Brexit will have any implications for common frameworks. Real danger they'll use Brexit chaos to force through UK wide arrangements to constrain Scottish government.

Liz Saville-Roberts - 1000s of jobs are to be put at risk by the British government's #brexit strategy...  is it not the case that she is prepared to dole out P45s to manufacturing workers simply to appease the #Brextremists in her own party? #FBPE #PMQs @LSRPlaid #PoliticsLive 
Almost laughable. It is the Conservatives that are driving our farmers to the very brink with their bad deal/no deal Brexit. The tariffs they could face because of this Tory Brexit could alone decimate so many of our farming sectors.  
New York has replaced London as the world's leading financial hub, survey suggests 
This is Brexit!! Utterly shocking!! This will be happening all over Britain. This makes me angry, sad, upset and utterly embarrassed to be a part of the disunited pile of shit, that is the UK!! Not in my name!!!  
Not that there was any doubt, but we know where you stand when it comes to what is right - WE are reacting to a regime that has been closing media outlets, shrinking civil society, targeting refugees and threatening academia, all of which are in clear breach of European values.

The steel industry told opposition parties (excluding the Labour leader who refused to attend) that jobs are at risk by UK Govt #Brexit policies. Is it not the case that the PM is prepared to dole out P45s to  manufacturing workers in order to appease Brexiteers? #PMQs

I’ve particularly enjoyed Brexiters reactions to this tweet saying that it’s nothing to do with Brexit, and we should stop blaming it on Brexit.The tweet doesn’t mention Brexit, but when they see “telling foreigners to fuck off”, they themselves assume that’s what it’s about.  
@GdnPolitics 15 British MEPs have signed a joint statement saying the revelation that the Electoral Commission has found that Vote Leave broke election spending rules during the EU referendum justifies a second referendum. In the statement, organised by @MollyMEP, they say: 
'No-deal' Brexit puts food export industry at risk as food consignments and livestock could be delayed at UK borders  
It is vital that our excellent Aberdeenshire produce can continue to be exported. Brexit threatens the strength of our industry and @theSNP will fight for it. 
Owen Paterson MP, at a ERG press conference this morning, said that we can solve the Northern Ireland border issue with a bit of 'imagination'.There's no golden ticket for Brexit. It's time for a #PeoplesVote 
Brexit means...  
This ERG Irish Border report is a reasonable contribution to a debate on how one could theoretically have no border on the island or Ireland after Brexit - but nowhere near enough to say the issue is 'solved' (sorry @BorderIrish) 
I joined ERG colleagues to launch our proposals to solve the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the EU as part of the #Brexit negotiations. It’s a considered and constructive approach to ensure a far reaching free trade agreement with the EU. 
While majority of UK await a workable outcome re Brexit - obvious reasons, the party we have in power in Scotland hope for a car crash of a deal. What poison they are. Many of their followers (the thicker ones) almost having an orgasm at the thought - SNP enemy of the state IMO 
ERG has just published its proposals for ensuring the border between NI & RoI remains invisible after Brexit, whilst ensuring the UK in its entirety achieves a clean break from the EU as voted for by the people#StandUp4BrexitIn full via @BrexitCentral 
Good to see David Trimble at launch of #ERG border plan.Go on, someone have the nerve to suggest one of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement (who fought for it, costing him lots politically) is risking that agreement by backing the ERG & #Brexit .....#StandUp4Brexit 
Ultimately you have to decide, what will people care more about in 10 years time?a) that a #Brexit decision was reversed, to the annoyance of a number of leaversb) that a Brexit decision was followed through on, with all its attendant problems, because we felt we had no choice? 
ERG’s #Brexit document on Ireland seems to have been whipped up in a bit of a hurry, footnote 7...  
This paper and indeed most Brexit rhetoric is based on double-think on regulation. Firstly: We're keeping regulation the same so no need for checks. Secondly: We're going round the world signing trade deals which require changes to regulation. 
Let's take a look at the ERG, Rees-Mogg/Davis/Owen Paterson/Villiers/Caulfield, etc all affluent, some extremely affluent, do you really think they have our interest at heart? They are greedy hard right disaster capitalists who want to feed off our #Brexit carcass #PeoplesVote 
There is nothing to respect, @michelbarnier. The decision to leave the Union was taken personally by @theresa_may, relying on a referendum result she knew at the time was unreliable and tainted by malpractice.The Article 50 process MUST be suspended to ensure the rule of law.  
Sack him.........    Hammond RELAUNCHES Project Fear and says Britain MUST pay £39bn Brexit bill  
Northern Ireland voted *against* Brexit. Support for Remaining continues to grow in Northern Ireland. If Northern Ireland has no voice then it is the Brexiters who have robbed them of it. It is the Brexiters who want WTO but gutlessly won't accept WTO rules are their fault. 
At this point, the best way to #BackBritishFarming is to #StopBrexit.#PeoplesVote #Brexit(HT @Rev_BJohnson) 
The govt responsible for the causes of #Brexit, is now responsible for delivering the Brexit to address the causes of Brexit.No wonder they're stalling, their bluff has been called, they know it can't be delivered.Brexit can't be done, but it can be undone by a #PeoplesVote 
Laughter at ERG press conference as @WestmonsterUK reporter accuses @Jacob_Rees_Mogg of not taking a hard enough line on Brexit. 
I am offering some resistance, but the best hope of unseating @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is with a grown-up progressive alliance uniting around the candidate most likely to win. There is however a fair chance that @Jacob_Rees_Mogg may defeat himself in angry hard #Brexit desperation.  
"There is absolutely nothing new in here" - Former NI secretary Owen Paterson says ERG plan could allow the UK to leave single market & customs union without need for hard border, and plan is based on procedures that exist around world already  #Brexit

DO you feel that the REFERENDUM was a complete CON, designed by Conservative Party with a 'double edged sword' in place.Vote remain, 'they were already' in power.Vote leave, 'introduce a dictatorship', built entirely on false 'disinformation'and eliminate democracy !! 
Repeat after me: future of Irish border depends on UK’s future relationship w/EU. There is no magic bullet. The ERG’s vision of Brexit would lead to changes in border once UK diverges from EU in agriculture etc. No end of flying taxmen or drones will change that.  
‘Ireland is the Achilles heel of Brexit & it is going gangrenous.’ My speech in the House of Lords yesterday  
We #BackBritishFarming - agriculture is a hugely important sector for #Cornwall.90% of Britain's food & drink exports go to Europe, which is why the NFU has warned that #Brexit could mean an "Armageddon scenario" for our farmers.#PeoplesVote

Lord Trimble, architect of the Good Friday Agreement tells ERG launch that it's "completely wrong" to suggest that Brexit interferes with the GFA, and there is "no serious threat from violence" in Northern Ireland.

You and your party have bestowed Brexit on our Nation even though 62% voted to Remain! You & your party are to blame for the abject stupidity of Brexit & the misery it will deliver, the responsibility belongs to you and your party no one else! #NeverTrustaTory #DarkMoneyDavidson 
When Brexit is abandoned there won’t be civil disorder, there won’t be a mass movement to restore Brexit, the leading Brexiter politicians will return to obscurity. There will be a national sigh of relief and the task of solving our real problems will begin.

The European Research Group has just published its guide to keeping the Irish border invisible post-Brexit - read it in full here  
The answer is to put "Accuracy", the first @BBC editorial guideline, first. @BBC would report that:1. What Economists for Brexit say is wrong; 2. Some prominent Tory MPs support it anyway.P.S. Not sure why there is ever any need to balance truth with patent untruths, @BBC. 
Even for you Jacob, this is a pile of cow compost. You just abandoned your "alternative Chequers blueprint" because you could not even reach agreement in the ERG.If you can't unite the UKIP wing of the Tory Party behind hard Brexit, how do you expect to unite the country?  
Summary:1. A second Brexit referendum could be for the best.2. Look at Ireland and Lisbon:3. In their first referendum, the Irish delivered the wrong result.4. But in their second referendum, they corrected this error.5. Talk about *second* time lucky!6. That's all, folks!

I shall be trying to call in to @mrjamesob on @LBC on his Brexit topic later.   We need to talk about Rees-Mogg and his ridiculous report and more important the mahoosive 'time CHASM' between Withdrawal Date and new trade deals.   Fingers crossed they let me through. 
Pathetic! @johnmcdonnellMP says we must respect a referendum result built on hard-right cheating, crime, lies & hate, and undemocratically ignore the majority who want a #PeoplesVote and to #StopBrexit. And his #Brexit proposal? David Davis style cherry-picking! Pathetic!  
Michael Gove and his hard-brexit seeking colleagues know full well the damage that they will cause across many industries - yet they drive on with their ideological agenda. They don't represent us, they represent just themselves! #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
1mn march for #Catalonia's independence as referendum anniversary nears  
WATCH | @Nigel_Farage: "On Brexit, [Juncker] was reasonably positive. He's saying what a lot of them are now saying, 'let's just have a trade deal'. For the first time in this process, I think they want to do a deal." #SOTEU 
Under pressure Tory MSPs (& MPs)  now casting around for people to blame for the abject, disastrous failure of their own Government at Westminster.  No Deal, Chequers Deal, Blind #Brexit - all Tory schemes, all unacceptable .  There must be a better way....  
 These negative Brexit scare stories are getting even sillier. So rigs are going to be shut down because of possible issues with less than 5% of the workforce. Oh come on! 
“We also ask the British government to understand that someone who leaves the Union cannot be in the same privileged position as a Member State” says @JunckerEU about #Brexit in his #SOTEU speech to European Parliament 
The country is unhappy with Chequers. Tory members are unhappy with Chequers. Instead of sitting there in silence, why not actually join the fight against it so we can get a proper Brexit? Mrs May is the obstacle to the Brexit we voted for. She has to go or the Tories will suffer 
Spot on! No minimum threshold or supermajority that pretty much all western democracies require for major constitutional change. No demand for a published post-referendum plan from the backers of both potential outcomes. For the govt it was an unforgiveable lack of due diligence. 
Brexit will starve our NHS of staffBrexit will not make us healthierBrexit will make it harder to get the drugs we need We agree with @DrPhillipLeeMP - time for a #PeoplesVote to save our NHS 
Shoppers to enjoy Brexit price cuts as farming rethink brings cheap food 
Brexit means being completely blootered and skedaddling doon an escalator. 
Remember the end of Finding Nemo, when the escaped fish are in plastic bags in the harbour?  As they bob about, one says 'Now what'?Can't help but think this'll be the Conservative Party on the day of Brexit... 
Suits me.I chose not to be part of the EU at all.As did 17,410,741 others.Viva Brexit! 
On @BreakfastNews tomorrow we chat to the formidable @LisaMillar as she wraps up her 12 years as an ABC foreign correspondent. She’s covered terror attacks, US elections, Brexit etc. etc..but this will always be one of her finest moments. @abcnews 
Brexit is a cult. It relies purely on blind faith. It cannot properly explain why it will improve your life, but it promises bogus empty rhetoric that is completely delusional and unworkable. 
"We asked her to explain her sudden U-turns on Brexit, P1 testing and more. She wouldn't answer." 
Brexiteers promised a ban on live animal exports. Now @MichaelGove says it won't happen. This Tory Brexit is built on lies. We urgently need a #PeoplesVote 
The reason nobody knows what Brexit means is because its roots stem from a 30 year psychodrama within the Tory party but without a strategic end game. Brexit is a way of deflecting from a multitude of problems facing our country - many of them caused by the Tory party themselves. 
"If one looks to the leaders of the #Brexit campaign...all of whom can make passionate cases in various media in 500 or 1,000 words. But if you ever examine what they say carefully, there is little or no policy substance." Excellent from @davidallengreen  
Today the #ERG will publish its solution to the Irish problem. The smart money is on a border patrolled by nannies and a Steve Bannon memorial wall built from the trillion pound coins apparently coming our way after a no deal #Brexit 
Animals stuck on motorways, food exports delayed, protections not enforced. Damning report from @NAOorguk raises serious doubts on @michaelgove's ability to deliver on "green Brexit" promises.For our environment's sake, we need a #PeoplesVote now. 
"The European Commission,this Parliament and all other 26 Member states will always show loyalty and solidarity with Ireland...It is not the European Union, it is Brexit that risks making the border more visible in Northern Ireland"  @JunckerEU #POTEU 
It all comes down to the lack of an informed national debate about Brexit prior to the referendum. Ignorance of the advantages of EU membership prevailed. Those convinced of the need to leave were ideologically motivated,  never bothered to agree a concept for post-Brexit Britain 
‘Brexit poll: Nearly half [40%] want Britain to leave EU next year with or WITHOUT deal’Hmmmm. That means over half [60%] don’t want Britain to leave EU next year. But hey, Express, don’t let that ruin your headline.   
Tell her you are not available to conduct an interview at the conference until she agrees  to an interview about the Brexit shambles, dark money, her stamping her feet for primary 1 assessments and having it in the manifesto now changing her mind, etc etc etc 
Number Ten says Chequers is the only plan that delivers a solution to the Irish border issue. Maybe it does. But IT DOESN’T DELIVER BREXIT! 
Disingenuous hard-Brexiter Michael Gove responded to the question "Will Brexit cause a fall in farm values?" with 'Some people may want to leave farming to give others a chance...' - he knows farming will collapse but wants us to ignore it #BrexitShambles #PeoplesVote 
We’re in the @guardian today as one of several groups who have been convincing Labour members to back a #PeoplesVote. Brexit is the fight of our generation. #FFS#Lab18 
FLASHBACK: Brexit Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Faisal's 683 Negative Tweets Since Referendum  
I’ve come to the opinion, sadly, that a no deal Brexit is probably what Britain actually needs. Because sometimes a slap just isn’t enough. 
I'm tired of people, including myself, tiptoeing around this issue. It's historically irresponsible. The logic of the hypothetical I just presented is undeniable. There are those who see Brexit as the worst kind of opportunity. 
UK drivers already pay £40b p.a in motoring taxes for shocking third world roads. Raising fuel duty with Brexit, oil at close to $80 and slow consumer spending is arrogant and reckless -and the way to lose the next election. @BorisJohnson @PhilipHammondUK 
"Dominic Raab has been reprimanded by Michel Barnier after the EU’s chief negotiator discovered the British government had written to the 27 other member states asking for side negotiations on transport in the event of a no-deal Brexit."  
EU leaders now have to over-rule Juncker and Barnier for ⁦@Theresa_may⁩ to stand any chance of securing her Chequers Brexit plan for trade - and then there’s the small matter of rolling it over the dead bodies of her ERG colleagues. Chin up  
Listening to gove on Radio 4 this morning. He is sounding more and more like Chemical Ali saying that Iraqi troops have driven back the coalition troops, when in reality they're ringing his door bell. Brexit will ultimately fail, but only if we keep engaging. 
Juncker‘s last #StateOfTheUnion speech: #Juncker presided over the worst 5 year term: Division between East and West, North and South, rampant populism everywhere,record debts in most countries and, worst of all, he lost Britain,the last country with common sense! #Brexit #SOTEU 
The National Audit Office reports that Michael Gove’s Defra department have completed just 15 out of 154 of the national export agreements needed to maintain the trade of animals and animal products with the EU after Brexit. Extraordinary tardiness. 
One for the project 'fearists'. Read and weep.‘Brexit does NOT scare us!’ German bank to keep THOUSANDS of employees in UK after Brexit  
Michael Gove says that the vital task for the government is to deliver Brexit. Dead right. But Chequers is NOT BREXIT. 
"If we don't respect the referendum result, we've got the potential then of the rise of UKIP again." Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says Labour is offering a "traditional British compromise" over Brexit.  
Juncker's statement on Brexit. He bristles at suggestions the Commission are being hardliners standing in the way of the UK and Member States sealing a deal. He trashes the economic part of Chequers and puts the blame squarely on the UK for the Irish border and risk of no deal.  
Philip Hammond says we will have to pay £39 billion to the EU, deal or no dealJacob Rees-Mogg says we won't pay a penny. Read the extract from his letter.RETWEET this if you trust Jacob Rees-Mogg over Philip Hammond. #StandUp4Brexit #ProjectFear #Brexit

NB This is the Lisbon Treaty that Lab described as a mere “tidying up exercise” and which Lab and Cons would not give us a referendum over.  
They will never learn, that's why a clean Brexit is the only way. To quote @Jacob_Rees_Mogg: “As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly." #SOTEUSupport us at

As Labour’s senior Bennite for whom internal democracy is axiomatic, I am happy to announce that there will be no vote on Brexit at @uklabour conference this year because I say so. 
Juncker “We owe it to our citizens to ensure the UK withdrawal is orderly and with stability afterwards. It will not be the commission that will stand in the way of this” #Brexit(ie it’s not our fault if it all goes wrong!) 
When @JunckerEU talks about Brexit: Acceptance. General negotiation points. Sadness. As Europeans we have to offer more than that. In Britain millions of people are still fighting against this madness. We cannot stay silent about their struggle! #SOTEU 
"The @EU_Commission, @Europarl_EN + all other 26 Member States will always show loyalty and solidarity with #Ireland when it comes to the Irish border. This is why we want to find a creative solution that prevents a hard border in Northern Ireland.."  #Brexit #SOTEU (1)

ICYMI: Documents warn thousands of aviation licences for pilots & aircraft may have to be reissued in the event of a "no-deal" Brexit. #PeoplesVote 
Largely because of the mere threat of Brexit - which has not happened & does not have to happen & can be stopped - the NHS is short of 42,000 nurses. Repeat, forty-two thousand nurses. - Don’t fall ill in Brexit Britain. Or anywhere in the EU or world, when reciprocity ends. 
The Brexit committee met last night to discuss about getting rid of May. About 50% wants her out but nobody putting their hat's in the ring. This is the most gutless, useless, slimy, Tory party i can remember. If this had been Maggie these lot would have been shot of ages ago. 
Let me tell you this: if Labour didn't want to leave the EU, they would fight the 2016 referendum with everything they had. They should just be honest about it, rather than saying 'Oh well, y'know, we really don't wanna leave, but we really have to respect the result.'Piss off. 
Brexit Bunch Economist on how Brexit would mostly eliminate manufacturing jobs. Well, I don’t remember them telling us that in 2016.   
How Brexit has already begun damaging Britain’s economy.A third of UK export firms have already lost business directly due to Brexit.And when business is lost, jobs are hit and public services suffer.MPs should call a #PeoplesVote and #StopBrexit. 
Did Michael Gove really just use the phrase "sunlit uplands"?Does he really think, after all that we have seen in the last few months, that people are going to fall for this vacuous rhetoric again?Is this all the Brexiters have left?#r4today #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
Typical guff from O'Brien.The referendum was due to the huge number of voters - of all parties - who wanted one. This was a major reason why the Tories won the 2015 GE, as they promised to hold one.The result of the referendum was due to Leave polling more votes than Remain.  
Such rubbish, ‘respecting the referendum’ - pure dishonest convenience for the Brexiter line. How can you ‘respect’ a result of 37% of an electorate voting on the basis of crimes & lies?  
Here we go again! Justin Webb asks Michael Gove on @BBCR4Today if Brexit is going to cause a fall in farm values. Gove prevaricates, then burbles, "Some people may want to leave farming to give others a chance". (rough quote)So that's a yes then. 
Let's not forget Labour's role in all this. A better Opposition would have resisted triggering Article 50 until impact assessments had been made and rough plans for leaving put in place. Brexit is a UKIP policy, enacted by the Tories, aided & abetted by Labour. Shame on them all.  
I’ll be discussing the ERG and their plan for Brexit with Vanessa Feltz on BBC Radio London in a sec. Will try to remain calm 
Is it any wonder the consensus is Jacob Rees-Mogg's Brexit analysis is deranged when he still relies on this work of fiction, displayed on his twitter page, even after The S*n was forced to make a MASSIVE 11-paragraph apology for publishing an article FULL of bull****!  
The Brexit referendum was due to Tory in-fighting. The result of the Brexit referendum was due to Tory in-fighting. The absurdly early triggering of Article 50 was due to Tory in-fighting. And now, instead of trying to undo some of the mess they’ve made, the Tories are fighting. 
This. The personal cost, the national cost that gets lost in the war of the absurd, day after Brexit day.

The ERG wants to move against Mrs May now? Their chance of getting a majority against her now are slimish. And if they did & took the leadership, what then? They haven’t a majority in Parliament for their Brexit. They haven’t thought it through. It’s less a threat than a metaphor

Choose your own Brexit: An interactive fantasy for all ages  
Wonder if the warning from the boss of Jaguar Land Rover has sunk into the PMs skull yet. Or whether she's happy to chuck the company and the staff under the #Brexit bus just to cling on to her job. Let's face it, that is all #Brexit is now about, a megalomaniac clinging to power 
I'm told that big foreign-owned corporations would prefer UK to a do a very soft Brexit.And Mrs May is hugely influenced by them.But last time I looked, big foreign-owned corporations do not get to vote in the UK.And we voted to Leave!Support Brexit! Not multinationals. 
I don't have a witty caption to this. It's a picture which shows the truth. Brexit is a disaster. History will judge politicians who allow it to happen harshly.

Please show your support for @IncorrectEn and @Firesnakious, a really lovely couple who, like millions of others, find their lives thrown into chaos by Brexit, and are now viciously attacked because they dare to stand up for themselves and challenge this nightmare.  
I wonder how the ERG meeting launching that Economists for Brexit report went.  
"If we stop Brexit, UKIP will come back" is the same line of deflection Starmer used early on.Labour aren't going to #StopBrexit or back #PeoplesVote. Instead they'll continue to push a discredited fudge, pretend they're being pragmatic and hide behind Tory/UKIP bogeymen. 
Let's be blunt.You're a dissident republican and want a United Ireland at all costs.Due to Brexit the North & South have different laws and border checks.You know that if you start real trouble at the border, pretty soon, there'll be a border poll on whether to reunite Ireland  
Leave think you're too stupid to vote. They'd prefer we just believed Brexit Elite lies. Let's prove Leave wrong. #PeoplesVote #NHS There is no good Brexit.  
Another day of Brexit madness kicks off with this Sun story about dumping Chequers, the economic part of which is dead anyway... 2 options are given, first to park it until Brexit day, which is what is happening anyway 1/  
I keep hearing about the "Cheggers Deal" for Brexit. What a truly talented man he was. 
The Conservative party comes ever closer to tearing itself apart over brexit, the very point of which was to unite the Conservative party. It would be hilarious if it wasn’t the rest of us who’ll pay the price. Absolute bollocks from beginning to end.

HERTFORDSHIRE: The Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, a new £60m lab in Stevenage for manufacturing cutting-edge gene therapy treatments wins approval to begin producing potentially life-saving drugs, in a boost for Britain’s post-Brexit economy.  
Also, if MPs do trigger a confidence vote and May wins, they can’t trigger for another one for a year, at which point May will be into negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. So you can see why many Brexiteers are focused - for now - on chucking Chequers not her 
I do find it increasingly amazing that Brexit (the most important political moment, for the UK, in eighty years) is being handled by a bunch of people that couldn’t agree on the colour of shit. 
Tory MPs are rallying support to oust the PM from Number 10. At least 50 MPs are said to be involved the plot, said to be the most threatening to her leadership. But there is a way forward for the PM - scrap her #Brexit plan and sign up for a Canada-style free trade agreement.  
Brexit means......ignoring mounting evidence that the democratic process was compromised during the 2016 referendum. 
In the run-up to the Referendum, one group of economists - Economists for Free Trade - supported Brexit and predicted benefit.It has now released a report. A hilarious report. Discrediting their 'expertise' FOR ALL TIME.So now we know. There was never any case for Brexit. 
Leaving Theresa May in place to run out the clock & slavishly, traitorously, agree to whatever punishment beating the EU hand her at the midnight hour, is a preposterous thing for the UK to do.  Get on with replacing her with a #Brexit Leader in accordance with the EU vote, #ERG.

There is a clear mandate for a sanctioned referendum. The majority of Catalans want to become independent from Spain, according to the most recent polls. A million people showed up on the streets today in a country of seven million. Their determination is extraordinary.

I've stepped up the amount I talk about the situation regarding Northern Ireland and Brexit because I've now actually been there and spoken to people who lived through the Troubles and who are fearful due to Brexit. The English media isn't speaking for them so....  
@Femi_Sorry each time you interact with a person who is vehemently Pro Brexit, please just ask them directly, about the issue over here and the border that will ‘become’ again. They’ll have no answer. They think we don’t exist. They’re wrong. 
I find it shocking that the Trade Unions are showing leadership on Brexit whilst the Labour Party Front Bench, funded by unions and ordinary people,  colludes- cowardly, with the Tories, ERG and aims to appease UKIP.What an utter disgrace.  
The fact that the CEO of the UK’s biggest car manufacturer is warning that, w 6 months to go to Brexit on Mar 29, he doesn’t even know if JaguarLandRover will be able to rely on its EU supply-chains to continue making cars, should be a big wakeup call to those promoting #NoDeal. 
hmm, some very good points in here. i guess we can counter the "i just want Brexit finished" argument by pointing out that Brexit will drag on for years, possibly decades to come, whereas a #PeoplesVote could put an immediate stop to it...  
7He is almost certainly aware that no court in Europe describes that referendum as a violent, seditious uprising, and that European Arrest Warrants issued by Spanish courts against exiled politicians have been rejected because there is evidently no case. 
Much as a lie and the truth are polar opposite words, a distinction is required between specific lies and facts relating to the financial impact of Brexit.On the side of reality, experts. And fantasy, Brexiteers favouring no deal.Subsequently, it is Economics vs Moggnomics. 
4In Spain calling an organizing a referendum without central authorisation was dropped from the Criminal Code. But its courts and police reacted as if it was still in force, to try and prevent an official referendum on independence on #1Oct2017. 
3Noone budged an inch to appease the Catalans & correct this anomaly. And continued erosion of their powers led Catalan leaders to ask the people in a poll, that was NOT a referendum, their opinion about independence. #9N2014. Courts punished them for keeping electoral promises!

How can the UK govt even be contemplating attempting to push through a Brexit arrangement that's unacceptable to the vast majority of Brexiteers? How can anyone imagine such an arrangement would be sustainable & wouldn't trigger a Brexit 2.0 movement? 
The GFA agreement is an international agreement signed in good faith and brexit is only an advisory referendum.  Article 50 should never have been triggered until this was illegal. 
Perhaps, Chloe, we could courteously enquire who has funded the "Taxpayers' Alliance" to lobby for a hard #Brexit? Do they include ultra-wealthy donors who prefer to keep their money offshore in order to avoid paying tax? We await a reply at your earliest convenience.

I didn’t mention Brexit. Interesting that when you see “telling foreigners to fuck off”, which the UKGov has been doing in a myriad of ways for years, you instantly equate it with Brexit though. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg: ‘People voted to leave the EU, but Chequers simply doesn’t take us out of the EU. That’s not my version of Brexit, or anyone else version of Brexit, it’s just not Brexit.’ 
He is a professional liar. If he thinks Catalonia is a nation, why does he deny our right to self-determination and does not call for a referendum on independence? Why did he say Catalonia must be disinfected? Borrell is a real two-faced snake.

9.2% of all NHS posts unfilled - a shortage of nearly 108,000 staff. A national emergency. Nothing to do with Brexit of course. All of those nasty foreigners have gone and the British people who were done out of a job will be along any minute.  
It was reported in a monumentally unbalanced way. There are no economists defending aNo deal Brexit. There is no plan & the BBC is reporting as if The ERG we’re dictating lines.What is going on ? Anyone educated is now avoiding the BBC !#No deal will destroy the UK# PeoplesVote 
There have been three votes:-2015 General election which gave us the government who would hold the referendum. -2016 referendum which saw Brexit obtain the largest mandate in British political history. -2017 General election where Brexit supporting parties proved most popular.  
A tiny GANG of hard-right rich men who are exploiting Brexit for financial reasons and to further their ambitions are in the process of deposing a prime minister who is trying to get a sane Brexit deal. There is no mandate for a #FlounceOutBrexit. This is a coup#Newsnight 
I’m fairly tired of the ERG running this country.No-one elected you to such a position.You have no Brexit plans.You don’t even have parliamentary or public majority support for your loose form of Brexit.You’re just kidnapping the country off to your weird fantasy land.

Scotland's pro-Union broadcaster relegated Brexit *again* to the second half of Reporting Scotland. Given Brexit is widely believed to be pushing more and more people towards independence, then it is no surprise.  
“No.10 is drawing up secret plans to dump Theresa May’s Chequers Brexit blueprint if EU leaders reject it next week. Work is underway to “pivot” away from the softer Brexit plan to allow the PM to escape a political disaster”#StandUp4Brexit

Brexit might be so bad that Cadbury is stockpiling chocolate just in case. This prompts the age old question: which came first? The xenophobia or the chocolate egg? 
Our government spent years cutting NHS pay, then as a country the UK shoots itself in the foot and cuts off its supply of European nurses, doctors and other NHS staff by voting for Brexit. Any wonder the vacancy rate has gone up?  
Secret plans are being drawn up to DUMP PM's Chequers Brexit proposal  
Brexiters, you need to swallow your pride and look at what you're doing!Is this what you want? To cripple the NHS? I doubt itThis is not scaremongering, that's the word cowards use to dismiss anything they don't want to acknowledge. Show us you are patriots! NHS before brexit  
"Jacob Rees-Mogg" is an anagram of "unscrupulous, lying toerag". In fairness, this is as accurate as any of his Brexit pronouncements. 
Chairman of jaguar landrover warns of devastating consequences of #Brexit for the car industry this should please leave voters who were voting to get rid of the UK car industry

One economist, who has been wrong about nearly everything, together with 14 MP's turned up to that latest instalment of "Brexit fantasy". The story of the elite pulling the wool over the eyes of the electorate with "Project Lies". It is time to stop the lies with a #PeoplesVote 
With 7 months to go Remain are at nearly 60%... The Brexit catastrophe WILL be stopped!  
John Redwood MP - "I find it most curious that some MP's are still saying that it wasn’t clear that we voted to leave the single market and the customs union.“One of the very few things that the two official campaigns agreed upon was just that point." #Brexit  
quite interesting - Chequers enabled PM and No 10 to embrace “frictionless trade” in goods as the aim of Brexit policy, when before that it had been “as frictionless as possible” - big problem say car industry/ eurotunnel, the right aim says JRM, as frictionless = single market 
Brexit is like driving to the shop, realising it's closed, and continuing to drive there  
Great reception from Momentum members in Lewisham today where we were invited to discuss what the left's response to Brexit should be. Our Love Corbyn Hate Brexit posters were particularly popular!  
Hey @JohnTory - we DO NOT NEED A REFERENDUM ON THIS! That is a clown-shoes, ridiculous, pointless, needless idea. There was city-wide consultation and study that gave us the 47-ward council. That's Toronto. Try standing up for it. #ONPoli #TOPoli

Activists to use Labour conference to push for second Brexit vote. Unlike last year, it's going to be impossible to ignore Brexit at this year's Labour Party Conference. 
Good blog post from @BBCRealityCheck on today's claims for a no-deal Brexit by Rees-Mogg and Brexity economists, indicating the extent to which their assertions are challenged:  
If Referendum fails, it will not be b/c of Russia, Turkey, Vanuatu, nationalism or vegetarianism, but b/c of corruptocrats and criminals sponsored by West as "model democrats". The Ref. is no longer about name, but about failed west policies in fighting crime. People are fed up! 
When your accountant tells you that he got it wrong, and that you'll actually lose more from the Brexit fallout than you'll ever save from persuading the country to avoid the 2019 EU tax directives  
Brexit’s not the only thing Britain needs to worry about.  
Am I the only person who is sick to fucking death of seeing Jaccob Rees Mogg's self satisfied mug on the TV every day ? He is a lying, self serving charlatan who wants to plunder GB though his disaster capitalism funds after his no deal Brexit.  The media needs to ignore him. 
Damn, seems the People's Vote were VERY keen to stress that the EU referendum was a one-time deal before the public went to the polls in 2016. What changed their mind?  (Answer: Their side lost.)  
We’re in the @guardian as part of a concerted effort to convince Labour Party members to back a #PeoplesVote - Brexit is the fight of our generation - and at #Lab18 we want @UKLabour to hear that. #FFS 
if Brexit forces Jaguar Land Rover to move production out of the UK then the Labour Party must work to protect the jobs and livelihoods of those workers in Merseyside, Warwickshire and Birmingham. They deserve a #FinalSay on Brexit! 
Happy #Diada2018 from London. @ANCEngland and CDR London along with the Catalan community have been present sending a clear message: We voted, we decided to be an independent Republic, lets implement the mandate of the 1-O Referendum!! #FemLaRepúblicaCatalana #ElPoderDelPoble

Peter Brookes on Brexit and the car of the future – political cartoon gallery in Putney  
Difficult to disagree. The Westminster bubble distances our pampered politicians from the reality of existence for the man in the street. If we finally get through BREXIT + MPs actually have to learn how to run the country again, cd be the reality-shock that's desperately needed.

Heard one or two grim whispers from a reliable source (although I am unwilling to substantiate) that there is chaos behind the scenes around the availability of some medications provided by the NHS. Two possible reasons posited are Brexit and catastrophic Tory mismanagement.... 
Boris Johnson says he would rather stay in the EU than accept May's 'humiliating' Brexit plan. Let's cancel BREXIT. I have the feeling that Boris Johnson knows that BREXIT is a huge mistake. Will he come out and say that in public ? 
Of course, when McDonnell says 'we must respect the Referendum result' what he really means is 'I wanted that result so the last thing I'm going to do is call it out as fraudulent'. 
I know not why but one thing I'm sure of is that Brexit appealed to nasty people. 
Despite the catastrophe-roadshow of Mogg, Johnson etc, the most depressing political event for me today was McDonnell doubling down on the ‘we have to Brexit for fear of the racists’ stuff.

I hate Brexit. I think it is a total disastrous crapfest that is going to impact millions many who voted for it. But I also think some of the tone of us remainers sometimes verges on the smug and the snobby and adds to the whole alienating liberal middle class vibe. Like this. 
The chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover tells @IanKingSky supply bottlenecks resulting from a no-deal Brexit could cost the company £60m a day. Watch the full interview here:  
This clip is Brexit in a nutshell: because the referendum didn’t specify what leaving the EU actually meant, there are multiple “versions” of Brexit and all we have are various factions of the Tory party claiming their version is ‘true Brexit’.  
These two disgraces are now arguing for Brexit. Why? Because England voted Leave. The Union in a nutshell. Time to bring Indy home #Indyref2 
This is your brain on Brexit.  
Err ... please tell me who died in order to ensure that massive and damaging constitutional change could be forced upon us following a wafer thin win in an advisory, gerrymandered referendum

Brexit angst: Cadbury is stockpiling chocolate  via @ReutersTV 
If nothing else, I think we are learning just how incredibly excited JRM is to make a financial killing off the chaos he's backed, if can get Brexit to happen.  
You do what is right for the country first and foremost. That means stopping Brexit @johnmcdonnellMP. If the far right and UKIP numpties want to fight then so be it. You don’t appease them and back down. @UKLabour continue to act like cowards on Brexit.  
Dear Remain MPs, Remain “Lords”,  “People’s Vote” supporters etcPlease watch this video and tell us how you can possibly, with a clear conscience, do what you are doing to wreck Brexit. As Cameron said, the referendum was OUR decision not yours.  
2. Such sacrifice! Such selflessness!Truly Jacob Rees Mogg is the Moses of Brexit, leading his people to the Promised Land while doomed never to set foot in it himself.What an inspirational figure he is. 
Jaguar Land Rover says Brexit could cost 'tens of thousands' of jobs in stark warning by car giant. Ralf Speth said he had no idea whether his plants would be able to operate after Britain leaves the EU  
“No one benefits from Brexit, hard or not” - Jaguar CEO Dr Ralf Speth.MPs need to stop putting jobs at risk, act in the national interest and #StopBrexit. 
It's taken Boris Johnson over two years to admit what 16million of us knew before the referendum even took place!The real question is: what would we do if he moooved to Remain and ousted Theresa May? Curd we support him?  
1. Despite the fact that Jacob Rees Mogg now assures us that Brexit will boost the U.K. economy by £1trillion, he declines to reap the rewards of his hard labour, taking his own business instead to Ireland where it will continue to toil ‘neath the yoke of EU over-regulation. 
Dominic Raab has been reprimanded by Michel Barnier after the EU’s chief negotiator discovered the British government had written to the 27 other member states asking for side negotiations on transport in the event of a no-deal Brexit  
“We must appease the far right” is perhaps the worst argument for going ahead with Brexit, though “the referendum result is decisive, permanent & binds all of us forever” gives it a run for its money.  
The money being burned on the altar of Brexit could have solved most of this country's problems.Upwards of £100bn. Poverty could have been virtually eradicated. The NHS revitalised.But both Tories and Labour choose to do this instead. 
As others have said, the ConLab Brexit is doing UKIP's work for them and making it redundant. 
Catching up with what’s happened in British politics at the end of any given day turned into a theatre of the absurd some time ago. Today, we seem to be in the throes of the amateur circus. #Brexit #CompleteGuide 
We all know now that the referendum was held before any of us properly understood the consequences.Asking the people again after we do know the facts is NOT disrespecting the initial result. However, not holding a  #PeoplesVote would be the ultimate disrespectful act.

UK Civil Aviation Authority response to Sky News aviation & Brexit story: #Brexit #Pilots #UKAviation 
I have detected a small flaw in the Cadbury's hard #Brexit narrative. Cadbury moved much of its production to Poland in 2012. We gave them an EU grant to do it. Please don't tell the leave voters 
I could post a picture of Elvis Presley riding past my house on a motorised toilet & I’d still get the same replies.“I’ve voted Labour for 784 years but Corbyn...#FBPE”“Corbyn must stop Brexit #FBPE”“CORBIN (sic) TORY BREXIT ENABLER #CULT”Some people are very impatient. 
Another sobering dose of #Brexit reality.The prospect of leaving the EU is already causing huge damage to UK exporters.Yet more evidence of why #Labour must oppose Brexit in any form and back a #PeoplesVote. 
He closes saying “we’re keeping all options open including a People’s Vote” but fails to make clear that the referendum itself was based on lies and cheating. Support a second referendum or not, you can’t say ‘maybe’. This pandering to party politics is getting ridiculous. 
Just opened this Brexit leaflet. It could been written word for word by any number of Brexiteer Conservative MPs. In fact it is being handed out at the #TUC18 conference by the "Communist Party of Britain Marxist-Leninist". 
Women for a People’s Vote is the most elitist Remainer campaign yet. It erases the millions of women, and men, who voted for Brexit and who expect Brexit to happen. It is anti-democracy dressed up as feminism, says @Ella_M_Whelan 
.@johnmcdonnellMP says we should respect the result of a referendum that was won by breaking the law. Great look for the party meant to be in opposition. @UKLabour 
This country is being taken over by UKIP BECAUSE we have NO credible opposition. To electoral fraud, foreign manipulation, illegal data sharing, illegal targeted advertising and a #Brexit pushed by the furthest right across the globe. Stopping Brexit stops facism #remain 
And this my friends, is how history will remember #Brexit and its creators. May we never forget. #PostModernistBrexit 
M'colleague @JohnGPeet and I just spent two days talking Brexit with top Brussels figures. Some takeaways: the crunch will come in November, not at Salzburg on 20.9; Chequers is welcome but very far from acceptable; appealing to the EU27 over Barnier's head is pointless. 
BBC news & politics reporting on this story today can only lead to one conclusion: you’re actively promoting no deal Brexit. Are you working directly on behalf of ERG now? Please explain how this is  not a fundamental breach of BBC charter @franunsworth ? 
Hey @Jacob_Rees_Mogg it looks like you are too frightened to debate with @Andrew_Adonis. All bluster and no balls? Or is it just that you know he'll rip through all your falsehoods and expose you as nothing but a cheap purveyor of #brexit bullshit?#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
The irony that nobody in 2016 said Brexit would literally *destroy* the UK, but people still think Remain exaggerated the damage.But when Brexit results in Northern Ireland leaving the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom, that's what will have happened. 
Romania will have a referendum to change the constitutional meaning of family from a union between "spouses" to one between "a man and a woman" — which would effectively ban same-sex marriage.  
Granite Brexit needed.  
Once again @johnmcdonnellMP no supporter of democracy can respect a referendum result that was delivered through subterfuge and criminal enterprise; anyone doing so is complicit.  
Lord Hain - The #Brexiteers have no plan for their cherished #brexit.. the govt admits we've no idea where we're going but we're going there anyway. Thankfully the trade unions & others are providing a lead to rescue the country from this madness by demanding a #PeoplesVote. 
Is it just me or are the wheels on the Brexit bus coming off and hurtling in all directions?#peoplesvote 
Oh dear:“Dominic Raab has been reprimanded by Michel Barnier after the EU’s chief negotiator discovered the British government had written to the 27 other member states asking for side negotiations on transport in the event of a no-deal Brexit.”  
We should not fear a Brexit on WTO rules. #ChuckChequers 
Well why dont we just revert to the status quo and stay in the EU as the #Brexiteers plans are even worse than Chequers...BBC News - Boris Johnson says May's Brexit plan 'worse than status quo'  
FWIW I think @johnmcdonnellMP is absolutely correct to say putting EU membership back to people will increase support for UKIP/ far-right.It’s a very valid concern.My simple contention is the consequences of Brexit will fuel support for UKIP and the far-right *much more.* 
.@johnmcdonnellMP claims that Labour can negotiate a Brexit deal that will leave the UK economically *better off* than we are in the EU.Labour leadership team are just as bad as the bullshitting ERG spivs in the Tory Party.FFS. What a time to be alive....

Forgets to mention they were 'Economists for Brexit' with a new name, this is depressingly corrupt from the BBC. 
Food prices increased by 15% when we joined the EU and so will drop when we leave. Tariffs on EU food will have to be absorbed by EU producers due to competition , food prices will fall after Brexit. 
You have position a, you have position b.It sounds reasonable to find a “British compromise.”But we still don’t get the core contradiction of Brexit: you can’t keep the benefits and not follow the rules.If we’re not prepared to follow the rules, we can’t have the benefits.

My contribution to #Orban day at the European Parliament where the Hungarian PM told me: “We would like to have a fair #Brexit because we love the British and we always cooperated well and you deserve a good deal, a fair deal.”  
Superb from @JohnJCrace - "Patrick Minford is a man who has made a career out of being wrong about nearly everything, and he wasn’t about to break the habit of a lifetime." 
Just like Trump, Rees-Mogg pours out the lies knowing that the #Brexit support base will lap them up and will remain blissfully ignorant of our careful refutations. As Arendt made clear, when lies prevail democracy is unlikely to survive. Rees-Mogg is at war with democracy.

Every other news outlet has been leading with the scathing Brexit comments made 5 hours ago by JLR’s Speth on damage to U.K. auto manufacturers - that could cost JLR alone £1.1 billion. But BBC have decided this statement by CEO of UKs largest carmaker isn’t newsworthy...

We essentially have UKIP in power under the name, Conservatives. And you are supporting them.There is no compromise on Brexit. It is either destroy our country and hand it to the rich & the far right. Or save it and work to make the country provide opportunity to the poor.

James Brien's attempt to imagine how Jacob Rees-Mogg came to claim Brexit would boost the economy by £1trillion is hilarious.@mrjamesob 
Nobody voted for job losses in 2016. This is why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. Please RT:  
To be clear: The most binding bit of the Brexit treaty will be the bit on Northern Ireland. The binding but more wishy-washy part will be the future trading relationship.Both will involve major losses of sovereignty (territorial & legal) compared to our current position. 
'No deal' Brexit could cost £60m a day, Jaguar boss warns   
Worryingly for May, he adds that it's cheaper to make cars in Slovakia than it currently is in Britain. “What decisions will we be forced to make, if Brexit means not merely that costs go up, but that we cannot physically build cars on time and on budget in the UK?”

Very good to see that Leo Varadkar is now calling openly and explicitly for an #EEA-based Brexit. He is yet another key decision-maker who is urging the govt and the front bench of my own party to recognise that this has always been the only viable option.  
LOL I can't understand why the Brexit lot who have been shouting about subverting democracy for two years aren't demanding a second referendum upon learning their side subverted democracy.  
With only weeks to go until a Brexit deal has to be agreed, no answers from the Chancellor today on what a no deal Brexit would mean for jobs, wages and living standards.I call on him to show some leadership and make it clear to his colleagues he will not accept a no deal.

Sudden and remarkable change in tone from the former A-team of Brexit cheerleaders. Liam Fox warns against "irrational positivity," while Boris Johnson describes the govt's plans as “substantially worse than the status quo.” They do say rats are first to abandon a sinking ship. 
It's your outspoken position on this that made me fall in love with you in 2015. I was a die hard Corbynista.But given that the EU is the best safeguard we have against this, your approach to Brexit is very disappointing. 
Is that the same Mark Carney who stabilised the economy straight after the EU referendum when the Brexters were in stunned shock some of them not wanting to win bc they knew Brexit is a national catastrophe!

As the 2nd poorest region in northern Europe, and one of the 50 poorest regions on the entire continent, Cornwall decided to turn its back on vital EU funding by voting for Brexit. The funding will not be replaced, because a post-Brexit UK will be too poor 
We agree with @DrPhillipLeeMP - we should have a say on the final Brexit deal to save UK healthcare. If you agree too, show your support at the People's Vote for the NHS rally on Saturday!  
Cornwall is the second poorest region in all of Northern Europe and receives more economic aid from the EU than any other part of the UK. And yet, 56.5% of voters in Cornwall voted for Brexit.

Someone who understands economics and is in favour of Brexit? Right come on all of you, line up!

Not a single person voted for no deal Brexit. Before vote, Brexiters filled the airwaves with promises of the easiest deal in history, EU needing us more than we need them, eating cake and no downside just a considerable upside.They are liars and frauds. They have no mandate. 
I'm definitely a Brexiteer and we need to get on with the job. Brexit has been delayed for too long and the #Chequers deal isn't right for London, therefore it's not right for me.#ImBackingBoff

We need prominent Tory Brexiteers doing less talking & start actively challenging PM May on the Chequers plan. We know the plan cannot pass in its present form unless it is propped up by Labour & Libdems. Rees-Mogg & co must step it up now & push for a no deal Brexit on WTO rules

More and more people have had enough of Jacob Rees-Mogg and the Westminster political games he and his colleagues are playing, which is why so many are demanding a People’s Vote on the Brexit deal. (4/4) 
Whether it is Theresa May’s car crash Brexit, or Jacob Rees-Mogg’s disastrous no deal Brexit, one thing we know about Brexit is that it is an unholy mess and the gap between what we were promised and the best we can hope for is getting wider every day. (3)

Almost 200k people signed the petition: Rescind Art.50 if Vote Leave has broken Electoral Laws regarding 2016 referendum Very few MPs showed up to the debate yesterday, but many who did had much to say. Here are a few of my favourite quotes. 1/@UKEUchallenge @BremainInSpain 
How Putin's military aggression against Ukraine has completely lost him soft power in that country: 67 (!!!!) of Ukrainians would vote for NATO membership in a referendum, up from 20% a decade ago  
The British Public would not accept a soft Brexit deal.  
Before Brexit slithered into view, there was no new money for anything.Now the government is finding tens, even hundreds of billions of pounds to guard against the impact of this thing they are choosing to do.Anyone else annoyed by that? 
Last week 13 MEPs from different political groups visited and asked for the release of our former Catalan MEPs @raulromeva and @junqueras, who are in jail for organizing a referendum. Europe is part of the solution! #Diada2018

The @Econs4FreeTrade report published today summarises how Brexit on WTO terms would "bring us the full gains from Brexit...faster with no burdensome transition period and tariff revenues from the EU, provide an additional fillip on top."  
Is is beginning to emerge that there is something wrong with the count in the 2016 referendum - see Facts Central @DelvingHaylee 
Follow @DelvingHaylee on deepening suspicions about the reliability of the 2016 referendum. Things get worse and worse with this farrago - it is scarcely credible that we should even be wondering whether this happened. 
Apparently Brexiter Peter Lilley is a director of the company involved in the referendum count. But - er - these things don't happen in the UK, so ignore any silly conspiracy theories about yet more interference: the evidence already proven for crimes & interference is enough.

Brexit is to do with freedom. For instance, the right to speak freely - the right to a trial the outcome of which has not been decided before it started. Remain will never understand this, most never having experienced it so they choose to live with the EU foot on their necks !

Another reason I suspect why Rees-Mogg refuses to debate Brexit with me again

According to Economists for Free Trade's press release, their report "concludes that the best way of delivering a “Clean Brexit” is to leave under a World Trade Deal covered by WTO rules."There is no such thing as a World Trade Deal.

Nope, that’s a myth. Immediately after 2016 vote, we wrote a plan for UK-EU science after Brexit. Gave it to govt.Problem is that the Brexit priesthood *still* can’t agree on their own plan after 2 years. They trashed Chequers, wrote an alternative, then shelved it. Pathetic.  
More propaganda tosh from a lefty remain title. Please admit it was our money in the first place and the #EU even has the temerity to tell us how to spend their supposed largess. #Brexit cannot come soon enough!  
 WATCH: I spoke to @jonsnowC4 at @Channel4News about why we should #ChuckChequers. I want the best #Brexit deal for the U.K. We shouldn’t have a common EU rule book or be subject to European judges. Rather let’s have a Canada style free trade agreement.

@DamianCollins Damian , can your fake news committee deal with this untrue statement from Mogg, which is motivated by his plan to make money for Somerset Capital from “brexit” . This might also constitute fraud so perhaps the Parliamentary Commissioner should investigate Mogg ? 
The EU is like a street full of neighbours all with similar interests. Post #Brexit the UK will be oddball behind twitching curtains mistrusting everything that goes on in the street and uninvited to any of the parties. 
If you were ever in doubt about the conspiracy between the "brexit means brexit" May and the EU, ask yourselves this question. Why is the EU desperately fighting to keep May in office? Why should they care what happens to her. £40 billion might give you a clue. 
“Cardiff University should lead the way in Wales in fighting for people having an informed vote on the final Brexit Deal”.Excellent to see staff are agreeing with students on the urgency of the need for a #PeoplesVote  
And the greatest inequality (see below).Pulling out of the EU removes the few safety nets that we do have... our current govt is way more neoliberal than the EU and yearning to be more so. Brexit = disaster capitalism & more inequality.  
A reminder reading the incredible growth forecasts of Rees-Mogg's Brexity economist friends:1 They already got their post-referendum forecast wrong (h/t @ChrisGiles_)2 Their man Minford forecast that the minimum wage would mean millions of jobs lost 
BBC News - Brexit worker issues 'could shut offshore platforms' . More Brexit fallout. Watch the Pump prices rise even more. Stop Brexit. #FBPE 
This Evil Lefty Labour Party is a joke. They are not a party in waiting, but a party of Anti-Semitic Marxist Loonies. They still deny their obvious racial faults, and have no clue whatsoever on Brexit. Corbyn, McDonnell, Abbott, all terrorist sympathisers, a party of pure Evil. 
I listed 72 Tory MPs who had received rental incomes in excess of £10,000 & voted against the Labour amendment compelling landlords to make homes "fit for human habitation". You're one of them. As with Brexit, you could have avoided embarrassment here by finding out the facts.

Absolutely correct @UKLabour have left all options on the table when it comes to #Brexit.Very clear what Labour expect from negotiations.Labour are not in power. Labour are not negotiating. We'll reject 'no deal'. The onus is on @Theresa_May. Let's see 'the deal'.#r4today 
Blimey, interviewer on @BBCr4today trying to pin John McDonnell down on a #PeoplesVote! He evades cos he wants a GE in preference.ME: You can't decide #Brexit in a multi issue GE + NHS, educ, econ.It must be a Binary #FinalSay with a #Remain option. 
Other EU countries don’t have such wild inequality. Brexit was always a red herring that will only lead to more irresponsible economics.  
I’d rather have a general election than a second referendum says @johnmcdonnellMP and so say all of us #r4today #TUC150 
John McDonnell saying he ‘doesn’t want to let the government off the hook’ by backing a second #Brexit vote. Wants a general election. But how? Will 100+ Tories vote for a general election? Really struggling to see that 
'I don't think Theresa May's #Brexit deal stacks up.'Labour's @johnmcdonnellMP says the prime minister's EU exit plan doesn't meet the criteria needed for a good deal and has called for a general election.Read the latest Brexit developments here:  
In fact, those of us who do want a fully renationalised NHS see Brexit as an urgent threat. It’s a catalyst for current Tory government privatisation trends - especially via a trade deal with Trump, which would be loaded with big US healthcare & insurance corps wanting in. 
I am about to go on @NickFerrariLBC to reissue my challenge to Mr Rees-Mogg to debate Brexit with me. Never in the history of English chivalry has a gentleman behaved with such cowardice as Mr Rees-Mogg 
Whenever Rees-Mogg bangs on about how jolly it will be after Brexit I'm just glad I learned how to trap and field dress a squirrel for the pot 
Gerrymandering of election boundaries will be this generation’s poll tax, along with the planned cluster-bomb that is a No Deal Brexit. 
So #BrexitHeavies. You're the ones who wanted a specified Out Date. We have less than 200 days till that date. You don't like anyone else's Brexit ideas. You've had 15 months to come up with your own plan for how it'll work. Where the hell is it? 
Mark, you can’t be serious. That’s the ‘Brexit dividend’ myth.Our net contribution is 0.5% GDP. Just the vote to leave has cost 2% GDP growth. It’s a loss. Pulling the plug on the Single Market (to get at the 0.5%) makes the loss bigger.And the fallen £ has hit the NHS too. 
BREAKING NEWS: @Lord_Sugar has become so angry watching @GMB this morning he wants to call in & rant about Brexit & anti-semitism in the Labour Party. So we’re getting him on the phone now... could be lively.  
Forget the EEA, FTA and the FCA, the big Brexit plan is KCACO - does the govt really have that much choice ....   
A shibboleth is not, as Mr Blunt implies, a mirage or false argument. It is a password, a marker of culturally distinct groups, usually to self-identify. In that sense I am a shibboleth, though not as he intends it. The term can also mean ‘coming to kick Brexit’s sorry ass’  
I have extraordinary intelligence that Mr Rees-Mogg has refused my challenge to a ‘no deal Brexit’ duel on @NickFerrariLBCThis must be a calligraphic error. Gentlemen never refuse duels on matters of principle & honour, unless they fear humiliation. I am reissuing my challenge! 
Remember, Brexit is not an act of God, people voted for it. People who hate foreigners like me so much, they don't care, if your family goes without food or meds, as long as they get EU27 citizen out. What are you going to say to them? #FBPE

And, sadly, enabled by a Labour leader who, unfathomably, seems to believe Brexit is a desirable stepping stone toward the UK becoming a socialist paradise on earth. 
How can a democratic #PeoplesVote undermine democracy? If the final deal is what you voted for, vote for it, if it isn't, don't vote for it. Don't tell me this will cause deep divisions. The 2016 referendum result, achieved by cheating and breaking the law has already done that.

.@Econs4FreeTrade chair Patrick Minford: Why a World Trade Deal – Brexit on WTO terms – would be highly advantageous  
Column, on the audience that really matters in Brexit battle to come - the people who haven't been paying attention.   
Govt proposals for the £39bn Withdrawal Agreement are totally unacceptable without simultaneous EU agreement to a Canada+++ Free Trade Agreement . See why ⁦@RobDotHutton⁩ below. Brexit on WTO Terms we be much better.   
Shackling the UK to supremacy of EU law & purposive jurisdiction of the ECJ, via the mooted Withdrawal Agreement & any backstop in it, would not be recognisable as Brexit, would be an unacceptable subordinate status & huge risk to a raft of industries.  
While politicians are causing Brexit chaos, communities are fighting to keep their schools open. Multi-academy trusts are ripping off our schools. There is no way for failed academies to come back under local authority control. #GMB #r4today #skynews #LBC

Just gone from reading last night’s HOC debate - Rees Mogg, Cash , Redwood et al denouncing  their own Government’s #Brexit plans in dramatic language - to reading @ProfTomkins denouncing @ScotGov for not supporting that Government to deliver a “successful #Brexit”.    Bizarre..

Seems like this idea has some support.How about a sit in around Parliament after the October brexit march? One million EU umbrellas should be hard to move on.  
Brexit is a dystopian nightmare, the characters gargoyles from a political pantomime which has morphed into farce. Intoxicated by constant attention they feed the media with their risible fantasies. The world watches and is lost for words. ⁦  
By the way @Asamoh_ , a referendum is coming in 2020 whose major highlights include change of governance structure and increasing allocation to counties. Guess who will oppose? It is the reason why Ekuru is preparing ground for him. 
I totally get it.   What Redwood absolutely fails to tell anyone is what exactly no-deal Brexit means and he also fails to tell them that their jobs will likely be lost.   Maybe he hasn't grasped the damage he is doing to the country? 
Someone get this man a job in the Brexit department.  
The ERG Brexit fanatics won’t come up with a plan because they already have one. It’s along the lines of all their previous ones, it’s make up a load of bullshit, lie through their teeth, attack at every opportunity and do whatever it takes to get their own way regardless 
Sadly, you could almost count the members who bothered to attend on one hand. This & the dismissive closing statement by #Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris, which can be summed up in 5 words: 'you lost get over it,' was in itself a telling example of the state of UK democracy.

Let us be clear. The problems faced, in Parliament, the Establishment, the EU, the Media all leads back to one date. 23rd June 2016. The result of a referendum. A decision given to the people by Parliament. Losers who cannot accept losing and are using vast sums to overturn.

Some of the damage will take a long time to put right, and some of it may never be. Nixing Brexit is the only chance of any dividend though. The alternative is the current status quo. More of the shitty same, and worse. Much worse. 18/18 
The #RemainDividend is not a return to the status quo before the referendum. We’d have the same deal with the EU, but the Government could never again have the shitty deal it had with the population, and still has now. 17/

'Mobilise!' Trade unionists threaten to STRIKE to block no-deal Brexit  You’re not fighting the government now, you’re fighting the people - don’t for one moment think that you’re going to win... when unions fight the people...who wins?? The people 
Brexit only stops if people vote to stop it. Therefore Brexit only stops if it is the express will of the British people to change the course that was set by the 2016 referendum.Seeking to deny us the chance to express our updated wishes is fundamentally anti-democratic. 
Despite knowing that the Leave campaign had cheated and committed electoral fraud @theresa_may she still invoked A50 on a referendum that was won on such a narrow majority. We need a #PeoplesVote to right the wrongs of the cheats in Leave campaign now we know the facts.

idk man could have probably used something like this during the referendum  
On one side of Brexit we have technical questions we cannot solve, and on the other side we have political problems we refuse to solve. 
Remember, folks: Labour guarantee the rights of all EU nationals (and, reciprocally, that means all UK nationals living in the EU). One of the most disgusting things I have witnessed in the current Brexit debacle is the treatment of wonderful human beings who've made lives here.  
When they thought they were going to win, Leave promised "£350m a week for the NHS", "no downside only upside" and "free access to the single market". When they won, they started campaigning for another Brexit, writes everyone.  
Agree with this, with the addition that not only was the selling lousy (you need us more than we need you), so was the substance (cake or unrealistic). Through the Brexit process UK Gov has shown total lack of understanding of the EU.  
Guy Verhofstadt has to be one of the most annoying people in the World.He thinks that if Brexit ends in Chaos that people throughout Europe will start to love the EU.It’s my contention that the majority of ppl living under EUrule (yes rule) already hate the EU.Guy shut up.  
.@patmcfaddenmp was the MP responsible for asking the police to investigate Steve Baker. He is now sitting in the office responsible for undertaking the Brexit process. Interesting.  
A clear warning: all main parties in Sweden’s election ended up taking a hard line on immigration. Nearly a fifth of voters chose a party with neo-Nazi roots. Similar sentiment drove our #Brexit vote. Europe must respond with an effective new internal & external migration policy  
So, if Boris becomes PM:He will cut taxesHe will scrap HS2He will get a real Brexit dealHe will not virtue signalAs a bonus, 12 Remainers who want to stop #brexit against their own manifesto and party policy will leave.Where do I sign? 
This is a reminder to Britain that Steve Baker MP is the same MP who suggested Vote Leave ‘spend as much as money as is necessary’ during the referendum by creating ‘separate legal entities’. This is exactly what Vote Leave did. Vote Leave was found guilty for it. #criminals

And did Brexit even get a mention? Or schools hospitals crime transport.  
What will Britain's borders look like after #Brexit? Courier Ciaran Donovan says they will "gridlock from day one". @Stone_SkyNews has travelled to the Swiss-EU border to see what @theresa_may's Chequers plan could deliver. Read his experience here:  
Brexit began when Cameron took the Tories out of the European People's Party group (EPP) in the EU parliament. Since then they've been aligned with racists, nationalists and fascists.Tories enter into alliance with Swedish far-right in EU Parliament  
If the ERG and the super hard brexity backbenchers are so clever why have they not published a viable alternative plan. I am still none the wiser of a single brexit benefit.  Anybody heard of any? Only one thing to do #peoplesvote #FinalSayForAll #FBPE 
A question the PM should ask herself; “If there was a general election today are you confident the electorate would vote for a party with your Brexit policy?” If she answers that question honestly, she’d change tact and #ChuckChequers#StandUp4Brexit 
Thank you @DeborahMeaden for the RT @myeuuk !It’s time to make the case for the option to stay in the EU + get it on the ballot paper of a #peoplesvote before MPs ignore the shift in supportfor the EU + finagle through a Brexit people don’t want @BestForBritain #finalsay 
This guy bankrolled Jacob Ress-Moggs investment company, that now has interests in Russia. You are being played. #brexit Hedge funds wager £3bn on the pound plunging this year amid no deal Brexit fears in the City  via @telebusiness 
Thank you members of the #EU Council Working Group Art 50 for visiting the port of Rotterdam to see the impact of Brexit on customs and just in time roll on roll off transports of vegetables. We keep working for a timely and balanced deal but have to prepare for everything.  
“Rescind Art.50 if Vote Leave has broken Electoral Laws regarding 2016 referendum”.Disgusted to see just how little interest there is in this in HoC this evening.  
90% of global economic growth is OUTSIDE the EU.82% of the World's GDP is OUTSIDE the EU27.60% of the UK's exports go to Non-EU countries (or thereabouts).Sort of puts it all into perspective, does it not?#Brelease, not Brexit.  
Conversely, a bashing of Tory Brexit by Parliament followed by a bashing by the public could set up an election beautifully for Labour. It’s a gift.  
It was never going to be any good having a remainer in charge of Brexit. 
.@The_TUC policy on #Brexit has moved forward today. Motion passed at #TUC150 says TUC will only support leaving EU if deal, "preserves frictionless trade with Europe"Chequers pulls us out of the customs union, so frictionless trade impossible. One step closer to a #PeoplesVote 
More proof that @Conservatives are lurching 2wards the far-right. I always said it #brexit is a far-right coup    #StopBrexit @BrexitBin @acgrayling @tempora_magda @jphcoleman @Women_4_Europe @voiceseurope @emmyzen 
I was, and continue to, argue that during the referendum, nobody voted to be poorer.  During that time in 2016 the Remain campaign said a lot of things, which as far as I can see are coming true, even though Brexit still hasn't happened.   
May, Gove, Johnson, Stuart..... They all knew, all of them. They are all complicit in the #BrexitScam 
Here's @JohnSwinney on how the Tories are so divided on Brexit, they're going to drag the whole country down with them. Only the SNP is standing up for Scotland, join us today:  
You guys are monitoring whatsapp groups? Talking about a fuckin referendum can make you land in jail and you see Hindus asking for Hindu rashtra openly, politicians giving warm welcome to those who lynch people to death. The law is different for Hindus and Sikhs?  
I'm beginning to feel like peaceful civil disorder against this Government if it enacts brexit laws that bear no relationship to anything in the referendum and clearly don't follow the current national interest or sentiment.Anyone with me? 
I'll be on @LBC for an entire hour from 8, talking about how dreadfully the Tories have negotiated Brexit and why the electorate should have a Final Say through a referendum. Please call in and join the debate! 
Brexit is a version of Jack and the Beanstalk in which Union Jack trades his family’s economic well-being for “magic” beans that turn out to be just beans after all. He then spends his days screaming at his mother for not believing hard enough. 
There are v few good things to have come from the #Brexit vote, but the @Wooferendum campaign is among the best.Completely off-the-wall & very British, it is perhaps the perfect antidote to the absurd & increasingly surreal situation we find ourselves in 
Boris Johnson, JRM, Peter Bone, and any other like wise Brexit Tories need to get in there and, DRAIN THE SWAMP. These are true champions of Brexit and with the extra clout of Nigel Farage its time to get rid of May and her cronies. Do it now before it's to late for your Country.

Verhofstadt: Brexit ‘Chaos’ Will Make People Like the EU Again 
How do you like your Brexit? 
Please don't call it a people's vote, call it what it is. A second referendum for those who feel hurt they lost the first one and are whingeing like babies instead of remaining in the EU, ie moving. 
Hey Brexit Fan Boy @PiersMorgan you keep giving us lectures about democracy every morning so why dont you care about Vote Leave's criminal overspending which bought them extra unfair access to Voters plus the attacks & massive funding from a hostile foreign power? @SusannaReid100 
HAPPY NATIONAL DAY, GIBRALTAR! Today 10 Sept commemorates the day in 1967 when the Gibraltar Sovereignty Referendum returned a vote of 99.64% to stay British, rather than come under the ontrol of Spain.

It's 200 days until Brexit. With the government making a mess of the negotiations, they want Parliament to sign off whatever rubbish fudge they come back with. With no detail of future trade deals it would be a dangerous step into the unknown. #PeoplesVote #ExitFromBrexit 
What will we tell future generations about #Brexit? We can either say that we were afraid to speak out, or we can say we had the courage to stand up for what we believed in. #Wales deserves a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Join my campaign, . 
Nobody voted for a TBC Brexit, and a responsible Parliament shouldn’t either. Question is if we have a responsible Parliament.

“I am concerned that after cheating to win a referendum our lies have been exposed and our party might kick us out” says disgraced liar and Russian funded fraud @SteveBakerHW .  A more evil & mendacious bastard you will not find in politics in Britain. 
EU citizens! More far-right lies. We all know the fruit is rotting in the fields and that Britain will starve after #Brexit, largely due to the cheese famine, leading to lack of calcium. 
As I predicted in my last article for the @Telegraph, the #EU is beginning to realise the cost (to them) of not being able to secure a deal with the #UK post #Brexit.As we approach the deadline, the #EU is starting to bend........ 
Shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook welcomes TUC Brexit announcement on “people’s vote” in Commons says...“Every option must be on the table” in a “constitutional crisis” that would be No Deal Brexit...

Here's a short clip of my speech moving the Brexit composite at #TUC150 earlier. The vote we need right now is a general election. @unitetheunion @BrexitCheck 
Pleased to lead the @HoCpetitions debate this afternoon on rescinding #Article50 if Vote Leave broke electoral law. I advocated a #PeoplesVote in Parliament and called for better safeguards governing referendum law:  
Today #TUC150 Congress voted overwhelmingly for the General Council statement on #Brexit. The message to Mrs May is clear: if her deal fails to protect jobs, rights and peace in Ireland our movement will demand a popular vote on the terms of the deal:  
In the Times;"Guy Verhofstadt, who supports a United States of Europe, has suggested that political chaos over Brexit is now one the most compelling arguments for the EU.""We see the difficulties, the chaos created by Great Britain’s exit.”He's as pissed as Juncker  
Astonishing that the Chequers Proposal is routinely described as 'pragmatic' when it entails a largely service-based economy willingly accepting reduced access to a market with which it has a £28 billion services trade surplus [2017]. Brexit seems to have redefined pragmatism. 
The Grand National was first run in 1839, loooooonnnnngggg before the EU, but y'know Brexit will see an end to it anyway. I'm getting so bloody fed up by how pathetic this is all becoming now...

Joan, Gavin and now Rosie -all fight hard for their areas. All marginal seats. All standing up for what they believe. And still nothing on Brexit from these people. Every member can either choose to be part of change or part of chaos for Britain. Only one brings social justice.

How can our party cover up the embarrassment that @theresa_may creates? She is dragging the UK over a cliff. #brexit should be cancelled or the UK will lose both Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
After comparing May’s Brexit plan to wearing a 'suicide vest', Boris Johnson is devastated to find out that making terrorism metaphors have gained him press attention again.  
Don't say "People's Vote" when you mean "second referendum" and reversing Brexit. 
This woman wants #brexit as do millions of others. You do NOT speak for us. We voted democratically and you can stick your #stupipeoplesvote where the sun doesn't shine. 
Make sure you ask (and get answers) why they have bottled out publishing their own Brexit plan. And make sure you find out what is in it.  
A #Brexit thought 200 days out. Scots voted four years ago & were promised a near 'federal state' by Gordon Brown. It still hasnt arrived & no plan was unveiled. Why dont we stop Brexit until we work out that near 'federal state'? Surely Scotland's vote should be enacted first?

The European Union is ready to strike a Brexit deal within 6 to 8 weeks, chief negotiator Michel Barnier has declared, sending the pound soaring.#EU #Brexit 
The EU’s Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told a forum in Slovenia on Monday that a divorce deal with Britain could be agreed in six to eight weeks if negotiators are realistic in their demands. By which he means if the UK concedes to EU demands..  
Former Defence Minister Guto Bebb U-turned to back a second referendum less than three weeks after promising his constituents to "be a voice for those who accept that we are leaving the EU"

I'm fed up with people saying Corbyn is powerless over #Brexit because he isn't in government. He's supposed to be in opposition, which he isn't. Have we ever needed an opposition more then we do now? @UKLabour leaving us wanting, playing disingenuous games with their 7 tests. 
Barnier says agreement on #Brexit possible by early November 
No, it was written before Brexit! It's about climate change denial. So I made up a Captain sailing a boat into disaster, despite repeated warnings!  
One thing that really annoys me about the current ‘debate’ is that it’s seen to be ‘centrist’ to oppose Brexit. It really isn’t: there are solid left-wing reasons to oppose Brexit (and, to be fair, some strong right-wing reasons too). I oppose from the left not the centre! 
Mark Serwotka: The TUC is not with Chuka Umunna. But it is not with Jacob Rees-Mogg either.I want a vote for workers’ rights, to scrap austerity and to renationalise all services.The TUC should accept the referendum result but insist on a general election. #Brexit #TUC18 
People often say "Just get on with it" when it comes to Brexit. I think that should be the slogan during the #PeoplesVote.Isn't it time we actually get on with fixing the country, rather than spending the next 30 years dealing with Brexit?! 
Brexit has amazingly managed to make the needs of hedge fund managers the biggest political imperative of our times   
Brexit deal 'possible' in 6-8 weeks if sides 'realistic' - Barnier  
Just landed in Dublin for an important set of Brexit meetings today & tomorrow with government ministers, politicians & businesses. Maintaining the solemn commitment to no hard border & North/South cooperation is a must. 
Hopefully one day kids will read in their history books about Britain’s brush with fascism and how the decent folk rose up and defeated the threat that was #Brexit.#PeoplesVote 
Here's Flaky Fox who said Brexit was a doddle, we'd all be better off. Is there a mechanism to throw him out of office, ban him from any political capacity again? No, but as an independent nation he'd remain a pain to London society not us.

There isn’t  any #Brexit worth pursuing! Time to ditch Corbyn or ditch Labour if you are a #Remainer #Brexit is a crime scene #ParliamentDoYourJob and #RescindA50 
No doubt that when London’s economy starts to fail due to the inability in being able to travel freely and operate within it due to the elite capture utopian dream The same individuals will blame everything and anything but themselves including #brexit  
Brexiters crumbling & have lost ALL credibility now that they are unable to publish THEIR BREXIT plan- The inference is they dont have a cohesive position-all they can do is whip up negativity round any plan that looks like a soft Brexit or rubbish remainer views as Project Fear’ 
Lots of #Americans didnt know #Obamacare is same as #ACA.They prefer #ACA but voted against Obamacare.Lots of British who voted for #Brexit later on went to check out what it really means on Google,now they're  against it?Do #Nigerians really know what restructuring entails?? 
Another Brexit Bunch strategy for surviving the shambles they have created. Where are you going to put your £3billion ...?   
In the last few days, Boris Johnson and his band of Brexiteer supporters have steadfastly refused to accept any responsibility for the unfolding chaos they have visited upon Britain. Brexit is a project by the elites for the elites. My @Independent column: 
What about a Wales-wide ratification referendum campaign - similar to what we had in 1997 & in 2011, similar to what I suggested to @fmwales we should set up ahead of the 2016 referendum? It’s not too late to prevent the wrecking (again) of our economy.  
'This absurd sabre-rattling against their own government only serves to underline once again that there is no version of Brexit with enough support to get through Parliament.'The Tory party is tearing itself apart! The only way out is a #PeoplesVote ! 
Ministers refused to disclose if they've taken legal advice on holding fresh referendum on final deal. In response to a request for information, DExEU said revealing such detail would harm UK’s negotiating position. So much for freedom of information!

Brexit be like ...   
MUST-WATCH: Liam Fox used to say striking a trade deal with the EU would be 'the easiest FTA in the history of mankind'. Now he's admitting Brexit will be bad for Britain. This is why we need a #PeoplesVote to sort out this mess. Please RT: 
In what way, shape or form has Boris Johnson earned this? Was it his constant lies over Brexit? Was it the inconsistency and insincerity of his positions? His dog-whistle racism and xenophobia? Are those what earned him the shot at the top job?  
.@guyverhofstadt: "We see the difficulties, the chaos created by Brexit. Even the populists do not dare to say that they want to leave the EU.”We voted for our country to be a lab-rat in an insane experiment. I hope other nations learn from our mistake. 
We’ve had a Conservative led govt since 2010. And if £70,000 is loose change down your sofa Arron I would suggest you may not be the typical Brexit voter- but at least we agree the current Brexit plans are a shambles, yes? Would you support a People’s Vote on the final deal?  
If I were a Nat, who would I support in the civil war?The guy who led them to Holyrood majority and a referendum where they narrowly missed?Or the woman who lost the HR majority, was on losing side of Brexit referendum, and lost 21 MP's and 500,000 votes?It's a tricky one.

Has the establishment media in Scotland gone full on dumbed down Fox News? I mean I realise they're all unionists. But when have any of them ever written honestly about Brexit's impact on Scotland. 
Interesting to note Steve Baker’s concern over Chequers Brexit, as broadcast at the top of every news bulletin, is not that it will damage the country, only that it will damage the Tory party.Remember leave voters,#Brexit was never about you. 
Britain remembers when Obama overstepped the mark - threatening that the UK would be at 'back of the queue' for a trade agreement if they voted to #Brexit.That didn't pan out too well for the Remain camp. I suspect his interjections now won't play too well for Democrats either.  
NL Customs says it is prepared for a hard Brexit. Expands capacity at Port of Rotterdam w 30% by March 2019. On Brexit-day, NL will have approx 300 extra customs officials in place (expanding later to 928 extra staff).

Pound Surges After Barnier Says Brexit Deal "Realistic" In 6-8 Weeks  
Last night was shaping up to be a real-time referendum on the Khalil Mack trade — until Aaron Rodgers hobbled out and did his thing. @AlbertBreer's MMQB on the show in Green Bay, and the rest of a wild first Sunday of the NFL season: 
BREAKING: EU Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier says a Brexit deal with the U.K. is “realistic” within 6 to 8 weeks  
Yup, exactly. Brexit at this stage would just be cat-nip to the alt-right. They’d aggressively blame all the economic problems on the EU - and say deregulation, undercutting our neighbours & austerity is the only way forward to re-make Britain.  
Lord Mandelson - Jeremy Corbyn needs to demonstrate his national credentials as a real British leader & standup for the interests of working people over #Brexit & taking the fight on #Brexit to the Tories... but sadly we haven't seen that yet.#peoplesvote #FBPE #PoliticsLive 
People who claim Irish border can be 'frictionless' and 'infrastructure-free' like Switzerland, should watch this.Brexit politicians are lying. Brexit punters should ask themselves: If Brexit politicians are lying about this, what else are they lying about? Clue: everything.  
With strong UK support, #Gibraltar marks last National Day before Brexit  via @GibChronicle 
So he just went with his Brexiteer instincts instead of knowing the facts. BBC pro Brexit bias & inaction since the Referendum campaign is astonishing.  
We know:A) the PM made the leave decision, people didn’t, Parliament didn’t B) the PM’s own lawyers admit she knew the referendum was a cheat and that’s all she used to inform the decision. Let that settle in.  
Fox admits the future for Britain may not be rosy outside of the EU. The end of Brexit is in sight. Brexiteers starting to abandon the reckless vision of stand-alone Britain. Stop Brexit. #FBPE #PeoplesVote 
MANDELSON: Brexit negotiations have been on EU’s terms, Brussels fear PM Boris. Time for a British Leader who will stand up to the European Union!  
Good afternoon @MarcusFysh. It’s me again. Does this, tweeted the day before the referendum, still reflect your thinking? Thanks.  
Opposition to Chequers is growing with former Brexit minister Steve Baker now saying that 80 Tories will fight the government & that May could cause a "catastrophic split" in the party. Time for fresh leadership!Support us at  
Will Chequers opposition from  @SteveBakerHW and his Brexiter party-within-Tory-party hasten departure of @theresa_may, foment break up of Tory party, precipitate EU referendum - or maybe all three?!!!!  
Disappointed to be branded a ‘hard Brexit’ MP by Lord Mandelson who I have a lot of respect for. I voted Remain. I back a deal, no hard NI border, workers’ rights, close trading relationship etc. What’s ‘hard’ about that. This debate has become too polarised #politicslive 
Theresa May is the EU’s Trojan horse. Everything May has done since being PM,supported by the UK establishment has had the aim of ensuring a  real Brexit never happens. That's why May is so terrified of politicians like Boris opposing her RETWEET if you agree#MondayMotivation 
Agree with every wordThank you @DavidLammy for your leadership on fighting Brexit  
Remainers must help young people build a better Britain, not Brexit Britain says @LibbyCherry98 
I will never accept any Brexit that is not full independence. I will not accept any compromise on independence. The chequers plan is a total sellout & is unacceptable. Brexiteers need to stick together & fight for our independence no matter how long it takes. @LeaveMnsLeave 
And while you’re at it, can you explain your thinking on the democratic implications of securing a referendum mandate on one basis and then reinterpreting it after the vote to mean something much narrower and very different? I look forward to your response. Thanks @SteveBakerHW. 
Hi, @SteveBakerHW. You’re in the news demanding a Hard #Brexit. Your briefing before the #EUref considers EFTA/EEA acceptable Brexit outcomes with “advantages and disadvantages” and WTO the “worst case scenario”. Can you explain why you now claim this isn’t “proper #Brexit”? Ta.  
My little sister lives in Italy now. Had a conversation about Brexit at dinner yesterday. Italians are absolutely CLEAR about the fact most of Scotland voted remain & consider us fellow Europeans. I won’t write what they said about the Westminster government... I’m too polite.

Keep seeing ‘but how can Corbyn stop Brexit’.  Well, the obvious thing he could do is fuck off. Let a Remain leader lead a Remain party and it’s 259 votes in a hung Parliament. That’s how. 
Hmm ... So the Rees-Mogg/ERG Brexit plan includes ...》A "Star Wars" style nuclear missile shield》A rapid reaction military force to protect the Falklands and Gibraltar》A refusal to pay our EU bill》Tax cuts for the rich#LeaversAreLoonies 
Just watched @MissEllieMae say #brexit isn’t the most immediate political crisis on #politicslive honestly, where do you start? 
WATCH: @RupaHuq lays out why the Brexit that was promised is not the one that’s being delivered. #PeoplesVote 
UK Brexit Dept rejects a Freedom of Information request from Reuters on whether it has sought legal advice on staging a second referendum, or reversing Article 50,   Says not in the public interest and would weaken UK negotiating position. Preposterous. 
More than 250 members of staff have signed an open letter calling on @cardiffuni to back a referendum on the final terms of #Brexit.They say "rather than accepting Brexit as an inevitability" the university should take a more "pro-actively pro-European stance".  
A grown-up needs to explain facts to the 80 histrionic Tory MPs in full-on #FlounceOutBrexit mode:Chequers is NOT a deal but a negotiation promptThere isn't a parliamentary majority (or public majority) for hard BrexitGrow the f*ck up princess,  you embarrass the UK  
Not everybody in Catalonia is Catalan nor pro independence.The differences now on are:-pro indy do not remove unionist propaganda as Spanish masked remove - pro indy respect pro Spanish-pro indy defend the right of pro Spanish to vote in a referendum 
We might do well to bear in mind that a core aim of Remain campaigners aim has been to foment a political crisis and deliver a referendum out of the back of that. A lot of the present activity - notably the synthetic outrage - seems to have something to do with that. 
Britain would get £80 billion boost from a no deal Brexit, Jacob Rees-Mogg claimsEuropean Research Group study says the UK would get a major economic stimulus from a no-deal Brexit 
Bloody centrists, trying to stop Brexit, so that thousands and thousands of jobs won’t be lost when our economy goes tits-up.Don’t they understand that from the ashes of Brexit Britain, a beautiful socialist Phoenix will rise?!.....  
If the Labour leadership decides to push for a Second referendum, then they will never be trusted again.  
So @SteveBakerHW says on Politics Live there are almost 80 opponents of ChequersThis lunchtime, 25 of them have gone public on the Stand up for Brexit website (it was 20 a week ago) 
So easy to travel across the Schengen countries, and then it's the Eurostar terminal at the Gare du Nord, huge queues, passport checks, security checks, people herded around like animals. The British willingness to surrender liberty in the name of security is troubling.#Brexit 
While @Jacob_Rees_Mogg claims to be happy to stand up for Brexit, he seems curiously reluctant to speak to @JasonJHunter about the issue.It's almost as though he's scared of debating with someone who's infinitely more educated on the subject than he is. 
.@LiamFox In Oct 2016 you said EU27 citizens at home in the UK are “one of [UK’s] main cards” in Brexit negotiations—bargaining chips to deliver that glorious Brexit future. You sold us out, and our lives haven’t been rosy since. Now you say this goes for everyone. Shame on you.  
The campaign for a second referendum gets some important backing - plus Monday's other Brexit headlines  
From Sweden to Brexit, immigration is the issue dividing Europe | Simon Jenkins  
Mays handling of Brexit has either been grossly incompetent or grossly dishonest with the truth being its probably both. How on earth do a relatively intelligent people put up with this? Its lunacy. Every second she's in office is another pint of blood we lose or she gives away. 
“Who is Carrie Symonds?” asks The Sun.Funnily, it doesn’t tell readers that she’s the wife of Sun writer Harry Cole (who’s spent the past few years promoting both Brexit and Boris).

Jacob Rees-Mogg: UK would get £80 billion boost from no deal Brexit  
This is “journalism” at its most embarrassing. How is a man who makes jokes about suicide bombers & whose racist comments have caused a spike in hate crime going to deliver “a more cheerful Brexit”  
Another company thinks Brexit London is a good bet - we're the obvious option  
So the @GuidoFawkes blogger & Sun columnist Harry Cole spent years bigging up #brexit & telling voters to trust Boris Johnson & aiding his march to Prime Minister only to now find out Boris has been having an affair with his wife Carrie Symmonds.Karma. 
The Brexit cheerleaders are desperately trying to row back on all their previous claims...if even they are admitting that it will be bad for the country it is only right that there is @peoplesvote_uk on the final #brexit deal #PeoplesVote 
A blind Brexit that damages our businesses and our NHS appeals to nobody. Nobody voted for this mess, that's why there has been a shift towards a People's Vote on the Brexit deal across the political spectrum. @RidgeOnSunday 
Wait until people find out that Brexit talks will last forever. As one negotiation ends, so shall another begin. 
We were told continually what Brexit would mean during the referendum. By both sides I might add. And we voted to Leave. Completely! We are awaiting delivery of that referendum result. It’s democratic because it was voted for by more people. 
Liam Fox, who used to claim that striking an EU trade deal would be the 'easiest deal in the history of mankind', is now admitting that Brexit is going to be bad for Britain.There's only one way out of this botched Brexit: a #PeoplesVote on the final deal. Please RT:

Main new reason EU wants a Brexit deal is that on 29th March, UK becomes EU’s 2nd largest external trade partner, just behind US. EU already risks major trade dislocation with its 2 largest trade partners: US & China. Wouldn’t want the top 3 all at once.

Someone needs to tell Len (and Jeremy) that there’s no such thing as a ‘jobs-first’ Brexit. Never was. Never will be. There’s just a Brexit which destroys jobs, rights, prosperity and public finances. That’s why a majority of TU members want a vote on the deal! @BestForBritain 
This is how a leading Brexiteer plans to avoid the Brexit shambles he has helped create. If you voted for Brexit maybe ask yourself why - if it’s all going to be wonderful - investing £70000 in gold is a good idea. How the elite Brexit Bunch plan ahead

How can #Leavers expect anyone to believe they knew what they were voting for, when the Tory party still haven't all got behind a single vision of what #Brexit looks like. The only people who spoke as one were the #Remainers.

#Brexit is not an event - it's a process of entropy. Think of the UK a few months before the referendum and look at us now. The country is unrecognisable. For what? Brexiters cannot answer. They have no plan and absolutely nothing to show for the chaos they've brought about.

6.  Lastly, as someone who 'grew up' in an academic literature where consensus was Sweden, Germany, Netherlands & Britain are resilient to radical right I'm struck by how much of this (Brexit, AfD, SD etc) is dismissed, mainly by writers on left (see what they want to see, etc) 
Brexit billionaires know what's coming. The poor people they conned into voting for it can't escape.... #PeoplesVote

You can see why extreme Brexiteers (and Andrew Neil) keep on crowing about populist parties in Europe. The claim that the EU is collapsing is a copy of Putin's 'strategic relativism': i.e. Brexit may be bonkers, but look how bad everyone else is faring. 
Are you a patient whose life has been saved by the NHS? Do you fear for what will happen to our healthcare system after Brexit? We're looking for people to be on camera talking about their Brexit worries. If you're in London and willing to be filmed, get in touch below. 
Right from the outset Brexit was about internal divisions in the Tory party. Over 2yrs later and nothing has changed. Brexit won't fix them and it WON'T fix the problems in the UK. It's long past time to put country  before party. #PeoplesVoteNow 
We are fast approaching complete Brexit DEADLOCK. There is no version of Brexit that can unite the Brexiteers. And yet you can’t implement it without one.Parliament must break the deadlock by asking the people what they want. 
Video games, like fashion, is a sector which don't get much Brexit attention, because of sneering basically. We focus on cars and financial services, which are considered proper. 
May's taking all the flak she would have got from the Ultras had she pursued soft (SM = aCU) Brexit, but in defence of Chequers, a far harder & more economically damaging version esp re services (even if it flies). So getting the pain of revolt without the gain of pragmatism.  
This is the Brexit people voted for. When I was covering referendum in places like Sunderland all anybody talked about was tax cuts. (*irony alert* Nobody mentioned tax cuts. They never do. Polls suggest c 10% of Britons want lower taxes. And that's been polls for years)  
There is no way on God's earth that 17m people voted for #Brexit and thought we'd end up with 'no deal' i.e. nothing. Even most remainers thought there'd be 'something'. The only way forward now is a #PeoplesVote with an option to remain and avoid disaster.

Trading on World Trade Organisation terms offers the best Brexit deal - Roger Bootle 
Good to have some more attention on the need for a commitment to replace vital EU funds for Overseas Territories' iconic wildlife post-Brexit. 
In 2016, Boris Johnson promised extra funding for the NHS but it's now becoming clear that his true ambition is to use Brexit to build Singapore-Upon-Thames - lower taxes for the richest, fewer protections for consumers and workers.

Ever since Brexit, there’s been a faction at the @BBCnews in bed with the tabloid press, excitedly hoping for right-wing surges and political turmoil across Europe. 
I very much doubt u would be asked to serve on a Boris cabinet or any other cabinet for that matter after your anti democratic stance on #BrexitThe electorate wouldn't stand for it in our new #Brexit World

The Tory Brexiters are destroying Brexit. Fine by me.Baker says 80 Tory MPs will oppose Chequers.But there’s no majority for a harder Brexit. Or a no-deal Brexit.So they’re blowing up their bandwagon.A #PeoplesVote is the way out of the mess.

“Brexit: 80 Tory MPs will reject Chequers plan says former minister” Theresa May appears not to have a majority for the outline plan on which she has staked her Premiership.   
Dear Reader..Just as we discover the police are planning for three months of civil unrest due to food and medicine shortages, it turned out the rich men had no plan at all.Brexit lived solely in their minds with a Star Wars force and battleships playing near the Falklands.  
I no longer watch bbc news because of its pro Brexit bias yet newspapers and Brexit MPs blame it of remain bias claiming independent researchIt turn out all of that research can be traced back to funding by Arron banks

#r4today presenter John Humphrys admitted not understanding "the details" of Brexit and the difference between the Canada & Norway options. Just remember that this is the presenter of the BBC’s so called ‘flagship news programme’ whose paid over £600,000 per year by the BBC. 
Oh bore off! The vote was an opinion poll on one day when people were fed up with government and austerity. Brexit is not the will of the people, it’s will of disaster capitalists.  
Now the truth begins. ⁦@LiamFox⁩ warns that there will NOT be a rosy economic future after Brexit as the UK will be subjected to “buffeting pressures in the global economy” that the govt will be unable to control.#bbcr4today #PoliticsLive 
More than two years after a Brexit vote built on cheating, false equivalence & weapons grade misinformation, John Humphrys apologises on @BBCr4today for getting ‘technical’ about ‘things that most of us don’t understand’. I genuinely wonder what he thinks his job actually is. 
Funny that those MPs who believe in democracy and wish to deliver on the referendum result and Tory manifesto are now considered to be ‘rebels’.  They are patriots.  May's Brexit plans opposed by 80 rebels in her party - former minister - Reuters  
Resist this new fraudulent narrative ofNo Deal Brexit = BadDeal Brexit = GoodThe reality is:Deal Brexit = CatastrophicNo Deal Brexit = Too catastrophic to contemplate (i.e. a bluff)You KNOW not to trust these people by now. 
The People's vote consortium are feeding the fire, the political elite have been given a mandate & think they can by hook or crook overturn it, deliberately thwarting, prolonging, undermining the process, legal challenges & now rebranding democracy itself for another referendum. 
After the big buildup the Brexiters turn out not to have a plan. You couldn’t make this up.Brexit is a disaster. It was always a unicorn chasing fantasy. You cannot slash taxes and maintain the things taxes pay for.You cannot make up for lost EU trade by signing deals elsewhere 
Last year Liam Fox said a post Brexit trade deal would be the "easiest in history".Now he warns against "irrational positivity" & admits no "guarantee that everything" will "be rosy."Shouldn't members of the public have the same opportunity to change their minds? #PeoplesVote 
1. Theresa May is doing more damage to the Tory party than any Conservative leader before her. She has failed in every area. Police, Crime, Windrush, the General Election, and is delivering a non Brexit. She is dividing the party & will tear it apart if she remains. #MayMustGoNow

BBC reporting of Sweden’s election sensationalist - a narrative of Brexit-style far right takeover. Only problem - the result of the election. The far right came 3rd, with 17%. The leading party was - wait for it - the Social Democrats, which BBC had on verge of extinction 
Another week starts, and Bash @BorisJohnson is again at the fore. This is nothing but an extension of the 2016 Referendum fight. Remainers attacking the threat. But remember, they may be attacking Boris, but really they are attacking 17.4 million Brexiteers.  We must fight back 
The @Conservatives will suffer a massive loss of public confidence if Theresa May is not sacked before the Tory party conference. @BorisJohnson brings 3 positives: 1. Harder stance on #Brexit; 2. End to Hammond's Austerity; 3. Finally we will have a PM who is proud to be British.  
And another one. Showing hard Brexit is a project of the right, by the right, for the right. Of the elite, by the elite, for the elite.

STOP THIS NOW.A general election helps precisely no-one!If Labour wins they have a matter of weeks to negotiate from scratch, which is why they wouldn't win. And even if they did, the damage of Brexit would be blamed on them, on Jeremy and on Socialism as a concept.FOCUS!

Does Brexit make exploring the world an elite privilege?My "Law with French law" degree sent me to France for 3rd year. No tuition fees. £80 travel.Those studying "Law with American law" had to show they had at least £16,000 in the bank just to get a visa, then pay for flights. 
Also 3rd downs are mostly random and we don't need to have a referendum on Russell Wilson during/after every game Seattle happens to do poorly on them 
According to the FT, EU leaders are preparing at this month’s Salzburg summit to give instructions to Barnier to soften his stand so as to make a deal on Brexit. The aim is to save May. The hitherto gutless ERG must go in for the kill NOW. 
In the immediate aftermath of Brexit there was a great piece by liberal high priest Michael Ignatieff admitting the failure of his own race - the people of Transnational Professionalistan - to ask the rest of us whether we wanted to invite the world in. 
Crispin Odey bankrolled the #Brexit campaign & made £220m by shorting the pound on the night of the referendum.Now he hoping to profit again from the harm Brexit will do to our economy.Wouldn't it be tragic if Crispin didn't get his way?#PeoplesVote 
Sadly, the summer recess has seen a major change when it comes to #Brexit - the total transformation of Project Fear into Project Hysteria. 
I'm flummoxed,If the ERG are just putting together a Brexit Plan to pit against the Government's recently cobbled-together Chequers version, what Plan was it the 17m allegedly voted for, in unison, 2 years ago?They had no Plan & no plans to make plans. And still have no Plan. 
Please retweet if you believe in BritainWe voted to regain our sovereignty and independence#Brexit must mean #Brexit#Standup4Brexit #BorisJohnson #ChuckChequers #ChequersPlan 
The forces that brought us Brexit are helping the far-right grow in Sweden. This is troubling.But here, as there, the answer is to step up, & defend our shared values of openness, freedom and equality. Not capitulate to a nationalist & xenophobic agenda. 
Our PM and Home Secretary have stated that Putin ordered the murder of people in Britain and that he wants to destroy the EU & the rules based international order. If they believe this then they must halt Brexit.  A Government's first responsibility is the security of its people.  
Monday's Daily Telegraph front page – 'Boris: May must cut taxes to help Britain thrive post-Brexit' #tomorrowspaperstoday 
Senior Tories trooped out to denounce Bozo's suicide bombing metaphor, today. Not long ago the same reptile's "fuck business" outburst was received in virtual Tory silence. It's clearly party above country now, with the Brexit Tories. #PeoplesVote 
Newsnet Exclusive: Brexit and Scotland, a public briefing by Michael Russell MSP (@Feorlean). Watch Michael Russell as he talks all things Brexit and answers public questions on what it means for Scotland. Filmed in Selkirk on Weds 5th September. 
I would really love to hear @BorisJohnson or @Jacob_Rees_Mogg outlining their plans for Brexit to @JasonJHunter, @IanDunt or @mrjamesob just to find out if they really know what they’re talking about. 
Anyone who believes that life in Britain (or Scotland) is generally satisfactory, or that things were ticking along nicely before the Brexit referendum unexpectedly ruined them, should read this thread.  
Watch this: "Brexit is the most cowardly thing that Britain has ever done"  
Full member but already the only member who had a cherry picked bespoke deal everyone else was jealous of. A deal that can never be bettered by Brexit x 
I agree 100%  Huge risk of the vote being about a 'soft Brexit' - I agree that we need to be absolutely ferocious in pursuing a vote on staying in the EU as a full member. 
But we have 2B careful..many leaning towards a #PeoplesVote are not clearly stating it must be a Simple Maj, Binary, Binding Ref + a clear#Reject #Revoke #Remain #Reform option.There's still a hint of respecting the EURef.Afraid I don't trust the EU not to offer #Brexit fudge 
Boris Johnson calls for tax cuts for a ‘dynamic’ post-Brexit Britain. Just what's needed - even less money in the coffers for NHS, social care, police etc. Has BoJo got a money tree too?  
Here comes the #Brexit Scottish car crash. We did not vote for this & have not any of our concerns listened to or respected by Westminster. A Brexit made by English right-wing elites for English right-wing elites.  
Not a good set of headlines for Johnson tomorrow... if column was a “dead cat”, doesnt seem to have worked - though, interestingly, one person who worked closely with him on referendum detects different sands shifting:  
The brexit rats and turnips will be shared out more equitably.  
Of course the #EU are now chomping at the bit to get a deal agreed. With all the concessions of the #ChequersPlan it puts a post #Brexit Global Britain in just the place the EU want us to be - not very global at all. #ChuckChequers #SkyPapers #PressPreview 
.@Femi_Sorry is absolutely right.#Brexit in any form will sharpen austerity and hit hardest those who have least.@UKLabour must have the courage to argue for a #PeoplesVote and campaign to #Remain in the EU. We need to commit to it at #Lab18, not for it be a last resort. 
MPs vow to quit to stop Boris getting into number 10 - Now that Boris has spoken out against Islam and Brexit. Let’s sit back and watch how the MSM tear him apart. You know it’s coming  
Boris Johnson pictured with head in his hands as Tories line up to slam his suicide vest jibe /#Brexit #PeoplesVote 
Speaking of ratings, wait until you see your ratings after the November Trexit referendum on your Presidency. People are moving on from Cray Cray. Vote Yes on Trexit.  
Brexit is the fight for self-determination and against and increasingly  arrogant nasty EU Nationalism. The EU is increasingly unstable and  offers nothing but unaccountable rule by distant people who loathe all  disagreement.  It is an appallingly dangerous situation.  
You vote for something which, by your own words, will cause "casualties", based on nothing but sheer "belief", against the will of young people, who overwhelmingly see Brexit as an unworkable disaster, and you're telling me it's the responsibility of young people to make it work? 
Looking forward to arriving in beautiful #Catalonia tomorrow morning and attending the #Diada2018 in Barcelona. The overwhelming message to the Spanish Government is free the political prisoners now and allow a referendum. #LlibertatPresosPoliticsiexiliats 
Between joining the EU in 1973, and the EU ref, the UK's GDP rose by 103%. We THRIVED. The UK has PROFITED immensely from EU membership - it became a very wealthy country - which it has FAILED to pass on to its citizens, bar the few. #Brexit is NOT the answer.#PeoplesVote 
Yes Boris probably did deliver Leave victory given narrow result. He broke it for us Remainers so he owns Brexit now and is responsible and accountable to the voter for all its political and economic consequences.  
Britain has fewer than 100 days left to fix Brexit — Is this something that could actually be done in 100 days of parliamentary time? If not, then abandon it at once. Britain has already wasted almost all the time it had. 
Essential from @BorisJohnson:“Now is the time for this Conservative government to show how a post-Brexit Britain will be a happy and dynamic economy that fosters enterprise, that rewards the strivers and the innovators, and where people can hope to...” 
#Brexit, of the elite, by the elite, for the elite.If you ain't elite, it ain't for you.Take back control from the elite,#PeoplesVote 
Certainly decades behind rest of northern Europe in terms of looking after out own people - class ridden backward country - Brexit just proves it  
Whilst 2/3 of Labour constituencies voted to leave ... @the_tuc and @francesogrady have completely missed the point that these @labourleave voters are their membership ... these men & women do not want a second referendum ... they want to see a proper #brexit  
Can we not just quietly kill Brexit and just tell the Brexiters that it has happened as planned in March next year? Then just issue them with a blue passport.They'll never know 
Tory minister tells @Peston no deal Brexit will mean UK looks and feels “like a Soviet-era eastern bloc economy” for some time with “de facto rationing” #sunlituplands  
Human beings are so smart.And yet...#Brexit  
absolutely not - Brexit is an unmitigated disaster - there are no economic advantages only major losses to everyone  
Conservatism is in crisis but Brexit can help reinvigorate it  via @BrexitCentral 
If we dont leave #Brexit backer Crispin Odey who is again patriotically shorting the pound will tragically lose a fortune  
New Brexit plans from Jacob Rees-Mogg's ERG eedjits. Step 1: a new military expeditionary force to defend the Falklands. Step 2: an invisible border. Step 3: renege on UK financial obligations. Beyond parody. 
It's great that people have created a powerful platform to advance progressive politics. But if it wants to have conversations about Brexit, antisemitism & Syria, then it needs to be having them with the very people those decisions impact the most. Otherwise it's not progressive. 
This is why elements of the Brexit campaign & US election disinformation efforts looked so familiar to some of us. The “flood not a dam” propaganda method was developed & tested in Russia on Russians first. 
Brexit racist? UK is Europe's ‘ONLY member’ not to have anti-immigrant party in parliament  
And are we sure that hedge fund owners are not colluding with some of the Tory Brextremists on this? The scope for corruption would appear to be almost limitless.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit 
Johnson’s one positive contribution to the Brexit debate is to call for “a big and generous Free Trade Deal with intimate partnerships on foreign policy, justice and all the rest”. We have one - it's EU membership.  
Oh what Porky Pies! - 'You said Brexit would mean Brexit'Jacob Rees-Mogg: 'Theresa May rightly said in her Lancaster House speech she didn’t want a solution that was half in & half out.I’m backing the Lancaster House vision of #Brexit, NOT Chequers!'#EU 
Brexiters have had 45 years to come up with a detailed and workable plan for Brexit. And here we are, 100 days away from Brexit, and still no plan. Nothing. Absolutely nothing.Brexit means emperor’s new clothes. 
The Netherlands will [wisely] block a post Brexit trade deal if the UK Government doesn't 'firmly tackle' tax avoidance.   
Judging by her many tweets she is *obsessed* with Brexit. This will, of course, have not in any way influenced her decision to ignore the criminal cheating by Vote Leave plus the attacks & massive funding by a hostile foreign power. Absolutely not.  
BFE: Most people now want a #PeoplesVote on Brexit. Someone who supports us all having a say in the event of #NoDeal is Conservative MP, @heidiallen75. Will you join her? To DEMAND your say, sign the petition and join the thousands who already have at   
Is someone looking into Crispin Odey?  He's into asset stripping, made millions just after Brexit, will make even more when businesses collapse, & is also a Tory donor;  Someone's pushing Brexit through. Makes you wonder, doesn't it. 
My position is clear on both, I am against antisemitism and will call it out always and it has no place in the Labour Party, I am against Brexit and I am on public record as such.  
.@paulmasonnews  - plse consider RT’ing & following @MarcusJBall - who is taking Boris Johnson to Court over the 350 mill/wk Brexit nonsense. #Brexit #NHS 
You are clearly delusional only Brexit that could come is either totally disastrous or worse nonsense  
Social unrest, security threats and government division. It’s just another Theresa May Brexit weekendBy @BaldPolitiKs 
Great to see you tweeting in defence of Brexit Penny It would be really brilliant if you’d support our campaign and pledge to #StandUp4Brexit... maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life 
British voters are more doubtful about Brexit than ever and increasingly fear it'll be damaging  
Monday marks 200 days to Brexit day. Stay strong brexiteers, the scaremongering, plotting & outright desperation from remoaners will only get worse. Next will come politicians trying to delay article 50 & backing a 2nd EU ref. We won’t let them win. No Brexit= end of UK democracy  
Theresa May is the EU’s Trojan horse. Everything May has done since being PM, supported by the UK establishment has had the aim of ensuring a real Brexit never happens. Chequers is a setup that is why May is so terrified of politicians like Boris opposing her & speaking out  
Spectacular video in which @Jacob_Rees_Mogg sets out his comprehensive plan for Brexit, meeting the promises of Brexiters and maintaining our economy.Nah, only kidding, it’s just the same old empty sloganeering from a man whose shipped his investments to Ireland.

'You said Brexit would mean Brexit' Jacob Rees-Mogg BLASTS May over unacceptable Chequers  
EU leaders set to give Barnier extra flexibility at Salzburg informal meeting this month to reach a deal ("save Theresa" operation). Endgame will be at "Brexit summit" in November.  
Oh, and here she is. Judging by her many tweets and the #FBPE hashtag, she is *obsessed* with stopping Brexit. This will, of course, have not in any way influenced her decision to criticise Boris Johnson’s choice of words. Absolutely not.  
Post-BREXIT UK Possibility of Aircraft Grounded.  It’s worth remembering that Heathrow is the busiest airport in Europe, the principal hub airport.  What’s the EU going to do about it - shoot our planes down? Project Fear at it’s worse..  
Lmao, and Rashford is "Brexit Mbappe" 
I am a woman. I voted for Brexit. I have not changed my mind. 49% female voters voted to Leave - that’s a big number...shock! This is not a gender issue. It’s more - can you accept  democratic vote issue?! 
Spoiler alert.There are only two Brexit options: Enhanced Associate Membership (what we’ve got but with fractionally lower contribution, no development funding etc., and no input on decisions);No Deal - pretty much the end of the world.That’s it. 
That would be the one that’s closing next year, along with Dunnes Stores in the town centre explicitly saying they can’t trade due to increased costs after Brexit?  
Brexit was mainly an argument surrounding pragmatic economic implications and the principle of law not being dictated to a country by other sovereigns. This has literally nothing to do with your goddamn obsession with meaningless 2010s bullshit buzzwords.  
Tough words from this RAF veteran. "Brexit is cowardly because we're abandoning our allies".  
On Monday there will be 200 days until the UK leaves the EU. We need to stay strong & focused as scaremongering, plotting & outright desperation from remoaners will get worse. Next will come politicians trying to delay A50 & backing a 2nd EU referendum. Insist on UK independence.  
2/2 TREATIES CEASE.  That means they all stop folks.   All of them.   There isn't time to renegotiate them all before 29/3/19 and there is NO PLAN for keeping the UK operating post Brexit.  Here is a sample of what is about to happen: 
‘just a more cheerful #Brexit’ must rank as one of the most inane comments amongst many on the topic. This is not a joke-jobs & futures are at stake-UK in danger of becoming a laughing stock  
If Labour stands for the working class how come the Conservatives have the highest employment and the lowest unemployment rate in 40 years. If the TUC represents UK workers how come they want a 2nd referendum so migrant workers can undercut UK workers?  
Theresa May is the EU’s Trojan horse. Everything May has done since being PM, supported by the UK establishment has had the aim of ensuring a real Brexit never happens. Chequers is a setup that is why May is so terrified of politicians like Boris opposing her & speaking out  
Imagine if Jason Donovan came onto the stage tonight to sing Especially For You with Kylie Minogue.. I think Brexit would be reversed, people would stop stabbing people everywhere in the UK for a week and we'd all probably get Monday off work as a Bank Holiday #R2HydePark 
This pathetic, confected “outrage” among Tory MPs over Boris’s suicide vest comment is risible. May is screwing up Brexit in front of our eyes.  Someone has to stop the Chequers sell out before it’s too late.  
It says GDP is already 2.1% lower than where it would have been if Britain had voted to stay in the EU 
Brexit. They have no plan. Please repeat this. Again and again. They have no plan.They are risking the future of everyone for ideological reasons when THEY HAVE NO PLAN. 
This is #Brexit.30th March 2019, as the sun rises over the hill, the reinvigorated UK emerges & freedom ensues.We reclaim our place in the world & we do the good we were destined for.The UK is not a province in any alcoholic's wet dream & it will never be so.#StandUp4Brexit. 
Tory MP Heidi Allen threatens to QUIT if @BorisJohnson becomes leader That would also mean an exodus from the Conservatives of her fellow RemoanersThe Tories would then become the true party of #Brexit that really does believe in Britain @MailOnline 
If you support #Brexit, your contribution to the world is that you made it a shittier place to live.No excuses.You, personally, helped make things worse.For everybody.Shame on you.#PeoplesVote 
#3BlokesInAPub talked about Preparedness Notices for Brexit and only 35,000 people have seen it?C'mon folks.... catch up... 
Boris Johnson is facing a furious backlash from fellow Conservatives after claiming Theresa May's Brexit plan had put the UK in a 'suicide vest'. 
Another Brexit vote is "the obvious thing to do," Tony Blair says  
Open invitation to @Jacob_Rees_Mogg to have a chat.   You've got the number.... No more excuses.   Man up and discuss your disaster that is Brexit.  
Is Brexit just a scam to make Brexiter hedge fund managers even richer?So much for £350m/wk for the NHS. #StopBrexit. 
#BrexitNorth: "Our idea was to look at what we could do to solve our country's problems if we didn't go head with #Brexit & instead we embraced the opportunities of remaining in the EU in March next year." Report & pictures via @leedslivenews  
I’m in momentum & will do everything I can to stop Brexit.  
"A cheerful Brexit"How about "he will make the torture amusing, killing people's jobs and businesses, causing medical shortages will be a giggle".How about you do the decent thing & call for Brexit to be dumped in the national best interest? 
Britain no longer wants #Brexit  the lies & fantasies of  leave  have been seen through  brexiters  formed  no plan in 20yrs of euro ranting & sabotage any attempt to put one together if brexit is implemented it will damage the lives of people who no longer want it  #PeoplesVote

BRITAIN’S BREXIT HUMILIATION: ‘May plan lets Brussels rule Britain FOREVER’ rages Boris  
Brexit Ultra MP Andrew Bridgen defends Johnson's 'suicide vest' comment as "speaking truth to power". The comment refers to phase 1 agreement on NI which Johnson agreed to when Foreign Secretary. More self-pitying victimhood from Brexiters.  
When will politicians realise that most of us don't give a toss about their internecine battles. What we voters want is credible government and opposition - particularly now as we face the challenges of #brexit We have neither.  
You'd think they'd have voted in that recent referendum so.

Every time atory government are in power they seem to set the UK back a few decades - with Brexit , looks like they're hoping to set a new record bt sending us back to Victorian times 
A staggering increase in sale of NHS land in the last two years begs serious questions as to the reason for this surge. Are these sales being used to plug financial deficits in hospital trusts as a result of a decade of underfunding? 
Corbyn supports Brexit.I think Brexit will destroy us.That's why I don't support Corbyn.#PeoplesVote 
No Robert. Not British haplessness. UK government was stupid to do this on back of a referendum - and one with a 2% majority! UK parliament duty is to protect us. They failed and are still failing. Nobody prepared to listen to Remainers. Take message back; withdraw Article 50 
Angry UK workers voted Brexit because UK’s rich (1) got UK corporations, gov’t to impose austerity, worsen inequality after 2008 crash, and (2) enabled demagogues to scapegoat immigrants, Europe. 
How #Brexit Britain works #4556. Press officer from hard right think tank charity that doesn’t declare its funders leaves to become SpAd to Brexit minister. Thus having a direct line to Brexit policy.  
Great Heidi. As a declared supporter myself of  #C4PV it is great to see other moderate Conservative MPs reach the same conclusion that #PeoplesVote is the only logical way & hope to resolve this Brexit debacle & painful division of country and party. 
To all those who Brexit has not unhinged some people have a read of this nonsense  Gavin seems unaware Brexit means leaving every aspect of the EU. Got that?  
May briefs Queen on Brexit progress at BalmoralWhat Progress? May is not a negotiator, she has offered too much! 17.4 Million voters want a Full Brexit, not in out do the Hokey Cokey!  
If by "products of migration.." you refer to the Anglo-Saxons and the Vikings; they were invasions. We couldn't control the movements of those people. We couldn't protect our culture from them. We can protect our culture against immigration; and we are doing so with Brexit. 
I’m looking forward to meeting the #TUC general council this evening at #TUC150 and discussing how we can best stop the damaging, costly, job-destroying, rights-threatening, Tory #Brexit  
The present parliament has no constitutional legitimacy because the two major parties both gained electoral support by claiming that they intended Brexit, which it is now clear that they didn't.  
More than two years after the Brexit vote the most ardent Brexit enthusiasts still cannot agree what Brexit is. Brexit is collapsing not because it is opposed, but because those who want it most still don’t know what “it” is.Sad. #peoplesvote

In late 2016, Alan Duncan gave MPs a one-page assessment of why he ‘liked’ extensive and binding EU military structures weeks after an agreement to actually join them. Now we find out his department is trying to make the UK commitment to these structures permanent after Brexit.  
Shockingly @emmyzen who came to the U.K. from the Netherlands c 40 years ago to live, work and pay taxes “in friendship and fellowship” was refused U.K. citizenship TWICE before the referendum (now resolved).We don’t run away from our problems as EU citizens.  We confront them.

So, the police are now telling everyone the military are going to be needed after Brexit. For those of us who’ve been telling everyone this obvious result was inbound, this is just frustrating.

Read this thread and weep - Then take a deep breath and carry on the fight. We can, and must stop Brexit. It’ll damage us and our neighbours beyond doubt. @peoplesvote_uk 
Whenever the Tories have to write something down about #Brexit it leads to a split.  The #Brexiteers have now decided to have no written thoughts at all , making their #Brexit as blind as May’s version. No country can base its future on such a farcical approach to vital issues.  
Brexit means Brexit.Brexit also means no food, no medicine, riots, and a military presence on your street.Let's stop this madness soon please.  
This is exactly what these people are all about - disaster capitalism to line their own pockets. Working people who voted for brexit (with some legitimate concerns and desire for change) have been completely duped by the rich elite. Much better to remain.

Greedy Brexiteer wager £3bn on the pound plunging this year amid no deal Brexit fears.  So they get filthy rich on people's misery.  People who will see every part of their lives get more expensive if this happens. Shameful  via @telebusiness

Frances, how in God's name WOULD it?By what mechanism, what process, what conceivable sequence of events could Brexit help working people?Can you imagine one? Even hypothetically? Can you draw a flow chart?If not, then get off the bloody fence.  
Every Brexit MP needs to be held to account for perpetuating the lies of brexit

TUC says it will back new referendum if Brexit deal fails workers.Any Brexit will be a disaster for workers, rights and public services.⁦@The_TUC⁩ and ⁦@FrancesOGrady⁩ should push for a #PeoplesVote with an option to #StopBrexit. 
The Chancellor warns that no deal will put us in catastrophic further debt. We fought hard to bring the country back from economic collapse, but Tories are now too wrapped up in their own mess to spare a thought for the disastrous No Deal Brexit they are leading the country into. 
Tories are threatening to end Boris's political career for standing up to May & her brexit sell out. What Boris needs to do is get the backing of brexiteers, stand to be leader & then sack all the remainers including May. Have a clean out of the Tory party  
If you voted Labour in the last General Election but:-Don't usually vote Labour-Voted Labour in the hope of stopping/opposing Brexit-Won't vote Labour again NOW is the time to speak up.The party is in the grip of people who think JC is their most successful leader. EVER. 
Note #Marr's words "a second referendum or a so-called People's Vote."I attended launch of #PeoplesVote & marched with 500K people, all of whom know it's a "vote on the final deal" & always has been.Calling it a "second referendum" is disingenuous & deliberately misleading.  
"Johnson will deliver no lectures on morality. Just a more cheerful Brexit"WTAF?!@SarahbaxterSTM a "more cheerful Brexit", Boris style?What's that? Wife swapping parties every weekend and full blown orgies on the last Sunday of the month? 
It is time for ladies to unite behind democracy. RT if you're a lady for LEAVE#Brexit 
As next week is Boris Week, a reminder. You were warned that this was the inevitable outcome of Brexit. We knew then he was the Poundland Trump...  
So on the post-Brexit exports list we now have:1) Innovative jams 2) Cheeses3) The precious life-giving blood of the young  
Johnson was set up by May and her cronies to prevent him becoming PM. I have no objection to Johnson at all and frankly where he dips his wick and with whom is none of my business nor does it interest me. Brexit however does interest me so Johnson is just fine in my book. 
Virtually nobody had a good word to say about Brexit in Exeter Yesterday. People desperately wanted an exit from Brexit#PeoplesVote 
Poor #Quitlings at the Daily Crapress don't like it that the majority of people at the proms were waving EU flags. #Brexit is clearly no longer the will of the people. In fact it never was. 
Seem to recall Brexiters saying during the Referendum that 'it's just our money coming back to us', so the research funding would continue, along with farming subsidies, regional aid (oh and spending it all on the NHS as well). Apparently not so.  
"I want to serve notice to the PM today" says @FrancesOGrady, as she announces that @The_TUC will throw its weight behind the campaign for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal if what is negotiated by @theresa_may is not in the interests of working people. 
Sweden: '‘Fury over EU’s bullying of Britain over Brexit will trigger Sweden’s own EU exit’' 
A blind Brexit that damages our businesses and our NHS appeals to nobody. Nobody voted for this mess, that's why there has been a shift towards a People's Vote on the Brexit deal across the political spectrum. @RidgeOnSunday 
Brexit means #Brexit. Lets stop messing about and just do it! No pain no gain! Why is it taking so long FFS #StandUp4Brexit #BrexitMeansExit 
I did 23 years in the RAF. About 10 years of the in Germany containing the Soviet block. We have just allowed Russian money skew the Referendum to weaken the western alliance. Farage, Banks, Agg IQ, the DUP and the Tory’s are traitors. 
Earned it? As mayor he closed fire stations and indulged in expensive vanity projects. Embarrassing and ineffective as FS. Chose Brexit for his own advancement, not belief. Everything he does is for himself. He’s amoral, self-serving, unprincipled & dishonest.

The thing is, you could probably plot a coherent path to hard (FTA) Brexit, trading off economy for perceived sovereignty, but it‘d mean:- accepting a special status for NI- a much longer stand-still transition, followed by an implementation phase (total ~10 years)- patience 
DELINGPOLE: Boris’s Brexit ‘Suicide Vest’ Metaphor Was Perfect  
It is indubitably clear that No Deal #Brexit would make life miserable for British companies that export to, or import from, the EU; No Deal papers reveal the web of red tape they would have to face – completely unnecessary, counterproductive and damaging to their bottom line 
A clear impact of #Brexit has seen the number of Brits taking out Irish citizenship (who don’t already qualify for a passport) spike massively. 2014: 51, 2015: 54, 2016: 98, 2017: 529 - fáilte  (via @thejournal_ie) 
Good to be at @The_TUC today talking about how we protect against a ‘no deal’ Brexit. If PM’s deal is rejected or she fails to reach a deal, Parliament should decide what happens next and all options should be on the table. 
A 'cheerful Brexit'. It started with outrageous promises, taking back control, and then descended into farce and cheating. Now we are supposed to 'cheerful'. How on earth do writers of this mediocrity manage to be granted high-profile columns in leading journals? Truly pathetic. 
It’s disturbing to witness what is happening to Britain over Brexit. Britain used to be an outward looking society defined by common sense, compassion and intelligence. These traits have been replaced by an arrogant, ignorant and insular mentality.It's tragic in so many ways. 
‘A more cheerful Brexit.’ God help us. 
You look at the debate around Brexit and you realise just how demoralised as a nation we really are. Every small obstacle judged insurmountable, every negotiating pose of the EU deemed implacable, every opportunity for self-agency determined beyond what we can achieve. Ye gods. 
This is perhaps the most embarrassing piece of journalism I’ve ever read in the pro Brexit Sunday Times  
.#BorisCantBePMBecause he is a self serving charlatan who doesn't even believe in Brexit himself #PeoplesVote 
"The document also warns that a no-deal Brexit could lead to a rise in crime, particularly  theft and robbery, as Britain suffers food and drug shortages with the +expectation that more people will become ill+." 
FLASHBACK Alan Duncan: Brexit is a Working Class "Tantrum"  
There's a political vacuum opening nicely for @Jacob_Rees_Mogg to take the reins.#Brexit 
The Poll TaxIraqBrexitThe people are usually right about huge, historic Government mistakes.  
It seems that the Unions have finally realised that #Brexit will hurt the working classes.Funny how Labour don't appear to give a fuck.#PeoplesVote #FBPE 
Give public a vote on Brexit deal, Britain's trade unions tell May  
There we go. This was inevitable. These Brit Nat Brexit fuckheads really are going to go all-out to erase all internal differences. Expect much worse to come. Man the fucking barricades.  
Brexit is a bit like PPI. Massive amounts of mis-selling, people unwittingly signing up for something that wasn’t in their best interests and then discovering that they’ve been ripped off. But, unlike PPI, there’s bugger all chance of compensation once it goes through. 
How do you know this? No one asked me or any of the women in my family. I voted #Brexit and would do again if there were another referendum, which there will not be. She is not speaking for the majority of women. 
And for you to defend the indefensible #ChequersPlan is just too much.The people knew what they were doing when they voted for #BrexitMaybe it's time you understood that. 
Planning to wreck the country and inflict massive suffering on the British people so that a tiny elite can profit from speculation, disaster capitalism and a #Brexit tax haven is not the action of a government. It is the action of a criminal gang.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
From an MP who dismissed #Brexit as the "blue-collar, urban, traditional Labour" working class being "stirred up by an image of immigration which made them angry and throw a bit of a tantrum".Whose comments are the more "disgusting" in the eyes of the public, I wonder...?   
Why YouGov poll shows support for a people's Brexit vote is solid  
The only problem is that there is no ‘Brexit for working people’. Brexit is intrinsically damaging to working people.  
We might have accidentally given out a few EU flags last night.  #lastnightoftheproms #Brexit #fbpe #PromsEUflags #PromsInThePark #lastnightoftheproms 
The Great Brexit Paradox - That those who lied and cheated to secure Brexit, those tasked with its delivery nor those hiding within the opaque right-wing groups who engineered it have a deliverable plan; yet those who oppose it have a fully detailed instantly workable solution.  
Last night at a gig I was speaking to some Belgian musicians who've come to UK for a farewell tour. They had one question for me :'Everyone we've spoken to in EU and UK hates Brexit. Everyone. Why hasn't it been stopped?' 
We can expect much more of this in Brexit Britain. Be prepared as all things that challenge the absolutist ideals of the London-centric British State are attacked.  
Boris: May’s Brexit Plan ‘Wraps a Suicide Vest Around Our Constitution and Hands the Detonator to Brussels’  
There must be at least ONE haulier ( truck or van ) whose self employed , who voted for brexit - still believes its a good idea and would risk crippling their own livelihood leaving the single market and customs union ... id love  to hear from you .. not one come forward yet 
The pathetic pro-Brexit turnout in Whitehall this week shows fake Twitter and Facebook ‘bots’ do not go on real marches, and there will be no riots if Brexit is cancelledIf Brexit happens and UK industry and commerce is ruined, thousands if not millions lose jobs, homes, maybe 
Facts matter. #Brexit  
Boris Johnson: May 'wrapping suicide vest around Britain' with Brexit plan...  
Actually, I think @AlanDuncanMP saying to an audience abroad that Brexit was just ordinary people having a tantrum was a bit more disgusting.  
Catalan leader calls for referendum as secessionists prepare protests  
Time for the TUC Congress to tell @jeremycorbyn and @uklabour to stop f ing about on #Brexit. Jobs are already being lost. There's no benefit for ordinary working people. It's just going to cause more damage and austerity. 
He was a terrible mayor of London and an even worse Foreign Secretary. He can't stand hard work. The only thing I'm sure of is that he'd eventually cancel Brexit, because he would want to stay in power and that'd be the only way to achieve it. 
This is tool that #Leavers should not use. If you enter your postcode and browse the resulting map you could view where the EU has funded improvements in your area. You really don't want to see which part of your foot you've shot with your #Brexit vote. 
BREXIT: Gammons are threatening civil unrest if they don’t get their self-harming act of redundant liberation. Again.  
Here's a thought ...When the UK breaks up because of Brexit, the Union Jack will become obsolete. But that won't only affect the UK. It will also affect the flags of Australia, New Zealand and many more ... including the Falklands, Cayman islands, and several states in Canada!  
This is not what the police are saying. They're gearing up for brexit riots and looting by a very disappointed populace. These angry people are going to blame the brexit liars. You appear to be near the top of that list.  
Police confirm brexit means the breakdown of law and order. Rioting and looting by hungry, angry people, watching their loved ones sicken from lack of medicines.  Disaster brexiters welcome this chaos. It will make them rich.  
We have been hearing the same words for the last two years.  But they not only misrepresent the #EU and what it is , they also misrepresent what the Tories are actually doing.  #Brexit has resulted in an Orwellian approach to language, subverting meaning & truth.  
This strikes me as pretty extraordinary: a home secretary being unable to rule out that a mooted government policy (no deal Brexit) would cause civil disorder and a jump in crime: 
U.K. Government haveduty to ensure it does NOT come to this - No Deal is NOT better! Problem is that the issues at ports and with supplies will also apply to Hard Brexit. #BrexitChaos 
“We set three tests for Brexit — protecting jobs, rights and peace in Northern Ireland. Two years on, we have no confidence in the govt’s ability to deliver a deal that meets those tests. Many people don’t trust  it to deliver any deal at all.” @FrancesOGrady #TUC150

Hey Tories, how’s the Brexit thing working out?Police plan for civil unrest after 'no-deal' Brexit  
People understandably focussing on the vileness of the rhetoric, but also note that as ever rhetoric is all Johnson has. No plan, no grasp of issues, no capacity for or interest in governing. So nothing to offer on how to deal with the Brexit mess his rhetoric did much to create.  
BETRAYAL: Osborne claims Britain will keep free movement after Brexit. Britain must take back control of our borders!  
The story I wanted to highlight on#Marr which is truly shocking about the chaos of a no deal Brexit is this one - also in The Sun, ST & Express'No-deal Brexit could lead to ‘real possibility’ of the military on the streets, leaked police document says'   
Wants to fight a “Tory Brexit”, calls Labour members “dogs” and says our party is institutionally racist. You will never lead our party, or our country.  
Having just watched this, I would urge everyone to do so if you haven't already. It actually leaves me even more astounded that WM entered into a deal with the DUP and indeed is even considering risking the Good Friday Agreement to furnish Brexit!! This is sheer fkn madness!!  
WATCH | @ChukaUmunna, who once posted on an exclusive website for millionaires and called ordinary Londoners "trash", says Brexit is for the elite  17.4m voters... that's a pretty big elite!Support us at  
Do not fall for the myth that we must reach a deal or leave with none.The third, best, easiest and most obvious option is still on the table. We cancel Brexit.

Brexit will bring job losses, lots of them. How will that cause wages to rise? 
Tragedy of the Lexiteers:They voted to leave EU, which they thought was a capitalist club. A no deal #Brexit will deliver a laissez faire free-market (ie Thatcherism +++). A Labour Government wouldn’t be able to do much about it, either. The global markets will dictate policy 
After 25 years campaigning for it, and with Brexit terms to be agreed within weeks, the Brexiters still can't agree what Brexit means or offer a plan which they dare try to defend in public. Whilst also insisting that everyone who voted leave in 2016 knew what they had voted for.  
We shouldn't be fighting for or standing up for #Brexit.Leave won and #Brexit should be delivered, unequivocally.We should be fighting to remove those in government, who would deny democracy being delivered to the UK's people, from their positions of power.#MayMustGo 
The context to the 'football Brexit' talks is that all sides (not least FA and PL) actually agree the decline of the English player in the Premier League is a bad thing. That decline in numbers here  
May wraps 'suicide vest' around UK over Brexit, says Johnson  
Tories condemn Boris Johnson for Brexit 'suicide vest' remarks  
I’ve just read Boris Johnson’s article in the Mail in Sunday. He must be furious that the subeditor removed all those detailed well-argued paragraphs where he set out an actual proposal for the post-Brexit settlement. 
#BorisJohnson accuses Theresa May of wrapping 'suicide vest' around Britain - and handing detonator to #Brussels in a scathing criticism of her 'feeble' #Brexit negotiations and Chequers deal  
Come on team. If we all tweet our MPs using the hashtag #howwillbrexithelp to demand they tell us how Brexit will help the most vulnerable and poorest in the UK we may well get one response between us. They don't believe in itWe don't believe in itCall them out 
After an excellent speech @NicolaSturgeon is now answering questions at the Association of Nationalist Councillors Conference. Many folk asking about the impact of Brexit.  
On this day in 2017 many of us went to march on the streets of London to say that we love the EU and that Brexit must be stopped. Were you there last year? Regardless of whether you were or not, it’s absolutely critical that you do come to march on 20 Oct this year1/

Sajid: People Don't Need to Worry About No Deal Brexit  
Don’t ever ever believe the push for a fresh referendum is the work of a Metropolitan Elite. It’s from nurses, the police, students and now our three biggest unions. Oh, and Boris Johnson is a former London Mayor: words that are 1) metropolitan and 2)elite.  
So this weekend we were meant to have a "plan" from Leavers.With 6 months to go and still no plan can I assume they've finally realised what the rest of us knew years ago?Brexit is a pile of undeliverable promises covered in sh1t that noone can create a "plan" for? 
The last few days of @BorisJohnson bashing shows that the Establishment has learned nothing. @theresa_may using her oposition research document against a popular figure has similarities to the referendum Project Fear.  It has increased the oposition against her.#IStandForBoris 
REFERENDUM CHALLENGE: The register was overstated by approximately 700,000. This opened the door to massive illegal voting. How many of the votes counted were legal and how many illegal? We will never know. Joanna 
He's blaming May for putting the country in a suicide vest but he was one of the leaders of the Leave campaign who strapped the suicide vest on. It doesn't matter whether there's a deal or no deal, the Brexit suicide vest is going to blow the UK's economy to oblivion. 
Me studying for exams:Loads of timeLoads of timeLoads of timeLoads of timeToo late. Not worth bothering.I am now advising the Brexit team on strategy. 
May was supposed to be a unifier. The issue is that liberals in the party wish to frustrate Brexit. That precludes unity.

Even the reasons why the public might dislike Boris are fantasy. "He'll deliver clean/ prosperous Brexit" If you asked 1000s why they disliked Boris, literally, not one person would say this. He is self serving. He is dangerous. He is a complete bell end. These are the reasons...

Latest poll shows 73% Tory voters back Brexit. Apart from anything else I don’t see how breaking Brexit pledges works for Tories electorally

No, Boris; Brexit has done that. You helped to strap it on. “Brexit: Boris Johnson says May has 'wrapped suicide vest around UK constitution', prompting storm of Tory outrage” - The Independent  
This is v weak from TUC gen sec  - already clear May will not and cannot deliver a brexit in workers' interests. Not a time for 'ifs' & prevaricating, time to take a stand against brexit & back a people's vote  
Become a tax haven. Build a Star Wars defence system. Invade Argentina. Beginning to see why the Brexiteers have had second thoughts about publishing their own Brexit plans 
Once again I repeat it was a dereliction of duty of all parliamentarians who voted for a referendum absent of any detailed risk impact analysis of Brexit. The most appalling dereliction of duty by both Commons and Lords. Makes you realise how useless most MPs &Lords are.  
Back to Brexit, and this Independent story is getting some attention - as yet we have no certainty on whether international agreements signed as part of the EU will apply to us from March 2019 - 1/  
Today I'm putting the PM on notice. If her deal doesn’t deliver for working people, then the TUC will throw our weight behind the call for a popular vote on the terms of Brexit.  
Trade unions could support second Brexit vote if deal hurts workers: TUC  
Presumably if the “People’s Vote” folk get their second referendum, the choice they expect is either (A) Chequers; or (B) Cancel Brexit, and Remain. So how are Brexiteers supposed to vote, when both choices mean “NOT BREXIT”? 
Swedish politician claims EU's HARSH Brexit tactics is causing a surge in SWEXIT support  
Fascinating weekend at British-Irish Association in Oxford. Most striking moment when a UK government representative said believed #Brexit deal will be done w/Brussels but doubted it could get through Parliament. If that’s case things could get v v v bumpy soon 
As George Osborne predicts we'll end up in EEA and Boris Johnson launches another blistering attack on Chequers, here's why neither is viable Brexit plan. Only sensible way out of madness is #PeoplesVote with option to stay in EU

Another week when Brexit fan #Marr didn't mention the Brexit fraud. Vote Leave's criminal overspending & the £9m from a hostile foreign power, both of which bought far more access to voters than Remain had leading to a massive spike to Leave in the final weeks of the EU ref.  
#Marr SajidJavid talks of the importance to Britain of the rules-based international system and of working closely with our allies - yet he wants us to walk out on our allies in the EU and tear up the common rules we’ve agreed with them over the last few decades. #Brexit 
The stop Brexit game plan hinges on “extending” article 50  
Caller to James O'Brien saying Brexit worth it even if they lose their job and everyone in their family does too. Bizarre level of faith in welfare state. Don't they realise that same economic disaster that will destroy jobs will give Tories excuse to savage welfare for jobless? 
Just a thought:Boris Johnson who led the #brexit referendum campaign, who was foreign minister for 2 years, who resigned because he rejected Govts Brexit plan & who now wants to be Prime Minister at the very moment of EU withdrawal.....has yet to offer a Brexit plan of his own. 
.@sajidjavid runs through the litany of Russian threats and interference in our way of life but no mention of interference in referendum. The criminal one backed by dirty tricks and dirty money #ruleoflaw 
The plea I’ve made repeatedly- to all engaged with Brexit, on all sides- there’s a line for those in prominent positions on language. If we worry about extremes, and how we come together after, language matters . Be passionate,just exercise some restraint. 
The same could be said about you, Zac, only more so. The last time I saw you,as London Mayoral candidate, you demeaned yourself by playing the Islamist card against Khan, doubtless on the advice of Dog Whistle Crosby, not because you believed it, any more than Boris does Brexit 
There's a growing fear among previously pro-Brexit voters that leaving the EU will damage Britain's economy, according to a leading social research institute  
Gisela Stuart knew she was lying during the EU referendum campaign. We weren't ever sending Brussels £350m a week & she knew as a result of voting Leave the UK would have a shortfall of many £100s of millions a week bc of diminished tax revenues. #Marr 
Dear @BBC before you again decide to afford valuable airtime to Chloe Westley aka LowFactsChloe of the Taxpayers Alliance, one of the many homogeneous astroturfing groups based at 55 Tufton St, you should measure the calibre of the 'expert' you're promoting by watching this video 
This is the guy who flew to Chicago at public expense to tell us that Brexit was a "tantrum" by the "working classes (sic)". Pompous doesn't really do it justice.  
One of the worst aspects of Brexit is the revival of pseudo-intellectual, bigoted, xenophobic little-Englanders like Burchill. She's an absolute embarrassment.  
Another Brexit lie exposed. The Government said there would be no need to deploy the Army. There will be.  
Fucking hell! #PeoplesVote IS NOT a second referendum! It has a deal to discuss. That wasn't on the ballot last time, was it? Why do you keep peddling that BS #MARR? 
Brexit talks are at crisis point. @FrancesOGrady is serving notice on @theresa_may: if she doesn’t deliver a Brexit for working people, our movement will mobilise and demand a popular vote #Marr 
Great to hear @FrancesOGrady saying full weight of @The_TUC will be behind @peoplesvote_uk on final Brexit deal 
Senior Labour frontbencher Barry Gardiner has explained why a second referendum (aka "people's vote") is an extremely bad idea. #RespectTheResult 
Remember the two main slogans from Brexit in 2016? What are they leading to?Take Back Control. Giving up voting rights in the EU Laws we end up following anyway.Take Our Country Back.Losing part(s) of the country. 
.@TiceRichard: "The pragmatic thing for the PM, is to chuck Chequers and confirm that a WTO arrangement is best for Britain. We can save £39billion, cut tariffs and go for growth. That is what Brexit means.”  
I don't approve of Boris' morality. I don't trust him not to make gaffes or miss some crucial point of detail. But he's a dial-shifting winner, a natural leader, right on Brexit, & 1000% better than Theresa May. 
As ever, its three against one on Brexit with Gina Miller on #Marr (and yes I include Marr in that as he’s a BBC toady through and through). 
Union members overwhelmingly back calls for referendum on Brexit deal, says poll  
On the early train to Manchester for the @The_TUC conference. Back to back Brexit discussions ahead. 
Unite, Unison and GMB members support a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal by 2-1.Time is running out, but it's not too late for our party to listen to workers and lead calls for a #FinalSay. We can still stop this right-wing, job-destroying calamity. 
Big Bad Boris Johnson has put his foot in it again saying, Theresa Mays Brexit Plan " has wrapped a suicide vest around the British Constitution" the trouble is he's right. This man is the British Trump and i like him. Boris is the only Tory who says it how it is good one you. 
Q so how long does the average Brexit leave voter think it will take to renegotiate 759 treaties /agreements.. it wont be overnight thats for sure   
Ahead of TUC Congress our new poll shows:Unite members support idea of a #PeoplesVote by 59% to 33%.GMB members support it by 56% to 33%.For Unison members it’s 66% to 22%.They know better than most the threat Brexit poses to jobs & public services 
Only weeks after his burka “ letter box” jibe, Down Trousers Boris likens May to a  Brexit suicide bomber, appalling, bad taste & hyperbolic nonsense that confirms he has no more control over his mouth than over his dick   
MUST-READ: Brexit is going to make working people worse off - that's why a majority of members of Britain's 3 biggest unions, Unite, Unison and GMB, back a #PeoplesVote. Please RT:

Big news today isn’t Johnson’s tantrum but 2 to 1 support for people’s vote among trade unionists & a surge of support for people’s vote among constituency Labour parties in advance of Labour party conference in a fortnightBrexit disintegrating 
Cuts in income tax, business tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty plus an 'expeditionary force' to the Falkland Islands - a glimpse of Rees-Mogg's post-Brexit vision of Britain  
It’s astonishing to watch these people abandon everything they’ve ever  professed to care about - party, country, loyalty, decency, unity, honesty - if it allows them to avoid admitting the heinous error of supporting Brexit for a few more weeks.  
He is right but it also illustrates the reality of #Brexit now - the end game of a #civilwar in the Tory party which has lasted 40 years.  The rest of us are onlookers though being damaged by it every day.

You utter clown Jeremy. Utter, utter, *utter* clown.You are tweeting stuff that says women in general don't want #Brexit. That Jeremy is complete and utter twaddle.When will these remain folk figure out that their nonsense just makes them look foolish   
No-deal Brexit could lead to ‘real possibility’ of the military on the streets, leaked police document says This is where the Brextremists have led us: threats to food supply, civil order and the rule of lawTime to put an end to this #BrexitShambles 
What’s substance in today’s Brexit row? @BorisJohnson say Northern Ireland backstop - agreed 9 months ago when he was For Sec - undermines Britain’s negotiating position. His alternative ? Rip up the promise. His plan? Yet to be produced (tho’ standby for speech by @DavidDavisMP) 
Neither tax is linked to EU membership so Brexit makes no difference as to whether or not they can be cut. Would the ERG have been honest about this? 
Northern Ireland’s Chief Constable has accused some Westminster politicians of failing to understand the dangers of terrorism in Northern Ireland post-Brexit  
Most worrying thing in @ShippersUnbound #SundayTimes articles this morning is the fact the ERG (whose main protagonists could never have won the referendum) have interpreted vote to Leave as meaning the country wants John Redwood c.2002 to be Prime Minister. Mental!! 
'Left-wing TV presenter - who is also son of a Left-wing TV presenter and nephew of a Left-wing TV presenter - comes out against Brexit and calls for vote to overturn it' shocker.

Boris Johnson compares Theresa May's Brexit plan to wrapping a ‘suicide vest’ around Britain and 'handing the detonator' to Brussels  
Tories still don’t have a clue what to do about Brexit and are more concerned with Machiavellian leadership plots. Labour are in civil war over antisemitism. Brexit is a mess and both our main political parties are failing us when we need them most. 
The country will be quite right in watching this psycho drama and wonder why their government is keeping tabs on Boris’s sex life instead of getting on with Brexit and competent stewardship of our country.  
We had a referendum, then a general election with main party manifestos to endorse the outcome, LEAVE.Why is the debate still going on when the voting is over?The debate should be how do we go forward when we've left.  
I’m stunned at the nature of this attack. There is no justification for such an outrageous, inappropriate and hurtful analogy. If we don’t stop this extraordinary use of language over Brexit, our country might never heal. Again, I say, enough.  
If #Brexit is such a positive thing to happen, why are UK police forces banning officers taking leave in the weeks following the UKs departure from the EU? 
After campaigning for #Brexit and now having seen the damage his betrayal of the UK and its population will wreak, Boris Johnson compares the #Chequers deal to 'suicide vest'  What a vile little shit he is as he backs away from the mess he helped create 
Boris is wrong.The suicide vest around Britain is Brexit.Boris is the detonator.Say no to Boris. Say no to Brexit. Let's not bomb our country to oblivion. 
Tory ERG's failure to come up with an alternative plan signals the end of Brexit. Brexiters oppose membership of the EU but they have no positive, realistic ideas & no alternative. #PeoplesVote. 
In the absence of any leadership, party discipline or coherence on Brexit, the Tories have fallen into a state of constant, low-level civil war.  
Johnson compares Chequers deal to 'suicide vest' - The violent, irresponsible language of a leading Brexiter. Brexit profoundly damages our public debate and normalises the politics of hate. Time to think again. #PeoplesVote

And what exactly would the point be in Scotland voting on a deal that we were not consulted on. Because there would be no "Cancel Article 50 and stay in the EU" option on that ballot! It's like giving the turkey a choice of stuffing or no stuffing on xmas day! #Scotref #Brexit

@BorisJohnson take down continues in the Sunday papers. Coordinated efforts from @theresa_may and CCHQ with their establishment journalists trying to thwart the electorate of the referendum result. It really is the London establishment against the people. Disgraceful 
Boris Johnson accuses May of wrapping 'SUICIDE VEST' around ‘Great British Brexit'  
It is their prerogative if they wish to abstain; nevertheless it is irrelevant to the fact, which is that the majority - however small - was to Leave. I'm just incredibly sorry to all those who are believing in false hope that Brexit will be stopped, because it won't be. 
I blame Brexit.  
Trump/Brexit. Same backing. Same playlist. America isn't the only Western country under attack rn.

Conservative MEP, pro Brexit. I remeber when the Tories deregulation the UK meat industry led to the creation of a whole new fatal disease called CJD....  
I have always used "if".From the 24.06.16 I concluded that #Brexit will not happen. They promised the impossible during the #EURef and now there is no majority in Parliament to vote through any version of #BrexitThe #Remain majority will have to offer a #PeoplesVote#FBPE 
Not the Onion: the ERG's Brexit plan contained a "Star Wars missile shield" and a new Falklands expedition - too absurd even for Boris Johnson to support. No wonder even the zealots realised their Reagan/Thatcher tribute act would be "widely mocked"

Bombshell poll reveals heavy union backing for second Brexit vote. That's more like it!  
It’s why I bang on about aviation. It’s a consequence of Brexit that was clearly known but ignored or dismissed and most people I’m sure did not know that voting Leave would threaten our flights or our aerospace industry or even heard of ECAA or EASA 
Only Remoaners, who refuse to accept that the majority voted to Leave the eu, are calling for a #PeoplesVote (#LosersVote)They say “people have changed their minds” - NO they haven’t I, like many others, knew I’d vote Leave B4 the euref campaign even started!#Brexit 
A very simple idea was behind #Brexit, which was Britain should be governed by the British people. We don’t need the EU to make our laws, we don’t need our economic decisions made by Brussels & we don’t need the EU to control our borders, trade or courts. #Britain ruled by Brits! 
One reason many voted for Brexit — so we wouldn’t continue to be told what to do by Germany. Who cares what interest they have?  
In effect, any Brexit risk pointed out cannot be proven until it is too late. So, it is dismissed as “project fear”. There is, however, a notable exception: something tangible that was promised by Brexiters and which was meant to have happened safely before we left. The Deal. 5 
Conversely, if Brexit is somehow averted, there will always be some who will fervently believe that, had we shown more courage and resolve, the sunlit uplands were there for the taking. It’s difficult to positively disprove a hypothetical long chain of complex events. 4 
You say “See? Brexit didn’t bring economic ruin.” I point out “Economy is showing worrying signs and we haven’t left yet.” Similarly, in the event of a post-Brexit economic collapse, there will be no way to prove it wasn’t due to other factors and would have happened anyway. 3 
This is the ‘Big Lie’ at the heart of #Brexit- it’s advocates can’t publish a plan because they have no plan-they just want their country to sleepwalk into chaos- its the ‘Loosing Control Plan’  
I’m raging at this. He’s a haunted pencil talking utter pish. “Surrender”? Fuck off back tae the 18th century. Brexit is a load of old wank, but, this isnae a fucking war, ye lang streak of sleekit misery.

Boris Johnson's hero is Churchill, who defected from the Tories to the Liberals. And then back to the Tories. In his own words, Churchill 'ratted' and 're-ratted'. So I'm giving even chances Boris runs for leader, then reneges on Brexit  
Britain's trade unions to take major step towards backing Final Say referendum

Well, @UKLabour, here’s looking at you. Members of Britain’s three biggest trade unions now support a new referendum on Brexit by a margin of more than 2:1, with a clear majority supporting staying in the EU.   
Newspaper headlines: Johnson's Brexit jibes and 'dirty dossier'

#Brexit would hit the poorest hardest.   The unions are recognising this.  It’s time Jeremy Corbyn did too    #PeoplesVote  
Here it is - read in particular Article 3(3) - a social contract.  The EU legal order safeguards our freedoms and rights.  It restrains over-bearing Governments and limits the power of vested interests.  It provides for a social contract, which the advocates of Brexit loathe 1/2

The whole “government must enact the will of the people” is rubbish in this case as the referendum was not binding, it was advisory and it excluded citizens that should have had a vote. In no way should a responsible government enact a criminally achieved result.

STOP SPEAKING FOR ALL WOMEN. YOU DON’T SPEAK FOR ME. This is the weakest attempt to bring gender/identity politics into a matter that’s nothing of the sort. It cheapens Feminism & the true quest for Equality. My ovaries don’t dictate my politics. Just. Stop. #Brexit   
Somebody really should remind those people waving those infernal EU flags that Rule Britannia & Land of hope and glory are British Songs and have nothing to do with the EU, haven't they heard we dont want their anthem or their Flag anymore? #lastnightoftheproms #Brexit 
Read down the thread. @RVAwonk is doing important work (again) exposing ugly, and possibly deadly, Russian propaganda about a possible chemical warfare attack in Syria. This is also how they used disinformation for Trump and Brexit, and elsewhere.  
“Members of Britain’s three biggest trade unions now support a new referendum on Brexit by a margin of more than two to one, according to a bombshell poll” someone ask Owen Jones if he still thinks  Brexit is the will of the people.   
Watching Last Night of the Proms (not something I normally do being a pleb) and struck by the huge number of EU flags being waved. Even this most traditional of UK events is saying Brexit is B*****cks?

We had a referendum. The issues were debated at length. Draft legislation was published so people could make an informed decision: The people have spoken. They are sovereign. Now let’s respect that and do our job - enacting their decision and caring for women with compassion 
Brexit was a gigantic mistake, I know there are possibly millions who still support leaving regardless of the economic and social destruction but that does not make it right for the country. Governments have a duty to do what is right and Brexit just is not right. 
An Irish forklift truck maker that used to buy its seats from a Welsh factory has now switched that contract to a German manufacturer.It's one example of how a lack of clarity on Brexit is already affecting trade.

No Deal Brexit is the biggest threat to economic and social stability since WW11.  The Tories are responsible,  but Labour will share the blame by standing idly by..  My @heraldscotland column. 
Boris may be flawed but the most important thing right now is to have a leader who believes in Brexit, will stand up to the EU, will fight to make Brexit a success & that will never be May. Better to have a Prime Minister who betrays his wife than 1 who betrays the entire country  
Interesting article some of the greatest economic stories come from European countries outside the EU. #Brexit  
Britain hasn't even left the EU, but Brexit already appears to have affected economic output  
The EU has made the upholding of human rights an integral part of its external trade relations. The UK is to sign post-Brexit trade deal with three countries that criminalise homosexuality. Don’t tell me we are not going backwards  
Chequers is Brexit. Brexit means leaving the EU. If you don't like the way Brexit is going then maybe you need a #PeoplesVote... 
It is a protest by music lovers against post brexit restrictions on freedom of movement for orchestras. Some orchestras based here have already moved abroad. As a music lover you should be supporting the protest.

It's quite impressive that after decades of campaigning for Brexit, Brexiteers don't actually have an idea or a plan on how to deliver Brexit without totally tanking the economy. It's almost as if they've been shouting a lot without properly thinking it through.... 
The Irexit freedom party; at long last a political party for people for whom the question, "Well I suppose, if you saw your friends jumping off a cliff would you do it too?" was not, in fact, rhetorical. #Irexit#Brexit  
Will do, thanks Theresa. Get in touch if you need any tips on Brexit  
Keep up the good work@MKLibdems! I find people so worried about #Brexit but they don’t know who to talk to. Being visible and explaining @peoplesvote_uk is good and the evidence of these Brexitometers shows opinion is changing. 
The main argument against Brexit seems to be “no one voted to be poorer” no, we voted for cheaper food, for cheaper clothes, for a trade policy that benefits the average person not the cooperate elite. We voted for change, not the status quo. #StandUp4Brexit 
We're launching a brand new range of post Brexit ready meals. Our beans come with added penicillin and insulin just in case medical supplies disappear...  
Great to see my good buddies from @SODEMAction and the mighty @EUflagmafia givin out #EUflags at the #Proms tonight, with musical accompinament too! It ain't exactly rock n roll but I like it like it yes I dEU!  #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE #FinalSay #Remain 
Companies are having to pay higher wages due to a shortage of skilled workers, a report finds. @CliveBull asks: is this a Brexit dividend or a problem for the UK economy?  
I am a woman and I voted leave and still would. Stop generalising! #Brexit 
Instead of tweeting nonsense can you please start tweeting/reporting on what is really happening in this country i.e. homelessness poverty nhs and not to forget the mess this government has got us into with brexit 
If anyone knows of ANY pro brexit mps taking answers on any radio station in relation to my field of expertise pls inbox and let me know - they need embarrassing with real true to life facts and shown up for what they really are . 
Blair and Cameron up Brexit creek without a paddle – cartoon  
Anti-democratic//anti-British numpties!Who paid for the flags I wonder? Can't have been cheap.Last Night of the Proms to get 20,000 EU flags in Brexit protest  
So much anti-brexit feeling in Haringey North London today that they needed to double-up on #brexitometers to log everyone. The momentum for a #PeoplesVote vote (as both #remainers realise they can't stand by and leavers become #RemainerNow) is becoming pretty powerful. 
Thanks #PromsEUflags for your campaigning today! I am about to go on stage here in Germany with a British orchestra. Our rights to work in this way are at risk due to #Brexit so thanks for help raising awareness of our concerns. #FreeMoveCreate @WeAreTheMU @theoae @tpearce003 
Five Star advisor says Italy could yet leave EU as bloc has failed to learn lessons over Brexit  
Good to see a growing number of MPs of all parties back a @peoplesvote_uk on the Brexit deal.Politicians must give the public a #FinalSay - with the option to stay and #StopBrexit. 
The latest work on traitors in Britain during the Second World War shows in the words of one reviewer: ‘whatever we may like to imagine about our wartime spirit, there were plenty of would-be quislings in British factories, offices and homes.’ After Brexit,why am I not surprised? 
Utterly disgusting & complete nonsense. #lastnightoftheproms #Brexit #OutNow  
‘Chaos’ warning as ministers admit 150-plus countries yet to agree to 'rollover' deals after Brexit. Didn’t see that on the side of the bus.Hold a #PeoplesVote and #StopBrexit.

"What strikes me about the UK during the Brexit negotiations is that it's the first time the UK has negotiated with a stronger power. Before, it's always been colonial powers or those with less capital" — @davidmcw at #FTWeekendFestival via via @FTMag 
Ooops!'Chaos' warning as ministers admit 150-plus countries yet to agree to 'rollover' deals after Brexit  
Leaving the EU is going to result in less not more government money. The #Brexit berserkers are now talking about entering a ‘space race’ with the EU. If you have seen the light and changed your mind, join the campaign for a #PeoplesVote. 
The level of troll activity on this just goes to prove how scared they are of the truth, that the country is now remain and wants to bin brexit... astonishing. The trolls wouldn't be here unless they were scared and they're scared of a #peoplesvote because they'll lose. 
Been there, done that, ended up with a Tory government and a referendum thrown in to appease the back benchers.So on reflection... no.  
Sally in action at #peoplesvotecymru describing the devastating impact Brexit is already having and is going to have on small businesses. Just one of the compelling reasons why we demand a #peoplesvote on the final #brexit deal.  
#LastNightOfProms Well uh-hey here's a lady got the same genes as me - we got the #EU runnin through our veins (and hair)Looks like maybe there's a few blue n yellow #flags at the #RAH too  @EUflagmafia #Brexit #StopBrexit #ThankEUForTheMusic  
Absolutely right, and also stop calling people with legitimate concerns who are brave enough to voice them publicly right wing extremists - that’s like calling Brexit supporters racist, it’s just a cynical attempt to shut down the argument. 
Even the WTO have warned that there is no certainty that we can fall back on WTO rules immediately after #Brexit, calling the Govt’s hopes “not realistic”. They must face facts: no matter what the deal, Brexit will be a calamity for businesses and families. 
Poor communities, the left-behind, need hope. #Brexit is taking it away - @Femi_Sorry #BrexitNorth 
Less than 10 days ago @AndyBurnhamGM said campaigners arguing for a second referendum “inflamed this idea of an arrogant political class”. Now he says he will back another vote if a so-called "no-deal" Brexit came to pass.Mr Burnham you are full of shit! 
Calling all the people of Maidenhead. Exercise your democratic right to see Mrs May and demand a People’s Vote. You are in a privileged position, use your power to help defeat Brexit. #FBPE #PeoplesVote 
Why Ireland should seriously consider #Irexit@FT@dailytelegraph #IrExit@Brexit@MandyGall7 
I agree with @ChukaUmunna, future generations will never forgive @jeremycorbyn for facilitating this Tory BREXIT. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
Just cancel fucking Brexit. Stop fucking about. Whether you like it or not, only the cuntiest shithorse or stupidest cretin can still deny that taking Britain out of the EU will destroy the country. Cancel the whole shitshow and let’s get back to something like fucking normality. 
The truth about leaving the EU is bitter, hard and HUMILIATING for everyone who ever thought UK's global reputation made it "too big to fail".'Chaos' warning as ministers admit 150-plus countries yet to agree to 'rollover' deals after Brexit  
Important gesture of Angela Merkel to visit Macedonia on this very day. Support also prior to the referendum on the name issue.

SPEECH: LONDON 2 October - Join me in a book signing/salon for @Plot2Destroy Democracy & drinks in London. I’ll be discussing Trump-Russia, #Skripal attack & GRU Spies in the UK and how #BREXIT was a test run to Destroy the EU/Western Democracy.    
A group of founding members of VMRO-DPMNE including former leader and prime minister Ljubčo Georgievski appeal to citizens to vote in Macedonia’s referendum on the agreement w/ Greece to resolve the name issue (30 Sep). 
Hello @BorderIrish. Left foot in Ireland, right foot in N Ireland. Not sure where they'd fit a #Brexit customs check on this wee bridge   
It’s not entirely true to say the Brexiteers have no post-Brexit plan. They are ultra marketeers and we’re starting to hear speeches from Tory ministers ( eg Sam Gyimah) laying the groundwork for mass privatisations of public services post Brexit. This should be our battleground 
Alexis: "The Referendum question In or Out was too damn hard. The phrase 'people knew what they were voting for' is starting to get to me." Did you cast your vote not knowing what you were doing? Watch ▼@AlexisConran | @JasonJHunter | @ajcdeane 
There's a lot more damage to come from Brexit, says @AdamPosen of the Peterson Institute  
‘Involuntary ascetism’ explains ‘intelligent Brexit’. 
The trouble with “Brexit Means Brexit” is that “Brexit” is a neologism; the word has only existed for about three years and for that whole time there’s been no consensus on what it actually DOES mean.Might as well say “Arglefoob means Arglefoob”.  
Over 750,000 people are demanding the #FinalSay on Brexit - add your name today  
Finally got around to cataloguing/framing some memories from the referendum. Cried a bit (again) when I had a read of article 40.3.3 and realised that it’s finally gone. Laughed a bit (again) at my Irish Times sass from 2017. #RepealedThe8th 
Out in the street in Bangor, North Wales today, campaigning for a People’s Vote. The mood has changed. Everyone and their mother is demanding a second vote. Mrs May come back to North Wales and change your mind again. Stop Brexit.#FBPE #PeoplesVote 
#Brexit split the country roughly down the middle in June 2016. To have ignored the half that was against it was the gravest of mistakes by an arrogant fool. May is now reaping what she sowed. 
Ah you’re tweeting whilst driving? How very brexit.  
The idiot Tories sit and laugh at the prospect of Scotland losing 80,000 jobs and anything up to 8% GDP for a Hard No deal Brexit ~ Seriously, who the hell votes for these cretins?  
Cheer yourself up with a giggle at this FBPE tantrum over Brexit   
Some legend could land Boris Johnson in jail. He faces court action over his false claim Brexit would free up an extra £350m for the NHS. Marcus J Ball, who’s leading the charge, says the case could set a legal precedent that helps prevent politicians lying in general (Canary)  
Brexit means the UK losing access to 759 Trade Agreements with 50+ countries, the Single Market, Customs Union & damaging international supply chains 
Ignoring the crosstika for one moment, this is the Brexit mindset.  
One of the great failures of this time in history is the notion that anyone should give a platform to a referendum on the truth. A thing is either true or it isn’t. We don’t need debates on what women see with their own eyes any more than we need to debate climate change. 
Heather Wheeler, Tory Housing Minister, couldn't explain the rise in rough sleeping.Karen Bradley, Northern Ireland Secretary, understands nothing about Northern Ireland.Theresa May insists, "Brexit means Brexit."#ToriesOut #EndHomelessness

Well said @PeterBoneUK,#Chequers is not #Brexit. We can, and we must do better.Thank you for pledging to #StandUp4Brexit 
Remoaner Tory MP joins the campaign for a 2nd EU Referendum. He clearly doesn’t respect democracy, the Tory manifesto or his constituents.  He should be sacked..  
Great to be @peoplesvote_uk rally in Cardiff. We must have a Peoples Vote on the final Brexit deal. Great speeches inc NUS, Royal College Of Midwives, campaigners and businesses talking about the damage a hard Brexit will do to our communities and economy #PeoplesVoteCymru 
Please watch this. Retweet. Share. This is the face of #Brexit. If you voted Brexit you own this too. It’s that simple. I will not see our UK hijacked like this. It’s appalling .#notinmyname#howwillbrexithelp 
In the face of Brexit and a media that talks Scotland down constantly, Scotland is still an amazing place to live and work.When independence comes, it'll go from amazing to extraordinary.There is nowhere else on Earth like Scotland and it's her folk that make her great! 
I wrote a deep dive into @UKLabour's plans to take their utilities back under public ownership, the party's climate plans and what Brexit has to do with it  
Glad people are talking Norway, but that Nick Boles Brexit plan is bananas. 
More than 2,000,000 who voted for Brexit now want to stay in EU Of course they do - seen through the leaving lies via @MetroUK 
We already knew any kind of #Brexit could be brutal for business; adding to this, the No Deal papers have revealed the web of red tape just waiting to strangle small and medium-sized businesses. 
"Conservative MP Guto Bebb told BBC Radio 4's Today that it would be "undemocratic" not to offer the public a say once it was known what the shape of the Brexit agreement secured by the Prime Minister looked like." 
It was a real pleasure to be out speaking to Horsham people this morning about their views on how Brexit is going. Our Brexometer showed huge support for a People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal.  
17.4m people voted for Brexit!But 48.1m people did NOT and we have a message for Brexit supporters.Sort out your shit-show and decide WHICH version of Brexit you want to implement. Because you can sprinkle general Brexity dust around any more.Time for a particular plan.  
our new merch store is open #irexit #freedom #brexit  
In the final days of the 2016 referendum polls showed that voters preparing to back Brexit thought 20% of the UK population -around 14m people -were EU immigrants. The true figure was just 5% & lower still in most of the regions that supported Brexit. MSM let everyone down 
The results of the #woolwich Brexitometer are clear. People think #Brexit is damaging the economy, that it’s bad for #woolwich and they want a #peoplesvote on the final deal. Take note @mtpennycook and @Cllrjfahy. @GreenwichInEU @Open_Britain @OFOCBrexit @FFSake_ 
Once Brexit squeezes on the purse strings of Westminster, they're not going to suddenly start caring about Hull or Swansea. They'll just use it as an excuse for MORE austerity. #BrexitNorth 
A huge thank you to all our speakers, @MitchBenn for compering, and to the over 500 of you that packed the venue for an absolutely brilliant #PeoplesVoteCymru rally. Now let's go out there and demand a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. Please RT:  
The catastrophic effects of Brexit summed up in one fact. Liam Fox's department has wasted £1 billion in two years with zero result. And simultaneously, May has cut £1 billion from children's services. Which is the better use of funds?  
Shame on you & Julie Birchill for trying to CREATE class divisions.The data shows a typical #Brexiter is a well-off pensioner in the South of England. Most significant indicators for voting #Brexit are age & education, not class. Working class youth overwhelmingly voted Remain.  
The anti-Brexit Bank of England is not ‘independent’, just unaccountable to the people. Its way of doing things sums up what Leave voters revolted against, writes Mick Hume  
This is one of the most galling aspects of Brexit, particularly for those of us who devoted significant portions of our lives to promoting UK interests and policies in the EU. The reality is that UK was very successful and significant in shaping the EU 1/  
Willie Rennie says @scotlibdems will not support any @SNP budget unless #Indyref2 is taken off the table, all while he and his party demand a 2nd Brexit vote. Willie Rennie and @scotlibdems are hypocrites! 
Some of our group out campaigning against the #powergrab. So many can already see how bad Brexit is going to be #DissolveTheUnion #indyref2 #activeSNP 
This was the final state of our Brexitometer when we packed up this afternoon, for an area that voted 52% to leave not many people feel Brexit is a good idea anymore and they support a #PeoplesVote. The public mood is shifting! @LibDems @catherinemep @EuroMove_MK @BBC3CR @mkfm

A letter to the Labour MPs who didn't give a damn about fighting the Tories in the wake of the Brexit vote, but have had a total change of heart now that prospect of democratic reselection of Labour MPs is looming.Please Retweet to ensure they see it. 
May warned Chequers will destroy Brexit - 'Deliver EU exit vote now' 
BBC admits ‘we get climate change coverage wrong too often’.Time to admit the same on Brexit, @BBC.Stop wall-to-wall coverage of every shady pro-Brexit group.⁦Start giving full and fair @BBCNews coverage to #Remain and #StopBrexit voices. 
The U.S. voted for Trump and the U.K. voted for BrexitThe similarities are obvious, and can be summarised in the following line:Convince the lower educated, that all their shortfalls and problems, will totally disappear, IF immigration is stopped, and we're the guys to do it 
Strange how you invoke the malevolence of Putin to support your case, despite being a hapless votary of the very same Brexit that is a regular feature in the soggiest of Vladimir's wet dreams.Isn't it curious how your logic makes no sense when you stop to examine it?  
Julie Burchill saying 'I like chaos/Brexit' translates as 'I'm bored, and my wealth will insulate me from whatever happens next'. 
Thanks again @BritishGQ. I will continue to work tirelessly until justice is served for the Grenfell and Windrush victims.With increasing division, poverty, xenophobia, and Brexit looming, there is much work to do. As I said here, the time to act is now. 
Dear Mr Privileged, as an MEP I can state that EU caused terrorism with Schengen/open border policies. When I asked for a debate on returning jihadis, I was outvoted. Globalism will be stopped by nation states, EU is globalist. #Brexit was a democratic vote against you, the elite  
There are enough resources in this country to ensure every worker is paid a genuine living wage. We are right to be thoroughly angry about the state of Britain today, but it wasn't the fault of immigrants. @natalieben today at the Stop Brexit conference in Leeds #brexitnorth 
Absolutely packed venue at #PeoplesVoteCymru rally in Cardiff today. Wales demands a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal!  
Really excited to be speaking at #PeoplesVoteCymru today on behalf of young people in Wales! Wales is a brilliant, beautiful and innovative country, and we will not be broken by Brexit. #PeoplesVote#FFS 
No, you just made that up Godfree.Tell me where, in the literature sent to us, or the EURef, where it was said we'd have to vote again on HOW we leave?Show me one speech where ANYONE suggested there would be a need for another referendum.Then stop crying, you're embarrassing. 
I wouldn't shun someone I knew who voted for Brexit, but I'd have already shunned Julie for the hateful, harmful, and vile piece she wrote in 2013.  
Brexitometer doing well in Beckenham today #FBPE #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FinalSay #LibDems 
I’m here today at the #PeoplesVoteCymru rally in Cardiff Bay. People have turned up from across Wales to demand a say on the Tories final #Brexit deal. We must have a #PeoplesVote #ChangeTakesCourage 
And while I understand the political need to to change their minds, and yes, a selfish stance against Brexit is acceptable given where we are, we still need to confront the racism and xenophobia that made them vote Brexit 
#Brexit is going to make those in #poverty poorer  #PovertyAfterBrexit via @MetroUK 
They are now recanting their vote not because they suddenly have informatin they did not have before. It’s because they are beginning to realise that the pain caused by Brexit will not be limited to immigrants, foreigners, ‘those people.’

‘Only a legal miracle can save us from a disastrous Brexit – we need to delay the whole process now’  
If these were Russian gov assassins, they were the most incompetent assassins in history.No attempt was made to hide their origin or movements & the target wasn't killed.Alternatively its a frame up by the UK gov as a #BrExit distraction & to stoke up anti Russia hysteria.  
You know I tried not to wake this morning. I was dreaming of a big table with Boris at its head and Jacob/nige/anne/liam/andrea/david/gerrard. And the mp.s that resigned over chequers sitting around it Discussing Brexit. With all the conservative party united.   Then I woke up! 
With the greatest of respect Phillip, you are talking absolute rubbish. The opposite of what you say is true. Trust will be shattered if we are seen to ignore the referendum result. 
A home truth: you stood on a manifesto commitment to deliver full Brexit and it now seems you lied! To force people to vote again when you haven't enacted the firstone is grossly antidemocratic. We had our #PeoplesVote and our #FinalSay was leave! #Brexit 
Exclusive interview with ⁦@matteosalvinimi⁩ on ⁦@BBCWorld⁩ Wednesday #Migration #Brexit  
A home truth: if the Government doesn’t act on the growing demand for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit, it will be blamed for what follows. @Conservatives need to realise that, if we don’t give our people a #FinalSay, we stand to lose both our country and the trust we need to govern it 
Rees-Mogg’s unfeeling and inaccurate letter to Lord Adonis has hopefully put another nail in the Brexit coffin. Who wants that sort of leadership and that sort of Britain? 
Walthamstow labour voted on Thursday to put a people’s vote forward to labour party conference- we want labour to fight Brexit, not each other! #changenotchaos  
Don't vote Labour. They want a Second referendum.  
For me this is the main reason why #Brexit is virtually impossible because of the Good Friday agreement.  Most people on the mainland especially #leavers  don't understand the fundamental issue. 
If ⁦@The_TUC⁩ backs this motion, it could be a real game changer in stopping Tory #Brexitshambles. Great to see #NHS unions leading, given damage #Brexit is already causing our #NHS #PeoplesVote 
Brexit WARNING: May will be 'OUSTED within TWO MONTHS' if she doesn't drop Chequers plan  
Tbh I forgot that Guto Bebb even existed, now that I've read that he is the fifth Conservative MP to join the People's Vote on Brexit I will continue to ignore his existence. 
You can have Brexit or you can have the United Kingdom.YOU DON'T GET BOTH! 
No to a 2nd EU referendum. Yes to a snap general election. 
Just imagine if you'd all united to slam the Tories in 2016 for creating Brexit without even developing a contingency plan for if their gamble backfired.Instead you threw away this once in a lifetime chance to attack the Tories to knife Corbyn in the back.Shame on you!  
It is now crucial the MPs stand up for the country. The concern is that they put their careers first, thereby ensuring the #brexit was created by a career politician and secured by career politicians... all being manipulated by the Far Right machine... 
The leaders of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg warn they won’t allow a piecemeal approach to EU rules 
Referendum and restructuring are the solution to Nigeria's problem. Thanks to Buhari our nation is primed for civil war.2019 will be the catalyst for that war and it will be fought on religious and ethnic lines.All this because of one mad man who believes that he owns Nigeria.

I have less than a tenner in the bank today. I worry about affording to feed my family next week. I voted Remain. YOU are a clueless idiot who has NO idea about the real world. How dare you claim to know us, you know NOTHING! Brexit is for the rich, NOBODY else! #PeoplesVoteNow 
This is from @BorisJohnson’s column in the Telegraph written a few days after the referendum. As Foreign Secretary, he did not answer correspondence asking him to confirm this position.So, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, do you support this assertion, or not?@Andrew_Adonis 
Forget the referendum for a moment.We then had a general election when two of the main parties endorsed the referendum result in their manifestos.It wasn't just one off vote therefore.The democratic die is cast, live with it.  
A good prime minister would look at the Brexit referendum lies, call the whole bloody Brexit thing off and prosecute those who told the lies.A good opposition would be screaming for the PM to do exactly that. We have neither. Q

So, with six months to go, the Leave campaign finally admit they have no solution to the problem they created and are now forced to turn to an EU expert for help. You couldn't make it up but they've been doing just that all along!!! 
Agree. The sneering unpleasantness of Dominic Raab is a absolute gift to remain!!!The more exposure he gets the worse it is for brexit. Raab is a gift to to remain!!!Remainers should boost his exposure.  
Generation Remain can still stop this Brexit nonsense.  
You've been warned May. Abandon Chequers and deliver a proper Brexit.  
Please remember when we are sending £200 million NET a week to EU it’s the poorest in society who miss that money most from their local schools &  hospitals as wealthy more insulated from these shortages. #Brexit 
Raab can’t handle stress. Is rude, bullying.  Doesn’t build alliance and help build communityIt’s a great shame for brexit he’s it’s official flag waverThe more it’s is associated with such an alienating man, the more unpopular it will getAssociation w/ Raab hurts brexit...  
Read this & you will understand why Rees-Mogg & David Davis said today that they won’t publish their Brexit ‘plan.’ They daren’t  
[2/4] Nor am I a 'separatist radical'. No, I'm doing it for 4 simple reasons (1) I'm a democrat. (2) I believe Catalonia should have been (& still should be) granted the right to have a self-determination referendum; you never know, Spain, the result might not be your worst fear. 
The Brexiteers do not want a second referendum as they know they will not be able to sell to the electorate any deal that we gain.  They know that no matter how good a deal we get we are all going to be worse off!!!  
“As part of a the new campaign group  #StandUp4Brexit, Tory Brexiteer @PeterBoneUK has urged @Theresa_May to abandon her Chequers proposal as it fails to deliver the Brexit people voted for in the 2016 referendum”

This.This is all you need to know.After 25 years of advocating Brexit, a ££ campaign for Brexit, starting the Brexit process, walking away from their own cabinet Brexit plans, the Brexit purists still can’t agree on a plan for Brexit.... so they’ll do some protesting. pic.twitter.com/aA1rpspFRF 
So much of #brexit woes lie in the false legitimacy of the bloody 2016 referendum. On such a rickety, corrupt & badly framed process no consent or policy can be foundedAll sides lost in itEnd Brexit & have a grown up political conversationRenew & restore our democracy 
An incoming Labour Govt will face a FEARSOME task.*Brexit chaos*Public services in meltdown*Carnage created by Tory social policiesWhilst the MAJORITY of Labour MPs are getting on with the *day job*, a SMALL number seem to be determined to SABOTAGE the prospect of a Lab Govt. 
The Tories have voted that animals can't feel pain as part of the EU bill, marking the beginning of our anti-science Brexit .   I’m by no means POLITICAL BUT where Animals are concerned then YES I am so #British Government have decided Animals are worthless 
But... Women voted during the Brexit referendum   
[Bursting into Jeremy Corbyn's toilet]Perhaps instead of wiping that you should maybe, I don't know, *stop Brexit*!? 
The latest scare story about Brexit is that we may have a shortage of Toilet Paper. Scotland will be ok though we have free copies of The National.  
“Brexit is a project of the elite, for the elite.” - @ChukaUmunna at #BAMEVoices 
"Up until the last couple of years, the centre left was always considered to be a legitimate part of the Labour tradition" - @ChukaUmunna is urging @jeremycorbyn to "call of the dogs" and "fight this Tory #Brexit".For more on the story:  
#brexit This is what 17 million who voted leave. Think of same MUPPETS trying to derail Brexit everyday. Owen Jones, Chuka Umunna, David Lammy, Anna Soubry, Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair, John Major. Others    
Opinion: The Brexit referendum ignored the voices of women. We need a #FinalSay to put that right 
That is a £39bn loss.It cannot be a victory.No £39bn. WTO Brexit.  
Very well expressed by Dan Snow. It’s time for us all to look again at where we are in the world, where we are with the Brexit process.  
Given the destructive consequences of Brexit, UK citizens living in the EU deserve a #FinalSayOnTheDeal, as much as citizens residing in the UK. UK citizens living in EU could face losing access to bank accounts and pensions – they deserve the opportunity to say ‘No’ too 
Sorry to say this but Corbyn may care for the poor & "the many"He may knit mittens for orphans in his spare timeBut as long as he's supporting #Brexit, normalizing "Foriners are taking our jobs" & misleading the public on a "cost free jobs first" option he's a bad egg  
If there’s a vote and Brexit is rejected outright, it won’t be the 2016 Remainers ‘wot did it’ - they are a minority. Don’t worry about them. It’d be the 2016 Leave voters & new voters that tip the balance and re-set the course of the country. It’s about their consent.  
They shelve their plan because they haven't got one. They can stand on the sidelines criticising others but they can't come up with workable ideas of their own. Brexit can tear down but it can't build up. Time to reboot. #PeoplesVote 
I completely agree with Dan Snow on Brexit. Millions of voters were tricked into voting for something that is fundamentally against their best interests. We must, as a nation, demand a second referendum before we do something that we will regret for decades to come. #PeoplesVote 
Filling up already at the #BrexitNorth Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference in #Leeds. T-minus 30 minutes! 
Don’t often hear John Swinney raise his voice. But of course he’s right. When the history books are written, and Brexit is analysed, I doubt many will look at the Scottish Conservatives with much admiration.  
An overwhelming number of women fear promises made by politicians on #Brexit will be broken.No one voted for broken promises. We need a #PeoplesVote#W4PV 
Well said @PeterBoneUK The people want #Brexit which ends free movement, stops us sending billions to Brussels, and gives us back control of our laws"We need to #ChuckChequers and we need to have the Brexit that British people voted for. That's why I'm standing up for Brexit"  
Britain - "Imagine there was a remain/leave referendum tomorrow, how would you vote?"Remain 51%Leave 49%Leavers 93% "leave", Remainers 93% "remain"Con voters 73% "leave", Lab voters 66% "remain"18-24 yrs 71% "remain", 65 yrs + 63% "leave"Source @Survation Sep 7 
Please, please do. All of you who feel that way. Off you trot: to the party that elected a massive anti abortionist & homophobe as its leader, enabled brexit, waved in tuition fees, and traded the lives of thousands of the poorest via welfare cuts, for a plastic bag ruling.BYE.  
It’s time to stop talking about ‘when’ Brexit happens and time to start saying 'if'.  
Best wishes to Hermann Kelly and the new Irexit Freedom Party launching today to fight for Ireland's independence from the EU. #Irexit #Brexit  
Why does Chukka keep hiding behind ‘his constituents?’ You’re telling me that the number one priority in Streatham right now is Brexit?!Even if true, it’s not the ONLY problem there right now is it? Undermining Jeremy, scuppers their chance for a Labour government. Top MP! #JC4PM 
Some think Rees-Mogg is an amusing toff, actually he’s a nasty, privileged piece of work. Puts fear into EU residents living here.Votes for Brexit as his company moves to Ireland to dodge UK market “uncertainty”.Just f*** off, Mogg. #VictorianDadFromViz 
A fifth Conservative MP has joined the People's Vote campaign.Guto Bebb supports the idea of giving the British people a referendum on the final Brexit deal.The movement is growing in public and Parliament. 
Time to admit the same on Brexit  
Please sign this #peoplesvote.  I have changed my position drastically since the last #referendum and believe we should all be given a chance to change the dire situation our country is headed into. #itsnevertoolate 
Increasingly difficult for ⁦@UKLabour⁩ to back away from a #PeoplesVote, with the option to remain on the ballot, as unions, the public & MPs add diverse voices of support amidst an unstable & desperate political disaster zone. #Brexit  
Ahh, the situation with Brexit worsens. . . .Now there is talk about negotiating a trade agreement over the next few years. . . .presumably in the belief that during this time the EU will see a government prepared to reverse Brexit. Forget it morons, it won´t work. We're leaving. 
Why haven’t I heard a single country in the world say “hey Brexit Britain, we really want to import more Cheddar. We’re going to lower all our import tariffs for you”? This is such a gaping logical hole in Leavers’ arguments. We want to EXPORT more, not IMPORT more. 
What the Lib Dem’s offer for Scotland is a Brexit disaster with all the attendant economic disaster and food stockpiling. Imagine a parties ambition that this is as good as Scotland can get.  
For Julie from Bristol, voting for Brexit was political equivalent of getting tanked up on a Saturday night, punching a police officer, spewing over a bouncer and collapsing in the gutter in a pool of her own piss.  
Significant. Another Tory MP, former defence minister ⁦@GutoAberconwy⁩, backs #PeoplesVote as only way out of the Brexit mess and attacks “Brexit purists who simply appear to care not an iota about the future prosperity of this country”   
A reminder of how grossly voters were misinformed at the time of the 2016 referendum - entirely to the benefit of Leave. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit 
BBC Sports presenter @mrjakehumphrey suggests he voted Leave in 2016 - but now he's backing a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal.  
I'm working class. I voted against Brexit because Brexit will make "my people" poorer. It's just the result of a generation of politicians shifting responsibility for their own failings onto the EU, and a generation of journalists being too cozy and lazy to correct them.

Voters got it right the first time. So did Guto Bebb when he said "you cannot have voted for a referendum only to then try and stop the decision being implemented". #r4today 
This lady speaks for millions not just in United Kingdom but across the whole continent. Hundreds of millions from Helsinki to Lisbon feel the EU is unaccountable, over reaching itself and does not respect their nation’s sovereignty. More will want to take back control #Brexit  
Actually this is serious anti democratic behaviour. The parliament Rennie sits in has voted for a referendum. He now seeks to subvert the will of parliament by refusing to agree the country's budget unless the vote he lost is overturned. 
Former Conservative Defence Minister and Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb has made a major intervention in the Brexit debate by making the case for a #PeoplesVote 
Across the UK, millions of people are completely unaware about why the #EU was started, how it functions, or what are its benefits. Today, spread some knowledge about the EU. Share this 4-minute video. Because knowledge is the best defence against #Brexit.  
Here's the article referred to by @Andrew_Adonis . @thetimes reports that the #Brexit team can't agree their own strategy largely because of @BorisJohnson . They are scammers and we need @peoplesvote_uk . 
Does the Labour party know anything about how Brexit will damage Northern Ireland?Or do they just not care?  
Total self-own by Guto Bebb today. He previously told off another MP who wanted a 2nd referendum. He got it right the first time.

I’m told on good authority that Mr Raab talks to Rees-Mogg & ERG’s Steve Baker ‘almost every day’ to get his negotiating instructions. This is making relations with his civil servants ‘virtually impossible’ & there are now ‘two parallels Brexit negotiating teams’

As composer Howard Goodall said: “No-one should be surprised that music lovers want to express their solidarity with professional musicians over the issue of the damage Brexit will do to their livelihoods...” 
This is how it is seen across the continent and our neighbours won’t forget it in a hurry. In the 1940s, the UK came to the rescue, and enjoyed a 50-year brand bonus as a result. Brexit destroys that, now we’re the cowards who quit and left others to do the hard work.

Says @ChukaUmunna, who has done nothing but attack Jeremy Corbyn for the last 3yrs, including a self-indulgent vote of no confidence in 2016 when Labour should have been focused on fighting the Tories in the aftermath of the referendum. The lack of self-awareness is staggering.  
My American brothers and sisters, you have it easy over there for now with Mr trump. It's a nightmare for us British patriots. TRUMP FOR BREXIT. 
Actually Brexiteers obviously don't really mean that they want respect for democracy. If they did, they would welcome another referendum, now that everyone is much better acquainted with the facts. What they really mean is that we must respect their successful deception. 
Brexit means brexit I suppose  @overwatchleague

The government caused austerity, subsequently the government orchestrated brexit. Do the people of Britain have a greater enemy than its own government? 
How’d that work out for you BHO?From 2016: Obama launches a presidential campaign blitz for Hillary Clinton unprecedented in the modern era, pledging a dramatic commitment to a contest he frames as a referendum on his personal & political prestige.  
What I am most looking forward to after Brexit is Jacob Rees Mogg’s weekly broadcast announcing how, despite all evidence to the contrary, chocolate rations are up again. 
John Cleese's press office denies he is the secret mind behind the government's current Brexit preparations 
A thought: Some super-rich and extremely powerful people are pulling the strings of the British state. They are directing Brexit and engineering the disintegration of the EU. For their own gain they are leading us to war. But scarier: Don't know if it's paranoia or an epiphany. 
Boris may not be everyone’s cup of tea but he is a leader who believes in Brexit, will stand up to the EU, will fight to make our departure a success & deliver the Brexit we voted for.  May never wanted to leave the EU & her Chequers plan was a total sell out, Brexit in name only

Weirdest interview I’ve ever witnessed on #newsnight Julie Burchill behaving like a spoilt child. Two middle class rich famous jouronos saying they like #Brexit cos they like “chaos”. It’s alright for you but not for the most vulnerable in this country. Grow up the pair of you

Brexit poll shows Londoners would now vote 2-1 to remain in the EU  
And, of course, DOING BREXIT AT ALL is the PM’s personal decision relying on the referendum alone. See our case to confirm this. Intolerable. Unacceptable. Insulting.  
The Times reports that Brexit Tories have agreed to give May a two-month stay of execution. The argument is that she will try to defend Chequers at the Party conference and become even more unpopular. It doesn’t convince me. She needs to go now.

Now some senior leavers are saying "Brexit is not worth it now" 
When Conservative ministers who campaigned for Brexit confront the detail involved in removing the UK from EU, they tend either to soften their position or resign, unable to accomplish in reality something that was conceived in fantasy. 
Belated but important recognition by BBC that “balance” does not require including points of view detached from factual reality.  Might be worth bearing in mind when discussing #Brexit  
Northern Ireland has no govt and Brexit risks destroying its fragile peace, and our PM cared so little that she handed stewardship of it to a woman who revelled in her total ignorance but who had once been loyal. Let’s be clear: Bradley is an incompetent, but May is a disgrace

When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of September 7, 2018 at 05:50PM, £1 buys 1.1109€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote 
#Brexit Sec knew nothing about the #EUForeign Sec knew nothing about diplomacyDefence Sec knows nothing about defenceHome Sec knew nothing about Immigration controlNorthern Ireland Sec knows nothing about NI is par for the course for #Tories 
That's it 35 years of the 8th is officially over. Certification of the referendum can proceed. Legislation can be passed. It's done. #repealedThe8th 
Boris knows Brexit is a national disater but will argue publicly for the Hardest Brexit possible as the best thing to do now to further his career. #Tosser 
Another journey round the Brexit loop. My latest Brexit Blog post discussing Mervyn King, the ERG, the revival of the 'Canada option', no deal planning, and 'blind Brexit':  
No Deal Brexit is 8% damage to GDP A Deal (FTA) is 6% damage to GDP Either are awful 2008 crash was 2% damage #context #Brexit 
The referendum ballot paper should have had two options.1) Remain in the EU2) Wreck the economy, ruin peoples lives, destroy jobs, more austerity, higher taxes and fuck the NHSTick only one box, this a once in life time opportunity to inform government policy. 
From being the fastest growing economy in the G7 before the referendum to languishing towards the bottom 2 years later. This is why we're demanding a #PeoplesVote. Please RT: 
Superbly said by Julie Birchill, succinctly setting out the class divisions on Brexit. Rich v Poor, Comfortable class v ignored & derided class  
This is an abomination, so what do we do with our homes, business, British  children and partners, my pension funds my taxes national insurance who is going to give me my investment back. This is a betrayal an absolute disloyalty from brexit vote  
Our intrepid #Brexitometer team were in #Helston today, just a step from Wetherspoons.Even so, very few peope thought #Brexit was going well and the big majority wanted a #PeoplesVote (including some who voted Leave & now regret it).The tide has turned in #Cornwall!

“My people have been treated like dumb pawns in the European game for many decades.”Julie Burchill, journalist and playwright, explains why she voted for Brexit. Full interview tonight 22:30#newsnight 
Emotional at this news. One step closer to Irish women not having to travel for abortions. Grateful to the judges ”Their refusal to hear an appeal means the way is cleared to formal certification of the result of the referendum.” #RepealedThe8th 
Yet again, ⁦@MarinaHyde⁩ will have you weeping, with laughter or misery, after you’ve choked on another grand week of political imbecility by our Brexit govt.   
Those leaked pictures of Operation Yellowhammer show that Brexit threatens to bring austerity back. It's time we put power back in the hands of the British people and gave them a final say on whatever sham of a deal is brought back by this government.  
The people spoke 2 years ago, but that wasn't the end of #democracy... Stop pinning 100% of the blame on @theresa_may, she's not a scapegoat, #Brexit was doomed to be a disaster from the start... Let the people speak again when we know the reality of #Brexit not fantasy bullshit  
Today’s Supreme Court decision now means we can get on with acting on the people’s instruction in the referendum to repeal the 8th amendment and care for women in our own country. Lots of work ahead. Plans remain on track. Pass the legislation in this Dáil session. 
Flatulent Hard Brexit plotters fail the “ piss up in a brewery” test (again): they withdraw their alternative Brexit Plan ( again) & postpone May’s Ides of March assassination until November (again), all this  before hero Boris gets his dick in a wringer (again) pic.twitter.com/JFcA9vS7ih 
The Chancellor warned Govt could be borrowing around £80bn a year more by 2033-34. This emphasises the scale of the crisis we face if this #Brexit nightmare goes ahead. The Govt must wake up, see the looming catastrophe, and give the people a chance to #ExitFromBrexit

Brexit means.... ah well that depends.... Good thread on the unresolvability of Brexit... which begs the question - if you can’t define the mandate, how can you deliver it?  
We'll never forget Boris Johnson's hard work during the referendum campaign. We need him as leader.  
Evanston group trying to save Harley Clarke Mansion kicks off its advisory referendum campaign tonight. The group is inviting residents to learn more about the issue. The event begins at 7 pm at the mansion, 2603 Sheridan Road.  
Jacob Rees-Mogg is nothing more than a political hedge funder. A disaster capitalist. He doesn’t even believe in Brexit. He’s shifted his investment funds to Ireland. For him, Brexit is just a game. It’s mere bagatelle to him. 
It's important that people make their voice heard in #Macedonia's historic 9/30 referendum on agreement with Greece settling the country's official name.  Check out my interview with @VOANews citing recent IRI polling on this issue. @IRIglobal 
It reflects the way that Brexiters' comfort zone is campaigning and protesting, rather than governing - hence the biggest irony of Brexit is that Brexiters would have been much happier if they'd lost the referendum:  
Man who as leading government minister failed to make sense of Brexit joins rally ‘as a matter of principle’ - to make sense of Brexit .... I am so glad politics is full of comedians because there nothing on the telly.

Theresa May claims that a ‘second’ referendum on Brexit would be “a gross betrayal” of our democracy. Precisely the opposite is true.  
UK is ‘trapped in a recurring cycle of silly behaviour’ on Brexit, EU Commissioner says  
Yes!!!!"Tom Watson, the deputy leader of the Labour party, has called on the government to confirm if the National Crime Agency is looking into whether there was Russian interference in the EU referendum." 
‘No deal’ Brexit is simply not an option and poses catastrophic risks to the economy.@cbicarolyn speaking at the @CBI_Scotland Annual Conference: #SDAnnualDinner 
“Brexit: EU sees 'positive elements' in UK's Chequers plan.” In a conspiracy between No 10 & EU we’re witnessing political theatre to con the British people into believing that a negotiated version of Chequers will give us a good deal. In fact it = Remain.  
A sleight of hand brought us Brexit. #StopBrexitSaveBritain 
China says UK navy 'provocation' has jeopardised post-Brexit trade deal

“I am backing a People’s Vote because Brexit threatens our health service. The NHS is a modern marvel. The world’s first truly national health service and still one of the best.” 
UK’s Brexit proposals 'not workable, basically' says EU's Michel Barnier. He re-iterated to MPs that the EU would not accept splitting up aspects of the single market, and that it would not delegate EU customs duties to British officials after #Brexit  
My latest for The New European - the Brexit Bunch speak in cliches because their thinking is as lazy as their hackneyed phrases  
Was @UKLabour founded to fight for working people, or attack excellent MPs like @gavinshuker & @joanryanEnfield who have always been their champions?  This madness needs to stop - all energy instead should be focused on fighting this terrible Tory Brexit. #FixUp 
For those that think Brexit won’t harm touring UK musicians because they toured Europe before the EU and just used Carnets. It might all be fine of course, but it really might not be. It’s impossible to know and that means missed bookings now.  
Theresa May’s Brexit proposals 'not workable, basically' says EU's Michel Barnier.    
Philip Hammond drops a not so subtle hint/threat that no deal Brexit could provide ammunition for eurosceptics in May's EU elections: 'It's very much in interests of EU27 that Brexit runs smoothly. Remember this event is happening just 8/9 weeks before EU parliament elections.' 
Project fear has been proven completely wrong. There was no recession, no 800,000 jobs lost, no emergency budget and no plagues.  Yet still remoaners can't admit they were wrong. They do not respect democracy and think we are all stupid for wanting our country back. #Brexit

Now “Karen” we are more than just a wee bit miffed!Karen Bradley has brazenly understated that ppl in the north of Ireland are “slightly offended” at how the border is being handled in Brexit negotiations“slightly offended” She needs to go; in fact they all do#Clueless 
“The poll found that if UK leaves the EU 52% of people here would vote for a united Ireland. If there was a hard border that figure goes up to 56%. Of those from a ‘nationalist heritage’, an astounding 94% would vote for a united Ireland in the event  of Brexit.”- Brian Feeney  
The last remaining challenge to the referendum result has been turned down. It’s official - the 8th is history!  
We asked @BenPBradshaw at lunch how prepared he thinks #Plymouth and the far south west is for Brexit  
That's weird I don't *remember* universities pitching Brexit as an idea and voting specifically for it. I could be wrong but.  
Miggeldy can sign the referendum result today on the 35th anniversary of the vote on the 8th! #RepealedThe8th 
Hang on! Is this?Brexit? 
Correct, EU Global Strategy, including the ‘New Level of Ambition in Defence’.EUGS ties together foreign and defence policy with a new geo-strategic outlook for the EU equipped with new military capability.Announced 3 days after Brexit vote and UK has joined all of it since. 
Pharmaceutical medicines and drugs will be available after Brexit. This scaremongering needs to stop. 
It's over! We're hearing reports that the Supreme Court has refused to hear an appeal to the referendum result. The Hateful Eight Amendment has fallen after 35 years! #repealedthe8th 
Another journey round the Brexit loop. My latest Brexit Blog post discussing Mervyn King, the ERG, the revival of the 'Canada option', no deal planning, and more is just up:  
One day I’ll take my grandchildren to London to show them the #SODEM statue and teach them how the good people of the UK fought hate and stopped Brexit.I am ever thankful to @SODEMAction for all that they do. 
Promising not to stand down until Brexit is "resolved" means @vincecable is set to be leader until about 2047... 
The Liberal Democrats have so lost sight of what we stand for that even the party leader now seems to be forgetting that we are, at our core, a liberal party, not merely a centrist anti-Brexit one. 
While we're all making divorce/Brexit jokes at the expense of Boris Johnson the important thing we must not forget is that he's in a lot of pain right now and we can take comfort from that.  
Every time, the media fawns over #TonyBlair and asks him soft questions about Brexit, I know with dread that they are ensuring the hardest of Brexits for Britain. 
REFERENDUM CHALLENGE: We lost. The judges said no leave. God Bless everybody who prayed. May God protect you and your families from all harm. We had 99 days of no abortion on demand. Praise God.#prolife,#savethe8th 
In response to John Howell's recent article in the Thame Gazette. "Brexit is not high on the list of local people's priorities" we would like to invite Mr Howell to  one of our street stalls to discover how his constituents are really feeling about Brexit @JHowellUK 
Enabling the Tories on Brexit. It's the one thing Corbyn knows how to do. It's the only thing he's ever done which has actually changed anything, and it has changed it massively for the worse.His A50 whipping and Brexit enabling is why I will never support Corbyn Labour 
Jo Swinson - Our country is heading off the #Brexit cliff & Labour is failing to provide an opposition & in fact they're waving through Theresa May's proposals.. Jeremy Corbyn should be standing up against #Brexit & he's not.#politicslive #PeoplesVote #FBPE 
Only 15.  I blame Brexit, Trump and - naturally - Fatcha.  
Why wouldn't I support him, what's not to like?  I find it hilarious that some of you #FBPE cultists spend all your time attacking the Labour leader rather than the Tories that are literally the cause for Brexit. Very strange strategy to win support.

More discussions in Berlin this morning with my old friend Peter Altmaier, the former head of Angela Merkel’s office and now economics minister. He’s been grappling with Brexit in both.  
Because most of the people I discuss Brexit with, have zero understanding of what the Single Market is and why it exists. Most people still think it's just free trade and free movement of people. 
Man who said Brexit would be simple and then failed to make any progress during  two years as Brexit Minister says he can now deliver Brexit by attending a rally  
The point is, these people were just exercising their right as British Europeans to work and live in the EU. They should not have been treated differently from someone who lives in Bristol or Belfast. Thank you @thomasbrake for your stand against Brexit.  
3) Brexit, in its current form. WILL hurt. That's undeniable, it's just how far, how deep and how long. So, given that, I think we all deserve a safety net, I've been in contact with #PeoplesVote this morning and will give my support however they need it.... 
A message for all remainers, please listen.We are approaching the end game, #PeoplesVote is within our grasp.This is not the time to air personal grievances or to argue about who is the remainiest amongst us. I am not your enemy, you are not mine.The enemy is Brexit.1/ 
Today's visit by the Austrian Chancellor @sebastiankurz is an encouragment and a reminder of the high stakes involved in the upcoming referendum, for the Republic of Macedonia, our friends in Greece, the region as a whole and the EU itself.  
Can you imagine if, in 2014, Scotland's referendum had denied English people living in Scotland - regardless how long - of a vote, then resulted in them being kicked out? I honestly can't, and can't accept this either. 
 'The Brexit Train' - I Fagiolini imagining Flanders & Swann.  (With deepest respects to them.)  Words by @TimothyKnapman @MyStephanomics 
I defy anyone to read this thread from an NHS supplier without profound anxiety at how a hard Brexit may harm patients. It makes @MattHancock’s laissez-faire approach of ‘leave it to anyone but me to sort out’ appear grossly irresponsible. 
Mogg is an evil piece of work, but this is another example of the constant goalpost-shifting Europeans have experienced since well before the referendum from many politicians (including some remain supporters) and media.  
New polls reveal 66% of Londoners would support Remain if there was another referendum

Am currently hosting an international ministerial conference in Addis Abeba, as you do,   - and found myself having lunch with the South African delegation. My question did they think Brexit was a good idea immediately unleashed peals of hysterical giggles.Not a great sign   
This is Femi. Talk to him about #Brexit. This is the view you will see the most, as he runs away on yet another mission to #StopBrexit. What a hero. He stands for our shared EU values. 
Between 2014 and 2020, #Cornwall will receive over €1,000 (£800) per person from the EU Structural and Investment Fund.No-one we talk to here has *any* confidence that this investment will be replaced by Westminster post-#Brexit.#PeoplesVote 
Rees-Mogg getting more and more desperate. The words of a politician that can speak eloquently but totally lacking in compassion and understanding of the very real fears created by these destructive words. Little Britain #Brexit at its vile worst.  
I try to give people the benefit of the doubt and whether they were on the right, left or centre of the political spectrum, I thought that most politicians had some principles. Since Brexit it is evident that too many don’t and their naked ambition could destroy this country 
Good to meet with @AJPhillipson this morning to discuss U.S.-UK relations post-#Brexit, trade and of course, our shared appreciation for the Big Apple! #specialrelationship 
The leaders of France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg warn they won’t allow a piecemeal approach to EU rules 
MUST-READ: Growing numbers of Londoners are swinging against Brexit - With 1 in 10 Londoners who voted Leave would now back Remain. Please RT:  
Jacob Rees-Mogg’s horrific vision of Brexit: This is what happens when Pandora’s Box of xenophobia is opened up. And to think Britain stood up and fought against this sort of right-wing extremism in World War II.  
With this cruel Tory government on the ropes over Brexit, surely time for all parts of @UKLabour to unite against our real enemy: Labour Party MPs. 
Former Brexit Sec David Davis & former UKIP Leader Nigel Farage to join forces with Labour’s Kate Hoey at a Leave MeansLeave rally in Bolton to demand our ref vote is fully respected & Chequers ditched,  Britain must not become an EU colony via May’s plan. 
We have published the transcript of the evidence the Committee took from Michel Barnier in Brussels on Monday, read it here  #Brexit 
So let me get this right. The Brexit Secretary hasn’t done his Brexit homework. The NI Secretary doesn’t know about Unionism. The Trade Secretary ... is Liam Fox. A Government of All The Talents. (Did I miss anyone?)  
So sick of the brexiters go to defense now "you don't respect democracy"If you think lying and cheating to win a referendum by the smallest of margins then denying the people any further say/vote of the subject is democracy then you don't even know what the fucking word means. 
Brexit poll shows Londoners would now vote 2-1 to remain in the EU  
“If you’re a Brexiter, I hope that you won’t vote for the Labour Party. The Labour Party is moving increasingly against Brexit… if you want Brexit you should vote for the party that is going to deliver Brexit, which I’m afraid is the Conservatives.” - Labour peer @Andrew_Adonis 
Couldn’t care less who Boris Johnson may or may not be casually screwing in his private life.Do however care very much that, deep inside her No 10 bunker, Theresa May is busy assiduously screwing Brexit, her own party, the country, and arguably even UK democracy itself. 
The Conservative party narrowly voted against retainIng EU human rights measures in UK law post-Brexit last night by 311 votes to 301.This is utterly shameful 
Exciting reforms set out by @vincecable to open up Liberal Democrats. So many people are dismayed by politics right now, with Brexit chaos and Tories & Labour veering off to extremes. @LibDems can be the rallying point to defend liberal values. Join us. 
Blair is fighting against #Brexit which is the one absolutely dominating Tory policy. If it goes the Tories will disintegrate. What is Mr Corbyn doing? 
#Blair is on the TV talking about #Brexit, while "journalists" nod along like he isn't one of the greatest war criminals & profiteers in history.Later today they'll talk about "#Nato values" & "human rights" & "rules based int'l order" without a shred of irony.

Hormone-pumped US beef would pose an “unnecessary and unacceptable risk to public health” if it is allowed to be sold in the UK post-Brexit.

Reminder that Brexit is a complete waste of money for our already stretched NHS...  
Prediction: if there is a Tory leadership contest before Christmas it will be won by Boris Johnson. But if the contest is next year or later it won't be. Boris makes sense while terms of Brexit can be reset. But post Brexit my tip would be @PennyMordaunt 
This is one of the most embarrassing things I've ever seen. A grown man being told what to answer, when to have a break, if he'll be coming back. Like a child at school. He claims to speak for millions of Britons in opposing Brexit. He can't even speak for himself 
72% of young people in Wales think that promises made by Brexit politicians will be broken. They’re right - promises that had been made to the people of Wales have not been kept. #FFS#PeoplesVote

The new 'Operation Skylark' report is leaked.It shows contingency planning in the event of Brexit being halted.A glimpse of page 1 reveals the phrases 'gigantic street party', ' national holiday',  'dancing in fountains',  'knighting of David Lammy' and 'Dame Gina Miller'. 
May plans new bus tour to resuscitate Brexit and fight #PeoplesVote 
What change has he made? Privately educated career politician looking to make change with policies that sound good, but could not be guaranteed to be paid for unless we borrow. In addition- his Brexit position will ensure his policies are nothing more than a socialist utopia. 
I like the sound of this David Davis guy. We should get him to negotiate Brexit. He'd show them. 
It's quite incredible that @PatKennyNT spins the narrative that "it suits both the SF  & the DUP not to have an agreement with #Brexit happening".Pat, there was an agreement which the DUP withdrew from. How does that tally with your narrative?Why not call out the DUP for that?

Roger, why are you so afraid of more democracy? Leavers want you to think Brexit cannot be stopped - because they know vast swathes of the public have now seen through their grubby little lies and changed their minds. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay 
Pleased to say that Braintree CLP & Witham CLP @BWlabour have voted to submit the @Remain_Labour @Labour4EU contemporary motion to #Lab18 . #Remain in EU referendum. 
It was stated quite clearly in the manifesto that the @LabourParty would respect the result of the referendum. If people wanted a party who opposed Brexit then they could of voted for the @LibDems who stood on a very clear anti-Brexit platform. They didn’t. Go figure! 
Wouldn't it have been much easier to have remained as Brexit Secretary and actually get the job done?  
The increasing expectation of economic harm from brexit is changing minds. Fewer and fewer leavers care about EU "migration". TL;DR: It IS the economy, stupid.   
I'm so impressed that the Academy realised they screwed up when trying a knee-jerk response to an imaginary problem, so they decided to abandon that course and think again. Cough cough Brexit cough. 
Interesting how the government are putting the responsibility for a successful Brexit on universities, supermarkets (viz. food stockpiling) and pharmaceutical companies (insulin stockpiling). Very interesting...  
#US delegation of citizen diplomats described referendum in #Crimea as legitimate will of the people.#Crimea #Russia #Referendum #Крым #Россия 
Brexit said that the world’s fifth largest economy and second largest exporter of services was bold and brave enough to unshackle itself from an EU bloc in decline. Chequers means we can’t enjoy the key advantages of Brexit - it’s a bad deal for Britain.  
I've heard remainers telling me they've heard this, but it happened to me last night out campaigning. An ex trade union/fireman screaming at me in the street 'I don't care if brexit ruins the country, I want out'. I told him he'd be dead soon, the young would suffer "Fuck em" 
Brexit is yesterday's idea. Outmoded, old-fashioned, backwards looking. A return to the 1970s, and even 1870s for some. No one has been able to give a single quantifiable gain from Brexit in 2 years of fact-free bluster. Brexit must die because the majority no longer wants it. 
Everyone with skin in the gave of a 2nd referendum should read this 1/~  
- Brexit. Brexit. Brexit!!- ughhh- Come on, time to get up. You’ll be late.- Don’t want to. Not going.- You have to. You have to take back control of borders and all the other stuff.- The Border laughs at me.- It’s just jealous.- It is not.- I’ll talk to it.- Not going. 
‘groups at Tufton St have engineered the real Brexit..the far-right ideology designed to deliver low-tax, small state, dereg economy that will have a detrimental affect on the lives of the very UK citizens they coerced into believing they were voting Leave for [other] reasons’

On 16 June 2016 polling company Survation announced: "With a Week to Go Until the EU Referendum, Leave Surges".Now it turns out Survation was being paid by Arron Banks not just to gauge public opinion but to *shape* it.This stinks.#Brexit #PeoplesVote 
UK government admits that what Brexiters said was never going to happen will happen unless it asks EU27 to break their own rules and sign bilateral deals to keep airlines flying after #Brexit. But we don‘t need to worry because Chris Grayling is in charge

JUST WHEN BORIS BECOMES BREXIT ACTIVE,the Europhile sewage gutter mediadecides to air his private daliancesso as to weaken any influence he may have on the LEAVE campaign!It justifies my reasons for never buying scumbag newspapers!Genuine journalism died many years ago.  
I have just issued my challenge to Mr Rees-Mogg to a duel on Brexit, in response to our epistolary exchanges. @NickFerrariLBC has offered to host at LBC, Putney Heath (where Mr Pitt fought his duel) being unavailable. No response yet. A gentleman never refuses a matter of honour 
Even the Chancellor is telling us Brexit will require £80bn extra borrowing every year until 2033 in the event of ‘no-deal’.Leavers must now ask themselves: "Do I support Brexit conditionally or at any cost to our country?"  
Well done Femi! You exposed Brexit for what it is. Nationalist flag waging by the Brexit Elite and total contempt for the ordinary people who were misled into supporting it.

Great thread from someone who actually supplies medicines used in the NHS. These guys are taking the no-deal Brexit threat really seriously.Life-and-death, you might say.  
Remain shows the wisdom of Solomon.Solomon knew that the solution to the custody battle was not to cut the child in two. One woman was telling the truth, the other was lying.Soft Brexit is just cutting the baby in half. The correct answer is Remain. 
Friends! There was *never* any consensus for Brexit!The Leave camp cheated by dishonestly including a "Leave" option on the ballot paper, which was against Our EU Law!Whereas Our Second Referendum, by omitting this particular Hate Option, will deliver Our Consensus To Remain.  
“This issue is too important for tribalism”.  Yes David.  And too important for meddling by sore losers.  The government made a solemn undertaking to implement the result of the 2016 Referendum.  It must do so.  
"In summary, I have been deceitful, dishonest and a downright liar ... ""Enough about Brexit, what about your marriage?"  
At least Adonis is honest, the left have abandoned Labour Brexit voters in the north. The party is sliding into a soft/no Brexit position. They claim we are stupid and racist for voting Leave, so why waste a vote on Labour?  
Mate, you couldn’t make Brexit work during two years in actual charge of it. Waving a little flag around in Bolton is unlikely to prove more fruitful.

A no deal Brexit could be a strategic nightmare for Ireland, if it led to a new border or a rift with the EU. But seen through tactical lens - no deal as a phase, not an end - it could become a greater strategic challenge for the UK. My take @UKandEU 
"Chequers is the new dementia tax" says @NadineDorries I'd go further: if it gets through, or is most likely diluted further – or worst of all, we're forced down the route of a second Referendum – the public reaction will be like that to the Poll Tax

Philip Hammond: No deal Brexit could mean deeper austerity cuts to public sector  There can't be a "NO-DEAL" Brexit because UK will still be trading under WTO rules which the EU has to respect. Next load of crap from the remainers please. 
A gem from @gavinesler:Perhaps the most ludicrous Brexit cliché is the idea that the “people have spoken”, & therefore forever afterwards we must keep our mouths shut. This is not how democracy in UK works. And shutting up is not an option.#peoplesvote!

The list of people that UKGov has not tried to blame for the consequences of Brexit is a now a very short one, and those on it are disproportionately located within the Cabinet.  
Yep. Remember when Facebook tried to shut down Chris’ story because he had warned them about the data breach a couple years before?They never took action then because they thought they could subvert people like Chris by sending them threatening lawyer letters to stay quiet.

Another promise from the Leave campaign in 2016 -  i.e. that the status and rights of EU citizens living here would not be adversely affected in the event of Brexit - turns out to be a lie. They lied, they tacitly encouraged racism and xenophobia, they demeaned us all.

Let’s dispel the myth that supporting a no deal Brexit is patriotic. To watch a country you claim to love fall apart, to allow families to split, the economy to go into recession, to risk a shortfall of food and medicines, all for an act of faith, is inherently unpatriotic. 
If there is no Brexit deal that could possibly make you reconsider Brexit, no matter how many jobs it put on the chopping block, no matter how much it damaged the lives of British people....Then the *idea* of Brexit matters more to you than the people of this country.

Set up a fund in Dublin to avoid the effects of Brexit?  
Philip Hammond says a no deal Brexit would mean cuts. Just like George Osborne said voting Brexit would mean an immediate emergency budget with cuts or the Treasury who said we'd lose 800,000 jobs. All false..  
Philip Hammond keeps abusing his position as Chancellor & promoting #ProjectFear Two. There was supposed to be a recession & an emergency budget after a vote for #Brexit & they never happened. Why don't you do your job & believe in Britain? #StandUp4Brexit  
'The sooner people accept the whole Brexit thing is dead the better!' 
Brexit was never about making more money, rather that Britain should be governed by the British people. We don’t need the EU to make our laws or our economic decisions made by Brussels & we don’t need the EU to control our borders, trade or courts. Britain ruled by Brits!

If the remain tossers got their way and were given a second referendum it would mean the end of elections because the losers would be constantly demanding reruns. They have to be stupid not to see the dreadful affect this would have on democracy and voting. 
Still have this ringing in my ears "I know you’re working around the clock, I know you’re doing your best, and I know that sometimes life can be a struggle. The government I lead will be driven not by the interests of the privileged few, but by yours." 
Time has run out for a second referendum so remoaners really need to stop plotting against Brexit & spreading anti Brexit propaganda. Time for everyone to accept the democratic decision & get behind Brexit to make it a success. We are leaving the EU & sulking won’t change it..  
A no-deal Brexit would blow an £80bn hole in the public finances.And,if the UK does crash out with no agreement,it would appear to blow a hole in Theresa May’s much-disputed claim that a“Brexit dividend” can help deliver her promised £20bn boost to the NHS. 
With a communist leading the Labour party it nonetheless is now 4 points in front of the Tories. Even with the worst leader labour has ever had Labour is trouncing the Tories because of May. Get rid of her and the pound will recover and brexit sail through. She has to go.

When brexiters say to me... If remain had won the referendum then they would have respected the result...No you fucking wouldn't have! ESPECIALLY if we had lied and cheated to win it too!So sick of the BS and the lies.

Here's the thing. I don't think there's anything to prevent devolved assemblies from conducting their own advisory referendums of their populations, in order to inform themselves of the position that they should be taking on Brexit. That would set the cat amongst the pigeons! 
Good, positive argument by @JLongworthLML on how Brexit “will demonstrate that the nation state is alive and well...a massive opportunity for Britain, but also for our friends, allies and trading partners around the world”  
Two of the biggest untruths told during the referendum was that the EU could be reformed from within and the other was their blatant refusal to even acknowledge the very existence of plans for an European Army.

Our governments Brexit crash plan, operation yellowhammer has a mascot. Hear its song of austerity and rejoice!  
Can't tolerate this notion that Lab, Lib Dem and Tory moderates are only positioning themselves to act on Brexit AFTER it's happened.We need this new force now, backing up the millions of UK citizens fighting Brexit everyday. What good is a party that only wants what comes next? 
Brexit is divisive. It's divided the public. It's divided the Labour party. It's divided the Tory party. It's divided the Union.It has to be stopped! Enough already!@Bremaininspain 
Scottish Secretary David Mundell admits that Brexit could help the case for independence (with honest subtitles)

Brexit affects a lot of Aussies who can get British passports. It closes the door to living in the EU for them too.Thanks Australia xx#GottaLoveAnAussie 
Sadly @jeremycorbyn doesn't want to fight Theresa May on Brexit - but the Liberal Democrats do. Join our campaign today and let's get out of this mess:  
Yet another deliberate self-sabotage leak to foster fearmongering bullshit about dire consequences of a no deal Brexit. Notice how Sky News quotes only hysterical Remainers in response to the story.Completely biased. Sky News is WORSE than the BBC. 
2016: Get £350m a week for the NHS!2018: Taxpayers to foot bill for stockpiling medicines to prepare for no-deal Brexit, Government admits.Stop the lies and cheating. #StopBrexit.   
Brexiteers are setting out how a WTO Brexit is much better than Chequers!  
#Brexit is an ideological endeavour not a rational one. We are led by fools....we are led by cowards who will not face the extremists in their party. It's time for a general election. A time for Parliament to take back control. #StopBrexit 
Raab: The family are well?Barnier: Tomorrow I have to go to Vienna because we have to prepare for the Salzburg meeting. Raab: How's that looking? Ignoring him, Barnier gestures to door. Raab: After you. Barnier: After you. The #Brexit talks, ladies and gentlemen.  
While all the "Look! An antisemitic squirrel!" stuff is going on, your attention is being diverted from the fact that the govt. are planning for a No Deal Brexit. That will mean no more welfare safety-net. No NHS. Every last asset paid for by our tax money syphoned off. Wake up! 
Operation Yellowhammer It's coming unless we stop this madness now with a #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE 
Great to be in Portsmouth today talking to local people and businesses (from small businesses to Airbus) about the impact of Brexit on them. A great deal of concern ...  
Here is how May is planning to betray Brexit and her country for her globalist, pro-EU beliefs. THREAD: 
Our trade with the #EU is bigger than our trade with the rest of the world combined. Just one of the reasons why #Brexit is so damaging & why we all need a vote on any final deal, including the option to stay @BestForBritain @peoplesvote_uk @Wales4Europe 
... coming on top of Brexit and the 45% for Scottish independence... this is yet another symptom of the broken/irreparable status of the system the FT cheer-led for 30 years...  
Yes!! I wasn’t a member of Labour but a lifelong voter of them until last Indy referendum. They were dreadful towards Scotland then and got progressively worse since. #DissolveTheUnion 
"Operation Yellowhammer is the latest proof that Brexit will be a colossal act of economic self harm for the country. It's the political equivalent of dismembering yourself.” @OwenSmith_MP We need to push the big red button on Brexit #FinalSay 
See how easy it is to cancel something? #brexit  
Lord Empey tells Lords that the government is ‘hunkering down’ for prolonged direct rule. Truth is, Arlene Foster & the DUP are ‘hunkering down’. They want to evade responsibility for everything until Brexit, so they can blame Brexit on Mrs May while willing it on 
Inside Geordie Greig's Daily Mail! Leaked recording of his introductory speech to staff! Some details on what the paper's Brexit position will be! Read it all!  
 Cabinet Ministers Are Plotting For A Harder Brexit "Third Way" If Theresa May's Chequers Plan Fails

We don’t need the car industry. Nor the banking industry. And science and pharma? Pah. Double pah.We will make double our GDP with innovative jams made from – *checks availability of fruit post Brexit* – turnips and mud. 
Just ordered my coffee as "No Brexit" in Budapest! The staff smiled and laughed out loud. Gammon in the room were all too old to hear it without their hearing aids on  
Theresa May is hiding the shocking truth seen in a document codenamed “Operation Yellowhammer” snapped being carried into Whitehall showing the consequences of Rees-Mogg & his fellow Brextremists' No Deal Brexit. There is nothing so shameless that she won't do it to stay in No 10  
A People's Vote can save our NHS from Brexit. We're #HealthierIN 
RT this to let #TheresaMay know we want a #PeoplesVote #FinalSayForAll on #Brexit! 
Labour's @Andrew_Adonis tells voters not to vote Labour if they want to see Brexit delivered because the party "is moving increasingly against Brexit."  
EU proposals that Northern Ireland remain in parts of the EU are unacceptable. I am glad the Government have re-stated that the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK must be respected. #Brexit  
Brexit - let's con poor people into blaming the EU for all the shit the rich and their Tory party has poured on them over past 40 years 
Raab is showing his true colours, he supports the lying and cheating in the Referendum. He ranks in the front line of disgusting politicians.#FBPE #PeoplesVote 
Tony Blair - Losing our say over EU rules is a bizarre way of taking back control. If Theresa May can't get a majority for her #brexit position in the HoC then the obvious thing for her to do is to go back to the people & have a #PeoplesVote.#FBPE @campbellclaret @Andrew_Adonis 
As this twat speaks remind yourself that, mere minutes after he unveiled a poster claiming that only Brexit could stop raging hordes of brown men rampaging across Europe to savage our suburbs, a far-right nutter shouting ‘Britain first’ murdered an MP in cold blood.  
It is becoming more and more evident that the people must be granted a #FinalSayOnTheDeal with a chance to #ExitFromBrexit. Director General of WTO dubbed the Govt’s dream of trading under WTO rules immediately after Brexit “not realistic”. 
The evidence that I brought forward aren’t ‘allegations’. They are facts. Raab had the gall to say ‘you’re complaining about the rules’. Because general referendums don’t have proper legal frameworks? He is saying that it doesn’t matter if you break the law in a referendum. WOW. 
So proud of the Welsh people for understand the impact that #Brexit will have on our amazing nation. You are allowed to change your mind. It is democratic. Wales no longer backing Brexit- YouGov  
A Canada-style trade deal with the EU would respect the mandate of the referendum. By dismissing such a deal out of hand, Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary is putting party before country and weakening our negotiating position.

Secret documents have been photographed, showing the government's planning for a no-deal Brexit, entitled Operation Yellowhammer.  
THis is how the Govt is approaching the prospect of a no deal Brexit, by classifying it as an emergency akin to major floods or terror outbreaks but with one key difference. WE VOTED FOR IT.  
One of most Brexit's most pestilential myths is that Brit people were somehow GAGGING to leave the EU.We were mostly pootling around doing the shopping when Brexiteers came forth and bayed: "VOTE BREXIT TO CURE ALL YOUR ILLS."Many people believed them.Fewer do now.  
Yeah, because Ed Sheeran can only play in New York thanks to the EU.Brexit will make no difference whatever to international audiences being able to see British acts live.  
The EU is a hugely important export market for #Cornwall & the Isles of Scilly.#Brexit threatens many of our businesses and the livelihoods that depend on them. Please share!#PeoplesVote 
Just watched a Labour MSP (Rhoda Grant) saying that Scottish Government guaranteeing EU citizens' rights post Brexit is a 'side issue'. It might be a bagatelle to her but to hundreds of thousands here it matters a lot. 
Today, the London Assembly called on @MayorofLondon to join the campaign for a “people’s vote” on the final terms of Brexit.Hear from @sianberry on her motion being agreed #PeoplesVote 
/5 The document snapped re Operation Yellowhammer No Deal Brexit emergency civil contingencies secratariat plans was in the hands of Treasury minister John Glen exiting Cabinet Office this morning HT  @PoliticalPics 
Our fishing industry has been decimated by the disastrous Common Fisheries Policy. A WTO Brexit immediately restores full control of our waters to Britain, allowing coastal communities to thrive. It's a huge opportunity for British fishing!Support us at  
This is what a lot of rich Brexiters are actually hoping for - 'asset breakup', or asset-stripping, as it used to be known. Feasting on the corpse of a Britain too weakened by Brexit to resist, in other words...  
Treasury no-deal Brexit document 'Operation Yellowhammer' accidentally revealed by bungling minister 
No trains, no planes, no food, no medicine.....going well Mrs May, non?Photo reveals secret 'Operation Yellowhammer' government no-deal Brexit papers  
Wales - which voted Leave in 2016 - both wants a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit Deal and would vote Remain. Everyday, more people are coming to the same conclusion and back young people in a vote on the Brexit deal. #PeoplesVoteCymru#FFS 
First they promised we would retain full access to EU funding. Then they sacrificed that in pursuit of idiot's hard Brexit, all the while providing zero information for universities to prepare. Now they have the gall to blame us for their incompetence and pusillanimity   
A woman who has plainly supported the anti-Semitic Labour Party and who opposed the democratic result of Brexit is now trying to stop an event taking place because her side has no sensible answers to the speaker. Yasmin. You’re a Nazi. A shit one, too.  
This is a really important debate. We mustn’t allow Brexit to damage scientific collaboration or the great strength of our science base. #Science 
#Catalan High Court ordered police to stop "use of public premises" for #1Oct referendum "without affecting normal coexistence". Not only was the peace destroyed but police also attacked voters on private propertyMore cases against #Spanish police

What beggars belief is that such a senior official cannot accept responsibility for his own actions in advocating Brexit.  
Instead of taxing everyone to pay for the stockpiling of medicines after a catastrophic no deal brexit. Could we just sue Boris, Rees-Mogg, Farage  and every other prick pushing for it? #yellowhammer 
To my friends across the pond in the UK, if there was another referendum on Brexit, would you:Please share!  
/4 sharpened writing up on this now“Remind departments of the need to consider the financial ro[bustness?? ] of commercial firms that play a role in their [No Deal Brexit] contingency plans” — that one, if my inference on missing word is right is v big - ref to ports? Freight?  
Govt are now planning for No-Deal #Brexit in the way they did with "Foot & Mouth, Floods, Terrorism" etc.. Just let that sink in a moment.  
Maximum respect to Steve who’s been protesting against Brexit outside Parliament for exactly one year - cheerfully even trying to enlist Tory @Simonhartmp to #PeoplesVote campaign this morning. 
JRM also seems to state that UK won't impose border controls with Ireland. In that case we must presume that he welcomes uncontrolled passage of immigrants from EU to UK.  And with France. And Gibraltar. I don't think that was a plank of the Brexit campaign, was it? 
.@DavidDavisMP: "I am joining the @LeaveMnsLeave rally in Bolton as a matter of principle - to ensure Brexit is delivered and democracy upheld."  
btw I'm aware that Yellowhammer is the name of Brexit contingency planning docs photographed by @politicalpics, and that this account probably tweeted when they meant to search. That's why I tweeted it. 
Coming up this autumn: #EUCO, #UNGA, #ASEM12, #G20, internal and external security, migration, rules-based multilateral cooperation, economy, trade, and of course #Brexit.Bring it on!  
“If.”             Perhaps “If” no one gets sick in 2019 everything will be fine.Sometimes the Brexit nonsense is so ridiculous it is difficult to believe a senior politician can not detect the Brexcrement flowing from his mouth as he speaks  
Cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott is clear that those who want a second referendum just don't believe in democracy.  
/3 The Treasury internal document appears to show some doubts about what will happen to “aviation and rail access to the EU” if there is a No Deal Brexit-  reaffirming “the need for consistent planning assumptions across plans”

Theresa May and the Basketcase Tory Brexit Operation Yellowhammer ‘a little bit of bread and no cheese’ FFS!!!!  
I see Brexiters are still blaming Remainers for Brexit's failure. Like blaming the lighthouse because the ship sank. You were shown where the rocks were, you chose to hit them. 
/2 The Civil Contingencies Secratariat held a two day meeting last week to discuss plans/ assumptions - and then there was a further meeting this week on how to mitigate impacts of No Deal Brexit 
WATCH: Scottish Secretary @DavidMundellDCT tells us that a "chaotic Brexit" could help @theSNP's case for independence. 
The impact of Brexit on the Premier League could be "hugely damaging" to English football.  More:  
I'll be speaking in the debate on Science and Brexit in the HoC today.   UK is a top 5 collaboration partner for all the EU member states & the EU, which is why we want to agree an ambitious science and innovation accord with the EU to solve the big challenges oue societies face. 
Operation Yellowhammer - named after the bird - who's song translates to "a little bit of bread and no cheese" I am not making this up - The Government codeword for Brexit contingency is basically rations. 
Looks like #TheresaMay will seek a “blind Brexit” - leaving without the key issues being solved, as she can’t face down either wing of her party...Key problems to be sorted only after #brexit  -  the height of irresponsibility!.  
Brexit is at Sudanese family visit status right now...  
It was great to see @rupahuq put women's issues on the agenda in Parliament this week!She's right - women will be hardest hit by #Brexit. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote#W4PV 
It looks like bots don't buy tickets. Brexit has money, corrupt politicians, oligarchs and foreign enemies behind it. But the one thing brexit doesn't have? Boots on the ground.  
RUMOUR IS @theresa_may offered a plum EU job to betray Britain keep us in EU.  Tories who backed Chequers deal, #Gove, #Raab, #Leadsom,  Fox, Javid, taken for mugs, and have terrible judgement.  THEY BETRAYED #Brexit for their jobs.    @borisjohnson 
Brexit Explained  
The "alt-right" is now behind the push for a no deal Brexit.Either drooling idiots on messageboards are driving UK policy, or Andy Burnham is a hysterical moron.Wonder which one is true?  
Here lies the #Brexit solution  
Raab: "If what you're trying to do is undermine the credibility of the referendum ..."THE OFFICIAL LEAVE CAMPAIGN UNDERMINED THE CREDIBILITY OF THE REFERENDUM BY BREAKING THE LAW IN ORDER TO WIN!No more undermining is required. 
*Brexit Explained*  
Did you see our comments in the Huffington Post yesterday?“Brexit is killing our weakened NHS and 83% of doctors say Brexit is bad news. It really is time to stop this failed experiment and support our NHS instead.”  
 This morning I asked the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell MP, if we should be stock-piling medicines in the event of a 'no deal' #Brexit.  
If you read one thing todayMake it this Pure poetry from @Jacob_Rees_Mogg calling out Lord Adonis' Brexit scaremongering.

The super-rich are getting richer, while more & more people struggle with crippling debts.This stark inequality caused by disastrous govt policies is the real driver of the #Brexit vote. We must urgently tackle it with living wage, wealth taxes and more. 
I am here at the Port of Ghent. Brexit means serious delays in getting goods into the UK. Its a waste of time and money and we need to stop it now. Please watch and RT

Superbly argued (and beautifully written) piece about the Brexit negotiations and EEA/EFTA by @DanielJHannan  offers the best way to leave the EU but maintain a deep friendship with our European neighbours. 
I don’t disagree with @InklessPW often, but I really do this time.  The consequences of #Brexit are too hurtful and harmful to deny the British people the right to a second chance to express themselves.  
• Brexiters won’t support Chequers.• Remainer Tories won’t support Chequers.• Labour won’t support a Tory Brexit.• Lib Dems, SNP, Greens won’t support a Labour or Tory Brexit.• DUP will hold everyone to ransom.But, apparently, a #PeoplesVote would divide our nation? 
Jacob Rees-Mogg tells us about his plan for Brexit and why we don't have to pay £39 billion in a letter to Lord Adonis on how we can save £100 billion. Extract below. Great stuff!Full letter here... #StandUp4Brexit #Brexit  
I find it shocking that the govt and @BBCNews are reporting stockpiling of medicines as if it is normal in a developed country like the UK with no actual need to do this other than #Brexit We need #FinalSay #PeoplesVote to put this right @BestForBritain @MattHancock 
Richard Wilson: It’s time to be bold and cancel Brexit  
No. The entire problem is that Brexit is ultimately little more than an unworkable fantasy which promised much, but offered no feasible mechanism for achieving such a fanciful utopia.Let's face it - you've got no idea how to make it work. Even with £625,000 in your back pocket.  
'Matt Hancock: 'Stockpiling drugs for no deal Brexit means 'extra costs' for taxpayers.' What about the extra human costs - utterly scandalous @MattHancock !  via @MailOnline 
This is important. Leave are selling a myth. In fact, UK Gov policy has caused the pain and inequality people feel and see. Not the EU. Brexit will make that worse. A #PeoplesVote may not solve this. But it will ensure that we have a chance to correct the course. 
What beggars belief is people still thinking Brexit is a sensible idea. In 2018. After our economy went from 5th to 6th largest economy BECAUSE of our vote. 
When Boris Johnson speaks out on Brexit, he’s standing up for 17.4 million Leave voters - Patrick O'Flynn MEP  
"UK taxpayers to foot bill for stockpiling medicines to prepare for no-deal Brexit, government admits"Don't think I saw that on the side of a big red bus either  
The Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester is happy to provoke mass civil disorder in order to block a clean Brexit. The so-called 'party of the people' are once again willing to both undermine the will of the people and put their lives at risk.  
A year ago the Catalan parliament approved the independence referendum law.The president of Parliament, Carme Forcadell, has been imprisoned since March for allowing that parliamentary debate.Free Catalan political prisoners.

Don’t be too nice! It’s not ‘barmy’ - it’s a total disgrace. The Brexit ‘mandate’ is utterly compromised and will forever be a source of bitter division if not addressed.#PeoplesVote - earn the mandate honestly. 
When 80% of Catalans want a referendum, they should have been able to discuss it in parliament. This is called democracy, and 168 days in prison for speaker of the house @ForcadellCarme for allowing the debate prove that the State is imprisoning debate. 
Theresa May's Chequers plan is a dead parrot and should be left to rot, it was meant to overturn by stealth the Brexit we voted for. We should offer the EU a trade deal only or just walk away..  
A WTO Brexit would save British fishing!  
We have, sadly, always been heading for a no deal/ bad deal Brexit. Anything else is just not in EU interests. Now that more & more people realise, our Govt must take notice, #SuspendA50 & get the people’s #InformedConsent to Brexit on the Brexiteers’ terms or to a new Remain  
A clean Brexit would spark a boom in the UK's ailing fishing industry:  
I am very proud to be backing a private criminal prosecution  against Boris Johnson for lying during the BREXIT referendum campaign about the amount of money the UK spends on being a member state of the EU (the £350 million for the NHS claim) ,  
It is clear that the UK’s healthcare would be at risk with Govt’s disastrous plans. Tory Ministers are talking down the impact of #Brexit on healthcare, whilst pharmaceutical companies are being asked to stockpile drugs. We can only turn this around with an #ExitFromBrexit 
Tom Watson - Facebook broke the law & it allowed illegal data breaches during the #EU referendum. Isn't it now the time to have a #Muller style enquiry into the conduct of the #EU referendum & that also examines the role played by the Russian state? #peoplesvote #FBPE 
If the reason you voted Leave was because you had nothing else to lose. Then you are mistaken. Things are gonna get a whole lot worse. #FBPE #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Our #NHS problems could be solved if we tackled #TaxAvoidance properly. Thankfully new EU laws kick in, in March 2019.Oh, wait that date seems familiar. Oh, yes. #Brexit. Funny, that. Must be coincidence, surely.  
BLIND BREXIT: leaving the EU with an "outline" deal, "proper details still to be worked out": that's a con no different from the no-plan no-idea referendum. More years of uncertainty, low investment, businesses leaving, jobs lost - how stupid can this get? #PeoplesVote now.

A senior official from the Trump administration has said he’s secretly hampering his agenda. Inspired by this, I shall henceforth fall asleep on any piece of paper in Downing Street mentioning Brexit. #EnemyWithin 
UK's biggest insulin supplier is building up a four-month stockpile to ensure that diabetic patients are not left without vital medications in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Still can't believe stockpiling in Britain is a thing now  
Brexit meant Leave, Leave meant Brexit. It never was a second vote or another referendum just because the outcome wasn't expected, and all the rest of the Bullshit. People who voted Brexit have had enough and would leave on WTO rules today. Lefties and remoaners move on you lost. 
Why do we have Brexit and how did the USA end up with Trump? Because politicians failed to address inequality. And what will the legacy of Brexit and Trump be? Greater inequality. 
This government’s level of inanity, insanity, irresponsibility and inability to grasp detail is unforgivable. We need some adults in the room too. #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
Brexit thinkingGet rid of FoM we hate foreignersWho will pick our fruit and veg?We need to bring in foreign workers Don’t bring in EU workers because that will look like we failed at BrexitI know let’s fly in poverty stricken people from the 3rd world Brilliant idea  
Stockpiling assumes there are extra supplies available. That shelf life is not an issue. That somehow the costs whixh could be huge are funded. Every month of stockpile  needs 1.5b in funding. Another Brexit benefit? 
Vote Leave actually sent leaflets reassuring people that companies like Nissan wouldn't leave if Brexit happpened and now Nissan is suing them.(P.S. He said "port" not "heart" above)  
65% of Leavers still consider control of borders and immigration to be prerequisite for a 'Real Brexit' according to a Deltapoll/LBC survey. Also see our paper on opinion polls  
Customary lucid and balanced presentation of #Brexit negotiations from Michel Barnier to EU Ambassadors. EU has offered an unprecedented future partnership to the UK but must defend its own interests and protect its greatest achievement, the Single Market.  
Mr Brexit-Enthusiast Humphrys obviously needs some defending by the BBC (aka The Orwell Ministry of Brexit Truth) so here it is:  
It's synchronised lying with Brexit Central funded by tax payers alliance and vote leave - spreading their nonsense all over sites like Quora too. The ugly truth about brexit's real.purpose to strip ordinary people of their rights  and aid tax dodgers  
Massive news ahead of @peoplesvote_uk rally in Cardiff in 2 days. Polling out today shows  hat in a #PeoplesVote at the end of the process, Wales would vote to stay in the EU - the will of the people to have their say at the end of the #Brexit process is growing

I am not racist, but I didn’t vote hard Brexit so that we’d get migrants from even further away picking our fruit. I wanted those jobs to go to English people who would refuse to do them - this is not the Brexit I voted for  
BLIND BREXIT: “Brexit is in two parts: first the separation agreement to ensure an orderly exit and to secure the transition period that companies desperately want. What follows is the future trade accord, which won’t be negotiated until after the U.K. leaves” DON’T FALL FOR IT. 
The ‘BLIND BREXIT’ con - don’t fall for it - “The path to a deal...As many Brexit-watchers have long predicted, it involves postponing some of the toughest decisions until after exit day”. Just like the 2016 referendum itself: no facts, no plan! 
Bravo @sianberry. Making it absolutely clear that the public deserve a #PeoplesVote, with a right to choose to ditch Brexit entirely...  
How could ANYONE have known what #Brexit meant 2 years ago when even now, 2 years later, the government cannot agree on what Brexit means. I voted #Remain, I didn't know what Brexit meant, & neither did 'the people'. Now we know it isn't going to be good, time for a #PeoplesVote. 
Leading MEP Verhofstadt advocates expelling Poland and Hungary from the EU.  Interesting..... Distinctive #Brexit research & news:  
Seems to be growing belief in Brussels that UK is heading for a 'blind Brexit' - a withdrawal agreement that doesn't set future relationship. As one MEP told me Parliament then would have 'a meaningful vote on a meaningless blind'. Be very hard for Dublin to back this. 
#Tradeunions move towards demanding a #PeoplesVote on the actual #Brexit deal :  
If? *If* "everyone does what they need to do"? And this is meant to reassure NHS patients? It sounds like the absence of a plan, the absence of leadership, the absence of responsibility for ensuring patients' safety in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  
A day in the life of mad #Brexit : the Gov announce a visa scheme for 2500 non EU farm workers to replace departing EU workers and the Health Minister confirms Gov will pay pharma companies to stockpile medicines to prepare for No Deal. Ah, the benefits of Brexit! #FBPE #Libdems 
Who/what are these moderates? Ppl (1) keen to reject biggest vote in UK history; (2) who still can't believe Brexit won as all friends at theatre & supper parties were Remain; (3) who attack fake news while 'knowing' + tweeting that the 52% MUST be bigots  
Representives of the Brits living in Europe, many of whom feel very uncertain about their future, STILL have not met the minister in charge of #Brexit. They’ve met @MichelBarnier numerous times but have never met either @DavidDavisMP or @DominicRaab despite consistent lobbying  
Erasmus gives students the chance to study and gain experience abroad. But, if Brexit Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, that could all be over  
Very reassuring to hear @MattHancock tells @BBCr4today that the taxpayer is set to pay extra to fly in short shelf-life medicines in event of No Deal. I must have missed that charge too in the Brexit small print.

The Petition to rescind Article 50 if #Leave broke election laws (they did) is to be debated in Parliament on 10th September. The government initially dismissed the petition but then it reached over 190,000. So now it must be debated by MPs. Well done everybody.#Brexit #Remain 
Brexit summed up perfectly @LBC @mrjamesob @Jacob_Rees_Mogg 
Personally I'm fighting Brexit for my daughters future.   How could I stop?   The fact that the rest of the country will also benefit when we #StopBrexit is a bonus x   thank you all. 
Dominic Raab: No, no, it's uh,...its resting.Michel Barnier: Look, matey, I know a dead Brexit plan when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now. Dominic Raab: No no it's not dead, it's, it's restin!…. 
Boris Johnson is facing a court room showdown over the £350 million a week lie he repeatedly told during the #Brexit referendum campaign.This is just so delicious.  
EU Brexit negotiators have long told me they think the U.K. would get further in negotiations if it built on Canada +++ than on EEA minus 6 
Accusation I often hear in Brussels is that U.K. Brexit negotiators are fine wordsmiths but that there’s often little meaning behind the words 3 
JRM thinks BoJo  would make great PM and negotiate better Brexit but says their is no vacancy.Sorry JRM we need to make sure there is a vacancy or we don’t get to Brexit.Just move the Appeaser to one side and let’s make it a success.Time to deliver. 
EU diplomats shrug at what they view as U.K. hysteria over Canada+ or Chequers #Brexit debate. The EU says the choice was never the UK’s alone 1 
Deserved. Since 24 June 2016 Lammy has consistently and persistently been the sole voice of reason and sanity on Brexit. He will be one of the few politicians to emerge from all this with honour intact.  
Weapons grade shit Owen Jones in today's @guardian: "The case for free movement of people in Europe has, sadly, largely been abandoned".  Yes Owen, it has. By ideological "respecters" of the referendum result, like you.#r4today#StopBrexitSaveBritain 
Big Ben silent as the hedge fund of ambition pillages the homes of the poor. Ms Truss is active, skirmishing with the rogues of the media. They fear the sword of her intellect and offer nothing to our post-Brexit future. We do not need Newsnight with fruit rotting in the field. 
The Welsh are no longer backing Brexit.  
Friends! Shrewd analysis!After years of Far-Right politics, Our Yoof - i.e. Jeremy, who'll be a mere 73 at the next GE - have captured Our Labour Party!And only the elderly - e.g. the electorate - voted for a Tory Brexit, i.e. Leave!Talk about no longer being in control!  
There are so many other injustices I want to fight for but for now it has to be Brexit Brexit Brexit until I or that destructive shit show are dead. Leave voters have stolen our lives, our normality, our equilibrium. There can be no forgiveness. #FBPE #WATON 
Scotland has already lost 14% of EU Drs since #Brexit vote. Now a SLab MSP thinks it’s a good idea to tell EU citizens, who may have worked here for decades, they should have their democratic rights taken away? Well done - I’m sure that makes them feel their future is safe here! 
I can't be alone in laughing at UKIP joining the Tories because of a referendum designed to save the Tories from UKIP

Any politician with any guts would say: “Brexit is a huge mistake. I cannot impoverish my children and grandchildren. We must think again.”  
Why do we allow Russian money to flow freely through EU banks when the Salisbury attacks and manipulation of Brexit vote demonstrate Putin is hostile to our values and interests?Time to end the double standards 
The UK govt advised the food industry to stockpile food due to the Brexit calamity only to be told by the industry that the food supply chain has no capacity to leave food around. The UK govt is so incompetent, they don't know how to fix the problems caused by their incompetence. 
Brexit: Welsh voters backed quitting the European Union by 53% to 47%, but now 51% would vote to remain compared to 49% - Every opinion poll confirms this trend, people are rejecting Brexit!  
"What type of Remain did Remainer MPs vote for?" Brexit Facts4EU poses the difficult question.  Read the #Brexit summary:  
Theresa May’s revenge on Russia, no more Tennis  as the city of London ‘Looting with Putin’ revenge? Tents on our streets £1,000,000 apartments left empty.. Who are Tory Spiv property speculators selling Penthouses to? Revenge? They are Tory Party donors? Who rigged Brexit?

EU bets on last-minute #Brexit deal. My autumnal thoughts:  
Great start to today. Post-Brexit migrant farm worker visa scheme announced At last! Thank you to all the @NFUtweets farmers and growers and our MP’s who have helped make this happen. Work to be done now to examine the detail and develop the scheme. 
Post-Dacre Daily Mail, day 1. So far so good! Not a single anti-EU or anti-immigrant story. Just this non-sensational article about end of scallop war at bottom of p2 & good reporting from Berlin on Brexit negotiations on p30  
"If you think they're going to give you #Brexit without a fight, you are sadly mistaken."  
Freddy Moore, a living legend, turned 96 this week. I was honoured to meet him at his house where the SC Aboriginal Advancement League began. He led a huge union contribution to the 1967 Referendum Campaign. In ‘67 we were counted, & now it’s time to be heard! #UluruStatement 
It doesn’t matter what he thinks. His job is to implement government policy. If the Prime Minister allows him to resist Brexit that is because she is either too weak to fire him or she wants Brexit resisted.  
EU banking on last minute Brexit deal this autumn

Anyone supporting Brexit is actively diminishing my country, of course I'm taking it fucking personally. 
Just received notification, Parliament will debate the petition "If Vote Leave has broken any laws regarding overspending in 2016 EU referendum then Art.50 should be immediately withdrawn and full EU membership continued."  
Listening to the audio recording of @Feorlean at this evening's (actually last night's now!) #Brexit talk, and I'm just so impressed at the calibre of the man's intellect and communication abilities. He's the David Attenborough of politics, in my opinion. 
Post-Brexit migrant farm worker visa scheme announced  
To clarify: I think Brexit is a (modest but real) mistake. I think a democratic vote that reached a different decision could legitimately cancel the first. But I doubt such a vote will happen and I'm not sure it should. You're supposed to be responsible the first time.  
We have exactly the same in the UK: elite officials who think they know better than the voters & see it as their duty to frustrate democracy. Here at the moment, it is mainly about Brexit.

The rumour that Roy Keane and Harry Arter fell out over Brexit is one of the best rumours I’ve heard in a while. Apparently Keane got angry at Arter exalting the benefits of Brexit in the changing room and told him he had no right to wear an Irish jersey.

To all those politicians saying that if the supposed referendum outcome is not upheld it wd lead to civil unrest, what are you really saying? That democracy should be subject to blackmail? That u are so cowardly and unprincipled that you surrender to the mere threat of violence? 
Sick to death of being fed Bollocks by this government. If it's not Brexit it's cuts, or housing, or zero contract jobs, homelessness, and i don't believe them with the Russian poisoning situation. We as people are being taken for fools and the Arseholes have to stop now FACT.

The threat of civil unrest if we have a #PeoplesVote is not a threat. It's blackmail. If you give in to blackmail they ask for more. We should hold another vote even if the streets of London burn to save democracy & send the message we will not be silenced or blackmailed#Brexit 
Why is Nigel Dodds getting frustrated about this? DUP supported Brexit & took a hardline over negotiations, letting down the interests of NI & making withdrawal agreement more difficult. We need more officers – but it is for a problem of DUP’s own making.

More than half of voters expect the UK to crash out of the EU with a bad Brexit deal, says new poll  
Leave supporters either don’t care that there isn’t a credible option for Brexit that doesn’t do the country massive harm; or they have a brilliant plan and are keeping it secret. Either way, it doesn’t sound terribly patriotic to me. 
A French cardiologist saved my moms life in A&E on the night of the referendum result.

Maybe deep down Brexit is all just Farage’s attempt to get his German ex-wife deported and we’re all just collateral damage. 
1. Chequers deal was never 'alive' because the proposals simply didn't make sense.2. Barnier ruled it out on Monday to me, and to a German paper.But don't worry. Raab says the Latvian Foreign Minister muttered something positive!Time to back an #EEA-based #Brexit  
And in a follow-up vote, the King County Council votes 5-4 to reject a February 2019 advisory ballot measure on public funds for the Mariners stadium. Voters can still do a referendum by petition to try and overturn the council's approval of tax funds for the Mariners.

This is what Brexit has brought the country to: democracy is broken if the rule of law is not upheld. Raab is a lawyer. He knows. But ideology matters more to him. We all know what happens when ideology becomes all important to those in power. God help us all.

King Launches Blistering Attack on Government's Brexit Strategy  
This is: bad for the UK, compared with Remain - we lose our seat at the grown-ups table where policy is made but pay into the budget; good for Europe for the same reasons; bad for Labour which doesn't get a Brexit crisis; and ok for Remainers - life continues almost as before. 
As has long been clear, the only way out for Govt is a blind Brexit. It will be followed by a lengthy or endless 'transition'. If we can't resolve the contradictions of Brexit with the clock ticking we'll never resolve them when that impetus disappears.

We need a @peoplesvote_uk on the final deal with the option to remain. Labour must take a lead. It’s what our voters, members and supporters want as we see the real disaster that is #Brexit for what it is - making our communities poorer and damaging us for many generations.  
Goswami wants you to send in more army to “let” Kashmir vote. How abt you take all the army out and let them really vote —as they were promised in a referendum?  
The impact of Brexit on the Premier League could be "hugely damaging" to English football.  More:  
Me on Politics Scotland earlier on why I think the EU side isn't just bluffing with its talk on Brexit, what I think of another EU vote and why I wouldn't get too excited yet about recent polling in Scotland edging towards a Yes for Scottish independence.  
Theresa May had no response when @ChrisRuane2017 challenged her to guarantee that #Wales will not be worse off because of the Tories botched #Brexit negotiations. Only @WelshLabour is #StandingUpForWales. 
The @MayorofGM Andy Burnham says a cross party campaign against a no deal Brexit is needed. Says a second vote would widen divisions and cause social unrest BUT it would be better than leaving without a deal. More at 1830 on @BBCNWT 
Now we need a proper investigation into the role of Russian money in the #Brexit referendum. Brexit is a far bigger prize for Russian foreign policy than the  #Salisbury attack was. 
Read the headline, then read the bottom line.@BBCNews, why are you doing this?#BBCbias#Brexit  
Spain sends 600 riot police to #Catalonia for the anniversary of the referendum  
A populist effort by Gov to railroad thru a Referendum on Article 41.2 against all best advice, is thwarted by Justice Comm. -  Minister says Article is "at odds with the Gov's gender equality policies" -Tell that to Single mothers battered by FG/Lab in 2011... And ever since...  
29TH SEPTEMBER NATIONAL ACTION DAYWe will be holding a national action day to campaign for a #peoplesvote on the final #Brexit deal with hundreds of events across the country.Can you put on an event or deliver leaflets in your local community? 
For many months now without fail, every afternoon at roughly this time a man walks into Parliament Square and hollers "stop Brexit" towards Parliament. Love the absolute stubborn-mindedness. 
While disaster capitalists like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Nigel Farage peddle a no-deal Brexit, if even just one person runs out of insulin, loses their job or gets their house repossessed because of a no deal Brexit - Rees-Mogg and Farage should be held responsible for their actions. 
Pound rises against dollar and euro following reports of progress on #Brexit deal  
There’s a lot of sense in the IPPR  recommendations on  rebalancing the  UK economy, but to do it successfully would take incredible political skill. We’re heading towards Brexit & Corbyn decided to reject the IHRA definitions & created this whole shit show through the summer. 
“Are you not concerned that Chequers was adopted on a frankly incompetent basis?” @MarcusFysh asked @DominicRaab and @OllyRobbins at today’s #Brexit Select Committee Marcus is one of 22 Conservative MPs so far who have pledged to #StandUp4Brexit Ask your MP to do so too  
We must have been all brain dead to have believed that rumour that Germany was in a conciliatory mood over BREXIT negotiation. I doubt the tough contingent from the EU would see their granny across the road.  For 'two bob' metaphorically speaking, she'd be pushed under a bus 
Jacob Rees Mogg should be congratulated for putting country before self. He's willing to go through the hell of #Brexit and to wait 50 years until he's 99 before he sees any benefits. Now that's what I call sacrifice.  
Theresa May’s Chequers plan isn’t workable. She knows it. Tories know it. EU knows it. It’s a red herring. The only purpose of her plan was to be seen to be doing something. But her something means nothing. There is no workable Brexit plan. Not now. Not ever. Nothing. No deal. 
British voters are more doubtful about Brexit than ever and increasingly fear it'll be damaging  
Thank you. I will stand aside if a stronger candidate emerges. It makes no sense to split the vote. But in the meantime we must shout from the rooftops what a massive balls up politicians of all sides have made of #Brexit. Hard to know if such incompetence is deliberate or random  
.@eloisetodd explains that people in focus groups often don’t know Brexit can be stopped. Even if they don’t want it, they think it’s inevitable, or it’s already happened, or we won’t be able to keep current benefits.We CAN stop this. It’s as easy as pushing a button #FinalSay 
Brexiteers want you to think that Brexit cannot be stopped because it is the only argument they have left.The truth is we have every right to press the stop button. As a democracy, we have every right to remain in the EU. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay @BestForBritain 
Surely this is an extension / repeat of the error the UK side made when agreeing to the sequencing of negotiations? We sign up to a Brexit bill and agree to be bound by EU rules .... in return for the promise of talks about a trade deal.  Not sure May is all there  
‘People deserve a say’ on the UK’s future relations with the EU - great to hear from @FrancesOGrady The implications of Brexit are huge for jobs, wages and workers’ rights. We all deserve a say on our futures, we deserve a #PeoplesVote. 
Let's crowdfund a GCSE course in constitutional studies for Brexit Central  
"It is a great challenge but one we should rise to" says Brexit minister @DominicRaab. That's not as dour about Brexit as May's "not the end of world" but still makes you wonder why Raab was one of the great campaigners to leave the EU. Has he too been captured by Whitehall? 
Today I'm proud to stand with @BestForBritain and politicians from all parties opposing Brexit.This issue is too important for tribalism. 1.6 million more Leave voters have switched to Remain than vice versa. We must stand up to the govt and let the public have the #FinalSay. 
This is, perhaps, the best ever tweet to sum up Brexit.  
Turns out Brexit is pretty pretty pretty...bad.  
Hahaha! Suffer, dear Remainers and eat your hats! Bottle your tears so that we may drink them at the Brexit banquet. It was all bluff and bluster from the EU and Germany.God save the Queen! 
Remain 59% Leave 41%#Brexit is not the will of the people. #Leavers, there is no mandate for #Brexit. #Brexit is dead, it is not restin', it is not sleepin' It is dead. 
.@DrPhillipLeeMP nails it at our Commons event:‘As a doctor I get the informed consent of a patient before a procedure. I am not confident at all that we have the informed consent of the country before proceeding with Brexit’#FinalSay 
#Brexit and Ireland: A Personal View  
Carney is set to stay as Governor of the Bank of England ‘to steer the economy through Brexit’. He promises to make the process as smooth as possible. Lucky us. His record hardly suggests anything of the kind. He has always opposed the process just like Osborne, who appointed him 
Its called a #PeoplesVote Jeremy. Its what majority of Lab voters/MPs want.. And more importantly, its what the country wants too. #Brexit  
Brexit poll finds Brits would vote 59-41 in favour of staying in the EU in second referendum  
"The NHS could face a bill of almost £500m a year to hire overseas staff as a result of #Brexit and the government’s immigration policies, hospital doctors have said." 
Me with my fancy law degree and European contacts, I'll probably still be able to get a visa to work in mainland Europe if Brexit happens.How about about someone less privileged with GCSE/A-Level German who wants to work as hotel staff in Berlin? (where unemployment is lower) 
Peak jargon? Dominic Raab just now on Brexit: 'The model we have chosen reconciles the three key forks of the strategic spearhead' 
Whilst I was away, did anyone get to the bottom of how Brexit will help the poorest and most vulnerable in our society? 
“Deep and special relationship”I’m sick of hearing this sentence, No @theresa_may we voted to leave, our troops are not for sale just to line your friends pockets. Brexit means out! No EU military integration @CasAnnStephens @DontDenyThe 
When asked about No-Deal at #PMQs, Theresa May said “It’s not the End of the World” ??Here's the reality of a No-Deal Brexit:

King supported Brexit in 2016, arguing it would bring “real opportunities” for UK. But he said govt had weakened its negotiating position by “a whole lack of preparation” for a no-deal BrexitMerv hasnt been that great at forecasting ANY economic outcomes. 
Former David Davis aide says no-deal #Brexit warnings are unfounded, claiming “very low friction” at Bulgaria-Turkey border. Tell that to truckers. 
At the moment MPs on the Brexit Select committee are not sure whether Barnier officially told them that Chequers proposals “are dead”.Thankfully, there is a transcript being prepared. 
Stephen Kinnock says that Barnier told him and the Brexit committee re Chequers “Les propositions sont mort” - the proposals are dead...Transcript coming soon from that meeting. 
#Brexit negotiations @EU_Commission continue this week with a meeting between @MichelBarnier and @DominicRaab scheduled for tomorrow: outstanding issues of Withdrawal Agreement & the future relationship:  
Jacob Rees-Mogg says Boris Johnson should be next PM and says he would negotiate better Brexit deal than Theresa May’s Chequers ‘muddle’  
The British People deserve a #FinalSay on the #Brexit deal  it's time for a #PeoplesVote  #StopBrexit #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #WeAreEurope #EUsupergirl #Brussels 
18Apr2017: May called a snap #GE, asking us to back her vision of #Brexit & strengthen her hand.We said, "No," & voted in a hung Parliament — i.e. we rejected both her Lancaster House (20Jan17) & Tory manifesto vision of #Brexit.There's no mandate for the Brexit she's pursuing.  
Hull City could be sold by Christmas.I could have a threesome with two hot Spanish lesbians with unlimited free drugs tonight.Brexit could be a success.David Bamber could still play top flight football.Scunthorpe could win the Champions League in a few years.#HCAFC 
If Brexit really is ‘the will of the people’, they should prove it with a #PeoplesVote. If it’s not, then we shouldn’t be doing it in the first place. (By the way, it isn’t). 
When you you tell us what Labour will do WHEN the Tories' Brexit deal fails Labour's 6 tests. You can't just stop Brexit. That choice belongs to the people. So will you support a #PeoplesVote or not, Jeremy? 
We need a peoples vote on brexit. Why can't you see this?!? 
We need a real plan for Brexit. #PMQs 
#EUsupergirl in #Brussels 100% determined that we will get a #PeoplesVote on the Final #Brexit deal and the #Remain will fight with passion & positivity and that we will win! #StopBrexit #WeAreEurope and we are stronger together!  
Just now, this British Trump supporter yelled at these German speakers to “F@#% off back to their own country” and that “we won”. To any MPs that say Brexit hasn’t resulted in vile racist abuse, step outside, it’s literally on our doorstop here at Westminster.  
Brexit is pushing Britain in a dangerous direction. It’s time to press the @BestForBritain stop button and give people the #FinalSay. For the environment, for jobs, for public services, for living standards. 
"What a Tory-Brexit-shambles..."@thomasbrake offers his verdict on the latest moves by the PM on her failed Brexit negotiations. Add your name today if you want to exit from Brexit:  
Good to have @Keir_Starmer meeting with the EPLP today in Brussels. He again made it clear, Labour won't back any Brexit deal that doesn't meet our six tests:  
Theresa May is four points down in the polls. The antisemitism attacks haven’t ousted Corbyn. Boris is about to launch a leadership bid. Her Brexit policy is a shambles. So what does she do? Ratchets up tensions with Russia still further. It’s all so transparent. #Skripal

This weekend you will no doubt hear and see that Ireland has 'lost' €200 billion in fish to the EU since the 1970s.Here, I briefly explain why this figure is false and should be viewed as just a very expensive red herring.#Brexit #Irexit #Fisheries 
Tánaiste @simoncoveney speaking to media in Vilnius and thanking Lithuanian  FM @LinkeviciusL for solidarity on #Brexit - strong support across the entire Nordic-Baltic region greatly appreciated in Ireland   
The Northern Irish border is one of the biggest Brexit issues...When Brexit Minister Dominic Raab was asked if he had been to Northern Ireland, he replied "I've been to Dublin"... #TotalBrexitShambles 
Andrew Lewer was a member of Conservatives for Britain, and despite having only just arrived as an MEP, had the guts and principle to back Brexit. He stood up for Brexit and is doing so again  
Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin slams the Prime Minister’s Brexit strategy 
Lord King was a cheerleader for Brexit. This is incompetence of his own making - like Grayling complaining that the train is late  
"With #Brexit looming, our businesses, irrespective of stage of development or size, need to consider the opportunities and benefits of expanding their international reach" - @PatBreen1 at the #BeyondLocal event on small businesses reaching export markets  
Theresa May is knowingly damaging this country through her commitment to #Brexit How then can I trust her or her government to make the right decision on any other issue. The answer is simply, I can't. #PeoplesVote #FBPE 
Even this vile racist ("Romanian pickpockets") admits that brexit sold a false prospectus on immigration.  He complains that brexit will not reduce overall immigration and will instead mean more brown people. Will of the people.  
Olly Robbins loyalty to Brexit is questions by Richard Drax, Tory MP on select committee. Thru gritted teeth he tells Drax that "no part" of his personal views on any matter play a role in how he serve any government.  
Jeremy Corbyn used to avoid Brexit during #PMQs but today he devoted all his questions towards it to much effect. To quote the Guardian, "he made it look easy and he won quite comfortably." Theresa May's answers do nothing to give anyone reassurance she has taken back control. 
Which do you prefer?#PeoplesVote #Brexit #BrexitReality 
MAJOR BREAKING: The Spanish government sends over a THOUSAND riot police officers to Catalonia to prevent pro-independence protests in the anniversary of last year's referendum police violence. 
Polls? Oh those things that failed to predict Brexit in the first place. Got it.  
Thanks @NicolaSturgeon for a positive and constructive meeting. We discussed Brexit, skills, and business investment. All vital to get right for the Scottish Economy.  
UK and Germany agree to go for a ‘blind Brexit’ with political declaration on trade set to be aspirational and light on detail. Macron will hate it as will Brexiteer MPs. Is this what Merkel meant when she talked about showing more ‘creativity’ in talks?  
Brexit is like swapping a 'three course dinner' for 'a packet of crisps' says Liam Fox's former trade chief  
When the Lab party should be fighting #Brexit they are too busy fighting each other. Unions can see disastrous impact of Brexit on jobs, hence GMB now agreeing to support #PeoplesVote. Corbyn is out of touch on so many things - being positioned as future PM is laughable #FBPE 
How much longer must we suffer from the sheer stupidity of the tiny minority who thought Brexit might be a good idea? #StopBrexit @CCHQPress @UKLabour @Independent @GMB_union @labourpress @W_A_T_O_N @LBC

Corbyn blistering at #PMQs. Not only forensic questioning on Brexit, but 10/10 gag about Theresa May's recent misadventures in Africa with "you can't keep dancing round the issues".  
London is likely to survive Brexit better than other parts of the UK but places like Sunderland, Wales & Midlands, conned by Leave campaigns, are likely to suffer most. Actions have consequences & Leave voters will pay for Brexit lies. #StopBrexit 
Twice @jeremycorbyn was given an opportunity to commit to giving the people a #finalsayonthedeal on #Brexit but twice he ignored the question. Deal or no deal, Corbyn is pathetically letting down Labour voters who backed him to oppose reckless Tory policies. #fpbe #PMQs #libdems 
The real Brexit Opposition.  
BREAKING: Britain and Germany have abandoned key Brexit demands, sources say, potentially easing the path to a deal  
If @theresa_may can change her mind on Heathrow expansion, the country can change its mind on Brexit.MPs must hold a #PeoplesVote. Give the public a #FinalSay, with an #OptionToStay. 
Can I just say a HUGE thanks to the #FBPE folk for making such a fuss about this tweet cos they (weirdly) think a hotel booking=Brexit. I've just confirmed my hotel with the lovely folk at @Agoda who kindly gave me a large discount to apologise. I'll send you all a postcard! LOL. 
Is the UK economy really weaker that it would have been had it not voted for Brexit? On the basis of these charts from UBS, comparing UK post-ref growth with pretty much every major country, YES:  
- Border, you look miserable.- I am, Jean. The Tories are a mess. Labour no better. Brexit is a catastrophe.- Same as every day.- And I'm worried that ...- ... what?- Jamie Oliver is going to persuade the European Commission to ban Raspberry Ripple before Brexit happens 
Got called "ingenious" by PM today. Shame she couldn't answer why if she can change her mind on Heathrow, anyone can: she should allow us all a #peoplesvote on the final Brexit deal. #PMQs 
Senior UK Brexit ministry official says confident plans in place for 'no-deal' Brexit  
"When we lost the referendum on devolution in 1979, Plaid Cymru did not change its policy on devolution. The Party of Wales has to put the national interest of Wales first."Fy sylwadau am Brexit ar @SharpEndITVMy comments on Brexit on @SharpEndITV 
Leave voters aren't scared of change, they're sick of change being something that is done to them. This is why scare stories about a No Deal Brexit won't work: voters are willing to take a risk on something new, writes @Phil_Mullan 
If 6,400 civil servants have been working on Brexit, then added to her 100 ministers, that's 6,500 bods.They've been at the Brexit plan for TWO YEARS now.So the total number of man (or woman) years spent on this plan is now 13,000.Species have evolved in less time. 
Snap verdict"It’s hard to recall now that there was a time when Jeremy Corbyn avoided the topic of #Brexit at #PMQs at all costs. Today he devoted all six questions to it. He made it look easy and he won quite comfortably." 
At #PMQs @vincecable challenged the PM on the extent of her 'hostile environment' to immigration with regard to EU nationals.If you think we're better off in the EU and want to send Theresa May a message, join our campaign to exit from Brexit:  
Thatchers tories were politically wiped off the map due to her inflicting the Poll Tax on Scotland in the 80’s.Mays tories will be wiped of the political May due to her inflicting Brexit on Scotland. Tired of being politically & economically suppressed? Independence is our cure! 
Over 100 Labour MPs are now sponsored by unions backing a Brexit vote. While unions don’t control MPs, they’re hard to ignore, writes @DenisMacShane. 
A barnstorming Brexit tirade from Lord Hain in the House of Lords today:"Everybody knows the mantra is “Brexit, dammit”, but nobody knows yet what it means, and maybe we never will until after we crash out into the nirvana of Trumpian free trade"  
With just six weeks until Brexit talks were supposed to conclude, the Tories have no Brexit plan and no support in Parliament for the Chequers proposal.A "no deal" Brexit would be a catastrophe.#PMQs 
PMQs verdict: Jeremy Corbyn dances rings round May on Brexit  
“A majority voted Leave but they expected the negotiations to be handled competently” - Jeremy Corbyn at #PMQs Corbyn has never ruled out a second referendum. This would be a good month to announce his support for one 
The truth is, a second referendum or cancelling Brexit would result in relatively small scale disorder but would create domestic terrorism as a real threat.Weighed against destroying a country and severe, ongoing disorder of a general population in perma-chaos, it’s low risk.  
Here's my question during #PMQs today. Pleased to hear the Prime Minister confirm that Gibraltar will continue to be fully involved in all aspects of the Brexit negotiations, and that no other party will have a veto on that.  
A majority of people in Greater Manchester voted to leave the EU, yet today the Mayor Andy Burnham spoke out in support of a second referendum and a Brexit deadline extension. He is not only out of touch with the people of Bolton, but also the people of Greater Manchester.  
There’s nothing honest or principled about Corbyn. Honest men don’t seek to mislead the voters over Brexit. Principled men don’t share platforms with Holocaust deniers, or share meals with Srebrenica & Aleppo deniers. They don’t call racists misogynists & homophobes friends  
Those wanting a Second referendum do not believe in democracy. Well said Geoffrey Boycott! 
Looking forward to meeting @DominicRaab again tomorrow, continuing our work on the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement & on finding common ground between #EUCO March guidelines and Chequers w/ a view to creating a new, ambitious partnership, as I said on Monday to @CommonsEUexit 
Cricket legend, Geoffrey Boycott lets rip on Remainers who refuse to accept the referendum result.  
Theresa May changed her mind on Heathrow expansion when she saw the new proposal. It's time she applies the same logic to Brexit by giving the people the final say on the deal she secures.Watch @RupaHuq's stunning PMQ and share with friends 
This is the first time I've seen a brand taking a very obvious public stance on #Brexit - are there any other brands doing the same thing, as in, actually advertising their position? I can't say I'm not skeptical. I did wonder if it was just a PR stunt, but it seems not...  
Strong & stark statement from the PM on Salisbury murderers - but until the Government acts on dirty Russian money in UK & comes clean on Kremlin meddling in EU Referendum - May's tough talk will ring hollow. 
Once fully staffed at 8,250, based on the average national salary of £27,600, these 'unelected bureaucrats' working presumably exclusively on Brexit will have a collective annual salary of  £227,700,000. Just thought I'd put that out there  
'Remainers are like a spoilt child' who would have 'got a smack' in the good old days says no-nonsense cricketer Geoffrey Boycott. #Brexit @GeoffreyBoycott 
How is it possible, one year after the Catalan crisis began and 10 months after the declaration of independence and the suspension of home rule, that Spain is again listening to separatist demands for a referendum on secession? 
Which is a decisive reason why we should not be leaving the European union. You now support Brexit, despite having previously said we should stay in the EU because of  precisely these security concerns. Big mistake  
Most notable #PMQs line from Corbyn: "A majority of people voted Leave but they expected the negotiations to be handled competently" - potential case for a second referendum.  
6400 civil servants are working on a no-deal Brexit.  Imagine if that were a task-force on the future of the NHS, or of the education system, or of the post-automation workforce.Whatever else Brexit is, it is a huge, irrevocable opportunity cost. 
There is sufficient evidence to charge 2 Russian nationals with using a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Britain. If they enter the EU, we can apply to arrest them under an EAW. If the UK leaves the EU, we will lose this right.#Brexit threatens our national security. 
Great evening with Mr Brexit, Nigel Farage himself!  
'The EU is a cesspit of waste, inflated salaries and expense accounts,  sickening cronyism and sniggering contempt for citizens'EU - working exactly as designed! It was always meant to be this way!Viva Brexit! 
"We do not need a new border in Ireland and we do not need a new economic border in the Irish Sea."Four pro-remain parties in Northern Ireland are to travel to Brussels later this month to meet the EU's chief Brexit negotiator  
Lessons from today’s pro-brexit march on Downing Street:1. Bots don’t march2. Actual human Brexit supporters are profoundly apathetic3. There will be no civil unrest when brexit is stopped 4. They’ll thank us for it one day  
Brilliant #StandUp4Brexit pledge video from @ConorBurnsUK. Thank you!“The Chequers proposal does not deliver on Brexit. It would leave the United Kingdom as a permanent rule-taker of the decisions made it Brussels, without Britain’s input”  
King failed to see the Great Recession coming and then made it worse. He failed to see the Brexit he supported would endanger the nation. He wants you to understand that it’s everyone else’s fault  
Wales has just been given NO guarantee from the Prime Minister that the UK Gov will replace the lost EU structural funds due to Brexit... #significant revelation from question by @ChrisRuane2017#WalesKnackeredinUK #pmqs 
Let that be an end to queries about a “jobs first Brexit”

I had a strong sense at #PMQs that Labour/Corbyn now taking a much harder line against Brexit than before the summer. Repositioning towards supporting another Referendum? 
So we finally know what Theresa May means when she says that “Brexit means Brexit”. On a no deal Brexit, she said: "It won't be the end of the world."That's that then. Brexit means...”It won't be the end of the world.”Put that on a bus.#PMQs 
SNP Westminster Leader @IanBlackfordMP tells Theresa May her disastrous Tory hard Brexit 'Chequers Plan' is as "dead as a dodo" - and calls on the UK government to back our vital single market and customs union membership #BrexitShambles #PMQs 
Once again during #PMQs @jeremycorbyn refuses to commit to giving the people the final say on Brexit, ducking the question. The Labour voters who oppose Brexit deserve better. The Lib Dems are fighting for an exit from Brexit. Join our campaign today:  
Vital new polling on #Brexit Since 2016, 1 in 5 Leave voters have changed their minds Remain now leads Leave in a #PeoplesVote by 18%Continuing to refuse people the right to a say on a final deal is a travesty of democracy 
Theresa May reiterated that a ‘no deal’ scenario “wouldn’t be the end of the world”. This does nothing to reassure hard working people up and down the country that she isn’t hell bent on driving our economy off the Brexit cliff. But all is ok, our passports will be blue.#PMQs 
Pathetic from @jeremycorbyn. Given the opportunity at #PMQs to back a #FinalSay on #Brexit he has yet again refused. No matter the Brexit, leaving the EU will be a disaster for the UK. Corbyn is betraying his own supporters. Only the @LibDems are fighting for an #ExitFromBrexit 
The PM can't "keep dancing around the issues" over #Brexit, says Jeremy Corbyn #PMQs  
Well done @RupaHuq at #PMQs - cleverly pointing out that Theresa May reserves the right to change her own mind on issues (like Heathrow) but wants to deny the public a final say on the Brexit deal now we have new information about what it would mean. #PeoplesVote #ExitFromBrexit 
A leaked letter from NHS providers said that a no-deal Brexit could see hospitals run out of medicine. So Theresa May is wrong, it would quite literally be the end of the world... #PMQs 
Theresa May response to Brexit is to quote the WTO chief, who says no deal Brexit, "won't be the end of the world"  Absolutely pathetic! #PMQS 
At #PMQs PM Theresa May tries to maintain the pretence that the Chequers plan is still breathing. It isn't. It is as stiff as a board. With the only alternative she is offering, No Deal, a catastrophe, we must have a #FinalSay and a chance to exit from #Brexit 
No Deal Brexit No Food No Medicine Portaloos on the M20and SPAM  Theresa May “it won’t be the end of the world” FFS!!! #PMQs 
In these very troubled chaotic #Brexit times - and when so many of our people are suffering from Tory policies - I attempt to respond to matters in a mature & considered manner.The PMs conduct on #PMQs day was SHAMEFUL.It does NO credit to the office of PM or to HER personally 
#PMQS LISTENING to the PMs speech on Brexit today seems like she's half given up on the Chequers plan, and she seems to be going and preparing for a No Deal Brexit. This has been a waste of 2yrs and the weak PM should have pulled us out on WTO rules from the start we are a joke. 
Last week Theresa May could not even answer if she thinks she thinks Britain will be better off in the world after Brexit. Her silence speaks so much louder than her bluster in #pmqs today. 
This has been one of Corbyn's best and May's Worst #PMQs in a while.Corbyn has sharp and hard hitting questions on #Brexit And when pushed into a corner she turns nasty and throws smears.Its time she and her shambolic government step aside! 
PM: "We will not have a second referendum" #PMQs #brexit  
No one voted for this car crash Brexit. Polling today and in recent weeks shows the public has changed its mind on leaving the EU. To push ahead with Brexit without a #PeoplesVote would not only be irresponsible, it would be undemocratic. #pmqs 
She's chewing a wasp now - Corbyn has destroyed her on Brexit first week back. #PMQs 
Corbyn “No deal Brexit will be devastating”Theresa May “whatever”#PMQs 
Britons are welcome in #Germany. Tomorrow the German Cabinet will pass a #BrexitTransitionalLaw. During the #TransitionalPeriod until end of 2020 the barriers to request #GermanNationality will be reduced for #Britons and #DualCitizenship accepted. #U2EU #brexit  
#PMQs today notable for @jeremycorbyn persistently refusing to rule out a second referendum. Further slippage towards Labour abandoning their Brexit voters altogether. People in northern constituencies like mine should be watching *very* closely. 
Theresa May says a no deal Brexit “wouldn’t be the end of the world”. That’s quite a low bar. #PMQs 
Six weeks until Brexit talks were supposed to conclude, the Tories have no Brexit plan and no support in Parliament for the Chequers proposal.A "no deal" Brexit would be a catastrophe – the PM needs to negotiate a deal to protect jobs, the economy, and the Irish border.#PMQs 
Corbyn refuses to rule out a second referendum AGAIN... will sit on his hands and wait and see which way the wind blows #PMQs #Brexit 
May rules out a second referendum - which given her history, means we are most definitely having a second referendum (she'll just say it's a different referendum and not a second one)... #PMQs 
Amazing scenes here at #PMQs. The absolute best defence Theresa May has for Brexit is to quote the WTO chief, who says no deal Brexit, "won't be the end of the world."That's it then. "It won't be the end of the world."A total joke. 
A no-deal Brexit would be better than “the end of the world,” insists Theresa May. Oh the soaring ambition #pmqs 
A no deal Brexit would represent a complete failure of the PM’s negotiating strategy. It would be catastrophic for people’s jobs, the economy and for the border in Northern Ireland. #PMQs 
Chief whip @JulianSmithUK told ministerial meeting yesterday he "has the numbers" to get Chequers Brexit plan through the commons and all ministers had to decide "whether they are on the winning side". This relayed to me by one of many ministers who was chuckling on the inside 
If the government can't nail down anything close to a proper Brexit deal in 2 years, don't expect them to do it in 4.If you fall for #BlindBrexit, then between now and 2020, they're going to either crash the economy or trash British sovereignty. 
Whether you voted Leave or Remain, Brexit was not supposed to be like this. New facts have proven that it is impossible to get what people thought they were going to get, and that's why we need a People's Vote on the Brexit deal. #PoliticsLive

British voters would vote 59-41 to stay in the European Union if given the option after a six-point swing away from Brexit, an opinion poll showed on Wednesday, the highest recorded support for EU membership in such a survey since the 2016 referendum. 
Important. EU doubling down on the Northern Ireland backstop according to well placed source. This is where the Brexit negotiation stands, question is if either side has a compromise position.

13. Our campaigning did not lead Parliament to find themselves in this insane position, it has simply cast a huge magnifying glass on the continuing splits, errors and inconsistency of Brexit and its drivers.

Dear @theresa_may there was a vote two years ago that split the country roughly down the middle. At the time nobody knew what the ramifications of #Brexit would be. The public are now far better informed and polling suggests they're now strongly #Remain.Why no #PeoplesVote ? 
It is a huge indictment of our political class that1. It has taken two years and ridiculous levels of evidence for most of them to admit Brexit is a non-starter, politically, economically, socially and electorally.2. they're all starting to jump now that it's 'OK' to do so. 
Spoke at #AFIconference18 250 people from construction industry. Show of hands time - optimism re Trump - 4. Optimism re way Brexit going - 5. @theresa_may doing good job - 0. @jeremycorbyn would do better - 1. Agreement we are in a mess. Total. 
It's their immense faith in their own intelligence, with so little evidence to support it, that continues to shock me the most about the self-styled 'brains' of Brexit..  
Genuinely, my emotive tweet - justifiably so - about my daughter and Insulin has made two things really clear in replies.1) A lot of you feel the same, which is good to see&2) With only months to go, hardly  a single proponent of Brexit understands what no deal brings about

The @MayorofGM Andy Burnham says there needs to be a cross party campaign against a no deal Brexit. Says a second vote would widen divisions and cause social unrest BUT it would be better than leaving without a deal. First though, he says EU should be asked to pause article 50  
Politicians keep talking about how there *may* be ‘social unrest’ if there is another referendum. The way public opinion is shifting, I think there *will* be ‘social unrest’ if we don’t have another referendum. Just an opinion, not inciting anything....  
“Young people never had a say in the EU referendum... we need to give them a say!” says the co-leader of the Green Party.In 2004, during the North East devolution referendum, I was only 11 - shall I demand a second vote because I was a child at the time?Nonsense on stilts. 
Nearly 60% would now vote against #Brexit, according to new study by one of UK's most respected political anaylsts.So why are we proceeding with something that the public doesn't want and that will cause such massive damage?#PeoplesVote 
Rees-Mogg and the ERG don't give a damn about the damage #Brexit would do. They want a brutal no-deal Brexit producing great disaster capitalist profits, and forcing the UK to ditch the welfare state and become a tax haven style economy.  #PeoplesVote #Brexit  
Evening Standard: 49% of those who didn’t vote in 2016 would vote against Brexit now, while only 23% would vote to leave. Only 17% of voters expect May to secure a good deal, down from 33% last February. Only 13% think the government has handled Brexit talks well, 64% say badly. 
The cost of hiring talented healthcare professionals from abroad could more than triple to £490 million a year if free movement doesn’t continue post-Brexit, the Royal College of Physicians has calculated

A People’s Vote would give 54% to 46% to stay in the EU according to new analysis by NatCen, trailed by Bloomberg. The NatCen study is based on research in June before Theresa May’s Chequers proposal - since when public opinion has shifted further against Brexit. 
Mervyn King says Government's "incompetent" Brexit strategy "beggars belief"  
To deliver a Brexit that brings people the opposite of what they voted for - a Brexit which impoverishes, isolates and humiliates us - is a national scandal.But to deliver that when the people no longer even want it is a uniquely sadistic outrage.  
A lot of you are going to be really embarrassed by your language when you look back on this. Dunno if tackling antisemitism or caring about Palestinians is a “pointless hobby horse” personally. You could’ve made your very boring Brexit point another way. You’re an adult. Act it.  
A John Curtice poll has found that 59-41 would back Remain in a People's Vote on Brexit and that 20% of Leave voters have now changed their minds since 2016. #LeaveWatch  
Andy Burnham disagrees with Andy Burnham about a second referendum. But who will win?

This report sets out for politicians what people across the country have known for years: our economy isn't working. While the Govt wastes time wrangling with its disastrous #Brexit, ministers are failing to tackle the very real reasons people voted for such a radical change.  
From last week’s Private Eye. In case anyone missed it. Brexit asset stripping at its boldest. Travesty.  
Brexit - the won't of the people?  
"Andy Burnham backs second Brexit vote – but warns of social unrest". We have now reached peak Burnham. 
"British voters are more sceptical about Brexit than they’ve ever been and would probably vote against leaving the European Union if the government called a second referendum..."  
This British rhetoric will increase greatly the nearer we get to the referendum, we just need to be aware and be ready when they start their nonsense. 
Former governor of the Bank of England Mervyn King has called the British government's preparations for Brexit  'incompetent'.  
You are truly the lowest of the low, celebrating your utter, brazen betrayal of the largest ever democratic mandate in British history, & a complete disregard of your fraudulent pretence of standing on a manifesto to deliver Brexit. I find you truly the most revolting creature.  
I disagree with Mervyn King's claim that the incompetence of Brexit negotiations "doesn't tell us anything about whether the policy of staying in the EU is good or bad". Doubts about state capacity were a strong reason to oppose Brexit, as I wrote:  
The trouble with the coin-toss referendum analogy: heads - we stay; tails - no one agrees what tails is.

Update on this: the opportunity to amend #Brexit Cross Border Trade Bill in Lords yesterday was squandered. @UKLabour could have pushed for ‘Customs Union’ and probably won. But frontbench didn’t even try. They let it pass. Utterly disappointing. 
“I voted for out but I reckon we will make a big mistake now, we should stay in.” On the first day back after recess, how did voters think Theresa May is handling the Brexit negotiations?  
More bad news for #Brexit Britain. Atlantic storms, sent across from the USA by the far-right Trump, will batter britain. The Uk will be plunged in to chaos. The EU, however, will be protected by the single market, customs union and our shared EU values. 
Personally I think anyone who can execute a full face of makeup on a moving train should be put in charge of Brexit  
Today’s twitter poll:  If we end up  with a NO-DEAL Brexit, should UK voters have a 2nd referendum to decide whether to leave or stay?PS if you didn’t/couldn’t vote in the referendum, go with what you would’ve voted then. 
So contemptible to see all these leading figures who backed Brexit blaming everyone but themselves for mess they created. Never forget that whatever happens they bear the guilt for the chaos, the lost jobs, the decline in national income, the divisions  
Labour’s Andy Burnham “ultimately” backs a second referendum - just weeks after saying it would tear society apart: you can always tell the way the wind’s blowing with Andy

Report from doyen of political polling John Curtice finds just 13% approve of Government’s handling of Brexit and gives Remain an 18 point lead in a new #peoplesvote. It has taken longer than I expected but it appears the tide has definitely turned 
But we’re going to do a trade deal with them and that will make Brexit a massive success.  
I think that Lord King’s assessment of the damage being done by the Tory @GovUK’s  gross incompetence in negotiations has more truth to it than Jackson Carlow’s apologia for that same Government and petulant criticism of those who (like he once did) regard #Brexit as a disaster.

The former governor of the Bank of England, Lord King, castigates the government's preparations for Brexit, calling them "incompetent" #r4today 
WEAK: Lord King savages Theresa May's approach to Brexit. "It's beggared belief that the 6th biggest economy in the world should get itself in that position."  
Why is it when you ask a question raising a serious concern around brexit to a leading brexit supporter on here you are always met with silence ? I can’t remember remember one question being answered by any of them 
You moron. I'm a PhD scientist who works in Germany. No highly skilled individuals want to go to toxic Brexit Britain. In fact, the majority of highly skilled Brits I know are now trying to leave Britain. You & your Brexiter cronies have destroyed global Britain & made it a joke  
WATCH: What do Conservative Brextremists, pro-European Conservatives & Labour MPs all have in common? Almost all of them hate the PM's Brexit plan. Please RT:  
The point is that Vote Leave promised that a trade deal on the UK's terms would be quickly agreed by a desperate EU. Immediately preparing for "No deal Brexit" would have revealed the dishonesty of the campaign earlier, and made it harder to gaslight people.  
A quite remarkable image. Turns out regardless of gender, education , voting preference and position on Brexit, most people in Britain don’t think the economy is remotely fair.  
John Curtice study shows there would now be a majority against Brexit. Time for T. May & the Labour Opposition to truly embrace democracy with a #PeoplesVote @Labour4EU @labour4europe @euromove 
“As many as 59 percent said they would vote Remain in another referendum, while only 41 percent indicated they would back Leave,” the report said. “This is by far and away the highest the level of support for Remain that we have recorded.”  
Mervyn King seems to be basically blaming everybody else for his own belated realisation that the politics of Brexit might be quite complicated. 
There will be further #NHS privatisation after #Brexit because UK Govt will reduce tax rates & deregulate labour laws to make UK more attractive to investors. Public services will be cut back to prevent “crowding out” of private sector.Lexiteers have put the NHS at greater risk 
Now I understand why the PM believes a 2nd referendum would be a "betrayal of democracy" .  
Jackson Carlaw’s argument on #BBCgms this morning nonsensical - huffing that there’s been no effort on the part of those who lost the EU referendum to capitulate and let the Tories trash our economy and sacrifice jobs. And perhaps he needs reminded that Scotland voted Remain? 
GMS reporting that Scottish Labour and Tory “parties” (they are not parties) oppose Brexit. That’s rubbish, all Scotland’s Labour and Tory MPs voted to trigger A50. Davidson supports the PM & Leonard aligned closely with Corbyn’s Brexit #Disinformation from @BBCScotlandNews 
James have you seen this. Holiday companies getting their brexit implications t and C's in already. People won't get refunds if they can't fly next year. How many voted for that?  
Mervyn King on @BBCr4today...really. Thinks all would’ve been well if only we’d prepared properly for hard Brexit/no deal. You can hear the scapegoating cranking up ever louder 
As @GiselaStuart says, for politicians to talk about a second referendum before they've implemented the first one really undermines democracy.  
Tomorrow in the London Assembly (Thu 6th Sept) I will be debating a Green/LibDem motion calling for a 'people's vote' on #Brexit. Some people do not understand democracy - we've already had a people's vote on 23rd June 2016, and the people voted to leave!  
Lord Mervyn King slams the "incompetence" of the govt. "...it beggars belief that the sixth biggest economy in the world should get itself into that position.”Even those who have spoken favourably about Brexit in the past are jumping ship. #PeoplesVote 
You could not make it up. A Brexit referendum built on hate & division, using immigrants as scapegoats. Brexit built on the 350 mill NHS lie.Now costs of £500m just to try & hire NHS staff from overseas. What a sham.  
Powerful stuff from Lord King. We should have been preparing to be ready in day one, deal or no deal, ever since the 2016 referendum - as I set out in a detailed paper with industry experts:  
There's a growing fear among previously pro-Brexit voters that leaving the EU will damage Britain's economy, according to a leading social research institute  
The poorest families can't afford good food & rent. The poorest are single parents - mainly women. Another reason we need focused feminist policies & a women's vote on a #Brexit that could pile pressure on food prices and these households particularly.  
.@DavidDavisMP’s former chief of staff @BrexitStewart: It's time to aim for a Canada-style Brexit. And if that fails, WTO it is  
Expect more of this. “Brexit was a great idea but we were betrayed”...We need to keep repeating 1 thing. The strongest advocates of Brexit were in charge. None could find a feasible solution.The problem is Brexit

British opinion still deeply divided by Brexit - poll  
But a referendum is literally a poll of voters’ opinion

Never be complacent about fascism, nationalism or racism. In 1939 the threat did not merely come from Adolf Hitler. Here in the UK Sir Oswald Mosely & his blackshirt fascists marched on London on 7th May to demand a referendum to negotiate with the Nazis He was imprisoned in 1940

Does anyone know how  the aviation industry will cope post brexit in regards to transport and importantly AOG express deliveries of parts airside ? If a plane can’t take off because of a fault and it’s awaiting a part from the uk to Paris for instance @DominicRaab ideas ? 
So why not simply be honest now, Hilary ? State that the 2016 leave vote was criminally procured, and GUARANTEE that Labour will stop "brexit" , even if Jeremy is still wedded to the criminal project ? You must now surely realise it is the only honest and ethical thing to do 
If remainers had put their energies into helping Britain successfully regain full independence, we'd be on the verge of a brexit-extraordinaire. Everyone pulling together as one.Who cd have guessed the losing side wd do their utmost to reverse the result. 
Brexit is not the will of the people.2.6m Leave voters have switched to #Remain. And 53% of the public now want to #Remain - a six point lead. Give the public a #FinalSay, with an #OptionToStay.Press the #StopBrexit button now:  
Had a look at Nicola Sturgeon's 12 Bills in her programme for Govt. Niff Naff, Trivia and tinkering around the edges. Should leave plenty time for her main priorities. Moaning about Tories, Brexit, Westminster, releasing squirrels and stringing the faithful along on referendums. 
I feel the same. My son also has type 1 diabetes and every day I fear the worst. The likes of Fox, Johnson and Rees-Mogg grind on about a People's Vote being a betrayal of democracy, but they are betraying us. Ordinary people will be dealing with the Brexit fallout, not them. 
Seeing as we need to plan for brexit I’d like to ask @DominicRaab this : please let me know where I can find annual green card insurance for three sprinters that will cover me for ADR including Class 7 - those isotopes need delivering Dominic - I trust you can advise on this .. 
Unlike what both the EU and UK claim the withdrawal Agreement does not allow eu citizens in UK to live their life after Brexit as previously. My detailed legal account now in European Constitutional Law Review. @The3Million @Pipermigration 
I’ve asked a number of leading Brexit figures and MPs how I’m to secure my daughter’s asthma meds. Only one has ever replied, Gerard Batten, and with total disregard and not a fucking clue. I’ve even had Brexit fans tell me the risk to my 9 year old is worth it. 
When it comes to #Brexit Britain is on its own.The EU aren't going to help.The EU aren't going to compromise the Single Market.The EU 27 value the EU.The EU needs that to stay that way.Leaving the EU must be seen to be a stupid thing to do.Lesson there Britain.#Newsnight 
Now that UK Labour has been shamed, bullied and intimidated into accepting what many in the legal profession, including the person who drafted the IHRA AS definition, consider to be flawed, how long before the fbpe/brexit spanners start their latest assault? Hours? Days? Weeks? 
No, no, no. There is no such thing as *the right Brexit*. The referendum promised a unicorn. What's to respect? The reason for a final say on the deal is a chance to reject Brexit. Let's be clear about that.  
Also these Tories urging May to ditch Chequers and go for a Canada-style FTA - they've not thought about Northern Ireland, have they? #Brexit 
Anyone else hear the chap from @YouGov explaining on @LBC  radio today that opinion has moved from 52% voting for Brexit to 53% voting remain?That's a 5% vote swing from Leave to Remaining in the EU!   In one of their largest polls in recent months."The Will of the People" 
Remainers want a "less disruptive Brexit" like Leavers want a "slightly improved EU". No matter how you slice it, Brexit, in any form at all, is not the responsibility of people who voted against it.How is it possible to be head of Trade Policy at IoD and tweet this nonsense?

Lee (if that is actually you), by your logic there wouldn't have been a referendum. By your logic Britain would have remained in the EU because that's what was voted for in the 70s. You fought for what you believed in. Don't deny others the right to do the same.  
If your team is crap after Brexit you’ll know why. And please don’t say footballers should receive special treatment. More than NHS workers or any other European person?  
The evolution of the Brexiteer1) Brexit will Make Britain GREAT!2) Brexit might have some short term downside3) after a few years Britain could recover!4) Brexit might not be a complete disaster5) Its not our fault we never had a plan, its remoaners who pointed this out!  
Dodds & DUP have played it wrong on Brexit from start, but their incorrect characterisation of backstop as a constitutional crisis has to be their worst yet. They look foolish as there are already checks, but more importantly they've given no alternative to it #Brexit

The fact that such a letter has to be written exposes the delusions & fantasies of some people in the Left. People voted for Trump. People supported Le Pen. People voted for Brexit. You can’t eliminate or wish them away. Regardless of your convictions, their views exist & matter.  
We know that we can only get a worse deal than our current one.We know that people don't want Brexit anymore. There is no reason to oppose a #PeoplesVote 
Raab is right Labour would be "frankly useless" if they ever got in charge of #Brexit negotiations“Nothing could weaken the UK’s negotiating position more than dangling the prospect of a second referendum, which would only invite the very worst terms" 
The idea of any kind of second referendum is ludicrous. The principle that the loser can constantly force successive re-runs, one after the other, is imbecilic. So daft in fact that only a Remainer could have dreamed up such sad nonsense in the first place. 
Labour is doing a survey on Brexit. It is an utter shambles of a document, mostly designed to do down the Chequers plan (which is already dead as a dodo), & gives no space to critique Labour policy on Brexit. Remember this when the results come out. 
The Brexit secretary displays the confidence of a man who has forgotten just how sidelined and out of his depth he really is  
Premier League fears Brexit could damage the league worldwide. 6 months out, it has no idea what the rules on signing foreign players will be.  
 As a political communication analyst, I must admit that even in its deepest sadness, Brexit has produced some of the most creative pieces of political satire I will ever see in my life   
Exclusive: Premier League wants Brexit exemptions amid fears next N'Golo Kante would be denied work permit. Premier League is calling for *no restrictions* on all foreign players, with clubs free to sign anyone they like if they are good enough 
"The UK is going to be ready for nothing. The only Brexit we are going to get is the one the government manages to smuggle past both the EU and parliament. And right now it doesn’t have a clue what that might be" #BrexitShambles 
Has the UK Government ever before removed rights from adult UK citizens who've committed no crime without giving them a say, other than the denial of votes to UK nationals resident in the EU? They are directly affected by #Brexit, despite assurances, so MUST get a #PeoplesVote 
What a ridiculous response to @TommySheppard’s excellent question..... Has Dominic Raab forgotten it was Theresa May who triggered article 50 against the advice of her own civil servants Brexit hasn’t even happened and the Tories are trying to cover up their mistakes.  
Exclusive: Premier League wants Brexit exemption amid fears next N'Golo Kante would be denied work permit | @timwig 
Jon is absolutely right. The continued demeaning utterances on Brexit from too many folk including in Government are absolutely the opposite of what we need. With this in mind here are 10 Brexit facts which everyone involved - particularly media - must know (thread)  
I met 2 people in my shop today, one, a scaffolder who said he never had any interest in politics but is really concerned about Brexit now. He did not vote. The other, an aggressive chap who took offence at my EU flags. The divide is real. 
He's also demanding that his farm subsidies be guaranteed by the Govt after Brexit. 
I hope we can, because I don’t want Brexit of any kind, but I don’t want to be in a position where Leavers feel like they were cheated in the same way Remainers feel like they were.

Does anyone who's heard about your daughter; thought about the consequences of a 'no deal' #Brexit for her, and for countless others, and yet whose hardened heart hasn't been softened by this human dimension, deserve to have their referendum result 'respected'? Certainly not.

Constructive comments by MM on #Brexit following meeting with @MichelBarnier 
Unfortunately the Leave campaigns preferred to lie rather than give voters a realistic view of the kind of #Brexit options available. The problem now is that there is no Brexit outcome which remotely matches the promises made.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
I broke my own rule today and made the debate a Leaver/Remain dichotomy even tho we are well past the ref. Probably shdnt have even mentioned blame. Rephrasing and drawing a line under it - there is still more realistic mileage in trying to shape #Brexit IMHO than stop it. Ends.

This would be at least the second such shift by a Japanese company before Brexit  
That moment when #Brexit Minister referred to #Scotland as a 'region of England' ... 
Take a look around now -Brexit, Wilders, Alternative for Germany- and you get a sense not only of how many observers in the 1990s "end of history" zeitgeist underestimated nationalism but also how quickly (radical) political change can occur 
Why would the Scottish Tories be worried about foreign nationals living in Scotland being able to vote in an independence referendum? 
Then count me in and count my husband in. If anything happens to a single child because of Brexit, we are happy to go berserker with you. 
President Torra insists on referendum and calls for march to defend 'civil and national rights'  
And these things are partly why we've not seen a major change of minds among Brexit voters. Too many fell into the trap of thinking Brexit was all about the domestic risk of Brexit when it was about what people saw as external risks in the EU -weak borders, insecurity, divisions 
Put in other words, the drivers of the Brexit vote are clearly visible in other EU states even if (for now) public support for the EU remains stronger than in Britain 
#fishing #WatersBackMay's dilly-dallying over Brexit has inevitably raised tensions. Just take back (all) our waters + let British fishermen create proper fishing rules, so everyone knows where they stand + fish stocks are managed sustainably. Being an island has its privileges.  
Most conservatives don't want to hold a new referendum. They are not part of our political culture and conflict with the British system of representative democracy.Yet the crisis we are in is the consequence of a referendum and in the absence of leadership it's the only way out  
I don’t give a rat’s fuck about your politics, about your dreams of empire. About your privilege.I won’t hesitate, I won’t stop. No deal to make.I’ll treat all of it with same contempt my little girl’s life has been shown.For me, Brexit is quite simple. Always has been. 
I've seen some tweets the last few days, saying there ought to be more respect in the online debate about #BrexitBut when Boles, Green, Lilico and Raab come up with such ill thought out nonsense, respect is the last thing on my mind.A new blog post... 
I mean, for me, Brexit is quite simple.If you cause a no deal exit, and Insulin runs out, and anything happens to my 7 year old daughter with Type 1 diabetes, I will tear everything that’s left down brick by fucking brick until it’s dust.Quite, quite simple. 
An Irish forklift truck maker that used to buy its seats from a Welsh factory has now switched that contract to a German manufacturer.It's one example of how a lack of clarity on Brexit is already affecting trade.

The “peace plan” heavily favored Russia and envisaged a Ukrainian referendum on leasing Crimea to Russia for 100 years in return for the withdrawal of Russian support for its proxy fighters in Ukraine. It was a nonstarter from the very start. <3/7>  
Brexit: It's not about you... It's about THEM...  
Is that it? This is going to be the Tories entire strategy until Brexit hits? "got down to work" is just a rehash of "get on with the day job" which worked for a while to be fair, then people saw through it.Well, most people.It's time for some policies from the Tories.  
Barnier has ruled out May’s Chequers plan. And Rabb should be ruling out a Canada-style deal which would have no solution to Irish border, & nothing on services – our biggest asset, but he failed to do so here. The only way forward is a unifying #EEA-based #Brexit.  
The Brexit paradox:Any government with the necessary competence to deliver Brexit, wouldn't. 
Even though you disagree with Brexit there’s no need to use stupid scare tactics that are factually incorrect to try and make your point.  Scotland aren’t going anywhere. Believe me  
Tánaiste @simoncoveney meeting with Finnish  FM Timo Soini in Helsinki tonight. Excellent conversation on #Brexit and a range of foreign policy issues.  
When a party whose leader's being squarely condemned over racism gains a 4-pt lead over the party of govt, you can see how bad the Tories are doing. Thanks to #Chequers. When will the Tory leadership stop being tone-deaf and listen to the British people?#ChuckChequers#Brexit  
It isn’t the Govt, isn’t Bank of England, isn’t an economist, isn’t a politician.It’s a Swiss investment bank & financial services co. advising its clients, but I’m sure #brexit #leave fanatics’ll be along to tell us it’s all project fear & they know more about banking than UBS. 
For 2 years politicians have told us their version of Brexit is the right thing for our country. The can't all be right, and we don't believe any of them are right.Now we are better informed, on whatever deal emerges, the people must decide if it's what they want.#PeoplesVote 
Six months until Brexit... what are the options?#newsnight 
.@DominicRaab may try and deny his words now he's #Brexit Secretary, but clearly 2 years ago before the referendum he believed a pause and then a vote on a #Brexit deal is a good idea. Pity now him and the Government ignore #LibDems and mass public support for #PeoplesVote #fpbe 
Teresa May's talk of betrayal makes me very angry.The loss of the right to live work and travel in 27 countries represents a massive and unprecedented loss of opportunity for our children & grandchildren. The real betrayal of #Brexit is of the young, by the old. Unforgivable.

Of all the recent disappointments, I think the one that irritates the most, is the one that somehow, the fact that we are not looking at a soft Brexit (Norway,Switzerland etc.), is my fault.1. I can remember the 2016 Tory conference.2. I remember Citizens of Nowhere...

Not quite a #remainernow story but this is definitely right from @thomasbrake. 16-17 year olds will have to live with brexit the longest and evidence shows they want a different future.We therefore cannot exclude them from a #finalsay #peoplesvote 
I’m afraid it’s Mr Dodds who is using the people of Northern Ireland as ‘cheap political currency’ - claiming to be against hard Brexit while voting for it time after time in the House of Commons, hoping people won’t notice

"Respecting Democracy" is not the same as "Respecting the Referendum".No one can deny that the visions of Brexit being presented now are not what was promised in 2106. If our MPs respect the #WillOfThePeople then they should seek our #InformedConsent.

Catalan president Quim #Torra points out to Spanish PM Pedro Sánchez that Catalonia has gone way past the point of negotiating a referendum on a new statute of autonomy. Nothing less than another referendum on self-determination will do, & one without threats and state violence.  
Catalan President @QuimTorraiPla demands that the Spanish Government grant Catalonia a referendum of self-determination: 'I will not accept anything less. The Catalans have the same rights as the citizens of Scotland and Quebec to decide our future.'  
With fewer than 206 days until the disastrous no deal Brexit you opposed, yet your party in Westminster is delivering, you, Ruth Davidson, need to stop promoting your book and get on with using this much touted influence you're alleged to wield to help protect Scotland.  
There's a good case for Mark Carney to stay on at the Bank, to continue overseeing monetary policy & the supervision of the financial sector through #Brexit. But, I trust, with a positive attitude to #Brexit!

Carney  up to now has been doing everything he can to prevent Brexit. One of the drivers of Project Fear, with predictions of doom that have not materialized. He should leave on due date with his jacket over his head.

It's the stupidity I can't stand.I can accept, sort of, that Corbyn hates the EU and wishes we'd never joined. That's his view and he's entitled to it.But to fail to see that Brexit is a disaster, and that opposing it would put him in No. 10... That's unforgivable dumbness. 
SENSE: JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin backs a No Deal Brexit.“You’ll be £40bn better off, you can abolish tariffs which apply on over 12,000 products - You can regain control of fishing and you can encourage foreign businesses to invest here.” 
An ambitious programme for government by @theSNP Scot Gov. Responding on behalf of the Tories @RuthDavidsonMSP outlines the Tory alternative view - “ No to a second independence referendum. “ 
May & Overpowering Stench of Treachery'Conservative' Party exposed as morally bankrupt cesspit of political putrefaction, a rotting husk.In better times, a PM accused of what May stands accused of would be out of office within days, if not hours.#Brexit 
When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of September 4, 2018 at 05:50PM, £1 buys 1.1095€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote 
I do not care if holidaymakers are mildly inconvenienced by Brexit. Not a tinker's fuck is given.

Great piece of reporting here - Liam Fox puts money where his mouth isn’t ....  Liam Fox spends tens of millions on firms warning of Brexit dangers | openDemocracy  
Brexit is not the will of the people.2.6m Leave voters now back #Remain - and 112 more MPs’ constituencies.Send @UKLabour’s conference a clear demand: a #PeoplesVote with an #OptionToStay.March with @Liverpool4EU from St George’s Plateau - Liverpool, 12:00 Sunday 23 Sept. 
Liam Fox spends tens of millions on firms warning of Brexit dangers   
Just heard from a Brit friend whose parents lived in France for years - she came over full-time two years ago to nurse her mum while she was dying. Now she's not sure if she'll be allowed to stay to look after her widower dad who's recovering from cancer. Fucking Brexit. 
Excellent to see the leader of our Council @AndrewMorganRCT calling for a @peoplesvote_uk on the final Brexit Deal. He’s  % correct - this Brexit Deal will make our constituents right across RCT poorer and our public services weaker. That’s not what anyone voted for.  
“We will be championing a #PeoplesVote on Brexit, tackling climate breakdown, ensuring everyone has the right to a safe warm home and fulfilling work that translates to more time off with our families." 
Thanks to, er..., Brexit...  
Do we really want to follow a more & more right-wing Tory government into a possible Brexit armigedon?Scotland could, should, will be a very different countryScotland will be the country WE want it to be.Time for a change#YouYesYet#indyref2#Independence 
Govt refusal to show MPs the full impact analysis of a no deal #Brexit makes a mockery of the already disbelieved mantra ‘taking back control’. The Govt must stop these murky games and do the right thing by pledging to release this analysis. 
 GDP down 2.1%  Investment down 4%  Inflation up 1.5%  Consumption down 1.7%  Real Effective Exchange Rate 12% more depreciated And all this before #Brexit has even happened: 
Spain offers referendum on greater Catalan autonomy. Hope Catalans don’t fall for that as Scotland did, getting broken promises in return for staying together. #ScotRef

Looks like my 6pm Delivery is out the window .... they had a cancellation and all trains delayed - plus the border force seemed to be on a go slow today and the queues went out almost to the motorway .. wait for personal allowances post brexit that’ll be fun  
Global Britain is brilliantly placed to seize the opportunities of Brexit  
The British people deserve better than this. Brexit has taken longer, cost more, and been far more complicated than we were told. Labour leadership are going along with the Tories. The Liberal Democrats are not.Join our campaign to exit from Brexit:  
Liam Fox says even a no deal Brexit would be good for British business - but his department has spent tens of millions with firms that have warned of economic disruption, dysfunction and chaos post Brexit. My latest @openDemocracy exclusive  @JennaCorderoy

I have a dream! That all the decent members of the Parliamentary #Labour Party resign the whip and sit as independents, same as crossbenchers in the House of Lords. Joined by moderate pro-EU #Tories for a new grouping, not a new party, to stop #Brexit and #Corbyn. Who's with me? 
Power companies have warned that Brexit could drive up energy bills even further as trade barriers threaten to increase the cost of importing gas and electricity across the Channel.  
Richard Branson - The British Public were misled during the referendum.. If #brexit happens it will be a disaster for Great Britain.. it's very unwise for business leaders & other leaders not to speak out as they can see people just shooting themselves in the foot.#peoplesvote 
The real division we face is not between the nations of the United Kingdom.It is between the richest few and the rest of us.That is the divide Nicola Sturgeon should be focused on, not dividing the people of Scotland with another unwanted independence referendum.  
This is really worth watching. #Brexit is madness, they know it and we’ve known it all along, so now we must stop it @peoplesvote_uk @OFOCBrexit @peoplesvote_uk @thomasbrake @SarahLudford @EdwardJDavey @LaylaMoran 
Flying out of the UK thoroughly depressed at the state of politics I leave behind. Extremes flourishing in both parties. Government incompetence supreme.Labour becoming institutionally AntiSemitic in front of our eyes. Brexit chaos. Where have the good people and competence gone? 
If Labour do the exact opposite of what they promised at the election and back a 2nd referendum it will be their death knell. I'm fine with that Anna but don't take the Conservative Party down with you!  #PeoplesVote #StandUp4Brexit #Brexit 
This is a ridiculous take. Our energies are focused on stopping a monumental national mistake while we still can. Don’t accuse us of enabling a “disruptive Brexit” by trying to stop it! Blame rather the enablers who concede defeat before the battle has been lost.  
Richard Leonard: 'Leaving the United Kingdom would mean an unprecedented decade of austerity for the people of Scotland' Because the FIFTY YEARS of austerity Brexit will cause is so much easier to stomach as part of the precious Union?Get in the sea.#ScotPfG 
Theresa May has  said on leaving the EU we will have “LESS MARKET ACCESS”. The EU has trade deals with over 60 other countries, inc Canada, Japan & South Korea - all in jeopardy on Brexit day. We have the first Gov’t in our history that has made a REDUCTION in trade its policy!  
 Nicola Sturgeon & the SNP announce an ambitious programme for government with more money for health and eduction. Richard Leonard & Scottish Labour: "No Independence Referendum."What a sorry state. #ScotPfG 
It's not the shabbiest thing he's said so far today but Richard Leonard in response to the Programme for Government just said we can't go for Independence because ... #Brexit. No! Brexit is one of many good reasons why we really NEED to be going for Independence. Sigh! 
Throughout FM's Programme for Govt she spoke about importance of migration to Scotland, talked about enormous contribution immigrations have made & gave assurances to EU citizens in the face of UK Govt's hard-brexit. Now try & imagine UK PM saying the same...nope neither can I! 
This is blame-shifting bollocks. Theresa May’s career-defining error was in not devising a ‘pragmatic’ Brexit that reflected the closeness of the 48-52 result. She stupidly ruled out EEA/Norway+ from the start, hence the mess we’re in today.  
Actually, Ruth Davidson, the @scotgov has been busy this year - in spite of the Tory Brexit mess that is engulfing the UK.  #ScotPfG 
GMB Union call for Brexit vote adds pressure on Corbyn to follow suit  
How history would see Brexit:The political class s*at on the working class for decades, esp. in areas like the North East & South West. Blamed it all on the EU, to convince them to vote for Brexit. Then even as every promise was crumbling, silenced them by denying a #PeoplesVote 
Dear Leavers.Do you know that the half a million Bollocks to Brexit and other stickers we have supplied through #EUflagmafia have all been printed in Lincolnshire, a huge leave area. On purpose. Brexit bonus - a boom in pro EU merchandise  
As trade unionists, when we negotiate a pay deal with an employer, we go back to our members and ask them if they’re happy with it. On Brexit, the government need to take a leaf out of our book and be led by the people >>  
ICYMI: 2.6 million Leave voters have abandoned their support for Brexit in light of Theresa May's plans, as she fails to deliver on the promises made during the referendum.The people must have the #FinalSay on her deal. Agree? Please share. 
It’s statistically proven that the majority of males over the age of 55 that are members of golf clubs in the Home Counties see pockets on shorts on the course a bigger issue than Brexit !!! 
This is leadership. Well done  @Tim_Roache & @GMB_union - ‘when our Union negotiates a pay deal we then ask the members if they want to accept or reject that deal’ Dead right - and the same democratic choice should be given on the Brexit Deal.  
My old boss. Always ahead of the curve.Has David Davis triumphed in the battle for Brexit?  
If #Brexit falls to party-political pieces & we don't get another chance to vote on it could we at least put some experts in charge who know what they're talking about & will work together constructively and collaboratively to come up with the best possible deal? Just a thought. 
This will guarantee EU citizens their right to vote in any future independence referendum, since it will be based on the Scottish Parliament franchise.  
Brexit vote has cost UK more than 2% in 2 yrs but Brexit fan #Marr still asked @LiamFox the leading question "So when the chancellor says that we'd lose 7.7% of GDP (in 15 yrs) with a no deal do you think that's nonsense, do you think that's projest fear?" 
I wish I could sit in for @mrjamesob for a day or too...skewering those who talk nonsense about policing with inconvenient facts & logic in exactly the same way he does with those talking nonsense about Brexit. I'd even settle for a day sitting next to him! How about it James? 
IT'S HERE! The  Brexit Battle Pack has been launched TODAY! Don't get angry, do something! All the tools for you to take action to secure #Brexit are here: 
Nicola Sturgeon says Scottish Government will pay “settled status” fees for EU citizens living in Scotland after Brexit #PfG 
FM: “We must protect EU citizens who already live here. They should not have to pay settled status fees post-Brexit. It is simply wrong that people already making a contribution to our country should have to pay to retain rights they already have.” #ScotPfG 
You can imagine a situation, for example, where a cross-party commission or similar was set up with the objective of finding the least damaging form of Brexit, or a UK Gov stating that the least damaging and disruptive form would be the one they pursued 3/ 
Autumn will see @LibDems lead the charge against  disastrous #Brexit. More voices calling for #PeoplesVote daily. Tories selfish & myopic, Corbyn mired in racism. Meanwhile families suffer as £ falls #FBPE 
This, from last year, is a summary by the ex-head of the Council Legal Service on some of the legal and political aspect that make an EEA type Brexit, however superficially attractive, hard to see as a politically sustainable solution. 1/  
FM: “As the terms of Brexit become clearer in the months ahead, we will consider and set out our view on how Scotland’s interests can best be protected and advanced.” #ScotPfG 
You have to hand it to @theresa_may - with 52% supporting Brexit and 48% demanding a Remain despite the vote... she magically conjured up a solution that made 99% unhappy with the outcome.  Now that’s a real skill.  
Union call for Brexit vote adds pressure on Corbyn to follow suit  
I like it. @LeaveEUOfficial Brexit project is a campaign to destroy the Union and make that flag a thing of the past. 
Summary:1. Everyone claims Our BBC is biased.2. Which, clearly, proves we're not.3. We provide a wide selection of pro-Left, anti-Right views, which are then pitched against a broad spectrum of anti-Brexit, pro-EU thinking.4. Talk about Our Balanced BBC!5. That's all, folks!  
New Brexit referendum backed by GMB union  
Many embittered Remainers would rather Britain fails than Brexit succeeds.  
The Govt’s shambolic Brexit plans could sink our economy in a swamp of regulation. They must stop recklessly risking the country’s future, and provide the people with what they deserve: a #FinalSayOnTheDeal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit 
'People deserve a final say on the Brexit deal because the promises made during the referendum campaign are simply not the reality we are facing.'A huge step forward - @GMB_union and @Tim_Roache today pledge their support for a public vote on the Brexit deal. #PeoplesVote 
After years of middle management politics, the young have captured the Labour Party and the elderly are voting for a Tory Brexit. And middle-aged, middle of the road Middle England can’t understand why they are no longer in control.  
People have no reason to worry about a no-deal Brexit scenario 
The majority of the public now want to #Remain in the EU.Brexit is not the will of the people.We should use our emergency stop and #StopBrexit. 
This month, I'll travel with leaders of Sinn Fein, Alliance & the Greens to meet with @MichelBarnier in Brussels. We'll jointly make the case that we need protection from a hard Brexit - full access to markets and no borderism. Confident of Monsieur Barnier's continued support. 
And the “John K. Lodgins” account disappears from Twitter as quickly as you can say “bad English”. We rumbled him. His profile pic was ripped from the web.His comment had been that Brexit was “best British decision”Da, comrade, da.  
This is major news. It's clear for all to see that the government's Brexit deal is going to damage the livelihoods of workers, whether through job losses/insecurity or through changes to working protections. This is a brave, bold step in our march for a #FinalSay 
Brexit opponents overwhelmingly know this. They'll take any resistance option they can get. But there are lots of prominent people on all sides of the debate who pretend otherwise. 
Maybe soft Brexit is on the ballot paper. Maybe it's what happens if the referendum isn't won. It doesn't matter. You can pursue an ideal strategy and a damage-limitation strategy at the same time. 
A reminder: you can call for another referendum and push for a soft Brexit. These are not incompatible propositions. 
1/ Here is @Nigel_Farage on August 21st criticising UK Govt for wanting to guarantee #citizensrights of the 3.6m EU citizens in the UK. Effectively calling for EU Citizens to be turfed out in case of no deal Brexit & for acquired rights to be cut. Which is remarkably different...  
New Post-ABC poll finds 2018 midterms shaping up as referendum on President Trump, with Democrats holding widest advantage of cycle in generic ballot, 52% vs. 38% among reg voters 
Obviously I take issue with the line “what sort of Brexit is the right Brexit”... but one step at a time - and remember that a broad audience needs to be kept on board. First you make PV an imperative as a foundation of democratic process. 
Well done to the @GMB_union trade union, for putting the livelihoods of its 620,000 members first, and calling for a public vote on the Brexit deal (or no deal)! 
This is the mindset of your average anti-Brexit type. Except this guy chose to give the game away. They hate Britain.  
“I am from Suffolk. I am a #Brexit...” - nah, this new account doesn’t look dodgy at all mate.  
2 years in, I can't find 1 Brexiteer who can tell me (honestly) why they want it, or can name 1 single undeniable benefit. 2 years in, I can't find a single French, Spanish or Portuguese friend here in SW France who understands why Britain is doing it. #Brexit - The age of stupid 
France and Germany have a message for the UK, with just a little Brexit subtext.

This is hugely significant news from @Tim_Roache I met with my own @GMB_union branch last night to hear how a reckless Tory #Brexit risks members jobs in manufacturing and so many other sectors. Time for @UKLabour to follow suit and back @peoplesvote_uk 
 Mark Carney faces questions in Parliament on Brexit and his Bank of England future  
I will repeat what I said to Alistair Campbell earlier: can we stop calling it the #PeoplesVote and start calling it the #LosersVote ? Because nobody who won wants a second Brexit Referendum   
Remain campaigners accused of using dodgy opinion polls to undermine Brexit:  #BrexitBetrayal

We are members of NATO and The UN. We pool our sovereignty and our military resources in any number of ways. When did we last have a referendum on membership of the UN or NATO? 
Many of us fighting brexit do so for our kids so this survey of Mumsnet users is no surprise:"22% of those who say they voted Leave in 2016 say they now want to Remain, while 2% of those who voted Remain in 2016 say they now want to Leave"#remainernow 
The GMB has called for a public vote on the final Brexit deal because the union says promises made during the referendum are "not the reality we are facing" 
Remainers only want a second referendum in order to overturn the result of the first one, which they lost. A second referendum would undermine respect for our democracy and its institutions.  
Seismic! GMB Union advocate the British public getting the final say on the Brexit deal!!  
Nobody voted for a no-deal Brexit, says @mrjamesob, and if that's what happens, there's no alternative than to have another referendum.  
.@AndrewMarr9: It looks like we’re heading towards a ‘no-deal’ Brexit  
If this is accurate, this is the Brexit Leavers voted for.  It's May's Lancaster House speech, not Chequers.   
BBC POLITICS LIVE 4/9/18Not happy.First up was a Brexit discussion, but on the panel is a lone Brexiteer, out of four guests. Bias.What don't the BBC "get" about bias or balance? Out of four panelists 2 should have been Brexiteers.   
Sounds about right.Belief in #Brexit is an act of faith.But faith is often blind and often stupid.And in this case it absolutely is.  
Today our General Secretary Tim Roache calls on the Prime Minister to give the British public the final say on the Brexit deal.

Following in the footsteps of Panasonic, Muji is now preparing plans to move its European base to Germany as a result of Brexit  
Dear @theresa_may How can you say you’re ruling nothing out on #Brexit & then rule out a vote on the outcome? If a majority of people want a vote, we should have it. If most people don’t want one, we shouldn’t. We need sufficiently large & diverse opinion polls to determine this  
There must be no extension of the transition period.. Glad to hear confirmation of this from Philip Rycroft, Secretary at the Brexit Department. #brexitmeansbrexit 
Tim Martin is an idiot who won't have to live with the consequences of #brexit and has moved his base to the EU.

56% of Brits think "immigration into my country is a good thing" - one of the highest figures in the EU. Only 19% think it's bad. I find this difficult to square with the public debate on the issue and Brexit.  
When it comes to our data economy, #Brexit means losing control: following EU rules which, until now, we’ve helped write. That’s relinquishing sovereignty, not taking back control of it as Brexiters promised.#PeoplesVote 
I'm going to have to limit my access to Twitter today, because to be frank, there are too many people I want to tell to fuck off.I'm sick of the AS shite, Brexit, Blairites, Murdoch, Tories and Trolls (in no particular order).I've officially HAD ENOUGH. 
Fewer international students will want to come to a narrow-minded, backwards looking little island that is cutting itself off from its continent and which vilifies foreigners. Young people are open minded, forward thinking and at ease with diversity.  The opposite of Brexit.

#r4today "BBC News is not biased in Brexit reporting, says John Simpson." He's wrong. Humphrys is so transparent, giving an easy ride to Brexiteers but constantly interrupting others. The BBC gave Farage far more airtime than he ever merited and now does the same with Rees-Mogg. 
This is total nonsense. If the Government hadn't set itself on a course for hard Brexit with its ridiculous red lines at the outset there would be no clamour for a people's vote. 
Exactly.  It was the Lancaster House speech that turned me into an activist.  There was never any mandate for May's batshit brexit. 
2.6 million people who voted Leave in 2016 have since changed their minds and would back Remain in a People's Vote on the Brexit deal according to polls by YouGov. The People's Vote campaign continues to build momentum!  
Here’s a reminder of a tweet that was sent during the 2014 Scottish Independence Referendum...  
Here’s what Nicola Sturgeon should announce in her Programme for Government.Bin the referendum, work with other parties, and focus on economic growth.  
Not sure I buy this increasing narrative that if Remain voters had got on board Brexit would have been far easier. May said out of single market and customs union way back in Jan 2017. That’s the ur moment right there  
"Brexit may be unfolding under a female prime minister but she is failing to represent the 58% of women that want a People’s Vote on the final deal. "  
As someone who has worked in IT for 30 years, I can also confirm that @andrew_lilico is talking dangerous nonsense.Brexit is the sum total of our country's ignorance and arrogance, mixed together and shaped into a massive country-destroying iceberg. #PeoplesVote 
These Yr 11 legal studies students at Cabramatta High School loved seeing the Uluru Statement today. They give me more than hope, they give me the certainty that we can win a referendum to enshrine a First Nations Voice in the Constitution.  
How about we start by stopping #Brexit & ending the home office #HostileEnvironment then YOU ABSOLUTE PLANK. Universities are seeing EU staff and students turn away in their droves. We will also be less competitive & attractive to international applicants after #Brexit!   
The momentum is building. Even Theresa May is talking about a People's Vote. On 20/10, London will see the biggest march for a decade - full of passionate, optimistic, patriotic citizens demanding a final say on Brexit. Book your coach ticket, bring 20 mates #20for20 #PeoplesVote 
Thanks to Brexit vote, UK growth more than 2% lower than it would have been, inflation 1.5% higher, investment 4% lower, consumption 1.7% lower, real effective exchange rate for £ 12% lower, say @UBS economists. And this is all before exit 
Meeting on Brexit with representatives of Swedish business this morning. One thing clear: We need an agreed way forward for the UK and the rest of the EU. 
A second referendum result would be “the will of the slightly better informed now people”.

When people say that fascism isn't behind #brexit one must only ask people to look at Steve Bannon and ask them "what do you think he is?!"  Same goes for Farage, Rees Muck, Breitbart etc... it's like some people have had a perception bypass...this is fascism in broad daylight  
To the remainers in England, (and for that matter in Scotland), bear in mind that if Scotland votes for Independence PRIOR to March 29th 2019, the UK will no longer exist and her resources cannot be negotiated away.Scotland gaining independence will stop Brexit.#VoteYes

In my view this is what Europe's stance on immigrants, Brexit and "Make America Great Again" is all about. Fear: of retaliation and of domination.  
#Brexit is perhaps the most monumental ****** the Tories have ever had - and that's saying something.What they clearly need now is #Ruth_Davidson as Leader: in favour of Remain and Leave, a fan of everyone's plan and of no plan at all, but most of all, of her own career plan.

Ta very much Brexit voters. Scotland is noo getting dragged oot of the EU against its will because some of ye stupidly believed a sleekit red bus and a poster of folk trying tae escape a war that oor government helped tae cause.Numpties.  
As politicians make the way back to Westminster after a summer of cock ups and confusion one thing has become clear: there is no support for either the Chequers proposal or a no deal Brexit. Only a #PeoplesVote on the final deal can solve this mess. 
Brexit has already cost Britain more than 2% of economic output, a new study shows, even before it’s left the bloc. Economists at UBS Group AG estimate that GDP 2.1% smaller than it would have been, inflation 1.5% higher. Consumption 1.7% lower, investment investment 4% weaker. 
Brexit is failing to deliver on its promises. Its champions promised sunlit uplands but it's set to deliver a bleaker future. It's time to press stop and give people the #FinalSay. Press it today:  
It is tragic that the name of Chequers, an iconic British building & institution, has been conflated with Theresa May’s appalling dog’s breakfast of a Brexit plan. 
Brexit is like a numpty haeing a midlife crisis who goes on a mad downward spiral an ends up putting buckfast and ket on his sugar puffs. 
We've spent a couple years talking about Brexit cutting across the party system. Interesting to see party identity actually start to overlap more accurately over it. 
People who think they're 'right-wing' being persuaded to vote against their own interests didn't begin with Brexit and Trump.  
It took Brexit to give me a voice. In 2016 I was complacent and guilty of blind political loyalty, I knew nothing about the EU. Two years on, I have a voice, albeit a sweary one. I will vote for whoever serves the interests of my country best, you will need to earn it. 
"Enough is  enough, we need legal certainty now" Our full joint letter with @BritishInEurope to the EU & UK Govt demanding separation of #citizensrights agreement from the rest of EU Withdrawal Agreement to protect rights in case of no deal Brexit now  
You and your fellow MP's chose to offer us a simple In/Out vote to a hugely complicated issue, and now you insult people's intelligence because they didn't make the 'sensible' choice you favour.  If you think #Brexit is a mess, it's a mess of your making.  
I wish people would stop referring to  the #PeoplesVote as a second Referendum - the first one was rubbish enough! It sounds too much like not respecting the 2016 result & therefore ignoring democracy. We need to push “a PV on the final deal” with an option to #RemainAndReform. 
Extraordinary new Brexit poll: 1.6m Leavers switch to Remain since referendum, most of them Labour supporters. But around 800K Tories switch Remain to Leave  
#Brexit:we don’t have to do it! ⁦@BestForBritain⁩ for a #FinalSay with option to stay 
It’s 2123. The 104th year of the Brexit transition. Polls show that only 17 people now think we should leave the EU. The cryogenically frozen head of Theresa May clings on as Prime Minister (now called Prime Stockpiler) and still insists a #PeoplesVote would be “undemocratic”. 
“Our ability to continue to conduct our international operations out of the UK, where the headquarters for our international operations is located, may be materially and adversely affected [by Brexit].”  
Theresa May: "I am absolutely clear that I cannot countenance Parliament being able to overturn the will of the British people"But the will of the people is to Remain in EU @theresa_maySo drop *the will of the people* malarkey & invent another reason for Brexit. Or revoke A50. 
With @The3Million, we have sent an open letter to both negotiating teams to call on them to end the extreme legal uncertainty for citizens on either side of the Brexit divide in case of a no-deal scenario. Read on our website...  (corrected link) 
Theresa May suffers fresh Brexit blow as the EU’s chief negotiator rubbishes her trade plan  
Brexit: What happens in the next few weeks will determine all our futures for generations to come. It’s bigger than party politics, too big for politicians alone. The British people deserve a say #PeoplesVote @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn 
Dear Brexiters, this man has no plan except to personally make a lot of money at your expense from #Brexit. The sooner you understand that, the better. #JRM #PeoplesVote #Tories #UpperClassTwat #StopBrexit 
So, not only are the policies for Brexit in chaos, the department tasked to deliver them is in similar shape. Hundreds of Whitehall officials leave department in charge of Brexit  
This extent of economic damage would have been intolerable to previous generations of politician at any time, except perhaps at times of war. It is cruel folly to pursue a policy that has failed before it has even begun. Stop Brexit now! via @markets 
I wish these Leaver snowflakes would make their minds up what sort of brexit they want, their dithering is killing us.Remain means remain. 
Ye ken, wi’ Brexit, it’s pretty simple folks. The current deal is better than a braw deal, glaikit deal or nae deal. 
After Brexit, Matt Le Tissier will be known as Matt The Tissier 
Brexit trade barriers threaten to increase the cost of importing gas and electricity across the Channel  
Ten years ago I was convinced by JS Mill: through open debate, facts, & logic we defeat idiotic alternatives.But as we’ve seen with Brexit (& strong support for no deal), reasoned argument is not always enough.Our belief in the power of evidence does not seem evidenced based. 
The Tories will lose next election if they continue to back Chequers, latest polling reveals.Chequers doesn’t mean Brexit, Chequers means Corbyn! 
#HappeningNow: H.E. Mr. Thomas Drew @TomDrewUK , British High Commissioner to Pakistan delivered a lecture on "Post-Brexit Foreign Policy: Future of Pak-UK Relations."

Wonderful that Parliament will be debating women's rights and Brexit today.  to the amazing @RupaHuq for putting this issue on the agenda 
Someone tell this failed lawyer and ex-administrator (he’s never run a business) that “remoaners” are not negotiating brexit.  
2.6 million Leave voters have abandoned support for Brexit since referendum, major new study finds - The Independent  
New survey from Mumsnet @MumsnetTowers:- Seven out of ten users want a vote on the Brexit deal.-  60% say they felt misled by campaigns in first referendum. - 22% of those who say they voted Leave in 2016 now want to Remain. 
So Brexit a Summary.1. According to the govt's own studies every brexit will harm UK.2. The govt has taken over 2 yrs to come up with a brexit plan & it is unworkable.3. Those who advocated brexit still have no plan.4.  Brexit is not the will of the people!So why continue?  
READ: New survey reveals over 7 in 10 Mumsnet users back a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal.Mumsnet users know that the Brexit that was promised isn't being delivered. That's why they're calling for a #PeoplesVote. Please RT: 
Summary1. These are grim times for Our Activists, e.g. Brexit, Trump, reality, etc.2. So here are 3 things to do: a. Go on lots of protest marches. b. Read Our Guardian. c. Call anyone who disagrees with you "Far-Right".3. What could possibly go wrong?4. That's all, folks!  
More intriguing than a John le Carré thriller, the shadowy story behind Brexit is a tailor-made blockbuster involving far-right cabals, spies, spivs and a host of unscrupulous politicians supported by an unwitting cast of millions of UK citizens. 
Off to Westminster tomorrow to make a speech about our destructive politics, Brexit & why English devolution is our best hope. Wish me luck! 
Brexit is a fantasy perpetrated by fantasists.  
Andrew. Mate.It takes dozens of developers YEARS to design, write, test and bug-fix a really big IT system. And on my team, half the staff are immigrants, cos Britain doesn't train enough.Only someone with absolutely no clue would claim it's easy.Brexit in a nutshell.  
3.6m EU citizens have been in limbo over their citizens' rights since the referendum - a referendum they had no say in. Should there be a #PeoplesVote it would be unforgivable to exclude EU citizens again from the #FinalSay 
Our latest article is out. Want to know what Iceland, Norway & Faroes can (& can't) teach UK about Brexit & fisheries policy? This is for you!Brexit and the future of UK fisheries governance: learning lessons from Iceland, Norway and the Faroe Islands  
Some detail here for Brexit timetable nerds and how tight the deadline will be for the EU Parliament to approve any Withdrawal Agreement.Without that EUParl endorsement, there will be no WA and Britain crashes out of the EU at the end of March.  
After #Brexit we'll have WTO tariffs on EU tradeWith WTO tariffs UK will be £8bn a yr BETTER offWith good Gov there's plenty of money to give more for elderly care,NHS & schools,as well as cutting taxes for low & middle earnersWe just need a Government with the will to do it. 
On a day when a new poll reveals that 1.6m people who voted for Brexit have changed their mind, BBC news doesn’t mention it. Instead it gives air time to Leadsom repeating their lies about Brexit ‘savings’ being used to fund the NHS. 
BBC has started a full-on campaign to attack other Brexit deals now the Chequers Deal is exploding.BBC should just register as a political party.  
This is how fears of a no-deal Brexit are already hurting the U.K.  
Nothing much will move on Brexit until the party conferences at the end of the month so spare a sliver of your attention to developments in Idlib and Tripoli that are of potentially crucial importance to European security

Sorry, Digby, much as I would love a trip to Brussels, I have not been a invited to negotiate for the UK in Brexit.I believe that was @DavidDavisMP and he did a runner because Brexit is an unworkable fantasy driven by rich tax avoiders, disaster capitalists, and Gofer Farage.  
Ah, Brexit... the glorious self-imposed WWII re-enactment.  
"Brexit’s the driver, we wouldn’t have changed otherwise, we’re not growing our supply chain in the UK, we’re curtailing it until we see clarity, we've already switched a 1.2 million-euro contract to a German manufacturer" 
It's September, so it must be time for a govt proposal to delay EU withdrawal and/or a govt proposal to stay in the Customs Union and/or a general election. Or, better still, we could just be given the opportunity to scrap the whole shebang, by a *legal* referendum (this time). 
As the truth has emerged about #brexit the country has turned against it & against the #Leave campaign that used #brexit to achieve its own agenda of a Far Right takeover. The ref was a coup. The country can see that now and we must have a peoplesvote for democracy #FBPE 
Good God almighty! No Digby, your grail, your quest, yours to seek, yours to grasp. It is nigh impossible because HMG and brexiters are incompetent and cannot even agree what their grail looks like. Brexit will fail and it is your fault alone.  
Labour voters in the heartlands are waking up to what Tory Brexit means for them. It's time for the Party leadership to stand with its voters and members and back a #FinalSay 
Why the UK will not become an EEA member after Brexit  
Tories reap the Brexit dividend: “Scotland: Tories fall behind SNP as members desert party. The Scottish National Party is now the second biggest political party in Britain after overtaking the Conservatives for the first time” @thetimes 
This by ⁦@NickCohen4⁩ rings true, as it’s what I have been told again and again“Questions about Brexit or anti-Semitism are no longer questions of right or wrong. If you disagree with Corbyn on Brexit or anti-Semitism, you are against the party.”  
BREXIT: we don’t have to do it if we don’t want to.Writing in today’s @timesredbox 
I can understand why some people voted Leave in 2016, with its sunny uplands and £350M for the NHS  But I really can’t understand Remainers who support Brexit now because it’s ‘the will of the people’ when we are getting an absolute train wreck which was never advertised  
#GTTO = Get The Tories Out (Took me a moment to twig it too - was thinking of cakes ) Unless we #GTTO  PDQ we will have a cliff-edge Brexit - Tax Haven Britain for the rich, Sweat Shop Britain for the rest.  Their hairbrained scheme has to be halted at all costs.  
BREAKING: There *is* a way to stop Brexit if we want to! Please RT! @BestForBritain #finalsay 
It is a monumental failure of political leadership that the country is as divided as ever over Brexit - my column for @thetimes 
Voters chose to leave - they got it right the first time. The Brexit deal is something that politicians must equally get right the first time.  
“Chequers will not deliver Brexit, Chequers will deliver Corbyn...She should say enough is enough and put her faith in WTO rules until such time as a Canada-style trade deal for the whole UK can be agreed.”

WATCH: "BRITISH ARMY GENERAL, wearing EU insignia, salutes EU flag and salutes EU anthem".  Shocking full #Brexit story here:  
For some time now hardcore, fact-free Brexit supporters like Rees Mogg have been promoting whatever nonsense allows them to continue denying basic reality. Against this backdrop, the clock is now really ticking on Johnson’s leadership ambitions. 
If you'd told me a few years ago that the arcane minutiae of Labour's NEC's adoption of a document would take precedence over Brexit on #bbcnews and in the #r4today running order I'd have said you were mad. 
New survey shows that 71% of Mumsnet users want a vote on whether to go ahead with Brexit  @peoplesvote_uk 
As the promises of Leave campaign turn out to be lies, it's not surprising that moderate Brexit voters are changing their minds. No one voted to be poorer...or to throw away millions of jobs. Common sense people must take back control #PeoplesVote 
It needs to be said again and again: "no deal" is not any kind of viable option. The government is not capable of managing an orderly #Brexit. We need to #StopBrexit with a #PeoplesVote 
Forget Brexit. Forget everything.  Here’s the candidate who won the most votes on yesterday’s #LabourNEC, celebrating Iran’s Islamic Revolution. All that matters in British politics is that regular Labour voters and the young understand that #Labour has been overrun by monsters. 
What are you doing about Brexit, apart from still hiding?  
A bit rich coming from a man who believes in Brexit so much that he moved his business investment funds to Ireland.  
More than half of Britain’s youth say that their confidence in politicians has got worse over the past year – with Brexit a key contributing factor.  
#FinalSayForAll I get up every day, I worry about what Brexit will mean for me and my friends. I make a coffe thinking will I be able to visit the UK? I go into the garden wondering if my healthcare will be paid for. I prepare lunch not knowing how much less my pension will be. 
According to Justine Greening, May's Brexit plan is "more hated than the Poll-Tax". Brexit is driving people insane. Literally insane. 
Brexit has already cost the UK a chunk of its economic output, according to the latest analysis by economists at UBS. UK GDP is already 2.1% lower in level terms than where it would have been without Brexit. 
UK national debt is now £1,800,000,000,000. Can anyone spot on the chart below when it suddenly started lurching higher. It corresponds exactly to the Tories coming to power. All that austerity and the debt is still growing. Can the UK afford the #Brexit hit to the economy?  
Thank the Lord! At last, a way of stopping Brexit. #FinalSay #PeoplesVote 
2.6 million people who voted to leave the Eu now back remain.To say having the chance to have a #FinalSay on the actual negotiated #Brexit is undemocratic is pure nonsense.To deny them that chance on the other hand... 
Has anyone seen @BorisJohnson @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @Nigel_Farage  or any other Brexiteer put forward a detailed plan for Brexit that doesn't cost jobs or take income from UK households?Anything other than false promises and sound bytes? 
Chequers plan is a non-starter. We are heading for a No Deal Brexit. People need to get their heads around what this means. It will mean a total loss of control with economic and logistical chaos. It is all so unnecessary. A monumental act of self harm. 
The Economist: “... any version of Brexit will depress Britain’s growth rate. If Britain leaves without any deal, the consequences could be catastrophic.” @peoplesvote_uk @Conservatives @UKLabour @LibDems @Greens @The_TUC 
Last month Rees-Mogg called for Ireland to leave the EU too & return of border searches ‘like during the Troubles’ - neo-colonialism & return to 1980s his ‘solution’ to Irish border. Come to think of it, that is his Brexit policy, period  
The shift is what we are hear in our street stalls being run by @Devon4Europe , over and over again people are saying that #Brexit does not match what they voted for. Either it's too strong or too weak. They now just want it dropped and to get on with running the country properly  
Ahead of my appearance on @JeremyVineOn5 with Alistair Campbell, some light reading. "How New Labour made Britain into a migration state" - and paved the way to Brexit

Sorry, Digby. The EU offered us 6 Brexit options. But Leavers bawled NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO !!! Don't blame other people for your incompetence. Your lot own this catastrophe tooth and nail!#StopBrexit 
e.g. on the questions of the role of class in bringing about Brexit, Shilliam reminds us that the working class is not monolithically white. So it's not a question of left wing elites talking down to the WWC. The WC is Black and Brown but culturally it is understood as white.  
The show merely rehashes what are dominant talking points made ad nausea since Trump's election and Brexit and amply refuted by myriad reliable sources. 
And as the now released video shows, the formulation this takes is even worse than the way it was put to me. For example, Brexit is blamed on people on the internet calling Leave voters 'racist'; racism here is reduced to name calling. 
There must be something other than stupidity behind the increasingly bizarre behaviour of the Tories in the face of mounting evidence of the economic harm caused to the UK by Brexit. Where is our own investigation? 
So what happened to that whole “Brexit” thing? Did England break apart like Pangea or something? 
As Westminster returns today halting the madness of #Brexit & realising #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope is top of my agenda. Here is a timely reminder from Ireland of what it looks to be an independent member of the #EU as opposed to the underdog in the U.K.

spanish president Sanchez will only allow an idiotic referendum to give us back the autonomy his party stole from us in 2010. Is this a sick joke or does he really believe he can trick us twice? We want independence, no subjugation

Suddenly on @BBCNewsnight, there's an admission that NO Brexit solution put forward so far "ticks the boxes". Are we on the brink of a U turn?Time to pile on the pressure.#StopBrexitSaveBritain 
The EU are desperate for a brexit deal because they rely on the UK so much; trade, money, defence, banking, security, international influence et al. May has failed, we should now offer a proper free trade deal or go WTO..  
Contacts within the 3 Para contingent have made clear to family and friends that their request to remove the EU Commission insignia from their British Army uniform was refused. On arrival, a host EUFOR officer treated them to a lecture about his views on Brexit. 
More trouble for Theresa: Govt sources tell Nick Timothy that Philip Hammond is “itching” to make a “generous offer” for EU immigration to continue after Brexit. And the vague Chequers blueprint would allow it;   
"#U2 is kicking off its tour in Berlin this week, and we’ve just had one of our more provocative ideas: during the show we’re going to wave a big, bright, blue EU flag.” #Bono Suffers ‘Complete Loss of Voice’ - THERE IS A GOD! #BonoVoiceBerlin2 #Brexit 
With new data showing 1.6 million Leave voters now back Remain, it’s clear that backing a vote on the Brexit Deal would be electorally advantageous for @UKLabour - as well as being the right thing to do for our country.  Come on Corbyn! 
Not just the Treasury then - Analysis by UBS Group AG shows UK gross domestic product is already 2.1% lower than where it would have been had the UK voted to remain in the EU, while investment is 4% weaker, inflation 1.5% higher and consumption 1.7% lower. 
Ah, the classic stab in the back myth being promulgated by arch Brexpest Jones. Expect more of this people.  You and your fellow leavers own the shitstorm that is Brexit. Nobody else. You own it 100%. 
Better to die as a free man than a slave. Future generations will thank those who voted for Brexit. 
Goodness, you’re obsessed. Why not focus on the day job and use the much vaunted but not yet seen, ‘influence’ on your own party to end the madness of #brexit? That’s a much much greater risk to our futures - and @RuthDavidsonMSP knows it. 
BREAKING on @BrexitCentral: New polling suggests that the Tories would be swept out of power if they stick to the Chequers Brexit plan  
Baffling that we’re holding ourselves to a decision made by an electorate that googled “what is the EU” the day after they voted to leave it rather than listen to an electorate that’s had two years of non-stop fucking Brexit information.  
Here’s Jeremy Corbyn not talking about Brexit again. Not being clear on the deal Labour wants. You know the way he didn’t say anything during the EU ref when he spoke on almost everyday of the campaign. The way we haven’t got any more money, the way the war backers are moderates.  
Like a patient with indigestion who insists on heart surgery, gov determined to continue with devastating treatment for a disease we don’t have- but despite summer’s theatrics, nothing has changed. Brexit will be soft or it won’t happen at all.My latest:  
First, it’s not “Sturgeon” it’s the duly elected First Minister of Scotland, and second, she was elected on a mandate for a second independence referendum in precisely the circumstances we find ourselves in. So why don’t you lot just accept who we voted for and why?

The former DUP Chief of Staff very revealingly describes Brexit as the "greatest opportunity for unionism since partition".Partition an opportunity? Shows how the DUP's actions only make sense if you view them as being about putting distance between the Other community in Ireland 
Ruth Davidson seriously wants us to cut off our only avenue of escape from #Brexit because she's that much of a "patriot" that she's slavishly following her party's disastrous and imperialistic policy instead of what Scots *actually* voted for. 
May’s attack on Boris shows just how scared of him she is. May knows a brexiteer in power would have more support from voters & Tory members but more importantly can do a better job. May is terrified she will be ousted & a real Brexit delivered.. @BorisJohnson @Jacob_Rees_Mogg 
Happening already. Had a chat with one of the Sweden Democrats' MEPs last week about the upcoming election there. One of the things he said was that they're focussing less on Swexit because the way Brexit is going has made it so hard to put forward in debate as a credible option.  
#Brexit I’ll say it again, first question at PMQ’s should be “How can this house be certain that leaving the EU remains the ‘will’ of the people?” 
Eurosceptics agree more with Michel Barnier on Brexit than Theresa May, says Jacob Rees-Mogg  #MoggMentum 
Former Irish PM is calling for the UK to hold a second referendumWith respect sir, we have had enough foreign politicians poking their noses into our affairs and every single intervention by them has backfiredWe are not Ireland#StandUp4Brexit 
Powerful and moving. Rees Mogg and any other Brexit wanker who blithely dismisses the issues surrounding Northern Ireland because they get in the way of their Brexit dream should be watching in shame. #MothersDay 
Michel Barnier says he strongly opposes May's Brexit trade proposals Barnier has told EU countries not to buy U.K. car parts.The Appeaser should be saying to people in the U.K.Don’t buy your next Car front an EU country.She won’t though,she’s to weak. 
New figures show women want to stay in the EU – no surprise given our patriarchal society means they’ll be the hardest hit by Brexit 
Dear @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, as the benefits of #Brexit may take 50 years to realise & I'll be long dead, I wondered if I could have a down payment now to tide me over? A couple of million should do it. Thank you in anticipation. My family will pay you back from any #Brexit dividend. 
I think the public are growing ever tiresome of Ruth Davidson's one trick pony bleating "End the Indy uncertainty" whilst dragging Scotland in a No Deal Brexit catastropheThe only certainty we have now is IndyIt's the only sensible option left 
As ever, a punchy & insightful blog. Amongst many sharp insights: "Brexit is not a classic negotiation. It is a damage limitation exercise". Just in trade terms, that's unusual as it's the 1st trade negotiation in history seeking *worse* terms than both parties currently have.  
“End the uncertainty” is what every business I meet says about #Brexit.  Let’s see some honesty from you - 2 years ago you were desperate to mitigate damage of #Brexit by ensuring a #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion solution.  You know without that the future is very bleak indeed… 
John Key spends millions of 'taxpayer money' on a flag referendum. Murray McCully gives millions of 'taxpayer money' away to a SA sheep farmer. Did you do a poll on whether we wanted our money spent on those things @TheAMShowNZ . I very much hope so. 
If only Brexit were my “fault”- I’d be proud. In fact it was delivered by 17.4 million ordinary people who are tired of being lectured by European kleptocrats, metropolitan quinoa-liberals, naive student Remainer-Corbynites and Blairite stooges who think mushy peas are guacamole.  
The only "serious" thing the PM has been doing for over 2 years post referendum has been to undermine that Brexit vote. The only "serious" conclusion for Tory Brexiteers MPs is to enforce a leadership contest to replace her with someone who is "serious" about delivering Brexit. 
2.6 million Leave voters have abandoned support for Brexit since referendum, major new study finds  
Very little comment in @Telegraph about how #Brexit negotiations are affecting our defence relationship with EU countries. We need more scrutiny on this. @JamesERothwell 
Thread: "#Brexit & #Chequers, the sellout. Dump it, let's move on"....I keep hearing "Where is the plan?" and a load of misinformation on #Brexit, pushed on UK media by irrelevant & biased commentators, elevated simply because they are avid Remoaners.They aim to distract.1/19

What do you think is @UKLabour's stance on #Brexit?Please RT after you vote for a larger sample. 
I am sick of being told to fuck off from a party I've busted my balls for for 30yrs. I'm done with it. Resigned & now disinterested. My only involvement will be a decision on the day as to who I vote for in any election. I'll focus on Brexit, no party loyalty, fuck the cults. 
This is laughably bad.And to think that this is supposed to be a pragmatic way forward Oh and remind me, who set the #Brexit timetable? The Tories when they triggered Article 50.  
When Dominic Raab became Brexit Secretary, I thought we might have a chance. After all, he was injecting “energy, vigour and vim”, he is my MP, and we've met before. So I wrote to him, asking for an urgent meeting specifically about our concerns in the event of no deal. 14/ 
Jeremy Vine thinks Brexit might win by an increased margin in a second Referendum, I'm not sure, but I think he is right about the terrible anger in the country. That energy will lead to something...  
David Milliband says HMG is handling Brexit negotiations badly. Surely it’s the Remoaners who are handling these negotiations badly! It is nigh impossible for anyone to negotiate well against someone who just keeps saying non! & who then sits back & watches the Remain camp & the 
A quick personal thread about my experience, as an ordinary EU citizen in the UK, of trying to be heard by those in charge of Brexit negotiations, on both sides of the channel.  There has been a shocking difference between the two sides. 1/

Britain hasn't even left the EU, but Brexit already appears to have affected economic output  
Labour Conference devoting an entire day to Democracy Review shake-up of party rules - but just 2.5 hours to Brexit AND the Economy.  
I’ve got some very bad news for unionists. If Yes is over the line already in relation to a hard Brexit, it’s not going to fall back. 
EU citizens! The UK will literally be destroyed. The army will have to deal with violence and disorder. Despite them saying they have had no requests for assistance or any plans put in place. Millions will surely perish in the disaster that is #Brexit.  
Unbelievable! Brexit fan @AndrewMarr9 was leading @LiamFox on the #Marr show asking him >"So when the chancellor says that we'd lose 7.7% of GDP as the result of a no deal/WTO end game, do you think that's nonsense, do you think that's projest fear? 
Keep an eye open for this #Brexit debate we are going to try and cover!  
In adopting #Chequers, Britain has gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank - Boris Johnson. Thank you Mrs. May. Now please will you step aside as you don't intend to deliver #Brexit?  
Tory MPs Are Heading Back To Westminster And They Have Declared Theresa May's Brexit Plan Dead On Arrival - BuzzFeed UK  
The reason that we will never stop fighting against Brexit is exactly the same reason as to why I would never help anyone I know give away their life savings based upon an email from a Nigerian prince.It is a scam perpetrated by a bunch of corrupt conmen (and women)! 
Ye wee shyster. This is your only plan for Brexit.  
Dear @AndrewMarr9Before Brexit, we chatted outside a tube station. You were personable & I used to enjoy your show. No longer. You've become a Brexit propagandist, ergo economical with the truth, no better than a Nazi apologist in 1933. Who knows what will come of it & Putin?  
Based upon the lastest indyref poll and In my opinion, NS is 100% right not to put a date on #indyref2. Committing to one simply energizes the NO camp and puts them in campaign mode, why would you do that when you can simply sit back and let brexit do the heavy lifting for you.  
Not content with being a festering sore for leftism disguised as news, the BBC is also pushing the trans agenda, the anti male agenda and of course the anti Brexit narrative. 
My new tune. Bollocks to Brexit. The mess at the end is supposed to represent the Government's attempt at Brexit. Enjoy @squeezyjohn @StopBrexitMarch #Brexit  
‘Gross Betrayal of Democracy’ – Theresa May Rejects Second Brexit Referendum

Any politician who uses such warlike rhetoric with regard to our democratic friends and allies can quite reasonably be regarded as a traitor colluding with Trump and Putin in their war against democracy. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit  
Tony Blair - Theresa May just can't bring herself to say #brexit is a good idea & she's been asked often enough. It's truly remarkable to see the British government take the country down a path that collectively they think is a bad idea.. it's a very odd thing. #peoplesvote 
Just caught up with the 1st show in the new series of #Marr where the Brexit fan pretends to ask objective questions about the national catastrophe. He asked about a "2nd EU ref" as he insists on calling it but did he mention Vote Leave's criminal cheating? Of course he didn't!  
It's taken me a while but now I realise that the Tories were never trying to get a deal for the UK. Their objective was always to crash out of the EU. Why else would they put morons in charge. #PeoplesVote #brexit #FBPE 
The Chequers plan is an abomination. The UK would pay a £39bn brexit bill we don’t owe, EU courts continue to rule over the UK, we’re subject to EU laws/regulations, the EU gets the final say in everything & the plan effectively imposes a single market & customs union on us. NO..  
There are still some in Labour leadership who think that a second referendum will harm or hinder them. How tragic that they can’t see it will energise the party after a disastrous summer and see a flood of disgruntled Remainers enthusiastically rejoin the Labour fold  
Brexit is estimated to have wiped 2% off the UK's GDP even before the exit date: —investment: down 4%—inflation: up 1.5%—consumption: down 1.7%—currency: depreciated 12%—GDP: down 2.1% over pre-Brexit projections(Modeled by economists at UBS.) 
Get us a Brexit that:Lets the UK set standards across EuropeLets all Brits find work/homes/love across EuropeMakes the UK an attractive manufacturing base for goods destined for mainland Europe.Lets us negotiate trade with the leverage of a $17trillion market. 
Jobs, prosperity and peace in N Ireland will be just fine outside the EU, deal or no deal. The EU will soon come running under a WTO option.  As for another Referendum, you seem to have forgotten the terms of the deal.  
If another country committed an act upon us which caused societal and economic harm, and threatened our stability, it would be called an act of war. When our own government does it, it's called #Brexit#PeoplesVote #FinalSayForAll #StopBrexit 
"Victory for Brussels"?No. Everyone loses in the Brexit negative sum game.Apart from Putin.  
Southampton Itchen voted 60/40 to leave in the EU referendum. I have received thousands of emails and messages and had thousands of conversations and the only movement I have seen has been from remain to leave.This poll is nonsense.

From “Game of Thrones” to Brexit: a journey around Ireland’s Lough Foyle  From @1843mag 
Given what Boris, JRM and other ERG-ers have said about the Irish border so far, presumably they would not accept a backstop and try to railroad Ireland, hoping the other EU26 pressure Dublin into a deal? If so, that would be very unwise...unless they really want a no deal Brexit

Praying for a brexit that will make the UK a world leader and will tie in Scotland forever.  
Most people voted Leave out of a desire for greater sovereignty and democracy, captured in the demand to ‘take back control’. The only option available right now that comes close to fulfilling that desire is a No Deal Brexit, writes Mick Hume.

Don’t always agree with Magnus Linklater , but he makes some good points in @thetimes today. @theSNP has made Scotland a welcoming place for English relocators and should attract more post-Brexit.

If Brexit is an abstract political hobby-horse, this is fine. For normal people trying to live their lives, it isn't. Politicians pushing for Brexit won't pay the price. #PeoplesVote #OFOC 
May attacks Boris for having no new ideas on Brexit. He does not require any, he has the people's idea on Brexit expressed in the 2016 referendum and it was LEAVE and that's what we must do LEAVE....

It's time we took remoaners at their word. They claim Brexit will lead to hundreds of thousands of job losses. In which case, no EU citizens should be given new jobs. If they lose the one they have, they can't get another one and must return home.

David Davis backs Boris Johnson after scathing attack on Theresa May's Brexit plan  
Little surprise that a Jeremy Corbyn hashtag proved more important than a commitment to tackle antisemitism, or giving members the say they want on Brexit, or *not* electing an openly racist person to the Party's ruling body. A very bleak day for @UKLabour 
When I was 14 I met a boy and being 14, pretended I was American. He asked me out and I said yes. I then had to pretend to be American every time I saw him. Rather than admit my stupidity, I eventually just hid from him till he went away. That was MY Brexit. What's yours?  
Actually, Barnier has 6 plans for Brexit. But our own red lines stop us from accepting all but the last.  
Wow not surprised but we are in a period where lots of certainties are breaking down and new things will replace them.The Brexiters may win their Brexit but lose the UK as it stands.  
No-one is even pretending that #brexit will be good for the country anymore. My question is, how long before we need to go to the IMF again?#FBPE 
Anne here abstained in 2016 as (despite being inclined to vote brexit) her sons made clear to her the value of being European. She wanted to put the issue in young person's hands. But two years on she would be a #remainernow in light of what she has learnt.@theannediamond 
Nicky Morgan claims her ‘treason’ consists of merely voting for parliamentary scrutiny of Brexit. Please. What about trips to Barnier in Brussels and meetings in the EU’s London HQ with Soros and friends? That is active collaboration with the enemy. 
Aside from offering to bail me out for my ticket - @jeremycorbyn talked trains, Frank Field, Brexit and gave a resolute condemnation of the antisemitic abuse suffered by Luciana Berger and others  
*All* of these things will be made even worse by #Brexit. If Corbyn wants to tackle them, and to bring down this Tory government, he needs to stop them railroading us into this catastrophe, which has been a hard/far-right project from the outset.

NS should continuing doing what she has always done and put the interests of Scotland first. That country that doesn't want Brexit at all according to the latest data would rather have Indy.Rather than allowing some posh oiks from London drag us out for their selfish reasons  
Brexit negotiations in summary: “trade with the EU on WTO terms or negotiate a free-trade deal that only applies to Great Britain but not Northern Ireland. These are the EU’s terms.”  I think no overarching deal is now most like outcome.

Scotland was always going to choose independence, not because of Brexit, but because any constitutional arrangement which succeeds in terms of the imperatives and objectives of the British state necessarily fails in terms of the priorities and aspirations of Scotland’s people.

We must not accept #Brexit as inevitable. For Our Future’s Sake #FFS are a youth-led anti-Brexit campaign, making young people’s voices heard on our EU relationship; their wishes and their futures have been ignored. We must get what we need: a #FinalSay. 
11. So the entire Brexit debate centres on a plan that won't be accepted in favour of a plan that doesn't exist with the ambition of doing something that business doesn't want and nobody will commit to. 
1. Watching the #Brexit debate unfold on my timeline is increasingly surreal. Tory drones are mounting an anti-chequers campaign despite all the signals from Barnier that the EU is not even willing to entertain it. And it gets even weirder... 
I read and hear people wanting @theSNP to call #IndyRef2 before Brexit. I get the frustration and I’m no expert, however, calling now would be premature. I’m convinced there will be dark days after Brexit, that will be the time, “give them enough rope” comes to mind. Patience  
And if you are a Conservative who believes the visions of Brexit presented now are exactly what you had hoped for, then please sit down, have a cup of tea and a word with yourself.  
Scottish Sovereignty and Brexit - during July's Claim of Right debate in the House of Commons, @theSNP MP @IanBlackfordMP highlighted how the Scottish Parliament is being ignored, with the Tories riding roughshod over devolution. 
Amazing this MSP thinks the Scottish government should fall in line with something his party created. We voted remain in every constituency. We have a clear consensus on Brexit we don’t want it. What is this deal you speak of? Independence? 
I was just stopped by a Brexiter who told me that the Remain camp is so poorly connected and organised, we’ll never get a People’s Vote.CHALLENGE ACCEPTED- like & RT this tweet. Let’s show captain Brexit that we’re very well connected and determined to win this. #PeoplesVote 
Both @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and @hilarybennmp emerged from their select committee's meeting with @MichelBarnier saying the same thing: he and they agree that major elements of the UK's #Brexit White Paper won't work. 
In coming months several EU member state will defy Brussels, ECB, ECJ on immigration,budgets, debt relief, Euro, etc. Expect power&authorit of EU Commission&ECJ to come into question. Deep divisions will appear. Germany will be divided. Inopportune moment to settle Brexit  
Well, it’s a good thing those media organisations influencing the Brussels bubble represent BOTH sides of the Brexit debate: Remain *and* Remoan.  
This is probably the most nonsensical political line I’ve ever heard - ‘the SNP must vote for a Tory hard Brexit... otherwise they’ll be supporting a Tory hard Brexit!’ From a Tory!Thanks for reminding voters how much of a mess your party are in Jackson.

Why should the anti-Brexit SNP pick a side in the Tory's civil war over which of two Brexits is least like Armageddon? They have a better solution for Scotland, which hasn't voted Tory since the 1950s, and voted 62% remain. 
The same horrible people that hijacked the referendum in 2016. Horribly unfair is democracy isnt it Daisy

All the Pro-Brexit figures have been screaming that Brexit isn't doing what they want (#BrexitBetrayal) for literally years, at this point.So even they know a Bad Brexit is not just possible, but likely. 
Home to five species of penguin, the Falkland Islands could be set to lose out on crucial conservation funding from the European Union after Brexit  
And do you agree with @DavidDavisMP that staying in would be better than Chequers too? Maybe that should be the choice for @peoplesvote_uk No deal v no Brexit? Wdyt Jake?  
European Parliament has just had an update on #Brexit from @danutahuebner who chairs the @EPInstitutional committee and is on the Brexit Steering Group (1) 
BORIS MAKES HIS MOVE: Chequers Plan a ‘Fix’, May Has ‘Not Even Tried’ to Deliver Brexit  
To me it must be hard for a sensible mainstream moderate bright thinking civil servant (as most are in my experience) to want to be part of such a selfish & destructive process as hard Brexit. Not surprised many have left DEXEU with their uninspiring hardline Brexiteer Ministers.  
Look at this for sheer propaganda and misinformation! My MP #mikepenning sent this to every constituents. Superstate?? The people deserve facts, not politicians fantasy and fiction. And if the economy is thriving why the hell are we leaving. #fuming #brexit #peoplesvote 
Never forget. THE TORIES DID THIS TO US. Asked people to vote on #Brexit. Without defining what Brexit meant. Without carrying out any projections of consequences. All in an (unsuccessful) attempt to settle an internal Tory party feud.  
Just been told that from April 2019 VAT can no longer be paid directly to HMRC through HMG site. Instead you have to use one of their 'chosen' software providers, for which you pay: Privatisation of tax services - taxpayer pays to pay tax. Brexit dividend? 
“There is a clear and present danger to the future of the United Kingdom" as a result of Brexit.  
Not that old chestnut again. The videos are out there, showing both sides knew what Brexit entailed. Out means out, not a half-way house. Plus, the campaign is not in charge of implementation, a Remainer government is, so enough with the Where is it? 
Small point. Brexit hasn't happened yet. How do you know it's been a disaster?  
I also have a Brexit plan that won’t work. Subscribe to my Twitter premium feed and you can read it. 
The Prime Minister’s ridiculed Chequers deal has been given its verdict. It is a ‘No’ in the UK, and 'nul-points' from Macron. PM and her Govt are now fast running out of options, leaving the UK facing the harsh consequences of their Brexit mess. 
I’m honouring the result by giving this Brexit government THREE YEARS to come up with a realistic implementation plan.If - after three years - they fail to secure a beneficial deal, I believe the people should decide what happens next. 
WATCH: Wendy, Eleanor, Gary, Phil and Anna all live and work across the East of England. At our #PeoplesVoteEast rally at the weekend, they told us why they're backing a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. Please RT:

Hey! People who voted leave to save the NHS ... how about asking the NHS how it feels about #brexit   And when you have reconsidered your position please tell your MP.

READ: The French President, Emmanuel Macron, has rejected Theresa May's 'blind Brexit' proposal, stressing that clarity on a trade deal before Brexit is needed to avoid extending transition. Nobody voted for a blind Brexit in 2016. Please RT:  
I can’t stop thinking about Adonis publicly taking Sacks to task, for a similarly extreme historical comparison to the kind he himself makes, driven by mistaken belief Labour is going to stop Brexit. 
TWO MONTHS, PEOPLE!We voted for a sensible Brexit that would help, not harm the lives of British people 27 months ago! And we now have TWO MONTHS LEFT to finish the negotiations, and the government still has no workable plan!!"Boris Johnson"

And is the kind of utter failure of a senior Minister who couldn't stop his colleagues successfully conspiring against his brilliant but unstated Brexit Ireland plan really someone who is fit to even tell us about leadership, still less to exercise it ever again? 
Boris Johnson Brexit article offers 'no new ideas', Downing Street says  
The Chequers plan is a non-starter in Europe. We are heading for a No Deal Brexit that no one voted for, and need a People's Vote to break the deadlock.

I wrote this about Boris Johnson's latest attempts at a Hard Brexit fuelled coup  
Tragic but predictable and not sure what Brexiteers will make of this. English nationalists won't care but many more rational and moderate Leavers will have regrets if the UK Union is endangered by Brexit as I've always predicted.  
Falklands funding for penguin conservation and climate change research 'at risk' due to Brexit

"For some, the answer to this 'better life' was to leave Poland, for some to leave Jaywick – and for others, it was to leave the EU." writes @alexandrabulat after listening to views on Brexit and migration in the Leave heartland of Jaywick, Essex.  
We are already aware that any kind of #Brexit could be brutal for business. The No Deal papers further revealed the web of red tape just waiting to strangle small and medium-sized business, which could put them at risk and put them off trading altogether.

If this isn’t the definition of hypocrisy The only uncertainty I hear stakeholders and businesses in my constituency talking about is Brexit! A Tory led Brexit.  
The only good thing about Brexit is that it has brought the self interested, narcissistic leaders ( I do not include the voters) into one place where we can see them. Now can we give them the attention they deserve. #ignore 
Brexit puts the UK union at risk, new poll - 'Almost half of Scottish voters, 47% said they would now vote for independence if UK leaves EU & 56% of people in NI would be willing to vote for a united Ireland if UK left EU & a hard border were set up.

British PM Theresa May's #Brexit blueprint has come under heavy attack, with pro-Brexit figurehead Boris Johnson calling it a surrender that hands 'victory' to the EU  #ChequersPlan 
May slaps down BoJo over his claim Britain had gone into #Brexit negotiations waving a white flag.Typical Tory infighting and jockeying for position, instead of doing their jobs.Worst government in living memory. 
The bank says a pickup in the global economy in the past 2 years has helped mask some of the worst impacts of Brexit, allowing "growth to move sideways rather than dive lower."  
“We voted Leave, right? Then there is nothing else to say about #Brexit!”“It’s poli-tricks, not politics. They just make the money disappear and nothing changes.”My latest @lsebrexitvote blog on listening to people's views in Jaywick: 
You lied to the public to vote leave. You had time to help devise a plan before starting a 2 year clock. Since then all you have done is spout lies & use Brexit for your self-promotion. You ran away by resigning. So please stop your war terminology. You are of no use to the UK. 
Yesterday 2nd September was the 25th anniversary of the founding of the UK Independence Party (UKIP).  Here is a brief history of the party I prepared for the 20th anniversary  in 2013.  Since then UKIP achieved and won the Referendum. Now UKIP has to fight to make Brexit happen.

The most brutal edition of Fortnite yet: Battle Brexit.  
Really great to speak alongside some fantastic women at the launch of #w4pv this morning! Young women are among those most in favour of a #PeoplesVote - they stand to be disproportionately affected by Brexit - & v exciting that so many are getting involved with the campaign!  
That's a silly take on it Boris. People reckon @GaryLineker talks more sense on #Brexit than you do. 
1.  A Ref won't stop #Brexit unless a maj want 2 #StopBrexit2. If a maj now wish to #Remain it's the Will of the Ppl3. Those denying a #FinalSay R Autocrats4. Those forcing thru an invalid #BrexitShambles R Tyrants5. A #PeoplesVote doesn't subvert Democracy it Reinforces it. 
Spot on by @anandMenon1 on what a no-deal Brexit really means.One official told me EU concerned about "a dramatic British misconception" that no-deal would open the door to new talks. For now, EU insists no deal means no deal.

Oh dear God! What if Boris’ plan is to say that May has screwed Brexit and that we should just call the whole thing off? What if he’s our saviour? How will we ever feel clean again? 
Theresa May vows to STOP second #Brexit vote as poll shows 90 percent would vote the SAME  
Last October I wrote a blog arguing that Brexit would play out as a choice between 'soft' or 'hard' humiliation for UK. What JRM is doing here is rejecting the soft version, thus endorsing the hard version.

"It's ridiculous" Former Home Secretary @AmberRuddHR weights in on Boris Johnson's latest criticism of Theresa May's #Brexit plan  
Sheryll, your constituents did not vote to be made poorer or to lose their jobs. Some of them voted on the basis of a lie about the NHS and some empty rhetoric about "taking back control".Many of them are now aware they were lied to.#PeoplesVote #Brexit  
I have such a plan (ie for the UK to be richer, healthier etc): stay in the EU. Stop austerity economics, go Keynesian. Reform our voting & Parliamentary system which is so toxic & broken it has delivered this dreadful Brexit shambles.  
“We’re not selling chocolate” German industrial leaders explain why @theresa_may #Brexit plan won’t work & why they think the UK side (not the EU) must give (yet) more ground.

Membership of the SNP reached 125,482 at the end of August making @theSNP the second largest political party in the UK. Membership has grown by 100,000 since the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence. The #SNP now has more members than the UK Conservative and Unionist Party. 
BREXIT LIVE: Tory civil war ERUPTS as May fires back at Boris - 'you have NO new ideas!'  
Interesting: @AmberRuddHR backs  @NickBoles 'Better Brexit' plan for parking in the EEA if the Chequers plan fails. Imagine there's a lot of Tory 'silent majority' MPs who agree with her instead of crashing out of the bloc. #politicslive 
Boris Johnson intends to wreck millions of Britons' lives, jobs, futures in the hardest Brexit, as long as it gives him a chance of being PM. He doesn't care about us. My piece @nytimes this summer rhttps://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/opinion/boris-johnson-resignation-brexit.html

We are grateful to Debbie Williams at @BrexpatsHOV for their full support of the #UKEUchallenge because #VotesShouldBeFair.#Brexit #BrexitIsPersonal #BrexitShambles @Suewilson91 @A50Challenge 
Within this article it is clear from  recent @YouGov polling (with 18k + sample) that the UK is #remainernow.(51% men, 56% women).As more & more 2016 abstainers & leave voters realise #brexit reality & that it's not inevitable, this will only increase. 
Both Labour and Tories are only united in being so disunited.  Neither offer a solution to #Brexit that is credible or workable. No wonder EU looks across at UK with mixture of frustration & sorrow. We must not pass on this mess to future generations #FBPE #PeoplesVote 
Optimistic? We should be...@james_rogers writes for @BrexitCentral on how #GlobalBritain is brilliantly placed to seize future opportunities after Brexit…Give it a read  
The Brexit debate has ground to a halt. In 2 years, 1000s of politicians and civil servants haven't come up with a single workable idea to make us richer, happier, freer, safer, more healthy, more educated and with better family lives. It's just a vanity project by Con and Lab. 
Voting for #Brexit like:Lobbing the grenade at the EU, but finding it has rolled back into your trench.That nice warm feeling when you piss yourself, until it goes cold, & starts to smell. Giving the establishment a kicking, but realising it still has control, even more so. 
Cognitive dissonance of Leavers laid bare: 65% say Brexit must mean full control of borders bu only 33% say it means leaving the SM.  
Sajid Javid challenges Boris to put up or shut up on Brexit: “For those who think there’s a different way, they need to properly set out their alternative plan”. 
So now the European Union Youth Orchestra ~ possibly the best Youth Orchestra in the world, will stop accepting British students after #BrexitSo many many small tragedies.#stopbrexit #Iameuropean 
Worth noting that the opinion poll that has independence leading by 52/48 post Brexit included 16 and 17 year olds. Many past opinion polls that have had it 48/52 to No have not included 16 and 17 year olds.Consider what would happen if pollsters always included this age group. 
If anybody has contact deatils for @PeteWishart can you please let him know Independence Live want to livestream the Brexit debate please. The people demand it! Well, the people liking and retweeting this :) 
Bannon's hardest interview. In the world. Ever.And (quite brilliantly) @FergusonNews allows him to show himself as a complete Froot Loop.But US mid-terms loom: and those Yankees are as silly as us Aussies. Or the Poms. If it comes to a vote.#resist #Brexit #4Corners #AUSpol 
BORIS JOHNSON: “Theresa May’s Brexit plan is a disaster; instead of securing everything I abstractly claimed we wanted 2yrs ago, she has instead opted to work within the realms of what is actually achievable and, in doing so, betrayed the will of the people.” 
And once we’re outside the PDO regime, all of the EU will be free to enjoy cheaper Cornish pasties made in Spain, Cheddar from Bulgaria, and Scotch from Poland, since our products will no longer be protected. Quite a Brexit dividend you’re delivering for those industries.  
Women have more to lose from #Brexit - be it maternity rights, equal pay, anti-harassment laws - so I’m throwing my weight being @women4PV. We must be given the chance to vote on the final #Brexit deal.   
Bono: “I’m gonna speak up against Brexit!”God: “I don’t think so.” 
Seriously, @BorisJohnson, I challenge you in your next crappy column to tell us the good news about Brexit.  
The day after 18 September 2014.EVEL arrived, then every single promise was broken & the UK government slashed jobs, our budget & reneging on their insistence that Scotland could only remain in the EU by voting no. It's illogical to wait till after Brexit for indyref2. 
I steer clear of Brexit these days.. I voted remain but trust JC/Labour to do what's right. There is far too much wrong created by the Tories that needs to be challenged.. People are  dying, NHS in shreds, poor deprived of pay, housing, Education... Just a starter. 
Spain's Prime Minister @sanchezcastejon would opt for a referendum in Catalonia on 'autonomy' or 'self government' but not a referendum on independence. But at least he's started to mention 'referendum' and 'Catalonia' in the same breath ...  
Reminder: your investment outfit set up in Dublin specifically because of the impact of a no deal Brexit. Your venal hypocrisy fools no one.  
Cruel irony here. Brexit showed how out-of-touch the London arts world was, but its effect will make the industry even more reliant on the capital  
Does anyone have a single tangible benefit of Brexit yet? I'll wait. 
Met (& talked to!) Brexit voters this weekend, while at a social event. Both fully convinced ‘everything will be fine & nothing will change’. I pointed out how much has already changed (for the worse). Uncomfortable conversation, really. Fear of losing face  clearly huge factor. 
the song stan is about brexit. stan (brexit) repeatedly writes to eminem (michel barnier) but does not get a reply. he finally drives himself and his pregnant girlfriend (the uk) off a bridge (hard brexit) at the end. my latest for the observer 
If only someone had been the leader of the Leave campaign and then in a position of influence over our foreign policy and the government's Brexit policy, things could have been oh so different...  
Brexit is likely to precipitate the break-up of the United Kingdom according to a new poll, which shows Scottish voters turning towards independence.We believe we should thrive together in the EU instead. Are you with us? Spread the word. 
I'm not a fan of Hodge, and certainly not of Field. But they're right that Corbyn must go, quickly. Not because he's anti-Semitic (I doubt that he is), but because he's a hopelessly bad leader, and because he's rather stupid; he's clumsily slippery; and he's been enabling Brexit.  
Hard Brexit looming, UK in turmoil, jobs at risk, debt and deficit increasing massively by the day, rise in foodbanks and homelessness. However there is an alternative, A WAY OUT! Scottish independence.@RuthDavidsonMSP "I urge the FM to NOT hold a 2nd independence referendum". 
Boris Johnson’s Brexit – a five-act farce1. I was Foreign Secretary for 2 years2. And now Brexit is going to be a disaster3. Therefore when I’m PM4. Er… and it’ll be even worse.5. Biscuits, anyone?  
"The possibility that Brexit could compromise our supply of insulin is terrifying for me and others living with type 1 diabetes...”Why people with diabetes are terrified of Brexit and what it could mean for their insulin supplies  
In the UK many on the losing Remain side refuse to accept the outcome of the Brexit referendum.  Like the EU itself,  they are fundamentally anti democratic.  
David Davis backs Boris Johnson after his scathing attack on Theresa May's Brexit strategy, telling ITV News: "We have to be tough with the Europeans."  
Former Brexit Secretary will vote down the Chequers proposal. Davis knows it is not a proper Brexit! 
On today’s poll showing a majority of people would back independence after Brexit - @NicolaSturgeon says it’s “not surprising” but won’t influence the timing of another referendum  
Women will be disproportionately affected by Brexit yet it is men who have been at the forefront of the debate. We need to have our voices heard so it was great to attend the launch of @women4PV today #Women4PV 
In which EU country has support for the EU dropped since the Brexit ref?The answer is none of them. Even Marine Le Pen has dropped her anti EU policy since then.Please stop cheering on fascists. It didn't end well last time. 
Boris Johnson’s latest Brexit outburst combines madness and mendacity | Simon Jenkins  
TORY BREXIT PLAN:1. Propose impossible deal, which EU refuses2. Say: "Look at those EU wankers, it's their fault we're crashing out of EU with disastrous no-deal3. Crash out of the EU with disastrous no-deal(Don't mention whole disaster triggered by Tories in 1st place) 
Brexit: Where we are at:- Chequers plan is unworkable- The only workable Brexit solution is EEA (single market / solves Irish border question)- EEA off the table due to freedom of movement  - May & Corbyn don’t want a second referendum= Tragically inevitable outcome: No deal 
It’s time to be bold and cancel Brexit.In its place, we need a major programme of economic and social reform to address the issues that led to the referendum result.Good piece by Richard Wilson of ⁦@LeedsEurope⁩.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE 
German businesses are now calling on @theresa_may to soften on the #ChequersPlan which is not even #Brexit.What a mess#StandUp4Brexit#ChuckChequers 
Average age of workers left at @DExEUgov and tasked with delivering #Brexit is 32.Remind me again, which age group is most opposed to the UK leaving the EU?  
“Conservative rebels including Iain Duncan Smith and @patel4witham have joined a campaign to wreck May's Brexit plan, it has emerged. The #StandUp4Brexit group has recruited 20 Tory MPs in an effort to sink the PM's Chequers compromise” 
On @bbcquestiontime five weeks before the referendum I warned about the right-wing xenophobic anti-rationalist takeover of the @Conservatives - that's what has begun with Johnson's move against May... #YouWereWarned 
FM @NicolaSturgeon reacts to exclusive @LBC #Brexit poll which suggests majority of Leave voters are happy to exit the EU if it means the UK going into recession.  
Realities on the ground in six steps:1. The Chequers ‘deal’ is dead on arrival2. There’s currently no public attempt by May’s government to find an alternative3. May can’t get Labour MP votes without softening Brexit; can’t get Tory ones without hardening it(1/2) 
First we lose the Medicines Agency - and the jobs, prestige and funding that brings in.Now we lose the contracts for medicine approval across the EU - where we were the leading member state.Brexit is a tragedy, making Britain weaker day by day.

The Govt must face the hard facts: a ‘no-deal #Brexit’ would really hurt. The UK within the EU could trade much more extensively than it does currently with countries around the world; Germany and France are leading examples. We can still turn this around #ExitFromBrexit 
I wish everyone tweeting about #roxannepallett could get as angry about Brexit.

What A No Deal Brexit Would Mean For EU Citizens Here, And Brits In Europe"No Deal is far more than just an economic threat – it would put people's daily lives directly in the firing line" writes @jdportes in this sobering analysis 
If people like you had left your egos and hysterics back in June 2016, the government, and Parliament, could have been much more effective in implementing Brexit.All your antics have done is embolden Barnier and obstruct the clean slaying of the EU beast. Any mess is your fault.  
Theresa May's team 'discussed' a snap election if her Brexit plan fails  
You think you’ve heard the most ridiculous statements about #Brexit. Then a Tory goes and tops the lot.  
There it is in black and white, 'We've failed'. Brexit has failed. After 40 odd years of talking it up, they have created an abject, humiliating failure. Staring out from the pages of the torygraph, the face of a man who lost the plot.  
No deal Brexit will rip apart our everyday lives and threaten our economy. This now is not Project Fear – it’s near and we are hanging over the precipice. 
- a 74 yr old lady left for 9 hrs “wedged between bed & wall”- elderly patients left for the whole day on floors having fallen- someone with a stab/gunshot wound left overnight NHS ambulance services are falling apart whilst govt bickers over Brexit. 
Given the dangers posed by far right climate deniers and their strong links to Brexit, it is time for those of us who back the overwhelming scientific consensus on #climatechange to take back control. My piece for @guardianopinion 
How many times must this be rehearsed. There isn't a 'solution' to the Irish border. It's not like a Rubik's cube. UK has a range of post Brexit options. Which one they choose will determine what border looks like. End of  
Boris Johnson used to be a supporter of Britain remaining in the EU and was extremely sceptical about Brexit. He doesn’t like people reminding him of this, so please don’t share this tweet with anyone.  
Totally wrong again, Sarah.  The disastrous #ChequersPlan is a mess of @theresa_may's making which was perhaps caused by you & your friends not respecting what the referendum.May I remind you of the manifesto and Lancaster House commitments?#StandUp4Brexit#ChuckChequers 
This is #2 on my wish list for Labour Conference. #1 is a motion backing the promise of a second referendum (which Momentum should have polled its members on!)  
Only polls but two fresh ones today suggest support for Scottish independence and Irish unification. All because of #Brexit. This was widely foretold but doesn't seem to bother Johnson et al at all.  
On the morning after the referendum Boris looked like a man coming down from a bad acid trip to discover he had murdered his best friend. Two years on, he looks the same. Still no plan other than ambition. 
It’s wrong to say Boris Johnson doesn’t have his own plan on how to Brexit. Here it is in full:  
@DavidDavisMP please DM me and I would be happy to tell you more about the real life existential issues facing businesses in the UK as a result of Brexit.    Jobs depend on this.  Households rely on the income.   You need to listen. 
Poll shows a real Brexit must mean full control of our borders, our money and our laws. That is what the referendum campaign was all about.  
The economy? You broke it. Now fuck off and let someone else fix it. And take your poxy Brexit with you.  
Who talks the most sense on Brexit? (please RT) #Brexit 
If he didn’t try, why didn’t he try? He was Foreign Secretary for two years, and the prime driver of #Brexit With Boris Johnson it’s always someone else’s fault.  
The scandal of Brexit is that we had had a referendum for Tory party management reasons when we were fastest growing economy in G7 whereas now we’re the slowest. David Cameron then buggered off, only seen occasionally gurning for camera at festivals after damage done ever since  
Brexit an "abandonment" of the young  
The links between the far right and climate change denial are strong#Brexit poses a risk to our climate as well our democracy and economy 
My son has lost his job because of Brexit.  He's now going to Australia and taking my grandson with him.  That's because of you and your lies.  You said the only way for Scotld to remain in the EU was to vote No.  Your lies have caused the breakup of my family. #DissolveTheUnion 
In a nutshell. For more than two years Theresa May has done everything possible to ensure Brexit is diluted to the point where her version of it is worthless. She must go!  
Anyway, we'll be talking all things Brexit from 10 on @LBC. Do join in. 
Iamnottheproblem.Brexitis  
Wonder how many people are suffering through 50 minutes of #Brexit debate just to hear what Roxanne will say  #CBB #JeremyVine 
The sheer brass neck of it is beyond belief. Boris Johnson has produced no plans for Brexit. Nothing. Whatever happens, he’ll blame someone else. The Brexiter media like to scream ‘traitor’ and ‘enemy of the people’ at every turn. But, Johnson fits those labels well in my book.  
'@BorisJohnson "In adopting The Chequers proposals, we have gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank. If we continue on this basis we will throw away most of the advantages of Brexit." 
No wonder a no-deal Brexit is looking more likely - with Theresa May's chaotic leadership and 50%+ turnover rate at the Brexit department.It's not too late - we can get out of this mess and exit Brexit. Add your name today:  
I will be debating Brexit with one of the local Scottish Tory MPs. Going well? Chaotic cluelessness? Come along and ask your question. Was packed last year.  
Pretty straightforward. Data shows that DUP is increasing chances of a United Ireland by embracing #Brexit - can there ever have been a more ridiculous stance from a Unionist party? Am in Belfast today surveying the scene!  
If only he had been in government. If only he had at his disposal a national newspaper willing to print every inane thing he says. If only he had led a Brexit campaign. If only he hadn't started showing newspapers they could increase sales by lying about the EU decades ago. 
READ: a new poll reveals only 13% of women think it is likely Britain will manage to secure a good deal before it leaves the bloc.Women are more concerned than men with the dangers of upheaval from Brexit & that’s why women are backing a #PeoplesVote 
Every time Fox talks about Brexit, it's worth remembering that he 1) claimed that a trade deal with the EU would be the easiest in history, and 2) he said the UK would have 40 free trade deals in place 'seconds after' Brexit. 
If you couldn't pull off a 'successful' Brexit while Foreign Secretary or Secretary of State for Brexit, it's unlikely you will be able to do so after resigning. 
‘Bad boys of brexit want to take women back to the 50s. We must rise up and fight for the rights our mothers and grandmothers have fought for.’ Chilling words from @RachelSJohnson   If that doesn’t make you fight for a #PeoplesVote then what won’t? #Women4PV 
No more concessions.No more #ChequersPlanNo more May.It’s time we got the change required to deliver BREXIT  
The fact that most of the media is treating Boris Johnson's latest fact-free bloviations as the biggest Brexit story of the day provides a pretty neat encapsulation of why so many are still surprised by the EU's long-established & frequently explained positions. 
great to see W4PV is launching The movement is growing! Sparked by the rally held by Women4Europe, Nina and myself + help from @RupaHuq bringing us to the HoC to raise awareness of the rights threatened by Brexit, more n more are standing up for the protection of our rights  
What is this nonsense about battles & white flags?Boris Johnson & his cohort of reckless Brexiteers mis-sold 17 million people the idea of Brexit.But totally ignored:The EU has rules & benefits.The rules apply to all.The benefits are only for members. 
Next up speaking is  @RachelSJohnson #W4PV“This gov’t is not allowing our people; women, children and grandchildren to have another chance to decide whether they want May’s Brexit. That’s a betrayal of democracy”#PeoplesVote 
Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit plan is the equivalent of a child egging a sibling on to do something naughty and immediately ratting them out to their parents when they do in the hopes they'll be rewarded.He thinks we'll ignore Labour has helped deliver Brexit hand in hand with Tories. 
Brexit is a feminist issue.Delighted to be at the launch of Women for a People’s Vote this morning.#W4PV 
.@thomasbrake has today revealed a staff exodus from the Government’s Brexit Department. He said the new figures showed the “deep instability right at the heart of the Conservative Government’s failing Brexit operation.” #FinalSay #ExitFromBrexit #Brexit 
The UK could never abide the EU 'superstate'. Why? Because the UK is a post imperial superstate itself. But with #Brexit it will break up into a federalised system and each component will rejoin the EU.That's why #Brexit is the exit of Britain as we know it from the world stage  
Here at the launch of  women for a @peoplesvote_uk, where they’re presenting research about how Brexit will affect women, and the lack of women in the discussions and the media  
Brexit persuading Scots to support independence. New poll shows majority will back independence after Britain leaves the EU. Pls RT.  #scotland #brexit  
Government are split 3 ways on Brexit. None work. Brexit is dead. Time to bury it.  
Theresa May says that asking the people of Britain (i.e., you) to vote again on Brexit would be the ultimate betrayal of the people of Britain (i.e. you), who should leave it all to a prime minister who commands no majority in Parliament.Is she quoting from Orwell's "1984"? 
Johnson's Brexit has, of course, been tried: it was the Lancaster House version. What has happened subsequently is that it has been shown to be completely unworkable.  
Worth noting that the @Andrew_Adonis who has today criticised Lord Sacks for his comments on Enoch Powell is the same Andrew Adonis who compared Brexit to appeasement of the Nazis.   
Rejecting #Brexit via a #PeoplesVote would not be the end of the world, nor the end of democracy, just the end of Mogg, Johnson, Fox, Gove, Farage and May. 
I could do a roaring trade selling blankets to stranded motorists ... Commemorative “Brexit blankets” ... you heard it here first, folks, ... patent pending ... #BrexitDividend 
UBS: "UK GDP is already 2.1% lower in level terms than where it would have been without Brexit; investment is 4% weaker, inflation 1.5% higher, consumption is 1.7% lower and the REER is 12% more depreciated."  
Pressure mounts on UK PM May as critics tear into her Brexit plan  
No @BorisJohnson it's the inevitable result of embarking on a project built on lies, most of which you have spouted some time or another. Those who have peddled those lies deserve lengthy jail sentences for harming the country. #JailTheLeaveLiars#PeoplesVote #brexit  
Boris Johnson might be able to stop May's Brexit sellout, but 2 YEARS have been wasted. Should've put our terms to the EU immediately, then spent time preparing businesses, setting up deals with allies, bolstering the fishing industry, etc... Now it's a last minute hatchet job. 
Ok let me restate ‘The economic cost of Scottish Independence is even more insane than Brexit’. 
This weekend:• David Davis, who’d ostensibly been in charge of Brexit since July 2016, said PM’s plan won’t work• Nick Boles said UK should rip up current transition plans for something new• Boris Johnson said Brexit’s going badly and offered no alternative plan.  
We have reached a complete impasse with #Brexit.May's plan is unworkable & won't make it through parliament.A disastrous no-deal #Brexit is not supported by the British people.When a democracy reaches such an impasse it *has* to go back to the people.#PeoplesVote #r4today 
I don't blame those who voted #Brexit in 2016 - they were lied to.I do blame anyone stupid, racist or bloody-minded enough to still support it in 2018.Stop ruining our country.#PeoplesVote 
Momentum deciding to focus on internal party rules while offering no challenge on Brexit seems *very* left-politics-as-usual. Feels like a fair few in Labour membership expect a 10-15pt election boost to materialise by itself, given what happened in 2017. 
No Boris Johnson. the Scandal of Brexit is that you conned decent, moderate people to vote Leave on the basis we'd get a great trade deal because EU needs us more than we need it, and there'd be £350m extra for NHS. All lies. You should be ashamed. #PeoplesVote pic.twitter.com/2SxQRQXi69 
Still think Corbyn is the key. If he goes the whole rotten edifice will collapse - Tories, Brexit, the lot. If May goes we’re still in the same shit (or worse). 
So knife-edge. But really, do Scots need to experience 18 months of post-Brexit unravelling/entropy before we go for indy, in order to get back in (or near) EU? What are we, Pavlov's dog? Is it only pain that teaches? Can't the escape argument begin to be made positively, now?  
BREXIT LIVE: Tory rebels sign up to Hard Brexit group in MAJOR blow to May   
Yes; and its roots are screaming STOP BREXIT! “Labour must reconnect with its roots to heal UK's rifts says Stephen Kinnock - the guardian  
Did they ever cancel that Brexit thing 
Damian Green @BBCr4today denies Whitehall conspiracy to achieve Brexit in name only. But is Chequers part of a greater conspiracy, between No10 & Brussels? Are we witnessing an unfolding circus act to hoodwink Brexit supporters? Barnier’s latest Chequers rejection points that way 
Boris Johnsao has savaged and ripped apart Theresa Mays Brexit plans calling it "diddly squat" saying it would hand the EU victory. This comes after Michel Barnier says he is "strongly" opposed to parts of the plan. This shows what a wonderful job May and her government is doing. 
Head of the German car manufacturers“Our view is that any Brexit deal must have one priority: to maintain and strengthen the cohesion of the remaining 27 member states. We must not give other countries any incentive to leave.” 
Today's news:- Boris says May's Chequers deal will only lead to victory for Brussels- Tory Brexit rebels pledge to wreck the Chequers plan- Barnier suggests UK must chose between Canada deal or staying in 
My biggest issue with the latest indy poll, is the fact it's not over 60%. Genuinely don't get so many people who would rather stay in hard Brexit Britain w/not enough food, than be indy in the EU. Scots, you're a strange lot. (Not all of you, obvs.) 
Interesting @BBCr4today re parliament voting against brexit deal, and idea that parliament may take control in that case. Question to historians / constitutional experts: What does that entail? Cross party group of MPs coalesce around unifying PM / deputy? Has that ever happened? 
As the Brexit blame game begins let me pitch in an alternative headline to the people of Wales. Westminster isn’t fit to run our country. It’s a shambles. Welsh interests are marginal at best. It’s time for us to start taking full control of our own affairs.  
Brexit is the end of the UK: @thetimes “Most voters in Northern Ireland would support a united Ireland if Britain left the EU, a poll has found” 
Only she’s not standing in the middle of the road. She’s backing Brexit despite all the evidence of the harm it will do to our country, which she tacitly accepts. 
Brexit is the end of the U.K.: @thetimes “More Scots would back independence after Britain leaves the European Union, a poll suggests” 
Damian Green, tells BBC @BBCr4today "Michel Barnier doesn't' have a plan" for Brexit". "The only plan on the table is the Chequers plan". 
1. Well good morning! Hope you had a good summer. Westminster's back this week and May's Brexit problem summed up by old Thatcher quote 'Standing in the middle of the road is very dangerous; you get knocked down by the traffic from both sides' 
The EU side rejects May's Brexit concepts not because they are unacceptable but because they are unworkable. #r4today 
Not fair. Even the Brexit Secretary was kept out of the loop by May on arrangements for Brexit. She has run a deeply duplicitous and for a long time secret operation against proper Brexit. 
Clear articulation by @BorisJohnson of the “myths” surrounding the Irish border & solutions to supposed problems. “The answer is to go for the one solution that both delivers Brexit and treats all the UK in the same way: a big and generous Free Trade Deal”  
Andrew Marr presents David Davis and Liam Fox as "both sides" of the Brexit debate.  Rational people don't exist in his universe.  Cartoon time!#AndrewMarr #Brexit #StopBrexit #DavidDavis #Remain #LiamFox #EU #FBPE #ABTV #WATON #PeoplesVote #FinalSay 
1/2 Hearing on the grapevine that there are UK-Spain bilateral discussions taking place over a post-Brexit Gibraltar .....  off to do some digging cant find much except Spain saying to EU negotiators in a three hour meeting .... 
It's scary that 43% still want to remain part of the UK - even after a bad Brexit.  They are happy to cut their own throats - and ours along with it.  They are obviously happy with a Tory Govt, that helps the rich - at the expense of the poor. I despair!  
As a non-Jew, I feel this letter is totally out of place, especially from someone who compared Brexit to appeasement of Hitler!!! How dare you tell a leader of the Jewish community he shouldn't feel this way. I hope it is withdrawn  
The real scandal of Brexit is not that we’ve failed, but that he lied.  
We all know that Theresa May's chequers #brexit plan is a disaster, but unless @BorisJohnson or @Jacob_Rees_Mogg actually grow the balls to challenge her leadership @theresa_may will continue bodging her way to UK servitude to the EU. 
Lord Adonis,Last year it was widely reported that you compared Brexit to appeasement of the Nazis in the 30s.I'm willing to bet Lord Sacks didn't write you a letter about what he must have seen as an awful comparison. He certainly didn't publish it.Yours,A Jewish Remainer  
Theresa May’s Brexit plan was hanging by a thread last night as 20 Conservative MPs made a joint public commitment to scupper her chequers proposals.  
For those of us who knock doors only surprise with this poll is that support for independence is not even further in the lead!May's hard-brexit extremists making people wake up to reality of an EU exit.Reminder to fellow indy supporters, we have to keep campaigning! #ItsOn 
That’s it Boris stick it to the Appeaser .The time to attack her is now.Let’s make her dance on the fire.We don’t need her weak and uninspired Politics,we need energy and forward lookingsolutions  to the Brexit we voted for.  
This is a devastating and true indictment of May's administration by the leader of the victorious official Leave campaign. May has deliberately connived against Brexit, totally against the mandate she accepted. Tories will not recover if they allow her to carry on much longer.  
Our full @UKandEU  report on the impacts of a No Deal Brexit now online. Covers everything from citizens rights and economics to drugs and fish. Warning: not an easy read.   
#brexit  This is what the 17 million, who voted leave the EU think of Labour MP David Lammy. Crying   everyday about BREXIT . We’re leaving David OK.  
The scandal of Brexit is that a small group of hard right Tory Brexiteers are holding the country hostage to pursue a destructive, ideological hard Brexit against the interests of the country.  
Whatever ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩’s skills, wooing the young Brexit vote is not one of them. Does anyone under 40 know even that there was a time when British wrestling was a big TV thing?  
Brexit poll bombshell as most Scots will back independence after UK leaves EU   
A second referendum would 1.  Betray democracy 2. Politically abandon the working classes and disengage them from politics, perhaps forever 3. Cause a hugely damaging run on sterling 4. Be a recipe for riots in the streets. Forget it! You lost, Remoaners  
#OnThisDay in 2016: London, #MarchForEurope. Were you there? I sure hope you’ll join me on 20 Oct this yearWe must make it a million at least. Because after two years of standing up to Brexit we must keep pushing. Remaining defiant and, as always, standing together   
This’ll be the non ‘traitor, mutineer, enemies of the people’ Tory rebels - the ones who won’t be losing their jobs if we crash out #Brexit #nodeal That’ll be #Leave voters working in our manufacturing sector  
Brexiters just assumed they’d get the Brexit they imagined, they never stopped to think how the other players would think or react. And now they’re outraged at the consequences of their own arrogance and incompetence.Thisis so bloody obvious.  
While Theresa May has spent two years negotiating with her own party on Brexit, voters in Scotland and Northern Ireland have been slowly heading for the door.  
Britain has lost its medicines contracts with the European Medicines Agency ahead of Brexit, in yet another blow to the British Pharmaceutical industry. #PeoplesVote 
Headline aside, the real story is that more leavers believe Boris Johnson would deliver a 'Real Brexit' compared to Theresa May - LBC  
People who voted for Brexit would be happy to leave the EU, even if it means food and travel prices to rocket and the UK goes into recession, an exclusive LBC poll reveals.  
Boris describes May's #Brexit negotiations as rigged.'I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head."Unless May goes, Boris is right 
Business Secretary Liam Fox contradicted himself (again) about Brexit. He said that it was impossible to predict things about the economy 15 years in the future. But just two weeks earlier he published a document doing just that... #BrexitShambles #r4today 
'Impossible': Johnson launches fresh attack on May's Brexit plans Here comes the leadership challenge from Bannon's numpty (sorry aka useful idiot)#PeoplesVote 
“It is now clear that some in the UK Government never wanted solutions. Solving Ireland would mean a solution for Dover-Calais, and they didn’t really want that. They wanted essentially to stay in, and to create a Brexit in name only” @BorisJohnson 
Brexit is bad for Britain  
New poll shows that Scottish independence is becoming the preferred solution to the Brexit vandalism being inflicted on Scotland. We mustn’t get carried away with one poll, but keep making the case and self-Government will win the day   
If you're of working-class & in a workers union then I'd recommend opting out of @UKLabour party contributions (I have) their apparent U-turn & lack of clarity on #Brexit with freedom of movement of a cheap labour force is driving your weekly wage down, along with everything else 
An exclusive LBC poll has revealed Leavers back Boris to deliver a 'real' Brexit; @NickFerrariLBC asks: should Boris Johnson be leading Brexit?  
If you think about it, offering a #PeoplesVote would actually insult our intelligence.The damage from Brexit is now so self-evident and so massive, that it defies belief that the country (if informed) could vote for it now.It's irresponsible even to offer Brexit as an option. 
Britain loses medicines contracts as EU body anticipates Brexit  
Just one question. Has ANYONE who voted to remain changed their mind in the last two years and now think Brexit is the best way forward? Anyone?... 
The £350m question is why Boris Johnson doesn’t admit he lied about Brexit instead of blaming others 
Boris campaigned to leave based on liesHe was a Minister who could influence the Brexit plan before art 50 was triggeredHe spent most of the 2 year art 50 period moaning & lying He resigned & is now sniping like a coward He has not tried. It is a scandal#peoplesvote 
.@BorisJohnson , your serious blunder over Nazanin to your offensive racist jokes and comments designed to stoke tension have lost you the right to speak on issues as serious as #Brexit #FBPE 
Will @theresa_may risk all on pursuing her Chequers Brexit plan, now that  @DavidDavisMP @BorisJohnson and @Jacob_Rees_Mogg’s ERG are putting it under sustained relentless ferocious attack to oust it or - if she won’t budge - her? 
Boris Johnson says “the scandal of Brexit is not that we’ve failed, but that we have not tried”. Is he right?@JuliaHB1 |  
Poll says 52% would back independence if Brexit happens  
The vandalism of #Brexit continues...  
Short thread on Brexit:1) These remarks by ex-UK Brexit Secretary David Davis reveal some core intellectual flaws at the heart of some Brexiteer thinking. Not only related to the Irish border, but also in HMG’s general approach to negotiating with the EU over the last two years  
LETS BE CLEAR-A second referendum is not a betrayal to any set of people, it would merely be a correction on the first when people voted influenced by lies & promises made by CHARLATANS which they had no control over. The current situation is false economy and must be put right..

If #Johnson thinks the UK “hasn’t tried” over Brexit, what exactly does he propose? Spell it out Mr. Johnson & while you are at it, tell us why you didn’t table your proposition when you were in the Cabinet. 
Yes of course Putin is all-powerful. David Cameron made the same point during Project Fear and that Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, also wanted Brexit. True or false it is irrelevant what they want. Brexit is the right, forward-looking decision for the UK.  
It's pantomime, a make-believe that the EU is bending over backwards to accept Chequers, utter bolloxI predict that Chequers will be put to the council for ratification. A Merkel & May production, that has #Brexit betrayal written all over it & is why we must chuck Chequers now  
Due to your opinion on Brexit & the 17.4 million who voted out in your own words you should leave your own party Idiot.

What does this prat @NickBoles not understand. The EEA is a mechanism for Countries to enter the EU and prepare to align with the EU.  The EEA is membership of the EU without any control in its running.  It is not Brexit as mandated by the electorate. 
Boris Johnson launches scathing attack on Theresa May's Brexit plan branding it a 'fix' that spells victory for EU  
"The decision by the European Medicines Agency to cut Britain out of its contracts seven months ahead of Brexit is a devastating blow to British pharmaceutical companies already reeling from the loss of the EMA’s HQ in London and with it 900 jobs." 
Brexit is toxic for the @Conservatives, toxic for @UKLabour and toxic for our country. The Brexiters have tried to make it work for over 2 years and failed. Time to think again, time to celebrate our membership of the European family of nations.

I'm becoming terrified. It's not just Brexit. If it were, we could experience the mess & rejoin the EU, albeit on worse terms. It's that Brexit is part of Putin's war on the west, what he's doing to USA via Trump & to the EU, including Hungary, & to NATO. UK is on the wrong side

Boris Johnson launches fresh attack on May's Brexit plans  
Boris Johnson has used his latest weekly newspaper column to attack Theresa May's Brexit plan. If he becomes PM, what would Boris' Britain look like? #DarrenOnLBC 
Spotted under Madagascar on this Japanese TV show - certainly one of the more radical plans for post-Brexit Britain...  
Brexit tore our nation apart. Good people arguing with good people. Everybody thinks they're right.I curse you David Cameron for your cheap attempt at keeping your party together. You failed at that, you failed your nation and everyone in it.I'm going outside to scream. 
The Captain of Titanic didn’t see the iceberg until it was too late. Brits have watched #Brexit iceberg approach for 2 yrs and still chose to ram right into it.   
“Theresa May’s Brexit plan was hanging by a thread last night as 20 Tory MPs, including the former ministers Priti Patel and Iain Duncan Smith, made a joint public commitment to scupper her proposals by joining the #StandUp4Brexit grassroots campaign” 
If you believe that a new referendum would undermine the results of the last referendum..Then you believe that the will of the people is to remain in the EU..INESCAPABLE Logic.. 
No, @BorisJohnson. The scandal of #Brexit is that unprincipled liars like yourself casually ruined our country to further your own personal ambition.Your shamefaced look look the morning after suggested that you may even have realised this yourself, albeit briefly.#PeoplesVote 
Newspaper headlines: Boris and Barnier bash May's Brexit plan  
I spent the best part of a decade in cancer drug discovery in academia, collaborating closely with medics and the pharma industry. From bench to bedside, there is no place that Brexit doesn't damage.But hey, experts eh? What do they know?! 
One Swedish opinion poll puts the Swedish Democrats (Hard Right) on 24% of the vote in next week’s general election. That would make them the biggest party in Parliament. They want a referendum on EU membership. 
Oh No! No! No! What are we doing people!!! Britain loses medicines contracts as EU body anticipates Brexit  
Hahahaha. For all the fake news, “prestigious” awards, and lobbying, the establishment has failed to convince law enforcement that there is any evidence to investigate the Brexit campaign. Because there is no reason. But probably many reasons to investigate the Guardian...  
New poll shows 52% of Northern Irish voters want a United Ireland, with only 39% wishing to remain in the UK, if Brexit goes ahead. History may record that the union was destroyed by Paisley’s DUP rather than the IRA, Sinn Fein, Dublin, London betrayal etc. that’d be some irony  
Terrible news - and yet more evidence of the massive act of self harm which is #Brexit  
“Populists are nowhere”? Er, try “everywhere”. The threat of UKIP populists pushed Cameron to hold a simplistic referendum, won by populist lies, the result of which now means brexit populism dominates both parties & the country is headed off a cliff edge. 
I remember when he was Brexit Secretary and I was the border that frustrated him. I’m still the border. But he’s not the Brexit Secretary.  
Brexit latest - short-cut to United Ireland, thanks to the DUP  
Cobblers. What has Mrs May been doing for the last two years if it’s not ‘trying.’ The scandal of Brexit is YOU, Boris Johnson  
Boris Johnson takes public for fools. Makes false promises to win referendum only to immediately quit leadership race so doesn’t have to actually see Brexit thru. Now when too late says could do better. Boris — you bottled it. We’re not having it. #BorisBad4Britain 
I don't think enough people appreciate the role of British punditry's imperial delusions & nostalgia in creating consensus for Brexit.  
Brexit latest - a big boost to those who want to end the UK in Scotland & Northern Ireland  
Your job now @Keir_Starmer is to OPPOSE the government rather than facilitate this disastrous #Brexit farce. Please persuade your “leader” that his fortunes - and the country’s - would improve immeasurably if you committed to a #PeoplesVote and a swift end to this catastrophe 
'Best for Britain' polling also finds 57% support for Irish Unity in Northern Ireland if UK follows through with Brexit.  
Many of us are missing something here. As the Tories tear themselves apart over Brexit and personal ambitions; Cable leads a march backing minoriity Remainers and Labour voters want Comrade Corbyn to throw away our defences and open the floodgates to immigration. How do we vote? 
I'm old enough to remember when Johnson was seen as an inspired appointment because it would mean he'd have to own Brexit.Two years later and he's literally boasting in the press about how absolutely he failed to do his job. 
"Ok, so you didn't free Nazanin. That was a big oversight. But at least it was because you were busy dealing with brexit, right?""haha oh god no"  
British Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out a second referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union, saying it would be a "gross betrayal" of democracy  
While UK politicians are either fucking up Brexit, assassinating Corbyn's character, or multi-tasking both,  walk through any City centre, like I just did, and have your senses assailed by the sheer number of desperate homeless. Open your eyes People. 
Remember the total panic on Boris’ face when his side won. He didn’t expect, want or know how to do Brexit - it was just a tactic to become PM. That’s why he bottled the leadership contest, & why he’s had no ideas, just slogans, ever since. A rotten, vacant, lazy, dangerous fraud  
Exclusive: FOI data reveals the equivalent of half the Brexit department’s total staff have left their roles in the last two years - prompting fears of “deep instability” at the heart of government as officials rush to get Brexit preparations finished in time.  
Today’s Best for Britain poll shows a majority would vote for Scottish independence after the UK leaves the EU.52% of Scots would vote for independence after Brexit, and a similar percentage of voters in Northern Ireland would vote for a United Ireland after the UK leaves the EU 
As the good ship the HMS Tory Hard Brexit sets full steam ahead for the No deal/bad deal iceberg the Scottish people realise that there are lifeboats attached marked 'independence'. All they need to do is clamber aboard and set sail as quickly as possible to the shores of sanity  
Used to joke that Brexiteers would eventually come to echo proponents of 'real Communism' but didn't expect this would occur before Brexit had even formally happened. Still, good to get your excuses in early  
“We should do Brexit”“This seems difficult, I quit the government”“The problem is nobody is trying but me”  
If Brexit goes ahead, it will BREAK UP not one but two unions! If Brexit goes ahead, Scots Vote 47-43 for independence. If Brexit goes ahead, Northern Ireland votes 52-39 for a United Ireland!  
If Brexit happens next year, my current plan is to sell up in London, move back to Scotland and open a business. If I get a vote, I'll vote Yes, as would my missus, and she's English.

Monday's @TheScotsman front page: "Brexit persuading Scots to support independence – poll"Read more here:  
Monday’s Daily TELEGRAPH: “ ‘Scandal of Brexit is not that we’ve failed, but that we have not tried’ “ #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday 
If Brexit goes ahead:Scotland would vote for independence (47% vs 43%)Nothern Ireland would vote to unite with the Republic (52% vs 39%)Deltapoll survey for @BestForBritain 
Damning latest from ⁦@BorisJohnson: In adopting the Chequers proposals, we have gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank. If we continue on this basis we will throw away the key opportunities of Brexit.  
David Davis says we can't go back on #Brexit because it's a once in a lifetime decision. Which makes sense, because it's clearly wrong to reverse a decision that will mess up the rest of your life while you still have the chance.... That's obvious, isn't it...?#PeoplesVote #FBPE 
Big new poll out tonight finds that Brexit could ultimately lead to Scottish independence  
So to "failed Brexit minister David Davis" we can add "failed foreign secretary Boris Johnson". He's literally admitting he failed to achieve anything in office.  
Brexit means...Up to yer oxters in shite and then kidding on that it’s a fucking jacuzzi. 
No-deal Brexit: study warns of severe short-term impact on UK  
Good point. ,If the people still want Brexit, how could a second referendum possibly be a betrayal? And if they don’t, then why the hell should they have to have Brexit just to save May’s scraggy arse?  
Harry's Last Stand?  If so I'd discuss how we allowed the 21st century to resemble the 1930s and ways to reverse this. Also make sure everyone knows that Brexit is a symptom of this inequality, not something concocted by fascists but they used society's indifference to poverty.  
I can’t seem to tweet about Brexit now without talking about May & Corbyn. They’re the Morecambe & Wise of politics. Only not remotely funny 
If the PM and Raab cannot sort out a clean good deal for Brexit, we are better off out with ‘No Deal’ and No Money to the EU on 29th March 2019! (£)Jayne Adye, Director, Get Britain Out.  
Brexit could sway Scottish voters toward independence from UK: poll  
David Davis promises to vote against Theresa May’s Brexit proposal.    
Based on previous "if... then..." Scottish independence polls, the country would have become independent after a) the Tories winning in 2015 and b) the EU referendum result. Experience shows that only what people say they will do now is what matters. 
Was always going to be the case. Their Scotland ignoring hard Brexit was always going to ensure that Scotland would review its constitutional options. Only one direction now.  
Michel Barnier 'strongly opposed' to May's Brexit plan  
Weekly reminder that Brexit is primarily a state crisis rather than an economic crisis 
Meanwhile, Davidson’s No Referendum Party is continuing to sound like a broken record.  
Tomorrow's front page: Major new poll finds majority of Scots would back independence in a referendum held after Brexit, if don't-nos are discounted.  
If Brexit goes ahead, the UK is over. It's basically as simple as that.  
Ah raise mah gless tae @ch_cartoon fur producing the best cartoon ever oan Brexit. Brexit means glaikit.  
Government have promised a referendum on this very issue in May next year - let’s all ensure we win it! #Act32 @sinnfeinireland 
Vote for meat we said and we showed you pictures of a juicy steak. Turns out it’s not steak; it’s raw donkey testes. But meat means meat and if you change your mind now democracy will fall. Eat it. #Brexit 
Global Britain is brilliantly placed to seize the opportunities of Brexit - James Rogers  
How much clearer can EU be? Chequers is dead. So therefore is May. Now is the moment for Labour to back a second Brexit vote. If @jeremycorbyn does not act, he will betray his voters and his country 
Join us at Parliament. United we can all STOP BREXIT. Tuesday 4th September abd every day they are sitting,  
Andrew Adonis - We need 1 million people on the streets of London on the 20th of October 2018 demanding a #PeoplesVote & an end to #brexit.@cambridge_stays #FBPE @Andrew_Adonis 
It's all very well asking what we could do were we not tied up with Brexit, but when you ask what we actually *would* do, the answer is more of the same. And that is why we have to leave the EU. #Brexit  
Yet another voice of reason. One of so many. But the PM still listens to the likes of JRM and the rest of the Brexit posse. She will go down in history as the PM who threw the grenade at the UK after Cameron pulled out the pin.  
Beware, Sarah. The ERG pledge you mention is the meaningless one. They will vote with the Gov to get Brexit over the line, then harden it once we are out. Focus on getting other Tory moderates to join you in backing a #PeoplesVote. We’ll need as many of you as possible! 
May, the Prime Minister, says "trust me" whilst telling bare faced lies. If there's one threat to democracy, it's this.Brexit has rocked our country to the core. For truth, respect and trust to be restored we must stop it and work to make our country a fairer, more equal place. 
A visual reminder of why a #PeoplesVote matters:1. The NHS is short of 40k nurses & 10k doctors. 2. EU staff are *already* quitting in droves.3. Brexit isn't 'saving' the NHS, it's decimating it.4. Democracy didn't end on 23 Jun 2016. A second referendum *is* democracy.  
She really has lost the plot if she thinks the British people will accept the possible loss of at least 186,000 jobs with her crazy Brexit plans !!...THIS MUST STOP RIGHT NOW !!...Brexit will only benefit rich Tories !!#FBPE #StopBrexit #StopTories 
Imagine a brawl on the bridge of the Titanic between those shouting that we should just keep going and hit the iceberg and others screaming that we should jettison the empty lifeboats and charge the iceberg head-first at full speed. Tories on #Brexit#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
As usual Prof @chrisgreybrexit spells it out as it is. It is nonsense the UK electorate can speak only once and never again. Democracy doesn't stop dead after one consultative deeply flawed Referendum.  
And this without any campaign! Guess what we can achieve, given the 2014 referendum started at ~ 23%! We can do this!!!  #indy2 #scotref #DissolveTheUnion 
Thank heavens this tweet has a date on it, because historians would have been none the wiser.  "Davidson urges Sturgeon to rule out holding second independence referendum": that's like "sun rises", "sun sets", "Earth spins on its axis"... 
And yet there's no legitimate report out there that says Brexit will make us richer. In fact, they ALL say we'll be poorer. And leavers are totally unable to tell us how our lives will be better. 
We were inundated with “facts” from both sides — and the facts pertinent to the question have not changed.Indeed, the only thing we have learnt for absolute certain is that, when both sides promised to honour the referendum result, Remain did not mean it.  
This is horse manure. Your own government's impact reports show that every form of Brexit will make the whole country poorer, disproportionately hurting the worst off.Get real and admit this project puts ideology over the economy, every single time.  
If you don’t care about the NHS or our car industry or universities or farming or fishing  or manufacturing or Northern Ireland or the poor or anyone with cancer or whose job depends on EU exports/imports, then I guess you could think Brexit is going well.  
Just for the record I want to clarify something @MarcusFysh said a few days ago “ we can export excellent champagne from the U.K. to Asia “ - one problem .. the champagne region is in FRANCE and not the uk .. oh dear - another idiotic claim from a brexit MP 
no Julie, *falling for a stupid scam* and supporting brexit that are the same thing, how are you this bad at understanding jfc  
Australian Farage fans get heckled and called Nazi Scum as they pay between £50-£166 to watch washed-up drunk at 350 seat Perth venue. 
Mrs. May called an election after ppl who voted tory in 2015 expected a 5 year parliament, she said no election when she took over, she called one, she lost her majority (haha) now she's saying no #PeoplesVote, thankfully #Brexit will destroy her and her horrible party #ToriesOut 
We must fight to the end but keep our options open. I've lived through a Cold War, the threat of nuclear annihilation, Thatcherism, the New World Order, the War on Terror, the sub-prime crisis & austerity.Politics has ruled too much of my life. I won't let Brexit wreck the rest  
In any case, if in the light of what is now known Brexit is indeed 'the will of the people' then they'll vote for it again. And if they don't, then it's not the will of the people. Either way, it can hardly be a "betrayal of democracy" to hold a vote.  
I do not pretend to be an authority on #Brexit, but as an outsider I would recommend...If the British people feel strongly that there should be a second referendum, they should assemble, march and demand it.Especially given the revelations of Russia's influence campaign.  
Momentum to take no position on #Brexit At Labour conference.No position on something that threatens to destroy countless jobs & livelihoods?On an issue that could enable Labour to bring down this abysmal Tory government?Pathetic.#PeoplesVote 
After a summer of Brexit illogic, are we now in for a storm? My Brexit Blog is back with a new post up today:  
Michel Barnier 'strongly opposed' to May's Brexit plan  
Can someone explain to me wtf Labour is doing with Brexit.When something is supported by the most odious crypto Fascists in the country, what more do you need to reject it. JRM, IDS, Redwood, Cash, Liam Fox, Christopher Chope, FarageWhy on earth doesn't Lab say #peolesvote 
“By the way, the British have a choice. They could stay in the single market “...exactly so ....Michel Barnier says he strongly opposes May's Brexit trade proposals | Politics | The Guardian  
British Prime Minister Theresa May has ruled out a second referendum on Britain's exit from the European Union, saying it would be a "gross betrayal" of democracy  
Good jobs lost...many more to go.  Brexit is pointless.It is wrecking lives and for what? Zero benefits.  
The inmates are completely in charge of the #Brexit Asylum; Jobs lost, Rights to be lost, National Wealth lost & with both a PM & a Leader of a so-called Opposition opposing giving the People a #PeoplesVote 4 a #FinalSay , it appears our Democracy is lost..FGS stop this madness! 
Labour has found itself in a position where everyone seems to feel comfortable making unconditional demands: IHRA with no caveats, Corbyn recanting his past ideals, a second referendum on the EU. We can’t operate like this  
Fact is that there is no majority either in Parliament or the country for a cliff-edge, no-deal, no-transition #Brexit Which is why @theresa_may has no mandate to inflict such radical high-risk surgery without seeking #InformedConsent We need a #PeoplesVote 
Tomorrow morning we release an independent poll showing Brexit will lead to a 52% to 39% majority vote for a United Ireland. A hard border makes the majority even bigger. But no Brexit and the majority swings to maintaining the Union. Brexit threatens Unionism. 
"The EU's chief negotiator has delivered his most withering condemnation yet of Theresa May's Brexit proposals, as he insisted accepting her plan would spell the end for the European project." #BrexitShambles 
How Brexiteers can still save Brexit. By Rupert Darwell:  
How often would you like to rerun the 2016 referendum? Every 2 or 3 years?Another referendum wouldn’t achieve anything - it would simply reopen an issue which is settled. And it would keep it open in perpetuity bc the losing side would have no reason to accept the result. Ever.  
The YouTube algorithm I worked on heavily promoted Brexit, because divisiveness is efficient for watch time, and watch time leads to ads.Brits deserve deserve to know what @YouTube's AI promoted by the millions during the referendum.Without transparency there is no democracy  
A Soft Brexit Flouts the Norms of International Relations.  
Do you remember the government saying that they were considering a ban on live exports for slaughter? If so, your memory seems to be better than the politicians’! Remind @MichaelGove to take urgent action for animals:  #Brexit #StopLiveTransport 
Dear @MarcusFysh,We *already* sell English sparkling wine to the US & Asia, incl. wine from #Cornwall's excellent Camel Valley vineyard.We can't sell it as Champagne for the same reason we can't sell red wine as Bordeaux.It's pretty simple, and won't be made easier by #Brexit.  
We are pleased to announce that the website for our #C4PV campaign is now live! Please take a look and support our campaign to let the people decide whether the Brexit being presented now meets their expectations. Join our campaign for a #PeoplesVote! 
I bloody love you @JasonJHunter - "Jason from 3 Blokes in a Pub Schools a bunch of Scottish politicians on Brexit" #FBPE 
The really important point here is that she held the election specifically in order to be given a mandate for her conduct of Brexit. And the electorate categorically refused it to her. We should be very clear about this. 
The demand for independence from Brussels is spreading with a new Irish party calling for their nation to be freed from the EU's shackles. Brexit is just the first domino to fall - this racket is set to collapse! Support us at  
This is probably the worst causality of #Brexit so far!Britain loses medicines contracts as EU body anticipates Brexit  
UK, which used to be lead medicines evaluator in EU with global reputation, loses all lead contracts with European Medicines Agency even though Brexit not yet happened.  
Describing Brexit supporters as flat earthers is not a good way to begin a call for a better political discourse  
David Davis Just Revealed Worrying Problem With Mrs May’s Latest Brexit Pledge. Look at this to see how she constantly tried to con the population. She is an evil globalist.   
Head of the German business lobby: “60 per cent of German exports go to the EU. Only 7 per cent go to the UK, and that share is falling steadily — also as a result of Brexit. That means we know exactly where to put our emphasis.”  
“The decision by the European Medicines Agency to cut Britain out of its contracts seven months ahead of Brexit is a devastating blow to British pharmaceutical companies already reeling from the loss of the EMA’s HQ in London and with it 900 jobs”   
The referendum has been proven to be flawed and probably highly illegal !!...So why is she stopping the electorate having their say with this drastic change of circumstances ?...To protect rich Tories from EU tax avoidance changes next year may-be ??#FBPE #StopBrexit #StopTories 
Whether you like Brexit or not, should the future of the United Kingdom be decided by a criminal act?Former @Vote_leave activist @shahmiruk explained it to @Femi_Sorry. 
Davis Webb is a hard worker and an intense competitor. I like him a lot personally, and enjoyed covering him professionally.But the referendum on whether Giants should have taken a QB was never about Webb. Those who insisted it was want to add some juice to the situation. 
I don't want brexit, i don't want trump, i don't want this stupid cold, i don't want white supremicists or mra's. I would quite like to sell lots of books so our authors can buy nice things. I think that sums up my mood 
That will be an excellent thing. First a proper Brexit, not Chequers style, and then an end to the evil attempt at an empire. Good riddance.  via @Telegraph 
Funnily enough, @yanisvaroufakis predicted we'd be exactly where we are on Brexit exactly a year ago - and also urged a 5 year EEA membership as a stopgap; 
A major breakthrough; the steel & textile workers’ trade union, Community, comes out strongly in favour of a new vote on Brexit. There are 20 Labour MPs sponsored by Community, representing working class constituencies in the North, Midlands & South Wales.  
The only logical interpretation of that General Election result - which Mrs May as such a champion of democracy ought now to respect - is that the people emphatically don't want a hard bonkers Brexit  
Retweet if you pledge to #StandUp4BrexitWe voted to regain our sovereignty and independence.Please share as widely as possible.#Marr #Brexit #Conservatives

I don’t believe you. The only announcement I am waiting for is your resignation. To date you have achieved nothing except division and insecurity. Brexit means leaving the SM, CU, ECJ and FOM. Not a fudged renaming 
YOU ARE a nationalist. But a spanish one. Don't worry! It is no as bad as it seems! There IS a political question in Catalonia that should be solved politically. But they only have police and judges. It won't disappear. Make a referendum and let PEOPLE VOTE. Be democratic! 
Was going to write an end of summer thread reflecting on where the Brexit process is, but  @chrisgreybrexit has gone and saved me the effort with this superb blog post. 
More lies Mrs Maybot. You know Brexit will only make the UK weaker and poorer, see own Govt figures.Your Chequers deal is already dead in the water. No deal will wreck the UK economy, where next?EU will not bend to your threats, you have no leverage.Time for a #peoplesvote 
When Brexit was exposed as a fraud, British leaders shrugged it off.  Now, as the total truth about Trump is revealed, will the U.S. shrug it off too? Same master plan, same Mercer money, same manipulation.  
Uncertainty around freedom of movement, a hit to the value of the Pound against the Euro - all caused by #Brexit is already negatively affecting football. Hate to think what would happen to the beautiful game if Govt’s anarchic #Brexit plans go ahead. #ExitFromBrexit 
Resign and let a Brexit supporter lead us to the next phase. You are not the future. #MayMustGo 
#Barnier trashes #May's #Chequers plan for #Brexit'EU firms must be prepared to disregard UK manufacturers once the UK has departed the bloc, in order to preserve other trade agreements'That clearly spells the end of the UK automotive parts industry 
Surprising absolutely no one, Brexit is shaping up to be an absolute disaster.  
After the shock defeats of the Brexit and Trump votes, the elites have internet freedom in their sights. This has nothing to do with fake news or ‘post-truth’, it is a naked attempt to cling to power, writes @JulianGlassford 
I agree with May and Corbyn. I don't want a second referendum. I want a new referendum on whether to leave with the deal or reject it and remain.#PeoplesVote 
Just doing this poll to ask you all this. Are you fed up the Government’s response will of the people on Anti Brexit Petitions on gov petitions? #FBPE please RT for a large sample 
Britain loses medicines contracts as EU body anticipates Brexit  
The more I read about #Brexit the more it feels like those firms that beach and then cut up huge ships to sell for scrap. Except they're eager to beach and cut up a fully functioning cruise ship with 65 million people still onboard. 
The decision by the European Medicines Agency to cut Britain out of its contracts seven months ahead of Brexit is a devastating blow to British pharmaceutical companies already reeling from the loss of the EMA’s HQ in London and with it 900 jobs.  
When will brexidiots realise we are ruled by the law not the mob. The law is coming for Brexit darling so best get your little head prepared for reality.  
Cheap halloumi people!! THIS IS THE TRUE BREXIT DIVIDEND. I mean, I know it’s £1.49 from Aldi as it is but imagine the sunny uplands of halloumi for £1.39. Bliss. It wont be made by Greek people and will probably be shite but still. All this and BLUE PASSPORTS TOO.  
I was just subtweeting the tories bc one of them is talking about how selling “naan bread” to India was a good reason for Brexit and now my inbox has folk accusing me of trying to implement Shari’a I’m tired 
blackadder series 5it's 2018. Rowan Atkinson is Sir Ed Black-Adder, a charming remainer civil servant working for a second referendum. Tony Robinson is opposition leader Jamry "Baldrick" Crombyn, whose running gag is looking to camera and saying "I support ISIS" every episode 
Britain’s leading role in evaluating new medicines for sale to patients across the EU has collapsed with no more work coming from Europe because of Brexit: How much more evidence do people need? Brexit damages us profoundly!  
The UK’s former Brexit secretary David Davis has promised to vote against Theresa May’s Brexit proposal, raising the prospect that the prime minister could be defeated in parliament later this year..  
The new Irexit party, is basically all the wankers I blocked during the 8th Amendment Referendum.....   
Just saw an unknown Lib Dem MP say that ‘ordinary people’ are confused by Brexit and need to vote again. How would she know? Ordinary people don’t vote Lib Dem. But how patronising to declare that Lib Dems know better than ‘ordinary people’ themselves what they need! Shameless! 
This and this thread - why do we not have people like this on every media interview on Brexit? You know experts, not just politicians  and think tank charlatans?  
The status of EU citizens in the UK remains at risk due to #Brexit. Despite PM’s announcement that they will be allowed to remain, regardless of no deal, how can we trust the Home Office to process cases fairly?  Remember Windrush? 
.@JuliaHB1 on #Marr points out that @theresa_may has given in to the #EU with #Chequers, whilst they have not budged.She also points out that by "giving them 39 Billion quid, & pretty much what they want, funnily enough it will unlock the deal"Truth!#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit 
Autumn promises more of the same, amidst growing volatility. Brexit has pushed our stable country to the edge of the precipice in so many ways. The only barely tolerable way out of this spiral now is for @UKLabour to switch and push for a #PeoplesVote. 
The emerging Brexit bears no resemblance to what was promised and looks like it would destroy jobs, harm public finances, undermine security and threaten rights. No wonder opinion is turning against it! 
Good to see more sensible moderate Tory MPs say these sorts of things. Come on @GeorgeFreemanMP  there are so many leave voters who now see brexit for the disaster that it is, are #remainernow and want a #peoplesvote MPs like George must be put country before party! 
The decision by the European Medicines Agency to cut Britain out of its medicines contracts seven months ahead of Brexit is a devastating blow to British pharmaceutical companies already reeling from the loss of the EMA’s HQ in London and with it 900 jobs #Brexit  
Brexit: The populist movement of the people that dictates that the people have no input at all on on the process, placing total control in the hands of the government.or.... #PeoplesVote 
Quelle suprise. EU boss Michel Barnier says he is “strongly opposed” to Theresa May’s Chequers strategy - which is already a dilution of Brexit. He fears the “end of the European Project” - for good reason. No deal Brexit just got a step nearer  
"We already had a vote on Brexit"Did we already vote on a completed Brexit deal in 2016?No? Then your point has no point.#PeoplesVote 
In 2017, May called an election to 'strengthen her hand on #Brexit' only 2 years after last GE.She now has the audacity to claim that a #PeoplesVote 2 &1/2 years after the vote in 2016 would be a 'betrayal of democracy.'It is absurd and she knows it. 
Can we SHARE this please to ensure the media covers our PRO- BREXIT protest?!!!@BBCNews @bbclaurak @ITV @SkyNews @SkyNewsPolitics @faisalislam @Channel4News @Peston @afneil @RTUKnews @WestmonsterUK @DailyMailUK @TheSun @BBCPolitics Read now:

RBS warns of no-deal Brexit loss of customers  
Cant think of another Government in the world where a Cabinet Minister rejecting his Finance  colleagues official projections publicly would last ten more  minutes in office.....BBC News - Brexit deal: Fox refuses to back Hammond's warning  
Very kind of Theresa May to worry that we might betray ourselves in a people’s vote. But I’m prepared to take the chance that we will be responsible, mature adults & not fall for the Brexit lies. Are you? 
The doublespeak of this Brexit government beggars belief. And so it continues. #PeoplesVote 
Where does this borderline pathological hatred of the EU come from? Nothing worse? Really? “Fox said he was behind the Chequers plan and and could not imagine many things worse than remaining in the EU.” #Brexit  
Stand up now, Prime Minister @theresa_may & tell us why another vote is a “gross betrayal of democracy”.How much more will Britain have to lose before you truthfully acknowledge what the cost of Brexit is to Britain? See quote on how disastrous this is from @martinmckee. 
The Brexit fanatics want you to believe there's no time to reverse things now. But it's not true - The Independent  
This is pretty much how brexit was sold as well...  
Brexit is like pretending gravity doesn't exist and arguing the ground doesn't exist when you're falling off the cliff edge. 
I will never vote for @theresa_may over the way she has acted over brexit.And I will never vote for @jeremycorbyn for allowing her to do so so easily.PS. To contradict myself.. I would vote for either if it was the ONLY way to stop brexit should either switch.... Yeah right. 
Politicians who suggest that another referendum would be a ‘betrayal’ appear to ignore the fact that - the fundamental principle of our democracy is that we have general and local elections regularly, because ‘the people’ are allowed to ‘change their minds’ - in a true democracy.  
Michel Barnier trashes Theresa May's Chequers plan for Brexit as 'end' for EU  
Britain loses medicines contracts as EU body anticipates Brexit  
Leaving on WTO terms was only ever the option for a proper Brexit, given the EU’s animosity towards us & their determination to make us suffer “pour encourager les autres”. EU is like the Soviet regime — building walls to keep their people in.  
Barnier delivers his most damning ever assessment of Theresa May's post-#Brexit trade plansHe says 1) He is "seriously opposed" to the #ChequersPlan2) May's customs proposals are illegal3) Her common rulebook would kill off the European project 
Fantastic to see so many people from across the East of England together in #Cambridge to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. I say friends Yes EU Can! And Yes We Will!  
@anneapplebaum is right. The US & UK need to prohibit anonymous companies to clean up political corruption & dark foreign money in their politics. Until proven otherwise, the Brexit vote & the Trump election victory appear likely results of dark foreign money. Illegitimate.  
i maintain this is a good idea! newsflash: young people like fun!! we should have a pro-EU event like the 'ship of cool people' for students! anyone with links to any uni SUs should look into having a Bollocks to Brexit costume night  make it about FoM, country-themed costumes!  
Amazing turnout at #PeoplesVoteEast rally: young people across the country will not accept this disastrous Brexit.#PeoplesVote 
May’s Brexit deal is dead - and it could take the UK car industry with it. Only ⁦@UKLabour⁩ and ⁦@jeremycorbyn⁩ can win a #PeoplesVote - saving wages, public services and our manufacturing industry in the process.   
We had a great turnout at today's #PeoplesVoteEast rally, with hundreds of people from all over the East of England hearing from our local and national speakers about why the UK needs a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal.  
If anyone was still under any illusion that the EU was about to roll over and accept Chequers, Barnier has killed that notion in one interview. Brexit, to the eternal shock of Brexiteers, means Brexit. #PeoplesVote 
'No Theresa May, Brexit without the option of a second referendum would be a gross betrayal of British democracy'  
Brexit is like being misdiagnosed with cancer and deciding to book yourself in to Dignitas. Yet, when you find out you're clear after all, you still continue; because you'd booked the flights and date and you must commit suicide regardless of the new facts.@dontbrexitfixit 
Ex-DexEU Minister who achieved less than nothing in 2 yrs (cos it turns out you might need to be clever after all) vows to vote against the only plan govt has come up with. How v Brexit.

Oh yes we do!17.4 million people voted #Brexit  
"I have the huge privilege of being able to speak to students and decision makers across the country, who are rapidly coming to the same conclusion- it's time for a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal!" My words to People's Vote rally in Cambridge this afternoon!  
There must be a referendum on the final Brexit deal - not to have one would be a gross betrayal of our democracy. But we can hardly expect PM Theresa May to be the guardian of our democracy when we see what has happened so far on her watch. #PeoplesVote #FinalSayForAll 
PM knows Chequers deal has been rejected by the EU. PM knows the consequences of a no deal #Brexit will wreck the economy, lives and jobs for generations. PM knows the referendum was won by cheating. Why the fuk won't she let the electorate change their mind.#Meglomaniac 
A new vote refreshes the mandate... so how can it betray anything.... if your brexit IS the will of the people, Madame May...

Brexit is 5000 hours away. #brexit 
After a summer of Brexit illogic, are we now in for a storm? My Brexit Blog is back with a new post, just up:  
Not sure what we in the low-carb community are supposed to do when confronted with this...  Succumb?  Resist?  Demand a referendum?  
Each side had a spending limit of £7m in the EU ref but Arron Banks banks gave £9m to Leave EU which he hasn't explained how he obtained, after numerous meetings with the Russians... and just look at that massive spike to Leave when it was used just before the EU referendum.  
All of this comes from privilege in varying forms. The idea domestic abuse requires a restorative justice approach. That xenophobia is acceptable. That Brexit won’t happen. That many will be okay if it does.Unchecked privilege, distorting reality. And nothing can change it. 
True patriots don’t just love the flag - we love our country tooThe country is called the *United* KingdomBut Brexit is breaking BritainPpl from Orkney to Cornwall, Belfast to Berkhamsted, Wales to Lancaster are all demanding a #PeoplesVote 
Some of these remoaners really believe that Brexit is some form of extreme “neo fascist” revolution rather than the views & wishes of the majority of the British people from  across the political divide.  We believe in democracy and self determination, they clearly do not..  
- Those that didn’t vote for Brexit at any cost, such as No Deal.- Those that voted as a protest at austerity- Those that voted Leave in the hope of more money and political attention for their depressed nation, region or town 10/ 
Proves you don’t need to be in a political union with countries ( which are rapidly heading towards a supranational state)  in order to trade effectively with them. As we thrive outside of EU I anticipate other nations will follow us to freedom and sovereignty. #Brexit  
Have they been listened to? Well, yes, apart from:- Those that voted for a soft EEA type Brexit- Those that voted for a Brexit that would make them better off- Those that voted for Brexit to make the UK stronger internally and internationally 9/

How the FUCK can you claim to be for a 'global' Britain while walking away from trading arrangements with over 50 other countries? You can shove that 'reason' up your arse, I don't buy it for a second. A bit of honesty at this stage would be nice - Brexit is NOT about the economy 
Theresa May has crossed all of her red linesFew now believe that she is genuinely committed to ending free movementSo Prime Minister, you are being judged by your action, not your platudinous wordsWith you and #Brexit, seeing really is believing

Brexshitter & abject failure @DavidDavisMP going on telly to offer his 'wisdom' about Brexit is akin to getting Tony Blair on to talk about making peace in the middle east.

Maybe the Brexit Politicians really are that thick?Always thought it had to be some sort of mendacious plot but maybe we shouldn’t close the door completely on the idea they would lose a battle of wits with a pheasant. 
Hello Britain! Today’s Russian troll pretending to be British in order to stir up antisemitism in an attack on the UK is “Margot Darby”. #AntisemitesForPutin #Corbyn #Brexit #ActiveMeasures #Skripals #THREAD 
"Theresa May says a 2nd Brexit referendum would be a 'gross betrayal' of democracy and trust."The #ChequersAgreement is a 'gross betrayal' of democracy and trust.It must be dumped along with the PM. 
Am I being paranoid or is this ad for French and German classes on the Brussels metro Brexit related?  
Really starting to wonder if the Labour leadership not unhappy about the AS row. Distracts from Brexit, provides a load of new enemies to blame plus drives out a lot of people they would probably like to lose. 
Yes. And if my party supported hard Brexit, I would leave it and join a pro-EU party. But then I have actual principles.  
Latest @YouGov survey from @peoplesvote_uk campaign shows 72% think it’s important to know the terms of #Brexit before leaving. Even among Leavers, 65% don't want a #BlindBrexit. 
On how Theresa May’s senior advisors didn’t just partake in the electoral scandal enveloping Brexit, but constituencies too.  
This was one of the most persistent Brexit scare stories. Now seemingly totally debunked. City jobs are growing not fleeing over the Channel.  
"Brexit is not in trouble because of those of us who oppose it. It is in trouble because those who are most enthusiastic about it cannot deliver the fantasy they promise."  
Michel Barnier says he strongly opposes May's Brexit trade proposals  
Friends! Brexit is the end of the world as we know it!Our SideWhiner speaks to Newsnight, saying that for happy shiny people, leaving Our EU is like losing their religion!And everybody hurts, e.g. the man on the moon who's near wild heaven.Talk about how May got a raw deal!  
This is amazing. Liam Fox told @AndrewMarr9 this morning that he didn't accept Treasury's Brexit forecasts, because “I don’t believe it’s possible to have a 15-year time horizon on predictions of GDP.”Here is the first page of Fox's export strategy published two weeks ago:  
Came across this by Salman Rushdie. Certainly explains some of the more venal and noxious aspects of “British Values” and  also Brexit. Or as Flanders and Swann put it “The English, the English, the English are best”.  
I am simply astonished at the pro Brexit bias of the BBC which has lost its sense of duty to be objective and independent of the policy of the UK government of the day of whatever persuasion. 
I'm 58 you prick - been a socialist all my life- seen it done it bought the shitty t shirts - he's fucking useless at taking on the weakest Tories ever & supporting them on their most damaging policy to the poorest brexit  
I won’t engage with Scottish independence supporters for the same reason I won’t engage with Brexit supporters: no one is willing to have a facts based, logic based debate that focussed on outcomes and consequences. It’s unicorns all the way down for these people. 
What the Brexit Secretary set out means a catastrophe for the British people - from public finances and jobs to British families. It is no wonder that he was hot and flustered when delivering this disastrous plan. 
I stopped listening to woodland animals' takes on Brexit after a squirrel told me the Irish Border wouldn't be an issue.

The Tories have made a mess of Brexit, as shown by the comments from David Davis and Liam Fox on #marrAdd your name to #exitfrombrexit 
I remember being told that during the Oxi referendum in Greece the country's press became so deranged that the country just stopped listening to them. A stomping 61% supported a proposal the media said would cause societal apocalypse. It was an emperor's new clothes moment / 
"The choices being made over the next few months will affect all of us for all of our lives"If, Andrew #Marr, you believe that, why is today's offering only people who represent one side of the #Brexit argument?It seems that you and the .@BBC have become the Brexit salesforce.  
In the future, Brexit Britain will be remembered not only as a suicidally deluded nation, clawing at memories of empire, but one which buried its head in the sand as it was attacked by foreign powers and failed to stand with its allies who were under attack tooHorrific epitaph. 
48% didn’t vote to jump & very many of the 52% thought it would be a softer landing. No one voted for this mess & there is no informed consent to a disastrous cliff-edge, no-deal Brexit. That requires a #PeoplesVote first 
This is what utter betrayal looks like. #Just when you thought the Tories couldn't slip further into the gutter,  the Foreign Office secretly plot to move the UK embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem post Brexit.   
Trump's WTO threats matter – especially to a post-Brexit Britain  
Theresa May isn’t engaging in doublespeak in her Telegraph piece. She is, for once, telling you what’s coming and facts support it.There will be no second referendum (and there isn’t time or political will). They have engineered a no deal exit (as long planned.)Heed truth. 
Dear Sarah, As a scientist, I just don't understand why all MPs don't "respect" the finding of the Electoral Commission that the 2016 UK EU Referendum leave vote was procured by crime - and call a halt to "brexit" RIGHT NOW. Anything else is a breach of #5 of your Code of Conduct 
David is absolutely right. I hope sincerely that we will #ChuckChequers and revert to a negotiating stance that will allow me to do what I desperately want to - support a good free trade deal with the EU that meets the needs of our country and delivers the Referendum mandate.  
The most important thing you’ll read on #Brexit. Bravo @AllisterHeath. #BrexitIsNotJustForChristmasEtc 
Conservative party donor calls for second public vote on Brexit  
If Brexit really is the Will of the People™, then a #PeoplesVote is not a betrayal, @theresa_may.If, on the other hand, it ISN’T, in the light of #BrexitShambles, then pursuing Brexit most definitely IS a betrayal.Have I misunderstood something? 
There's far too much negativity around at the moment. We need some positive messages about Europe & the UK's place in it. Who better to make this case than these brilliant campaigners, who will all by in #Leeds next week at the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference!  
Why is Govt carrying on as if the ERG & Corbyn’s votes aren’t set to sink the Chequers Plan?  This chaos is leaving the rest of us at higher risk of a disastrous No-Deal, No-Transition Brexit alongside a refusal to seek informed consent to such radical surgery  
We're all set up in Cambridge for our East of England rally - are you making you way down today to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal?  
.@LiamFox on @MarrShow sets out how @Conservatives will respect the result of the referendum and ensure we're a truly Global Britain #Marr 
Scottish independence is even more insane than Brexit, but as Brexit tells us, there are die hard fanatics who have a singular ideology with no actual thought to the consequences. 
17. The UK had better find a way to soften Brexit, improve the legitimacy of its democratic process, and improve community relations, as well as give people a sense of community (which is NOT attacking immigrants) or you will have people wanting to use violence to get redress.END 
9. Brexit means prices will go up, people will have less opportunity, there will not be as many foreign holidays, imports will cost more. Standard of living will decrease for a large number of people. Are the less stable in that cohort going to remain peaceful? 
Do you support young people in Northern Ireland rising up against Brexit? Please share and, if you can, donate!

How on god’s good earth can you possibly describe @DavidDavisMP and disgraced former defence secretary @LiamFox as representing “both sides of the #brexit debate”? Ludicrous bias from what used to be an organisation that was willing to challenge power. 
Don't forget this was an advisory referendum. It was May's decision, not the *will of the people*, as we may well guess as it is no longer the *will of the people* but still her decision. Except Parliament could override her. But MPs forgot why they are there, beyond getting paid 
Theresa May vows to STOP second #Brexit vote as poll shows 90 percent would vote the SAME  
Theresa May: There will be no second referendum on Brexit – it would be a gross betrayal of our democracy 
It is very odd that we had a referendum & AFTERWARD we became informed. It's easy to lose sight of how odd a lot about the referendum is, not least May ploughs on, not seeming to care if there were lies, fraud, withholding info, foreign interference, manipulation, disaster ahead. 
Theresa May does an awkward dance and people start to warm to her. It’s ridiculous. She instigated and covered up the Windrush scandal, used £1bn of taxpayers money to bribe the DUP and is still floundering on Brexit. Don’t let an awkward dance deflect away from the real issues.  
Hay #Marr, if this is your idea of balanced debate, why not invite us on? We are three fiercely pro-Remain cows and three fiercely pro-Remain calves, that's balanced enough right? Happy to talk amongst ourselves while you ignore the other side of the Brexit debate. Mooo.   
Factually incorrect. We are not the world's 5th biggest economy. We were at the time of the Referendum vote. We've since slipped behind France, whilst the projection is for India to overtake us in the next year or so.  
Can there really be so many worse things than continued jobs, prosperity, free trade & ability to vote on key economic decisions affecting us? Even analysis of Fox’s own government shows that Brexit will make us poorer.Fox is a zealot. His comment is indefensible. He should go. 
The more Theresa May digs her heels in, the closer we are to No Deal Brexit. So what would happen overnight to cross-border health care? In emergencies like my family have just experienced? UKG don't give a damn- Brexit is terrible news for Northern Ireland and they know it 
Brexit “Most of Britain’s problems are internally generated, and there is nothing about membership of the EU that prevents entrepreneurs from trading with rest of the world—indeed, the EU has just signed a trade deal Japan”  
Let me help you Carole. No one is going to investigate this because outside of your head there is nothing to investigate. No evidence of anything. You've spent two years freaking out whenever a Brexiteer is pictured drinking a Smirnoff Ice for nothing. #Brexit  
‘I can’t imagine many things worse than remaining in the EU’, says real-life Cabinet minister Liam Fox.Reminder that a no-deal Brexit will ground planes, block life-saving medical treatment, empty our supermarkets and crash our economy. The man is a psychopath.

NEWS! Weary nation prepares for yet another referendum after Theresa May categorically rules it out  
In 2016 @theresa_may campaigned (albeit feebly) to remain, she now is backing brexit (despite the fact she knows its bad for the UK) So she can change her mind but millions of others can’t in light of new facts!To me that is the betrayal of democracy!  
Why is David Davis, he who promised the magic Brexit impact reports that never were, & disappeared when the going got tough, being entertained on #marr ?What a disgrace. 
On train to Cambridge for anti-Brexit event now renamed ‘Gross Betrayal rally.’ The more we can betray Theresa May the better! 
Andrew Marr show now as unbalanced pro-Brexit as the Today programme. Having Liam Fox & David Davis today, & Marr saying this was ‘both sides of the Brexit debate,’ unacceptable @MarrShow 
'@DavidDavisMP 'A second referendum would encourage the EU to pursue the worst outcome in order to encourage us to stay in.'  
A masterclass in authoritative political rhetoric from the intellectual titan himself.3 years as Europe minister and 2 years as Brexit Secretary and he still has literally no understanding of either  
There you have it folks. That's the best they can come up with. Brexit means cheaper (and inferior) American feta and halloumi. I'm sure your average Brexiteer is celebrating as I type.  
Is Treeza really that thick?! No one's asking for a 2nd referendum love...we're asking for a vote on the deal!! #idiot #PeoplesVote 
Don't be fooled people may keeps repeating I wont allow a second referendum because that wouldn't be democracy. Its just to make us think she's on our side. Since when did she care about democracy if she did then she would leave the E.U as the majority of the people ORDERED her.! 
It would be a real betrayal of trust to deny the people a say on a Brexit deal which is nothing like the one they were promised. It is a betrayal of democracy for the PM to force a bad deal - or no deal - on Britain without giving the public the chance to have a final say. /4 
Remember this from Corbyn the day after the referendum. We'd have been in an even bigger mess if he'd been in charge   
"We are the world's 5th biggest economy. We are an enormous market for countries to want to sell into and invest in. (Other countries) want to have an open relationship with the UK."The benefits of Brexit are too often overlooked. V refreshing update from @LiamFox. #Marr 
When is N Ireland getting their devolved Govt back?What's happening with the NI border?What's happening with Gibraltar?What's happening with EU Nationals?What's happening with the £Bill for #Brexit What's happening with future trade deals?Anyone know what's happening? 
Every time I meet an EU doctor I ask them about #Brexit. Most want to stay in UK, but all of them have anxieties and are trying to future proof themselves with a plan B to leave. This is awful for them and awful for the #NHS 
Today’s latest Brexit shambles from the Government - plastered over the papers and on display on broadcast - is merely the latest panicked response to the momentum generated this summer by the campaign for a People's Vote on any Brexit deal #PeoplesVote /1 
So it’s 5 years of Ozil today then. In them 5 years people have blamed Giroud and Walcott, they’re now blaming Xhaka and the defence, also in that time you’re called racist, voted brexit and don’t understand football all this for calling out his bang average performances. 
And there you have it. The simple fact fact is that @DavidDavisMP just isn't very bright. This has been the problem all along. And people wonder why there was little or no movement on Brexit for all that time.

The standard defence of Corbyn - which I don’t accept- is there is nothing he can do to stop Brexit. What is the justification for him not campaigning for a #peoplesvote ? 
"How can anyone argue that I shouldn't have a say on this?"Harri supports a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. Agree? Please RT#ourtimetovote 
or a Scottish one. everyone I know in Scotland is furious at the way UKGov has ignored our position on Brexit.  every single constituency in Scotland voted Remain, and support for Remain has increased here since then.  we are being treated as a trivial little colony of England. 
"The point about referenda is that they are once in a generation"  - Former #Brexit Secretary David Davis on prospect of a second EU referendum #Marr  
Why is David Davis still a thing? He had two years to make it work. He couldn’t. Surely he now either admits his mistake in backing Brexit or he gets consigned to the oblivion he so richly deserves. 
Andrew Marr as usual giving Brexit, the Tories, especially somebody as useless as David Davis an easy ride. Why not call this show Tories on Sunday. Corbyn to me isn't sharpest tool & there's antisemitism in Labour party - but comparing JC to Enoch Powell unchallenged sheesh 
I blame Brexit.  
Brexit is now akin to the belief that if we keep sending money to the nice man from the emails then the gazillion pounds he needs help getting out of his country will soon be in our current account. 
Former Brexit Secretary @DavidDavisMP says: “The Chequers proposal is almost worse than staying in." #marr 
David Davis says he will join rebels to vote against a Brexit deal based on Chequers plan, and accuses May of giving Brussels an "open sesame" today on further compromises #Marr 
Britain can recover economically by reversing Brexit but there's irreversible political damage. UK's reputation for competence & rational govt has been destroyed. Tories will be blamed for years & rightly so.

Jeremy voted *with* the party membership against Labour *and* Tory plans for illegal wars and bogus austerity.Frank Field voted *with* the Tories, saving both Brexit *and* the May government from collapse.See the difference Jacqui?  
Brexit has so far COST THE UK ABOUT £100 BILLION. Here are some costs for comparison:*NHS: £120bn*MOD: £35bn*Hot primary school meals: £4bn*Education: £31bn*University fees: £18bn*Police: £12bn*Affordable housing: £8bnWe could have massively increased EVERY service. 
Have I got this right? The Leave campaign broke the law but nothing can be done legally because the referendum was only advisory. But the idea of going back to the people after two years is a gross betrayal of our democracy? 
Thanks Emma. I believe history and the future of the UK is on our side in deploring Brexit. I may not live long enough to see this assertion vindicated but my children surely will.  
Now even establishment Tory Remainers like Nick Bowles are calling the Brexit process a humiliation.  
I had a dream that May flipped the tories, backed a second referendum, and annihilated Labour for decades.I've never had a dream quite so simultaneously boring and terrifying. 
You've got David Davis/Liam Fox/Julia Hartley-Brewer/Jo Coburn all fronting up on #marr this morning, yet some people are still trying to tell me the @BBC is not #Brexit biased, fuck off, #PeoplesVote 
Brilliant piece from ⁦@DavidLammy⁩ on why we need a united Labour Party to take the lead and give the people, not politicians, the final say on the Brexit deal ⁦@BestForBritain⁩ 
I'm sorry but when the #Marr show is presenting Liam Fox and David Davis as the opposing sides of the Brexit debate we're far through the looking glass 
'Both sides' in the Brexit options appear to be the Davis or Fox. May I be so bold as to offer another......? #Marr 
Jeremy Corbyn is virtually silent on Brexit. The 70%+ Labour voters who opposed Brexit deserve better.The Liberal Democrats are the party fighting Brexit. If that's a fight you want to be part of, join the Lib Dems:  
BREXIT? 
German businesses raise alarm over Brexit progress"We need to be realistic, 60% of German exports go to the EU. Only 7% go to the UK, and that share is falling steadily - also as a result of Brexit. That means we know exactly where to put our emphasis." 
Utterly depressing tweet from @DavidLammy. Don't worry about anti-Semitism. If Jeremy Corbyn just sends out a single tweet on Brexit, all Labour's problems are solved. 
Labour has been pussyfooting around on Brexit for too long.The clock is ticking for us to save the country from this hard-right Tory fantasy, which was built on xenophobia, lies and a law-breaking campaign.Time for us to unite behind a #PeoplesVote. 
Britain and the EU still say in public they want a Brexit deal wrapped up in the next 7 weeks.Behind the scenes, though, senior officials on both sides admit this is unlikely 
Glad to see that #Marr features people on both sides of the Brexit debate. Those in favour of Brexit as well as those in favour of no deal. 
So there is a prima facie case for a Peope's Vote. To the extent, in fact, that a number of Brexit luminaries argued years ago precisely for such a two step process. They no longer like to be reminded, of course. The "you lost, get over it" mentality has taken over. 2/2 
Now that the Civil Service are on record for abandoning neutrality and actively working against the Scottish People during our referendum, and ignoring the Purdah, thats more ammunition for having another one without their interference on behalf of the Union. 
Opinion: If the Troubles return after Brexit, it won't just be because of the Irish border issue "The British government is removing essential building blocks of the Good Friday Agreement of which the nature of the border is only one element"  
Centrists aren’t splitting over Brexit, they’re splitting over socialism. Everything else is PR.  
PM slams call for second Brexit vote as 'betrayal of trust' and insists she will not be pushed around by Brussels  
Ok, look at it this way: 1975 was the 1st referendum (67% majority); the 2016 referendum (3% majority) was therefore the 2nd referendum, so this was in fact the betrayal.It was also vitiated by fraud, gerrymandering, cheating and foreign interference.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
Note to Carloline Lucas:Accepting the result of a referendum does not mean that democracy has ended. Refusing to accept the result of a referendum by insisting on reruns until you get the 'right' result is anti-democratic (and very much the modus operandi of the EU). 
If the Brexit negotiations had proved to be the ‘easiest deal in history’ and if the public had ‘come together’ in support of Brexit I wouldn’t now be campaigning for a #PeoplesVote. But they’re not and they haven’t. Plus I want the best for my country! 
First referendum: Irrevocable “will of the people”.Second referendum: “gross betrayal of our democracy”.They both cannot be right.  
May warns  the EU there will no compromises on her Chequers plan. Her Chequers plan is already watering down Brexit! 
Helped out on the Aberdeen stall for 20 mins or so as I passed on my way to work. Incredibly busy and great support for Independence from the Aberdeen Public. Brexit not going down well with the people of Aberdeen. One angry unionist apart from that all positive  
Theresa May says a 2nd vote would be a betrayal of democracy. No, promising Brexit means a trade deal as good as we have now, no loss of jobs, £350m extra for NHS...but then reneging on those promises...that's what you call a betrayal of democracy! #PeoplesVote 
Note to PM: 1. Democracy didn’t end on 23 June 2016.  2. A #PeoplesVote on final deal is an extension of democracy, not a denial of it 3. Our movement for a #PeoplesVote is growing fast - and with your Government’s chaotic handing of #Brexit, it will grow still more  
PM insists she will not be pushed around by Brussels over Brexit plans whilst being pushed around by Brextremists in her own party  
A Prime Minister who held a General Election we did not need - and lost seats - now says a People’s Vote on the Brexit Shambles she has created is somehow ‘undemocratic.’ This government appears to be dying from its own incompetence  
There IS no solution to the Irish border that doesn't breach the Good Friday Agreement, EU Treaties or keep Northern Ireland on same terms as rest of UK....   it's an impossible.   And also essential in the Withdrawal Agreement to avoid cliff edge Brexit.   A conundrum. 
I’ve always liked Evan Davis but above tweet neatly sums up what BBC news has become. Where once it would have held an openly floundering govt undertaking a failing chaotic #brexit to account it now sends out jokey tweets as if it was the Conservatives PR dept. 
This Valentine’s Day, take a stand and buy your own chocolate. For you and for teddy bears everywhere. #SetTeddyFree 
Making the case for a No Deal Brexit today means being on the right side of the major political divide – the side of democracy and popular sovereignty, writes Mick Hume  
Wanna know what the UK proposal is for handling customs after Brexit?   Alright then here ya go, it's very simple really..... 
The British people have been betrayed by Boris, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Farage & co who promised the earth and have delivered very little indeed. However you voted in 2016, you did not vote for this chaotic Brexit shambles. That is why we need a #PeoplesVote! 
PM rejects call for second Brexit referendum as 'betrayal of trust'. That's rich, when she's betraying the whole country.  
“The Prime Minister should chuck Chequers & stand up for Brexit" - a new Brexit plan by real Eurosceptic backbenchers will be unveiled before Tory conference. Now we just need a prime minister to go along with it!Support us at  
Theresa May insists giving a better-informed public a second referendum would be a “gross betrayal of our democracy” as she tries to push through a deal that no one voted for.  
Of course Theresa May says she won't "give in" to those calling for a #PeoplesVote. She represents the tax and regulation hating elite who know that a #PeoplesVote would mean an end to their dream of a #Brexit tax haven for the rich. #StopBrexit 
An advisory referendum made politically mandatory. An electorate gerrymandered by excluding EU citizens. A referendum corrupted by illegal overspending and lying. A government bribing it way into power. History will not look kindly on those responsible 
Resolving the Irish border issue is "critical" and "urgent," Michel Barnier says 
Surely it wouldn't be a second referendum - it'd would be a new referendum on the final deal with the EU?I don't remember voting on that before... 
Surely @theresa_may the “gross betrayal of democracy” & trust was perpetrated by those who based their campaign for #Brexit in 2016 on distortions & lies, not those advocating a second vote now we have so much better information on what Brexit will mean. 
Not sure that’s what the public think any more. The bigger betrayal would be to deliver a botched Brexit or a #NoDeal #CrashOut. If we can’t deliver a sensible Brexit transition that doesn’t damage the economy I suspect the call for #PeoplesVote will grow 
Did I just hear #Marr say he has guests “from both sides of Brexit: Liam Fox and David Davis?” He did say that! I don’t swear often but.... FFS! @BBC take a good long look at yourselves. 
Put into perspective what we could do with the £100billion wasted on Brexit so far:*£25 bn on NHS*£20 bn affordable homes *£10 bn on MoD *£10 bn on schools*£10 bn on mental health*£10 bn on children’s services*£5bn on police *free hot school mealsTHIS is what UK needs  
Theresa May’s aides have had talks with civil servants about whether to call a general election if her Brexit deal is voted down by MPs.  
It’s September 2018 — After two years the Conservative party still cannot agree what Brexit should look like. And therefore Mrs May cannot negotiate coherently with the EU. This is why democracy demands a People’s Vote.   
All this talk about a “gross betrayal of democracy” when even the Brexit Secretary can’t tell the people what they might face without breaking into a terrified sweat. Come off it @10DowningStreet. And step up @jeremycorbyn. 
It’s great that ⁦@NickBoles⁩ now agrees we need to #ChuckChequers but an EEA Brexit in Name Only half way house really isn’t the answer as ⁦Former Trade Minister ⁦@GregHands⁩ has so eloquently written 
‘Gross betrayal’ is a referendum won narrowly on a pack of lies by a group of charlatans in support of an undefined proposition - which when it turns out to mean impoverishing the country is described by the Prime Minister responsible as ‘not the end of the world’ 
I thought I hated Thatcher most, until May put me right. It's Tories I have a problem with. They don't create a good society for people  (in fact they deny its existence); they create things like #Brexit. Overall, they're bad for us.  
Mr Rees-Mogg still has not replied to my letter asking him what his so-called ‘no deal Brexit’ comprises. May I say, Jacob, that you are ‘gross betrayal’ of your duties as an MP? 
Her Chequers deal is a shambles but Theresa May is bang-on to say calls for a second Brexit referendum are a “betrayal of trust and democracy”. Let’s stop banging on about a so-called #PeoplesVote which is really a #LosersVote  
The PM says letting the people have a say on the final #Brexit deal would be "a gross betrayal of our democracy"But the real betrayal of democracy would be silencing the people over something that will affect us for generations. We demand a #PeoplesVote! 
We dinnae waant ony o' that foreign muck. Take back control of the steering wheel wi’ the new Austin Brexit.  
Next week in #Leeds we will be “Creating A Vision Of A New Britain Without #Brexit”. What great & ambitious things could we be doing to make life better for our people if we weren’t consumed by the negativity of #Brexit? See  for more. 
Mrs May clearly thinks Mrs Thatcher (her words here from 1975 referendum campaign) was engaged in ‘gross betrayal’  
Theresa May rejects calls for a second Brexit referendum, insisting she will not be pushed around by Brussels   
This is an interesting and troubling graph. It clearly shows that GB is pro Remain and always has been but was manipulated spectacularly for the 2016 referendum. How can this be prevented from happening again in a 2nd referendum #peoplesvote? 
And that's great.Now have a look at the guest list for #Marr this morning.John McDonnellDavid DavisLiam FoxJulia Hartley-BrewerAll in favour of #Brexit. Not a single guest on the list has an anti-Brexit stance, or one that's top of their agenda to communicate. 
An ALTERNATIVE plan to the Theresa May's Chequers blueprint is being stress-tested ahead of its unveiling on the eve of party conference.Brexit-backing Tory MPs are working on the benefits of a Canada-style deal & a no-deal scenario with policy experts.  
Have a great Sunday today everyone out there. Going be nice sunny day. Let’s have a day without Brexit slagging off FFS. Get out on your bike like me do you good. Go for a walk, go shopping, or go down the PUB . Or listen some fantastic music.

The #PeoplesVote is now @BBCNews top story and its gain in popularity requires a change of status - Brexit should now be referred to with ‘if’ rather than ‘when’ it happens in news reports. This is Democracy at work and has become the ‘will of the people’ 
Nearly two thirds (61%) of UK manufacturing businesses that employ over 500 people are owned by foreign companies.There’s a tragic irony that Brexit has created a risk of “bloody foreigners taking away our jobs” as foreign companies pull out of the UK.  
BREAKING: May vows to STOP second #Brexit vote as poll shows 90% would vote the SAME.“To ask that question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy – and trust” It's a shame you bowed down to EU's every demand, you spineless imbecile 
"UK dominates entire world in foreign currency trading" - UK does 78% of the EU’s foreign exchange trading. UK does 21 times more than Germany. Read our #Brexit summary  and brighten your Sunday!  
What you're missing is probably corruption. 1) The Tories are making too much money from Russian donors; & 2) politically, they feel trapped by Brexit. The shame & humiliation of backing down is too great. Ergo - the country has to suffer for Conservative pride/power. @CCHQPress 
'We want to leave with a good deal and we are confident we can reach one,' PM says. 'But, of course, there is still a lot more negotiating to be done'. Ah...butWe’ve already got the best deal, it’s called EU membership, and ‘we’ don’t all want to Brexit.  
German business leaders raise alarm over Brexit progress  
Sadiq Khan should never have been elected London Mayor. He is totally  useless & crime is totally out of control. It is basically a  bloodbath everyday & Khan is more concerned with PR stunts &  trying to derail Brexit  
Come on nick, your idea of staying in the EEA is still a betrayal of the #Brexit vote. It’s time to #StandUp4Brexit @standup4brexit 
PM May says Britain will not compromise over Brexit plan  
"Brexit is not in trouble because of those of us who oppose it. It is in trouble because those who are most enthusiastic about it cannot deliver the fantasy they promise." 
May writes in today’s Sunday Telegraph that she will not agree to a second referendum. Good. But she also says that she will not compromise on her Chequers Plan. We don’t want her to compromise on it. We want her to chuck it. 
what are everyone's favourite centrist conspiracy theories? think Corbyn voted Brexit, quoting the office is Stalin too me, Seumas Milne is the smoking man from x-files etc 
PM slams call for second Brexit referendum as 'betrayal of trust'  
Just saw #ActiveMeasures. Great view of the big picture. Fascinating interviews with @MollyMcKew. @McFaul , @craigunger and others. AND they mention the Russian influence on Brexit @tom_watson, @DamianCollins, @carolecadwalla. People in the US see the links. Hope Brits watch it. 
If Corbyn was the issue, the PLP (& definitely the Tories) would sit back & let him fail.It's because they know he won't, that even Tories are saying he needs to go!He's offering a solution to why brexit happened in the first place.No one else even has a plan. 
Far right..pmsl.Try concerned centrist citizens pissed at another racist murder of a German citizen by a pair of syrian and afghan gougers...The ultra left there too by chance,in the form of antifa?Ask why Trump,Brexit,Poland,Hungary,Latvia,Czech Republic,Austria and Italy? 
The Russian-backed, secessionist president of Bosnia’s RS entity: “Trump’s second term will deliver independence for the RS, I am convinced the EU will dissolve”. These are the kinds of extremists that have been emboldened by Trump & Brexit.  
Even if "only' 1 out of 10 people have changed their mind, that's still 10% of the Brexit electorate. Ignoring the change in demographics, that's over 3.3 million people. More than enough to change the result.  
Good grief , you haven’t produced any evidence other than you hate the referendum result.  
Ruth what about your constituents and the elected day job? Our party has been hijacked by ultra Right Winger's racists and bigots with finding from who knows where? #brexit is a disaster and you've found time to write a book? @bbcnews @SkyNews 
"Democracy betrayed by voting!!" Only in the far away make believe land of Brexit UK could this be a thought!!!  #bonkers 
No, @theresa_may. Calling a #PeoplesVote a “betrayal of democracy” is even more ludicrous than your dancing. The majority now want to #Remain in the EU, by 53% to 47%.And the public now want a #PeoplesVote on Brexit. Brexit is not the will of the people.#StopBrexit. 
Would a second referendum on #Brexit be a 'betrayal'? RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters 
Conservative party donor calls for second public vote on #Brexit.Interesting. His voice may well carry considerably more weight with this government than the voices of the millions of ordinary British citizens calling for a #PeoplesVote. 
Why is our government allowing us to be blackmailed by the socialist monolithic European Union. Australia needs its own #brexit from the EU.  
All of the top 3 economies in the world are outside the EU. After Brexit, 7 of the top 10 economies in the world will be outside the EU.  90% of future growth is predicted to be outside the EU.  The EU was yesterday’s solution, the future’s global..  
.@theresa_may Millions—EU27 citizens in UK & Britons in EU27—never had a first referendum even though we’re most immediately affected. Then you chose to make our lives collateral of Brexit. That’s what a gross betrayal of democracy, and a gross betrayal of humanity, looks like.  
Brexit: Theresa May says a second referendum would be a 'betrayal'  
Brexit Britain: Where the state broadcaster refers to as Remoaners anyone who questions the validity of a non-binding ref narrowly won by criminal cheating, stirring up race hate & the targeted attacks & huge funding from foreign powers. #BrexitBroadcastingCorporation 
.@BBCRadio4 at Midnight:@theresa_may has dismissed the prospect of a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal because it would be "a betrayal of trust""TRUST"...?!Trust in Politicians to deliver on their promises?She's deluded if she thinks she has a shred of trust to lose 
“Brexit Tories to unveil alternative to the Chequers plan on eve of party conference as part of #StandUp4Brexit campaign” @SunPolitics 
Whilst we agree that #Chequers must be dropped, we do not agree with @NickBoles’ proposal to “Confirm continued membership of European Economic Area (EEA)”This would be a betrayal of the referendum vote and serve as a backdoor to remaining in the EU#StandUp4Brexit 
I met a girl. We’ve got so much in common. I can’t dance. She can’t dance. I can’t negotiate Brexit. She can’t negotiate Brexit... 
Why I can no longer back the PM's plan and am campaigning for a Better Brexit  
"A gross betrayal of democracy"These are words and phrases that FUEL the right and the far right! FUEL anger towards remainers, FUEL anger that anyone against brexit its betraying the UKHow many time do you hear brextremist idiots saying shit like this?Shame on you MAY  
Credit to Calton Jock Scottish Civil Service"In the months after the referendum they expressed great satisfaction that their “Campaign of fear” had generated “fearties” in sufficient numbers so as to win the day for the Unionist coalition" 
Encouraging news for Remainers: woman who said there won’t be a snap election then called one has said there won’t be a second referendum.  
People say xenophobic attacks on EU citizens by Brits after Brexit are made up.I wish that were true.Today I saw a couple in Bristol who began slagging off the station announcer for his foreign accept.By Bath, they’d been arrested for racially abusing Spanish passengers. 
When my daughter was 6 she decided she was leaving home to live under the slide in the park. She packed a lunchbox with an apple, a Pokemon dvd and a feather boa. More planning went into that than Brexit. #PeoplesVote #FinalSayForAll 
After Brexit and in sole charge of our Territorial waters we will have insufficient patrol boats and air patrols to protect them. Another Tory  failure, thanks mainly to Hammond, first as Defence Secretary and then Chancellor, but not forgetting his cabinet colleagues. 
Whose opinion on #Brexit should we seek next? 
Sorry, but it’s wild that after years of grimness post-2010; Cameron; Brexit shambles (whichever side); austerity; cabinet resignations & sackings; NHS attacks; rail chaos; Grenfell; Windrush; Boris fucking Johnson... Labour are two points behind.  
Welsh Lamb from NZ?Scots Salmon from Canada?Melton Mowbray Pork Pies from Denmark?Hereford Cider from Normandy?#Brexit is for mugs. Time to take back control. Time for a #PeoplesVote. 
The only thing the Tories can now offer is a hard Brexit bad deal (which is rejected by large swathes of their own party) or a catastrophic no deal. Their choice to you is shaping up, Scotland.  
This is also true in Britain. Fighting to defend the UK against Russian information warfare is the job of all of us.The Russians did not start with #Brexit nor did they finish with it. They poisoned #Skripal and his daughter, and they are poisoning British politics. 
She intends to betray the first referendum hence no need for a 2nd. #ChequersPlan is a template for keeping us mired in the EU. It must be rejected and May MUST fall. 
A new legal challenge on the blocks & one that looks almost impossible for #ukgov to defend. If as High Court found in @A50Challenge case @theresa_may took #Brexit decision under A50 then that decision is unlawful after @ElectoralCommUK found #EURef2016 tainted by overspending. 
It'll take decades to rebuild our country from the catastrophe that is Brexit but if Scotland's gains it's independence that struggle would be somewhat lessIts beyond time that we took ourselves away from the continual damage inflicted by Westminster & stood on our own two feet 
Only one in every eight people think your approach to Brexit is right @theresa_may. The vast majority reject it.You're a pound shop dictator, and we resist your attack on our democracy.#PeoplesVote 
Apparently UKIP voters (who are more likely to be former Tory voters) and Labour voters who want to back a Party committed to Brexit and make sure the Party delivers on the biggest democratic verdict in our history aren’t welcome members - that would be a disaster for the Tories. 
Brexit Britain is escaping the sinking EU ship:  
Former Rolls Royce chairman and Conservative Party donor calls for second Brexit referendum  
Now @Jacob_Rees_Mogg's hard Brexit pressure group the ERG is working with Lynton Crosby to conduct internal Tory warfare. What will it take for expenses watchdog @ipsaUK to cut off their £250,000 in taxpayer funding? 
But breaking electoral law to obtain a result isn't a gross betrayal? At least we know why all the cheaters are Tories, they do so with impunity. 
#bbcnews So #TheresaMay says that allowing people to vote on her #Brexit deal would “betray democracy”.  New concept of democracy: avoid asking the people, even when what you deliver bears no resemblance to what was promised! 
The Prime Minister: I will not give in to those who want to reopen the whole question with a second referendum.And why not if a #PeoplesVote is the will of the people?Is the democratic process in the UK being well served?#UKEUchallenge 
Florida voters will decide a constitutional referendum in November that could restore voting rights to 1.4 million people who are currently disenfranchised because of past convictions. More with Phillip Agnew of @Dreamdefenders:

The people vs Brexit: a very elite insurgency  
The referendum was a betrayal of our democracy; to hold another one the same would be a gross betrayal. We need a new one where the remaining options are all tabled and we chose the order of preference of the options. 
Change Britain is a cross-party campaign set up to ensure the referendum  result is respected and delivered in full. We do not take a position or get involved in internal party political or leadership campaigns. 
Idiot! Economic superpowers don't need a plan B when negotiating with a weaker power. The same would go for the USA and China negotiating with the UK. And those are the 3 trade deals on which #Brexit Britain's future would rest.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit 
There will be no second referendum on Brexit – it would be a gross betrayal of our democracy, writes Prime Minister Theresa May  
The EU are giving their game away, they want to trap the UK in a customs union so they keep control of our economy & trade. A customs union deal is incompatible with the Brexit vote..   
Stand up now for Brexit and Britain, says FREDERICK FORSYTH  
No ambiguity in our Brexit position.It's a far-right project bringing nothing but pain for ordinary working people. We reject further austerity and poverty to areas that have suffered enough. It offers no solutions, only further problems.We're totally against it. Join us

Read the replies......  
An ACTUAL MP can’t get facts right on tariffs then starts having a go at someone about a pan European hashtag that is used to counter far right politics. Surely our MPs have a duty of care to know the detail of #Brexit and to not be rude to people disagreeing with them   
This is a non-partisan event. It doesn't matter who you vote for, if you've got questions about #Brexit, then this meeting is for you.  
A leading comedian and one-time Hollywood luvvie is against Brexit. Well that’s that then. I’m sure the 17.4 million people who want their votes to mean something once again will all change their minds in one fell swoop. When will these out of touch folk in London get it?

The people vs Brexit: here's Rod Liddle's take on the comedians, businessmen and others seeking a second referendum  
Yes, I agree. Though frankly: after #800DaysInLimbo I am not astonished about it anymore. If ever I were to decide to leave the UK, it would not be because of Brexit itself. It would be because of the lack of empathy and general apathy towards the situation of @The3Million. 
Why dont Brexists want a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal? Because they know they won't win 
Brexit is a deadweight holding this country back.Let’s talk about what we could be doing if we weren’t doing Brexit. 
Nothing says "disaster socialism" like the Labour leadership shutting down all routes to stopping Brexit because it's politically easier to let a disastrous Brexit deliver a Labour government 
Unfortunately, the British political system is such that in essence only two parties can exist. Both are now pro Brexit. I don’t know what the solution is but putting pressure on the Labour Party seems to be just about the only thing that could help 
A Leave-voting colleague was shocked to hear that we are having to spend around £500 on charges and paperwork to temporarily export something to Switzerland - in order to show it to a potential customer. That’s the profit from £5,000 worth of business. Gone. Just wait for Brexit. 
We're campaigning with @Remain_Labour for @UKLabour Conference to adopt supporting a #PeoplesVote on the Brexit deal.If you're a Labour Member, please support our motion in your CLP by September 13th. It has overwhelming support amongst Labour voters.Please RT

Theo,Why on Earth would you write a piece on future UK trade with Africa and not even mention EU’s EBA -which covers most African countries?!Surely the very first question would be whether Brexit Britain would replicate it. If not, that hammers Africa’s 33 poorest countries. 
I prefer this Stoddart: Nobel Prize winner Sir Fraser Stoddart... ... who thinks Brexit is daft & reckless. 
Conservative party donor calls for second public vote on Brexit  
Labour must reject the 'deal'; it can provide no certainty about our future relationship with EU27.  At best it kicks the cliff down the road to Dec. '20.   The people can only decide to reject Brexit NOW - that option is dead after 29 March 2019.  
Africa already well covered for trade deals and special trading conditions(EBA = Everything But Arms... zero tariffs on all exports - no quotas - for Africa’s poorest countries. Brexit Britain couldn’t go lower than zero)

As a democratic socialist Party, Labour Conference must debate our Brexit policy and Members must decide. Not the Leader, the Shadow Cabinet or the PLP.That was Jeremy's commitment, and on the biggest issue of a generation, he must deliver.#PeoplesVote

Sadiq Khan blimp demo was a pathetic failure: turnout of ±12.I guess bots can't attend demonstrations. Given they can't cause "civil disruption" either, I predict the cancellation of brexit will be an equally damp squib.  
Uk trade in wines to USA will probably be more difficult after brexit, since the EU has signed an agreement with the USA on wine  
The UK has been my home now for exactly 20 years. Unfortunately, today is also the day @The3Million EU citizens have been living in limbo over their #citizensrights for exactly 800 days following the EU referendum. Happy anniversary to myself and not so happy #800DaysInLimbo. 
Both @UKLabour and @Conservatives are on a hiding to nothing, of their own choosing. The party that overturns the referendum result will probably lose some voters, yes, but they will recover, while the other will perish. But if #Brexit goes ahead then neither party will recover.

If I am wrong about #Brexit then I fully expect to have the piss taken out of me. If I am right then I will have nothing but hatred for the rest of my life for those responsible for pushing Brexit through & those who have stood by & let it happen. I suspect I will not be alone.

Part 3 of the incredible @juniordrblog ‘s series on Brexit & the NHS. The NHS is currently 40,000 nurses short & 10,000 Drs down. Brexit is already making this much worse.  
In all honesty, while I do consider Theresa May to be a moral vacuum given her attitude towards human rights, I do pity her.With the aggression of the Brexit debate, she's stood squarely in no-man's-land as she's delivering a Brexit that both halves of the UK hate her for. 
Essential reading for those who want to understand the trade impact of no-deal BREXIT. If you haven't heard @JasonJHunter talking about the reality of trade deals the I suggest you give #3BlokesInThePub a try. Brexiteers are welcome although you may not like the cold hard facts. 
Please could someone explain to me why EU citizens living in or visiting the UK after Brexit require different rights to UK citizens living in the UK?  The UK is supposed to be leaving the EU for God’s sake, everyone should abide by the same UK law..  
I don't know how small an object the most powerful microscope can see, or how distant an object the most powerful telescope can see, but you would need a combination of both to find the doubt I have that #Brexit is not a fucking terrible idea. A good idea though is a #PeoplesVote 
Today marks #800DaysInLimbo for me, my French partner & millions of other EU citizens as well as UK citizens in the EU. That’s 800 days of anxiety & stress, our lives in turmoil, my partner losing his job because of Brexit & still not knowing where our futures lie #StopBrexit

Hell, the FBPEs who've (questionably) claimed their opposition to Brexit was because it promoted bigotry are now going to the mat to protect an arch-Brexiteer and open bigot and there's absolutely no mainstream consequences for them. 
MPs should remember that the Labour Party manifesto last year clearly stated that the party ‘accepts the referendum result’. Every Labour MP elected in 2017 stood on that manifesto.  
In Wales 2 more Labour GMCs, Ogmore & Bridgend, add to the critical mass of constituency parties calling on national conference to end brexit by supporting a people's vote with option to remain. @andrew_adonis @walesforeurope @bridgend4europe #PeoplesVote #StopBrexitSaveBritain 
7/ Then Brexit tell us that the EU isn’t that important anyway since 55% of our global trade is outside the EU. What they seem to have forgotten is that the UK enjoys preferential trade status around the world as a result of our EU membership. 
6/ ratifying by another 25 EU heads of state and they would want us to make serious concessions for a Free trade Deal. What is your preference? Open borders and entry to Schengen? Or the UK take on the Euro? I am not sure that the Brexit camp would want either of those. 
2/ Brexit say that they *think* the UK will have the stronger negotiating position because we have a trade deficit with the other 27 countries in the EU.This is a very insular and isolated perspective. 
Calling NHS staff. There’s still time to sign this letter calling for a #PeoplesVote on Brexit. Please consider RTing. Thank you   
I don’t recall the uproar when #JeremyCorbyn voted against the last #Labour Government 428 times? #FrankField #Brexit 
Those telling me they’re the ‘real Conservatives’ & there’s no home for people like me - suggest they read my @ConHome Aug 2017 article - ‘..our history as a party is much, much bigger than Brexit and Europe, and our appeal must be much broader if we are to win a majority..’ 1/2 
Really important point. Too many Britons are ignorant of colonialism, partition and war which wrought such havoc on the island of Ireland for centuries - and of the delicately balanced stability which Brexit’s post-colonial panic attack threatens now  
“It is no longer the Tories who are the Nasty Party — it’s Labour. Corbynistas’ smearing of Frank Field simply because he backs Brexit and is concerned about anti-Semitism shows how ugly and intolerant Labour has become.”Brendan O’Neill’s Sun column:

Why doesn't @BBC #Newsnight interview (say) Sir Michael Caine or Edward Fox – both of whom understand that #Brexit is primarily about freedom and who governs Britain?  
“You’ll still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit........” 
Had nightmares last night after reading a tweet: “Any country will burn if you set fire to it”. Sorry to bang on, but Brexit will strangle our children’s future. Let’s keep talking about why it’s stupid, unworkable and built on a criminal conspiracy. 
NHS people, staff, researchers, doctors, nurses, all of you! Please sign & share the open letter to govt to demand a People's Vote! 7200 signed...let’s get to 10,000! #PeoplesVote #Brexit #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #BrexitMadness #SaturdayMorning

Excellent, evidence-based piece from @juniordrblog on the impact of Brexit on the NHS workforce.  
Apart from the money, following the data was always the royal road to proof of collusion. And if this involves #CambridgeAnalytica it will prove that #Trump #Russia #Brexit was part of the same overall plan @carolecadwalla 
EasyJet is shifting pilots based to Austrian and German licenses in case of a no-deal Brexit  
UK, a cara,Please can we borrow your @TrumpBabyUK in November?Your pal,Irelandp.s. Brexit? WTF, dude?#TrumpinIreland 
Why did @BBCNewsnight think the views of an American lefty pop star about Brexit merited a national UK TV platform? 
“No developed country trades purely on ‘WTO rules’... It is not a model for post-Brexit trade, it is a euphemism for failure to understand the true value of EU membership”.  
I don’t care what Michael Stipe of R.E.M. thinks about Brexit. I’m not sure I even care what Michael Stipe thinks about R.E.M.  
Good luck on your Antipodean Adventure! Can’t wait to see how it goes and how many people come to see your thoughts on Aus and NZ after seeing the success currently being made of Brexit! Do keep us updated!!  
So the #Brexit deal is almost done...A deal based on a starting point that is unacceptable. It signs the UK up to ECJ overrule, separates NI from rUK and allows continued preferential treatment for EU immigration#Chequers is not Brexit #StandUp4Brexit 
Unless a “new centrist party” brings together sitting MPs from Labour and the Lib Dems and offers serious anti-austerity positions and a coherent anti-Brexit plan, there is literally no point in creating it. If anything, that party should be created after a GE, not before it. 
Dance Theresa May  Dance for austerity  Dance for Windrush  Dance for Brexit  Dance for little kiddies eating at foodbanks the homeless crying on our streets dance  for the poor sitting in the dark Nana sitting in her piss dance Teereza Sméagol  
But there is a very important point to be made here about the education of young British people in the true history of their country's historical colonial exploits. One can argue that Brexit is based in large part on a distorted view of Britain's colonial past. 
Yesterday’s Express announced that Brexit will return control of our borders. Do people honestly still believe this crap they are trying to feed people? WE NEVER LOST CONTROL OF OUR BORDERS. We can’t shout any louder. WE HAVE ALWAYS HAD CONTROL!  
#Brexit is a problem entirely of the UK's making. Until #Brexiteers understand this there can be no solution. 
3. ...The reality is that the problems of Nigeria can only be solved by having a  credible and all-encompassing referendum and ensuring that our so-called federation is properly and thoroughly restructured. Anything short of that means we are simply postponing the evil day...3/4 
This is insightful on the Brexit end game, especially re the Irish question.  Markets (and sterling bulls) should pause for thought.   
We already voted, look at this bunch of entitled fools telling the commoners how to vote again, which last time was a big part of them losing.The same commoners are still not stupid, the people’s vote is just a second referendum dressed up with some spin.#peoplealreadyvoted 
We voted Leave or Remain. We were told the result would be implemented. We were not told we'd vote Leave or Remain and then deal or no deal and then Leave or Remain again which is where this is all designed to end up. This is designed to stop Brexit entirely and everyone knows. 
An excellent read from @gavinesler To be clear: Brexit is not in trouble because of those of us who oppose it. It is in trouble because those who are most enthusiastic about it cannot deliver the fantasy they promise. 
I've written as much about Brexit as anyone in Britain. @tconnellyRTE is one of the people I read to find out what is going on  
Nick.. A Brit living in Canada hits the nail on the head.. #Brexit does one thing only & that is to reduce trade with Europe.. #Brexit just makes #EU trade more difficult & expensive.. there is nothing stopping Britain selling its products in Canada now.#peoplesvote #FBPE #LBC 
European Parliamentarians call for annulment of BREXIT referendum on ground that the result was procured illegally.

Reportedly the new applicants are staunch right-wingers who want lower immigration and a leader who is fully committed to Brexit. If true, there can be only one possible explanation. The Conservatives are being infiltrated by Conservatives! 
A new anti-brexit group and notably one with people who will be most affected by brexit young people in Northern Ireland.Give them support and a follow.Take a look at OFOCNI (@OFOCNI):  
If Brexit is such a good idea... then why is it supported by the most odious establishment people in our society? 
"Any new trade deal with Canada will be TOTALLY on our terms" says TrumpBodes well for Brexit then ! :) 
Today I am #800DaysInLimbo. I will have to apply to stay in my own home. My 'crime'? To choose the UK as the place to make my home and contribute to. Ever day. No EU citizen who made that choice should be left behind because of Brexit. Become an #EUcitizensChampion today to help. 
Brexit: Entering the final phase via @RTENewsNow  
On Monday Belfast City Council debates motion for People’s Vote to stop Brexit. Very significant - as most important elected body sitting in Northern Ireland. I could find no support for Brexit outside DUP leadership when in Belfast & Derry this week 
Yes Michael we do need to get it together. We have the evidence, we have growing public support, we should be doing so much better challenging shallow Brexit dogma.  
Who are the Brexit posse chasing us off the cliff?  
Blimey, full on anti-Corbyn from Andrew Castle on @LBC  this morning but managed to sneak in that Frank Field is actually at loggerheads with his members over Brexit (NOT Anti-semitism) and being held to account is normal in a democratic party (as happens in US with primaries). 
Hater of Brexit, getting on Twitter to join the online fight. Seems this is where a lot of the action is. Did not expect one of the first posts I see to be TM floundering around and bemusing some Africans with her "dancing". (Forgive the air quotes, this seemed legitimate usage) 
Saturday 1st September, 2018.It is now 103 days since my last interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation.#brexit#SNPCivilWar#DarkMoney#indyref2#Tory 
FORSYTH on post-#Brexit Britain"We Brits have ... Often threatened, never defeated. Often assaulted, never beaten. Sometimes knocked back, never brought low. And so it will be this time if we can throw out the weaklings, the appeasers, the capitulators" 
Trump says trade deals will be ‘totally on our terms.’ And he wants out of WTO Goodbye Brexit Britain  
All the centrists who were convinced that stopping Brexit was the most important issue of our age now howling in sorrow that Brexiteer Field has been ousted because of his views on Brexit tells you all you need to know about their real priorities. Their own careers.

United Kingdom: 'BREXIT BREAKTHROUGH: Theresa May to have Brexit deal ‘DONE and DUSTED by October’' 
So, while I was gone, Alex Jones was caught with trans porn on his phone, and I think there should be a referendum on all other Alex Jones tweets until there are at least 5 billion tweets about that. 
Would that this becomes a national referendum on who we want guiding our peace officers!  
They didn't have a plan B, because they didn't have a plan A either. In fact, they didn't brexit. It is the UK that brexits, haven't you noticed? It is not the EU leaving the UK but the UK leaving the EU. Furthermore they are far more prepared for whatever happens than the UK is. 
Barnier stands firm on post-Brexit border in Irish Sea *guffaw* 
Interesting that you choose to frame his words here on Twitter the way you did rather than the clear condemnation of Brexit it is.#BrexitBroadcastingCorporation#BBCbias 
Please “brexit” stage right! Oy. Lol.  
What's important is to remember that we're all fighting for the same goal. I stood as a Green in May, and I had more in common with the local Tory than Labour or LibDems. Brexit transcends party politics - we need to embrace and include everyone who wants to defeat this stupidity 
THIS. i know we're supposed to put party loyalties aside to fight Brexit but if you vote tory you're voting to drive me and thousands like me to suicide so forgive me but i kinda don't wanna be on your team?  
Pretty sad that these are becoming the dividing lines, even post-Brexit.  
Trump heads into a midterm referendum on his presidency showing no real progress on a core promise: to raise the wages of America’s “forgotten man and woman"  
"The race is, in many ways, a referendum on...Beacon Hill politics. Sanchez and his supporters say he can make a difference with the prominent seat he has ... Elugardo and the progressive groups lining up behind her say that’s a failed model...." YUP. #shakeitdown #itsYourHouse 
Devaluations do not boost exports GBP depreciated 25% after Brexit referendum. Result? Squeezed corporate margins with costs increasing and exports’ growth rate decreasing  
Me too. And I've invited my relatives to join me here, inlcuding my many illegitimate children. I'll need a big house to put them in, which I'll employ Poles to build. That will depress the earnings of native-born Brits. I'm acting fast, because Brexit means time is running out  
UK is not a homogenous blob. Only 37% voted for #Brexit. Half the country want to #Remain. We do not want to lose our EU citizenship & are fighting desperately to #StopBrexit. We are the first people to have to fight fork EU citizenship so we know how precious it is. 
You'd expect principled politician to resign rather than implement policy she doesn't believe in Instead May campaigned for job as PM knowing her task was to implement Brexit Having discovered Brexit is threat to UK she should tell The People it's too risky so it aint happening  
What do you think about the upcoming referendum on electoral reform? #ProRep #ProRep4BC #bcpoli 
He’s got to go 
Because the referendum needs to be respected. I voted remain but I support Corbyn unlike you who'd rather the Tories got a free pass even tho' they created this mess. You're not labour if you turn away from labour in this 
Absolutely! But where is the leadership in any opposition? I see the tweets as a follower but as joe public I’m not seeing any real publicity drive towards a People’s Vote and so many people don’t know or care! If we are to halt Brexit, much more is needed - come on everyone!

There is no balance in our media. Jones is a very small example of a left-wing commentator with access to the MSM. He has always acknowledged Anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and other parties. He is against Brexit. Just do some reading. 
Liam Fox said a Brexit deal would be easy. With no deal likely, he's diverting blame   
Brexit: on the magic roundabout - which way Mrs May will jump on Brexit is anyone's guess. Until she makes a move , the magic roundabout will keep spinning and the music will play on. What the tune will be is not for us mere mortals to know...  #Brexinfo. 
The benefits of a blaring brexit are clear, we cannot and must not accept a 'lucky' brexit!

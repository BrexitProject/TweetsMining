I voted to remain in #Europe & am very anti #Brexit.BUT the public cast their vote & there shouldn't be a 2nd chance.#Democracy is a responsibility & if some #Leave voters now regret their decision, tough shit. That's what you get for believing the media & @Nigel_Farage. 
Didn’t rate him as a #Brexit statesman, don’t rate him as a civil engineer 
While the majority of Britons have been, and will increasingly be, impoverished by #Brexit, certain lead Leavers have made a fortune on currency speculation, offshore havens and lucrative Russian deals. It's a heist, a hijack and downright daylight robbery 
Once #Brexit is dead (very soon), then we should band together to demand a reform of our FPTP voting system. Modern society is simply too complex and nuanced for the current two-party hegemony. It's time for proportional representation and an elected upper house.
Feels like the right time to put applying for an Irish passport at the top of my to-do list. #brexit
I'm a community pharmacist. I source drugs for my patients on a daily even hourly basis. Since #Brexit obtaining staff has become impossible. Many drugs are unobtainable and generic prices have surged so much it has already cost the NHS half a billion pounds
FFS, would #HMG give us all a break from this paranoid, stupid nonsense #brexit #hmg
I decide (vote) to employ someone to negotiate a deal for my family.If I start seeing signs the deal will be bad and people tell me I should judge the deal for myself, but I say "I've already made my decision", I'm either stupid or I don't care what happens to my family.#Brexit
Theresa May arrives in Birmingham for #CPC18 - ignores questions on #Brexit and the Conference app debacle. 
1/ The vitriol directed towards MPs opposed to Corbyn makes me fear for Labour's future as a democratic party. Democracies, whether parties or nations are not built on dogmatic unity and loyalty, but on the right to disagree, dissent & contest power and leadership.#Brexit 
Corbyn promises extra Bank Holidays. Theresa promises not only to bid for World Cup 2030, but also to hold a 'Festival of Britain' after #Brexit - inspired by the Great Exhibition of... 1851.They will promise anything - ANYTHING - to get what they want.#PeoplesVote
Peters writes extensively about his #Brexit app on Medium. Worth reading how it worked. 
The poll has closed. An amazing tunout and great result, albeit probably not what the organisers were hoping for.#Brexit

I am sorry did John Major repent, do a mea culpa over the terrible things that occurred to poor people on his watch-or is that neo liberalism thrives in this era because people have political attention deficit disorder. #Brexit 
As it is #CPC18 eve, let's remember last #CPC when the PM promised a #Brexit deal that was based on Lancaster House.Instead we got given #Chequers Do remember that Chequers isn't the Lancaster House Vision.  #StandUp4Brexit #CPC18 #ChuckChequers
Britain’s bill for #Brexit hits £500m a week – and rising 
Theresa May's Festival of #Brexit Britain is an inspired idea. It will do much to cheer our nation and distract it from minor inconveniences such as mass unemployment & food rationing.Fawlty Towers is proud to support the #FestivalOfBrexitBritain!
#Brexit costing Britain £500m a week and rising, says report 
A vital thread! Something we & others have looked at in the past, yet, as with other strands in the #Brexit #VoteLeave #Tory #Trump #SCL #CambridgeAnalytica #AIQ story the MSM have pretty much ignored the connection. Article below may help your research: 
Let's all hear the billionaires tell the hard working debt-ridden people of Britain to work even harder and stay on minimum wage while they deliver #brexit whatever the hell that is #ConservativePartyConference
Boris Johnson couldn’t even get a bridge across the Thames - a river that already has 33.Good luck getting one to Ireland - you total feckin spoofer #Brexit
Those Festival of #Brexit Britain highlights in full. 
Public demanding a probe after a report that British think tanks, advocating #Brexit, received lavish funding from American donors 
500 million smackers a week that's  what Barmy #Brexit is costing and we haven't left yet. 
As I couldn't get back to the Highlands in  time for the #SNPDayofAction , I had a great time in Alloa with the teams there - thanks for the hospitality. People on their doorsteps really happy to engage on the future - and see the shoddy way Scotland has been treated over #Brexit 
The European Union are effectively refusing to allow Northern Ireland to leave with their #Brexit backstop. It is a land grab to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom.
Clinging onto a unicorn #ConservativeConference2018 Time to face the reality that #Brexit is dead! 
Germans used to be in awe of British politics for their pragmatism&courage. Now they see a country lost btw extremes,facing a Darkest Hour #Brexit @welt
1. Time of a thread on this Toryboy dribble. The problem with a #Brexit FTA+++ ("with maximum recognition") is that the EU does not do mutual recognition where it has already has harmonised rules. it is never going to agree to an equivalence system. ... 
What Moniaive thinks of Brexit  #ScotlandCan #Brexit 
Jonathan @Freedland is on the money here.I also think it's a factor why some men voted #Leave in the #Brexit referendum. Very last thing those male leavers want to admit is their vote was a result of their own insecurities (which they'll deny they have!) 
 @KeithBrownSNP speaking earlier this afternoon on the #SNP day of action which saw canvassers speak to 50,000 people across Scotland about independence. #activeSNP #DayOfAction #Brexit #IndyRef2 @theSNP

We have allowed #Eton to destroy the country we could be, we could have become.It's a tragedy of a peculiarly British kind.#Brexit
May is Toast! #Brexit is Toast! The Tories are Toast! #ConservativeConference
Listen to the recordings & read the thread.It’s absolutely compelling imo.Wow Well done to the Canadians for unpicking this & holding people to account. Now then, let’s consider what our own govt is doing about itNothing Trying to bury it all. #AIQ #Brexit #CA
David Miliband and Sir John Major both call for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal.The version of #Brexit sold in 2016 is not on offer now.That is why we need a #PeoplesVote on whatever deal is available.
Not to be outdone by Theresa May's "Festival of #Brexit Britain", Boris Johnson wants to build a bridge to Ireland.Yes, seriously.Jesus wept, The state of the Conservative Party. 
Boris Johnson’s #Brexit plans torn apart by another Irish person 
FM Carwyn Jones tells PM to stop 'pedalling myths' on #Brexit.Yet his own finance minister sold 24 powers down the river without any reason to give Wales' backing to the disastrous project.Welsh Labour: Talk big but follow the same walk as the Tories.
ESA DG @janwoerner says he was given a topic for his speech “United space in Europe, United Europe in space”. Once again I feel ashamed about #Brexit :( #SGC2018
Apparently, pointing out the truth behind @BorisJohnson’s lies is #deeplyunhelpful !  Never thought I had so much influence!  At least it’s more than UK will have, after #Brexit ! 
The CBI is a grave menace to the political stability and economic prospects of the UK:  #Brexit
Professional pack-walker, Guy from #ReservoirDogs endorses the #wooferendum dog march.“The March on October 7th will be great & I’ll be there. Dogs are naturally sociable animals. A pack walk works every time. Come down to the march next Sunday & let’s stop the #Brexit madness. 
.@Keir_Starmer’s unilateral statement at #Lab18 that he doesn’t respect the referendum respect has killed @UKLabour’s post Conference bounce stone dead.Every time he advocates reversing #Brexit he loses Labour votes and seats and is effectively campaigning for the #Tories.
Hey, @ZacGoldsmith - it seems your constituents in #Richmond aren't at all happy about how #Brexit is turning out & want a #PeoplesVote.
#Bracknell view of #brexit. Certainly looks like a #PeoplesVote is wanted and needed.
No kidding!  The closer we get to #BREXIT, the more polls show Britain wants to #Remain in Europe #PeoplesVoteSent via @updayUK
Theresa May's "Festival of Brexit Britain" is a classic example of "bread & circuses". Or at least of circuses - #Brexit is not looking too promising on the bread side.When it comes to circuses, the Conservative Party has an ample supply of clowns.#FestivalOfBrexitBritian
Fantastic support across the social spectrum for a #peoplesvote #Brexit is rubbish costing £500m per week. Join the march in 3 weeks. 
DG English Scots 4 Yes and DG Pensioners for Yes were at the #MoniaiveBluegrassFestival today.  #Brexit is not wanted here. @boomersdgp4indy @EnglishScot4YES
The bill for #Brexit hits £500m a week (and rising). So much the the £350m a week we were told we'd get back!  #leavetoldlies #brexitshambles #PeoplesVote
Our universities and our scientists led European research more frequently than our population or economic contribution would have suggested because of their recognised excellenceNow this leadership,has been sacrificed on the altar of a pointless ideological ‘democratic’ #Brexit 
A bridge to Ireland? Anyone that's studied civil engineering will say this is a dream for those against a hard border. The cost of protecting this bridge would be massive.  #brexit 
The most socially harmful *gang* this country has experienced since 2016 are David Cameron, Boris Johnson & Jacob Rees-Mogg. All white. All Eton boys. When will the elite establishment do something about them?? #Brexit #TORYCONFERENCE
12) The final option however might be a lot simpler - the Labour Leadership just want #Brexit, and would sacrifice an opportunity to fatally wound the Tories rather than risk Brexit being stopped.After the attempt to squash the #PeoplesVote this is my pick
For anybody on the mainland UK who doesn’t understand the #Brexit conundrum affecting #Ireland, this excellent thread should help...
Mrs May? Mr Corbyn? Mr Raab? Mr Starmer? @metpoliceuk @NCA_UK Act. Do the right thing.#Brexit is fraud. The referendum result was neither free nor fair. Decisions based on this result cannot stand.You must #StopBrexit .
Tragically @UKLabour has ben lost to the far left. Lost for good as the Stalinist and Trotskyite vultures circle MPs supporting #BrexitTime for a new kinder, more progressive party which embraces tolerance.Check out the @LibDems
It appears that there have been talks with Spain for the past 7 months and that certain proposals made before the summer by Spain. Would be great  if more info could be given to the public here #Brexit #Gibraltar
Critical reading for@NadineDorries@mogg_jacob@BorisJohnson@theresa_may And anyone else too intellectually lazy to take on board that #Brexit will be very bad for Britain and absolutely disastrous for Ireland.
I'd be more nervous, but @ajcdeane again rationally suggests we just need to get over the #Brexit line in March.The real threat to Brexit comes from those seeking another vote to overturn the result. The rest is mere detail.#Dateline Clip 2/2
People talk about #Brexit like it's the end of the world but it isn't! That comes after Brexit.

Boris Johnson“Unlike the Prime Minister I campaigned for #Brexit. Unlike the Prime Minister I fought for this. I believe in it. I think it’s the right thing for our country and I think that what is happening now is, alas, not what people were promised in 2016”#StandUp4Brexit
Food and drink imports to the UK could be hit with tariffs of £9.3 billion pounds a year, lifting supermarket prices, if the country crashes out of the European Union without a deal, according to a study.#indyref2 #brexit #DissolveTheUnion
#Brexit is set for 11PM GMT on Friday 29th of March 2019.
@UKLabour are pursuing a dangerous fantasy just like @Conservatives are with their suicidal #brexit. It’s the country that suffers and we may never recover from this ludicrous political game playing.
#RuleBritannia? 6 Months to go before #Brexit & it's still anyone's guess what it will look like.  @lily_martin @CBCJaredThomas and I try to explain for @CBCTheNational #CBCNews
EU branded THIEVES for forcing austerity on Italy: It's what they do!Matteo Salvini: "Be calm Mr President!Years of budgets imposed by EU have made our public debt explode...Finally we are changing course & betting on the future & on growth"#Brexit #EU
14) It literally does not get any better for an opposition - and the narrative of corruption, illegality, opaque funding & foreign influence would have been a powerful attack on the ToriesBut it would also have undermined #Brexit, and we can't have thatend/
13) However, to answer that regular question "but what can Labour do about #Brexit, the Tories are in charge?"They could have done this - highlighted all of the dodgy dealing & funding, *without explicitly opposing Brexit*"we respect the result but look at this scandal!"
For too many people the outcome of #Brexit LITERALLY means life or death, and that is the unacceptable truth that is about to become reality. By supporting this you are condoning sentencing people to DEATH - #ProjectFact #BrexitDeathSentence #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #FinalSay
Even moderate @UKLabour MPs are claiming that #Lab18 was positive. I think they are in complete denial about just how bad the hard-left rhetoric, flag-waving, #Brexit confusion, police minders and plans to ‘democratise’ the media actually look.
2016 the PEOPLE voted decisively for a 2nd indy referendum given #brexitThe PEOPLE returned an #SNP Govt & a majority pro-indy parliament2 yrs ago we said YES to #indyref2 in the event of #Brexit & we meant it!It's time Tories pet jocks listened#DissolveTheUnion #Scotref

We’ve had a technical issue with #Democracy since the 23rd June 2016. We are investigating it thoroughly after 2 years of lies, scandal & infighting in the #Tory party. Stopping #Brexit with a #PeoplesVote will fix this issue & normal Democratic device will resume.
And here is today’s Brexit board from the #MoniaiveBluegrassFestival No doubt about it - #Brexit is not wanted here. Thanks to a great combined team of DG English Scots for Yes and Dgp4indy  
Despite my differences with @ChrisLeslieMP on #brexit. I cannot understand how any @UKLabour members could take from #Lab18 that our priority is to attack or remove Labour MPs. That will only divide and weaken us.
If you ever wondered what you’d do in 1930’ s Germany , you’re doing it now . If you’re not terrified , you’re not paying attention. #Brexit #Remain #PeoplesVote

Today I'm pretty much, no let me be 100% clear, I am a deeply unhelpful filthy remainer. I'm a patriotic democrat whose only crime is to be guilty of reason & the rejection of lies. Oh, & I believe any #Brexit will be a national disaster so I think we deserve a #PeoplesVote

The people who bought #Brexit: American donors are giving money to US fundraising bodies that pass the donations to four thinktanks in Britain. A Guardian analysis has established that $5.6m (£4.3m) has been donated to these US entities since 2008.

The beginnings of the far right US infiltration of UK politics which led to Bannon, Mercer, #CambridgeAnalytica and #Brexit begin around here. Same shady money and transatlantic alliances (HT @NarcAware)  
Yes, hopeful - but as always McDonnell omits to mention #Brexit. The evidence of wrongdoing and dodgy dealing affecting the referendum is mounting, but @UKLabour continue their blinkered path, focusing only on party politics #StopBrexit
Worried about your residency status after #Brexit? Pop a postcard to Mrs May c/o the ICC Birmingham and ask her what she’ doing to protect you in a NoDeal. Be quick. A million postcards would be a story.

Macron is another generic "progressive" globalist - very much part of the euro-elite groupthink who vomit empty virtue signalling slogans into the international domain. #Brexit is an attempt to reclaim politics for ourselves and snatch it away from the dead hand of technocracy. 
Throughout my 3 years in parliament I have always been deeply impressed by @chrisleslieMP. His forensic attacks on the Tories in the chamber always leave them reeling, and he’s playing a pivotal role in exposing the incompetence of the govt on #Brexit.
Clearly Blantyre prefers #independence over #Brexit ! Even @scottishlabour supporters were telling us that #BrexitShambles is bad for Scotland and that independence is a better route. Great to have @haughey_clare and @CllrChalmersSNP at our stall today
Campaigning with @Maryhill_SNP in Springburn. Strong Indy support. People switching Labour to SNP mentioning #Brexit as reason #ActiveSNP

LISTEN: Conservative MP Heidi Allen announces her support for a People's Vote, sharing why it's fair for the British public to have a say on the final #Brexit deal 
Of all the baseless claims made by @VoteLeave - the most infamous and dangerous was '£350 million more per week for the NHS'The truth is that #Brexit could finish the #NHS, not save it.You can't fight for the NHS and not fight against Brexit. Please follow @NHSvBrexit

EEA (or thereabouts) wdnt unite the Conservative Party. "SuperCanada" wdnt either. I used to be an optimist about ppl in the party coming together to move beyond #Brexit. Maybe it's just b/c we are still in the thick of negotiations, but that optimism is fast failing. Dejecting.

#Brexit is not about the terms of any trade deal. It’s much more important than that. But our democracy has been subordinated to the wishes of commercial corporations who want to flood this country with even cheaper labour, and whose primary duty is to their shareholders.

#Brexit threatens the #GFA - that is the biggest issue, far greater than the wider socio-economic disaster that will be foisted on Ireland but a terrible decision fueled the by lies of a nasty leave campaign
The same MPs who were elected under a manifesto to deliver #Brexit, who voted for Art50 & the EU Withdrawal Bill? Those MPs @DrPhillipLeeMP (including you)? Most in the electorate are angry over this anti-UK /anti-democratic stance.#StandUp4Brexit - Back #PlanAPlus (Canada)

Toyota has no evidence that there would be major border delays if "no deal" #Brexit. So scaremongering. Moreover, Toyota should know that even under Chequers there would be a customs border as UK is leaving the Customs Unoin. 
The Brexeratti are self serving, racketeering, pretentious, fantasists and fraudsters. Their snake oil #Brexit was a sham from the beginning, they 'won' only by cheating and breaking the law. They are faux Patriots and charlatans, consumed by their own make-believe blether.

1. #Brexit: how likely a 2nd EU Ref?I'd dispute the Labour position. My sense is of a membership & voters + Starmer wanting it but Corbyn et CABal anti a #PeoplesVote & esp a #Remain option.Disgraceful MPs accept 51.8% to leave but not 54% to #StopBrexit

How is a blowhard Brexiter as spectacularly dishonest as Lord Digby Jones not just allowed to get away with it but actively abetted by John Humphrys of #r4today?Decent @BBCNews journalists must be hanging their heads in shame at what this is doing to @BBC's reputation.#Brexit

To all filthy cave dwelling unhelpful #Remainers, more & more people are waking up to the truth that any #Brexit deal will be a national disaster. You are my inspiration & strength to carry on. See you in London on 20th October. We deserve a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain
Dear Mrs May @theresa_may, here is your periodic reminder that you said we are better, safer, stronger in. I think so too. Any #Brexit is going to be a national disaster. Give the people a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain.
Leave EU can't handle the fact that people have wised up to the #Brexit shitfest & are changing their minds. Now they know the promises are undeliverable & that any deal is going to be a national disaster. They're shit scared of a democratic #PeoplesVote, shit scared of democracy
The absurdity of such a statement! Give people - many of them very hardpressed - an opportunity not to get into this ‘difficult situation’ of #Brexit - by choosing to #Remain#FinalSay #PeoplesVote #ExitFromBrexit
Brilliant dissection of #brexit & why this utter madness will diminish the UK & Ireland. There is no solution for the @BorderIrish -if there was we would have sorted it by now. The Good Friday agreement transformed Ireland. History will not be kind to @BorisJohnson et al.
Salzburg was NOT a #Brexit summit. May was told WEEKS beforehand that 'Chequers' was unworkable. A hissy fit is not generally a wise negotiating tactic. May is just seeking excuses so that she can crash us out of the EU without a deal. Tax haven UK with little regulation beckons.
Ah lads, stop with the conspiracy theories and work out a #Brexit deal 
That would be cos he is a statesman with great political integrity...unlike most of the charlatans from right & left who are forcing this invalid #Brexit upon an increasingly unwilling majority w/o gaining Confirmatory Consent.#PeoplesVote for a #FinalSay with a #Remain option
Boris Johnson can reverse the position he held as Foreign Secretary and his previous support for EU membership. But ordinary people can't have a #PeoplesVote. One rule for the elite, another for the rest of us. #Brexit
Be honest, wouldn't it be hilarious if #Brexit was stopped in its insane tracks by Strabane/Lifford, Muff and @PatricKielty?
Actors @StephenMangan & Stephen Beresford are among the celebrities who will be joining/supporting our #Wooferendum march on 7 Oct. Stephen Mangan, you don't need a dog but we will bring you a floppy-haired pooch for you if you like #StopBrexit #Brexit 
This is exceptional, and essential reading for all who don’t understand the potential consequences of #Brexit for the island of Ireland. Oh, and an elegant  to @BorisJohnson. #PeoplesVote 
My friend who doesn't do politics says:"Now I want another referendum. We'd vote Remain because that would put an end to this stupid mess. We'd stay in the EU & just get on with life like we used to. The EU never did us any harm but #Brexit has without even happening."#r4today
See @BorisJohnson eviscerated in 20 tweets by @PatricKielty.One of these two men is a comedian...He's the one more politically astute than the #MemberOfParliament he is #schooling on NI politics, #Brexit and the #GFA. Well done, sir. I hope he listens.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
John Curtice:"neither side in the #Brexit debate has secured any ‘momentum’ so far as the balance of public opinion is concerned – and any claims to the contrary made by protagonists on either side .. should be regarded with considerable scepticism"
There is probably more people now that want a #brexit referendum than before the #brexit referendum. Think about it.
Guess who has been pumping millions into the right wing think tanks that BoJo and the other Brexit clowns are using to draw up their #Brexit plans to make us Trump's lap dog? #StopBrexit
The Johnson "plan" is a profoundly unserious proposal. It attempts to rewrite the framework already agreed, ditching the NI backstop in favour of an ill-defined an undeliverable fudge that the EU could never agree to. It fails the most basic test. #Brexit
The Tory party is in a shambles, and quite rightly they should be blamed for the ridiculous #Brexit disasterIt is somewhat depressing however after the highs of last week that the Labour Leadership want to go so against their membership and enable it
Thousands of volunteers will be out engaging with their local communities tomorrow (Sat 29th) on the importance of having a People's Vote on the final #Brexit deal.Help us to spread the word even further tomorrow by retweeing our grassroots campaign pictures from #PeoplesVote
Absolute pleasure to meet @Andrew_Adonis of @UKLabour today in Derry. A keen advocate and campaigner for a second Brexit referendum and @OFOCBrexit One of the few voices of reason among UK politicians who realises the uncertainty #Brexit poses for Ireland 
Problem for PM is she hitched herself to wrong policy!We’re at end of negotiation that's been very weakly conducted on basis Treasury & Govt never really accepted we are Leaving #EUWhere you don’t really Leave because they're so scared of Leaving#Brexit
The M62 is a shit storm of epic proportions, I’d rather follow Theresa May’s #brexit plans then deal with this garbage.
Wonder how longer the people of Scotland are going to put up with this #Brexit catastrophe?

Labour MP Ronnie Campbell - "Outside, when I speak to people, they don’t say they are changing their minds.“I got one card last week, saying we should have a People’s Vote, one card. That is all I have had." #Brexit 
Tomorrow's #RoguesGallery cartoon, after #WinslowHomer, for @Independent ... #BorisJohnson #TheresaMay #SuperCanada #Brexit 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "It is really important #Brexit delivers for the people who are the least well off. It about lifting tariffs."Food, clothing and footwear are the most heavily tariffed items that come in. Cutting those costs will be good for the least well off." 
The people who tell you that a no-deal #Brexit is nothing to fear are the same people who told you that the EU would fall over itself to give the UK everything it asked for.They were lying to you then. They’re lying to you now.
Poor @terrychristian He’s like a Poundland Chris Evans & he spends his life:Crying, whining & bitchingUrging employers to sack or punish #Brexit votersNormalising hatred & intoleranceTweeting #FBPE bollocksHow grim it must be to be a nasally, petulant pessimist like that pic.twitter.com/rzw9OimRTR
Join us on October 20th to form a massive @UKLabour bloc at the March for the Future. The Tories' Brexit negotiations are falling apart. We'll be marching on parliament to demand a public vote on the #Brexit deal. Join us. #StopToryBrexit
“It may have fallen to #Corbyn to save the country” from #Brexit, says @martinkettle :
Lt-Gen Riley hits the target.  We and @VeteransBritain have independently assessed the threat as severe, based on our respective research.  We must NOT leave our troops behind on the post-Brexit battlefield.Distinctive #Brexit research & news daily: 
This old video of Neil Kinnock is circulating. Warning of how impossible promises lead to stubborn dogma, leading to chaos - which leads to destruction of people’s jobs and services.Good summary of where #Brexit is taking us. 
I've said it before; the weans of Ireland understand the EU better than the British Gov and official opposition. #Brexit 
They say a #PeoplesVote will exacerbate division.If #Brexit is forced through against the will of the majority, after a gerrymandered referendum perverted by foreign interference, industrial scale lying, hate propaganda and electoral crime that won't cause further division....
Great to meet Lord @Andrew_Adonis when he visited the city today to give a talk on #Brexit. Was delighted to be able to invite him to the Mayors Parlour in the Guildhall & interesting to hear his views on why he thinks the public have a say on the final Brexit deal.#PeoplesVote
Someone just seriously said to me 'We won't run out of food, there will be emergency food drops' - like #Brexit is some sort of fucking humanitarian crisis instead of the self-inflicted nightmare it actually is. There's no war or famine, why the FUCK is this ok? #Raging #FinalSay
The clock is ticking until Jean Claude Juncker will claim that the Ryder Cup victory (if it happens) is a victory for the #EU.  Doubtless if the USA win he will blame #Brexit.

There are @peoplesvote_uk events all over the country tomorrow (Sat) Open the link to find out where there is one near you, and join the winning fight for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal: 
"#Brexit will be a disaster for LGBTI people - we demand a #PeoplesVote." Great to have the support of @gaystarnews. See you at the #PeoplesVoteMarch: 
Dear @MichelBarnier, while I fully respect your decision, @EPP will be missing out on an excellent candidate for #Spitzenkandidat. I praise your commitment & sense of duty and I’m convinced that you will conclude #Brexit negotiations in a  successful & professional manner.
#NoDeal is a bad deal for science. Science needs a #Brexit deal that:Keeps scientists in the UK.Keeps access to money and networks.Maintains regulatory alignment.Read our fact sheet for more information 
. @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is either utterly ignorant or a shameless liar. Opinion polls have consistently shown a Remain majority. The reality is that it is a tiny tax and regulation-hating elite minority who are now driving #Brexit. #LeaveLies are perverting our democracy.#PeoplesVote
As Tories head for conf their self-absorption, arrogance & delusion is staggering. They drag country in 2 #Brexit abyss & we see headteachers, police chiefs & bus leaders protesting cuts & mismanagement. No wonder TM fears election. Soon 2 follow Cameron into the wilderness #FBPE
1971 Briefing paper acknowledges Britain would in time become little more than a puppet state of Brussels.Line after line, the faceless Whitehall mandarins behind the astonishing briefing paper FCO 30/1048 actively WELCOME Britain’s decline...#Brexit #EU
If securing a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement with the EU sounds too good to be true, that’s because expectations were set far too low to begin with. It would be madness to squander this #Brexit opportunity!
Plenty of high profile support for the excellent @news2dayRTE explainer by @RTENewsPaulC on #BrexitWestminster are you watching?
Avoiding a #Brexit no-deal won't be easy, but it can still be done. Here's this week's #ScotlandinEurope update
Andy, get yourself elected to Parliament. Otherwise shut up, piss off back to Belize, and stop helping Putin and Trump screw up our country. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
Whitehall thinks Britain should be ruled from Brussels!Briefing paper hidden for 50yrs acknowledges Britain would in time become little more than puppet state of Brussels.Instead of sounding alarm bells ministers hid truth from British public#Brexit #EU
I have decided today not to run for the nomination as the @EPP’s European elections lead campaigner at #EPPHelsinki.                                 It is my duty and responsibility to continue the #Brexit negotiations right to the end. 
The #LibDems are the only party taking on the power and privilege of the #Brexit elite with their country mansions, gold bullion investments, inflated expense accounts and offshore wealth. Join us today: 
Once upon a time @Anna_Soubry claimed to believe in democracy She said she accepted the #EUref result and we should just get on with #Brexit She told us all 2nd referendum would be undemocratic #LosersVote Be a shame if she forgot about this

I’m French and in the UK for 26 years. My children are British. All I want is the country to strive and prosper. If there was any sign that #Brexit was indeed good for the economy I would be the first to be in favour of it. However.... it is not.
Great response to @FFSake_ campaign for a #PeoplesVote outside Plymouth University.It's clear students and young people want to have their say on the #Brexit deal.Let's make it happen! Join us at the #PeoplesVoteMarch on October 20th!This is the fight for our generation.
Brexit is dangerous for the LGBTI community – and so @gaystarnews is today announcing its support for our campaign for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal.Read more about why they want a People's Vote, and their plans to march with us on October 20, here:
A good 2 minute summary of the Irish problem related to #Brexit, from an Irish RTE news political commentator. I wish this clarity was more commonplace 
This week @lewisalloyd, @AAIacobov and I have read *all* of the Government's no deal #Brexit notices, so you don't have to. Here's what we found...
Nicola, whether you like it or not, #Brexit is the biggest issue of the day, and would demand the full attention of any responsible Government. If you weren't too busy taking a wrecking approach to negotiations to make political capital, i'm sure you'd agree. 
My cartoon Friday @TheTimes...... #TheresaMay has her #MeghanMarkle moment  #Chequers #Brexit 
BREAKING: As it's announced that Jeremy Corbyn is to take Diane Abbott with him to meet Michel Barnier in Brussels to REVERSE #Brexit I ask"Has Corblimey got a touch of dementia? he's not running the country"#MarksMemes #Liebour #HackneyCabbage
Why don't we have TV programmes in Britain that teach out kids about politics? I bet even most adults don't understand WTF is going on with #Brexit atm! #StopBrexit #PowertothePeople #FinalSay

BREAKING NEWS RECIPROCITY SHOCK: The EU might actually treat UK nationals in the same way that the UK wants to treat EU citizens under a post-Brexit skills-based immigration system.The bastards. Don't they know who we are?#Brexit 
12) if you trace every single statement or action from Corbyn & his team they have virtually all been in support of #BrexitIf you trace all of the silences on various brexit scandals it's the same.Most Labour supporters oppose Brexit, why do you still support him?End
Very well put. This is a message that I’m hearing more and more. That is why we need the #informedconsent of the people before we proceed or not with #Brexit. Britain needs a #FinalSay #PeoplesVote
Tomorrow marks six months until the Article 50 deadline expires on March 29, 2019. But in reality we’ve probably got little over six weeks before big #Brexit decisions are made.So here are six ways to help campaign for a #PeoplesVote
For Irish kids (and adults everywhere, especially #Westminster), here’s a super explainer on #Brexit Well played @news2dayRTE
Congratulations @RTENewsPaulC and @news2dayRTE for this #Brexit outline which has just been broadcast in Britain by @mrjamesob on @LBC radio who is rightly asking “why an Irish children’s TV programme can provide a clearer explanation of where we are than any UK govt minister?”
Brexit supporters, we were all lied to. There was no motive of doing good for the NHS or for any other public services.The motivations behind #Brexit are becoming clearer. Who profits from Brexit? Not me. Not you.I want a #PeoplesVote .
A positive start to the day - which is unusual when you're discussing #Brexit! Grateful to @Andrew_Adonis for making Northern Ireland a priority - a hard Brexit would be devastating for us & the @allianceparty will continue to work hard to make a #PeoplesVote a reality.
EU quotas have allowed the French to take vast amounts of fish from UK waters, with disastrous consequences for the UK fishing industry.  #Brexit
40 MPs will veto Johnson's harmful 'Super Canada' plan, while 40 other MP will veto Theresa May's plans.This leads us to the scenario of having no chance to get any #Brexit plan through parliament - and that leaves no option except to call a #PeoplesVote
BREAKING: Jacob Rees-Mogg on #BBCQT "How many votes have we got to have on the Referendum. Both parties said that they would implement the result"We need to crack on and leave as soon as possible.Well said Jacob  #Brexit #Neverendum
#Brexit is a modern disasterTory-inspiredTory-ownedLabour can, & will, steer  away from catastrophe 
BORIS "There has been a collective failure of government...to deliver on the mandate of the people“This is the moment to change the course of the negotiations and do justice to the ambitions and potential of #Brexit"
Ok let’s put this to the test after last nights #bbcqt debated another #brexit referendum.If another vote was to take place, how would you vote? Would you vote Remain or Leave the EU? Please retweet this for a bigger vote
Who has the best #Brexit plan?  - Boris Johnson sets out his 'Super Canada' Brexit plan  #ChequersPlan #supercanada @BorisJohnson @theresa_may RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters
Just to be clear, the 2008 financial crash was a 2% hit to GDP. #Brexit is looking at least three times worse. Get ready for higher prices, lower wage growth and austerity on speed....or campaign for independence. 
Image 1: The Brexit we were sold.Image 2: #Brexit reality.Spot the difference. 
“TOMORROW (Sat 29th) in communities across the UK, people will be campaigning to have their say on the final #Brexit deal. The people started this, and it is the people who should finish it. Come and join us! #People’s Vote”
.@BorisJohnson calls @theresa_may's #Brexit plan "a moral and intellectual humiliation for this country" 
 At Lancaster House we were promised a “bold and ambitious” free trade deal. Instead we got Chequers. Bound to an EU rulebook, interpreted by EU judges and unable to sign new trade deals with our allies. There is still time to change course and deliver #Brexit  
Neither MPs nor the media have tackled the fact that an entire level of Rights & Protections are being Removed w/o Consent. It is a disgrace that this is being countenanced with no debate after a non -Binding Ref in which only 26.5% of the Ppl supported #Brexit.#PeoplesVote
No major surprise that the vast majority of people crossing the @BorderIrish begin / end their journey in the border counties. #brexit 
#Brexit will be the end of 000's of UK businesses, and 100's of 000's of jobs that rely on UK/EU trade.Yet @Conservatives, "party for business", and @UKLabour, "party for workers", both happy to say that "we must respect" a ref result "won" by (proven) cheating.  Why?
It's because of people like this that we start work at 2am each morning, 7 days a week, and have done since before the Referendum.  Bless you sir, well said.Distinctive #Brexit research & news daily: 
Super Canada with technological solutions guaranteeing no need for any border with Ireland, freedom to diverge on rules, freedom to sign comprehensive trade deals and no ECJ beats the awful Chequers Plan hands down. #StandUp4Brexit#Brexit @BorisJohnson
No-one has a coherent plan for #Brexit. 
This is what happens when the EU start to realise that the cash cow has left the building.#Brexit  
My co-authors - Huw Edwards and Mustapha Douch - and myself have written this piece for @UKandEU about our joint research on the trade effects of #brexit. Exports would have been around 15% higher if we had voted to remain 
The United Nations' demand that Australia give $400 million to its US$100 billion annual climate fund shows its just as pushy as the EU is to its member states. @CoryBernardi stands up for #Australia  #auspol #abetterway #AustraliaFirst #UN #UNWatch #Brexit 
So all of those “project fear” predictions turned out to be accurate after all.2016: Let's give the #NHS £350m per week.2018: There won't be any cash after #Brexit so let's sell the NHS to the Americans.Is this what you voted for?#FinalSayforAll
Rod Liddle, "some remain voters just want to get on with it"What kind of irresponsible idiot thinks we should go headlong into a country changing decision on #Brexit which no-one can define even in the broadest terms because some people are irritated at the complexity? 
Perhaps #labour should try opposing #brexit rather than supporting it? 
"Oops, someone lied to me... and now I know it's the wrong thing to do." #brexit #bbcqt
#BBCQT Those who most strongly argue that Brexit is “the will of the people” are strangely the ones who are most opposed to allowing the people a say on whether they still agree now that #Brexit is turning out to be very different from what they promised !
Brilliant.. Perfectly put . Extremely brave to speak out like this, especially in the current political climate. #Brexit #bbcqt
"I voted Leave but I've changed my mind"MASSIVE APPLAUSE & CHEERS!The writing is on the fall for #BrexitThe writing is on the fall for #BrexitThe writing is on the fall for #Brexit We will have a #PeoplesVote  And we will #StopBrexit.#bbcqt
Ayesha Hazarika claims #Brexit is a right-wing cause. Anti-EU campaigners include everyone from Tony Benn, Arthur Scargill, Kate Hoey, Frank Field and Peter Shore to Norman Tebbit, David Davis and Jacob Rees-Mogg. It has NEVER been a left-right issue #bbcqt
Feeling more than ever that #Brexit can be stopped. The tide is turning. #PeoplesVote
#bbcqt @ayeshahazarika "Brexit is proving to be like a leap in the dark with a blindfold on...Why is it ignoble to give British public a decision on the final deal? I say it's undemocratic not to!..Democracy is not just a moment in time..." Hear hear. #Brexit #PeoplesVoteMarch

I’m honestly baffled by this obsessive focus on @UKLabour position on #Brexit. It’s wild. Labour doesn’t have a majority in Parliament and has no ability to negotiate with the EU nor to call a second referendum. #bbcqt
Fantastic article from @BorisJohnson A man who truly believes in Britain and discusses our glorious future post #Brexit. 
Will our elected representatives end up showing the world that Britain would be the only country in the Commonwealth that failed to achieve independence and they were the only representatives who sided with the foreign power rather than the nation they represent?#Brexit 
#Brexit blame game explained 
The European Union is trying to make an example out of the UK to discourage other member states from leaving the failing bloc.  #Brexit

Best news that I've had in ages? Hearing my Dad was recovering in hospital after a serious illness.Best news a Remoaner's had in ages? Hearing that some builders have apparently lost their jobs.Imagine hating this country to the extent you celebrate unemployment#Brexit 
Arron Banks serving Putin, Trump & tyranny. Creating a fog of doubt undermines democracy. Once people cannot distinguish between truth & falsity they either slide into apathy or the politics of emotion & prejudice. Debate is replaced by insults & violence.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
Vast sums?  That would be Leave.They claim that #Brexit is non-elite. £16.7m of the £24.4m spent on the #Brexit campaign came from just 10 people with a combined net worth of £11.5bn. 
Koko has tried all of her diplomacy skills on Lightning the little owl but it isn’t working, she’s off to negotiate a deal for #brexit as its likely to be easier than making friends with a grumpy little owl  #smallandfeisty
The majority of voters never voted for it in the 1st place...a clear majority now want to Stop #Brexit & Remain...it simply the minority of #Brexiters in Govt & #Lexiters in Opposition who are standing in the way of a Democratic #PeoplesVote with a #Remain option.#FinalSayForAll
We don't often agree with @BarryGardiner on #Brexit, which is why his #newsnight interviewproves how far we have come."If there is no GE, we move to a #PeoplesVote with all options on the table".We want to go further & faster, but we are moving forward.

This is not good at all and a sign - as I warned in my latest  column,  that @UKLabour backtracking on #Brexit & support for a 2nd referendum would be suicidal. Keir Starmer’s speech, welcomed by some, very harmful to electoral chances HT @atvar99 cc @jeremycorbyn @seumasmilne

BBC News - "Theresa May said the independence issue had been settled by a "clear vote" of the Scottish people"  So was #Brexit. The people of Scotland said REMAIN by an overwhelming vote.
Apparently Theresa May is telling Nicola Sturgeon to 'get on with the day job'. I wonder who slipped her that tedious soundbite which by the way is totally disrespectful to the First Minister. Get lost Theresa.#brexit #indyref2
Labour conf showed that #Brexit is still a running sore for the party. The majority join @LibDems in understanding  the danger. Leadership continue to play games. We approach Brexit zero hour & need #PeoplesVote now #FBPE
Are you stockpiling yet? If not, why not?Now is the time to start preparing for #Brexit before the food riots next year.#NoDealBrexit #NoDealSurvival
The europhobe leaders will secretly love it if #Brexit falls apart...They won't have to face up to the consequences of their actions, and they'll be able to spend eternity doing their favourite activity: blaming the evil foreigners for their revered nation state's own failings.
Meeting w/@jeremycorbyn and his team today. Continuing to listen to all views on #Brexit and to explain EU positions, which aim for the UK’s orderly withdrawal and to build an ambitious future partnership together.
We know that our country needs big fundamental change - I'm not arguing for the status quo. But #Brexit won't answer the problems our country faces - rising house prices, increased NHS waiting times and a shortage of school places.
It was brilliant to speak at the rally for a @peoplesvote_uk with @FFSake_ in #Manchester today. Young people and students overwhelming want a #PeoplesVote. #Brexit

'Academics from all over the world are attracted to #Scotland – and one of the core reasons for this is the connectivity that our universities have with partner institutions across Europe. #Brexit threatens this.' - @UofGVC
While fake bots claim to be Remainers, now preferring Leave, listen to heart breaking account of an effective campaigner for Vote Leave (confounder of BeLeave) who now believes the whole #Brexit Vote was a cheat and a scam (and now a coverup) 
WATCH: Things don't always turn out the way we hope. If #Brexit isn't turning out the way you hoped, maybe it's time to think again. #PeoplesVote
Hint from May's closest ally: She could quit!"She said to the party she will remain leader for as long as they want her!She will decide!She’s had a very, very difficult few years with #Brexit situation."=> Yes, ALL of her OWN making!  #incompetence#EU
How much do we know about the #Brexit process and the #WithdrawalAgreement? Read our briefing for an overview of policy areas where Brexit ‘unknowns’ still exist 
Highly amusing watching all those Telegraph readers who loudly denounced the concerns over planes being grounded post #brexit as “Project Fear”.....seamlessly switch to denouncing the EU for grounding planes post brexit.Brexit’s never ending idiocy. 
6/ In my view the single most damaging legacy of #Brexit will not be economic, but will be the introduction of the notion of the "Will of the People" into the heart of our political culture. It will have made Britain far more vulnerable to a lurch into tyranny during a crisis.
No shit?!?! Has she missed out on what #Brexit means ?????

Any FTA, no matter how many ‘pluses’, will require some sort of border controls. This means that a 'Canada-plus' deal will leave the Irish border issue unsolved & curtail UK trade with the EU. Blog by Alan Winters & @NTamberi @uk_tpo  #Brexit
At today's #FMQs i asked @NicolaSturgeon about the newly appointed UK Government Minister for the protection of food supplies. It's time to STOP this #Brexit madness.
1/ This fascistic rant from Sajid Javid is deeply disturbing. He does not seem to accept, or want to accept, that we still live in a democracy in which Parliament has the right to overturn the government's policies. #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Brexiters don't want a #PeoplesVote because they know they would lose. They want to impose #Brexit against the will of the majority. They are running scared of democracy.  Where Brexit is concerned they fear and loathe democracy. Fight for democracy. Fight for the #PeoplesVote
I'd never vote tory, ever, ever, ever, but i find myself agreeing with almost everything Ken Clarke says on #Brexit.... From the #EUWithdrawalBill through to his appearance today on #PoliticsLive, he speaks bloody sense, in contrast to the extreme Rees-Mogg/Dorries/Raab et al.
"They only cite Canada because they are white and speak English and are a nice country, the Canada deal is pretty dreadful"Naughty Ken Clarke calls out the not-so-unconscious racism which underpins a lot of the Tory terminology about #Brexit and immigration  
Unreal that @russell_kane got access to #JeremyCorbyn!! I finally get where he stands on #Brexit now. 
Kaneing: #JeremyCorbyn interview. He reveals his #Brexit and #PeoplesVote plans.Thanks to @LukeKempner on sound and camera.
The Govt says a No Deal #Brexit wouldn’t be the worst.  Perhaps not, but it includes stockpiling medicines, 17 mile tailbacks, depriving UK citizens in the EU of their pensions and the UK becoming a dumping ground for banned chemicals. I think most would prefer an #ExitFromBrexit
Nadine Dorries: Irish border is a red herring!IEA produced a paper & showed quite clearly it's being put forward as a red herring & being weaponised & used to obfuscate & make negotiations more difficult.The Irish border issue does not exist!#Brexit #EU
Nadine Dorries, that hard right #Brexit extremist said the Northern Ireland border issue doesn't exist and it's a quote "Red Herring", omg this is the calibre of people pushing a deadly no deal Brexit, she cares nothing for our country, that comment tells you that #PeoplesVote
 UK: Oh dear! The apologists of the #BBC explain the life of the British after the #Brexit. Brainwashing! Note: In the 70's there were no EU and smartphones, and yet we were able to communicate, and we could buy and eat bananas too. You idiots! 
"The power of #Corbyn's narrative is that he has concentrated on 3 issues that need to be discussed: #brexit, the social contract between capital & labour & the idea that citizens should be protected from a punitive state & a uberised labour market" @yanisvaroufakis #politicslive
With only six months until #Brexit, @Reuters tracks the City of London’s fortunes through a series of indicators that show a slowdown in some areas, while others are thriving despite the uncertainty 
This is why UK will get a Brexit deal. German Green warns of low tax Britain. They're terrified of a low tax, turbo charged Global Britain economy post #Brexit  I'm so excited!

Good meeting w/ @MarotoReyes, Spanish Minister for Industry, Trade and Tourism. The EU continues to work for an orderly #Brexit and an ambitious future partnership with the UK that should include a close economic relationship. 
But @sajidjavid 1. It may not be up to you, parliament can dictate this.2.  Many leave voters are calling for #peoplesvote as they see #brexit is not what was advertised.Maybe a number of #RemainerNow ladies and gents should reply to your tweet below confirming this!

The woman @NadineDorries chose to lead our country, has appointed a Minister for food supplies.There were never any sunny uplands, there never will be any.Nadine changed her mind about her choice of PM, let us change our minds about #Brexit.

No-deal #Brexit ‘could lead to NI electricity blackouts’ 
‘Global Britain’ is disappearing down a devastating and destructive whirlpool -- its lethal currents whipped up by the egos and imperial delusions of the rich, bickering, visionless and talentless #Brexit elite. The flames of a destructive No Deal Brexit are getting closer.
Thanks to @brexit_advance for getting Brexiteers to advance the #Brexit case and let me update on the growth of @TheBlueWaveUK
Whatever your views on the Conservative Party (my view now is that it has caused more damage to our society than any other single thing since WW2), some good people remain trapped in its stinking carcass and are fighting against #brexit insanity. We need every vote. Help them!

Dorries is absolutely right to castigate Remainers who have "weaponised" the Irish border to bolster the EU's position in #Brexit negotiationsThese same Europhiles deliberately ignore the workable solutions offered by trade experts, the ERG and the IEA

Astonishing, @BarryGardiner MP tells ITV's Peston the Labour party is prepared to "bend its red lines", the #Brexit tests @Keir_Starmer says are central to his approach to Brexit.
The #Lab2018 clearly showed that LABOUR PARTY under the leadership of @jeremycorbyn has an alternative to Tory economics that looks after the pockets of the wealthiest at the expense of the rest of us ! Also there is an alternative to #Tory #BREXIT#JC4PM
The Northern Powerhouse Minister says he 'can't guarantee' the economy will be better after #Brexit - but believes people in Northern England are still optimistic about 'taking back control'.

Compare & contrast the read outs from the Trump/May bilateral meet. Team May effusive about a big US-UK trade deal. White House didn’t even mention. Rather embarrassing #Brexit #May #Trump #UNGA
NEW Theresa May and Donald Trump have tonight held talks about a US/UK trade deal after Brexit. A 10 Downing Street spokesman said the pair "agreed that Brexit provides a wonderful opportunity to strike a big and ambitious UK-US Free Trade Agreement". #unga2018 #Brexit
So Theresa May says her govt will slash corporation tax and make the British economy more competitive, after #Brexit. If you really mean it, why not start now? 
Brilliant, must watch: explains how Corbyn has snookered May on #Brexit. He’s put her into a position where she must choose between the country or her party. Either way she gets destroyed politically. Genius. Never play chess with Jeremy!#JC4PM

The European Commission has come up with a new way to prevent people backing #Brexit – by curbing press freedom. They want to stop the British press encouraging ‘hatred’ of EU leaders and judges, and impose a ‘European approach’ of ‘smart regulation’.

Theresa May, Hannan, Truss and Fox have all been outlining elements of the #Brexit tax haven for the rich which they know would be forced on the country after a hard or a no-deal #Brexit. Only thing is, the Leave campaigns didn't tell anyone about that. #LeaveLies #PeoplesVote

Great speech from Dennis and he’s absolutely right to highlight importance of immigrants to NHS, but let’s remember, Dennis campaigned for Leave and repeatedly went through the lobbies with the Tories during #Brexit votes. Like many Labour policies, an utterly confused position. 
By linking defeating the government's #Brexit deal (if there is one) with a push for a General Election, Corbyn has greatly increased the pressure on potential Tory rebels to vote with the government on Brexit, so making a Tory Brexit more likely. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

Deeply depressing. It is all too clear that Labour's leaders will seek every opportunity to avoid a #PeoplesVote.#Brexit 
Poll after poll shows different numbers. But only one thing stay true. We are leaving. Because we are a civilized country. We have laws. Our decisions have consequences. #Brexit #LeaveMeansLeave#StandUp4Brexit
There's no such thing as a good #Brexit. Most Labour members know that. Doing what is best for the country is to Remain in the EU. A few more months of this Tory debacle will prove it.
If you are so confident that #Brexit is the right thing for the #UK, you should be able to win another referendum without breaking sweat. You will easily be able to demonstrate the benefit & convince people to vote with you by an even larger majority. What are you so afraid of?
The irony for @Theresa_May is that so far the only consensus she has created about #Brexit is that Chequers is unworkable. #ExitFromBrexit

According to David Campbell-Bannerman on @BBCTalkback- the CBI and business community are lazy? And the issue of the border has been hijacked? What a load of tosh. Arrogant garbage from someone who clearly has no understanding of the situation #Brexit #NoBrexit #StopBrexit
Britain's security depends on European security which has 2 elements, NATO and the EU. Each depends on the other. NATO would fragment without the political unity. Putin knows that, which is why he is trying to weaken the EU. #Brexit is not patriotic. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
In a long speech @jeremycorbyn makes a brief mention of #Brexit, the biggest issue facing Britain. He is sticking to his old meaningless platitude of a jobs first Brexit. Nothing about consulting the British people. Much to like in his speech but not this.
In my opinion #Brexit represents the most terrible and dangerous attack on our privileged way of life since the last war, and if it's allowed to happen all that we have built since that dark time will disintegrate.  
After 1pm: The Prime Minister @Theresa_May says it's necessary to support her #Brexit plan if you want to prevent the break-up of the United Kingdom.  Is Theresa May really the saviour of the UK? We hear from @DCBMEP @JasonJHunter and @ShankerASingham

There is no doubt the speech made by @Keir_Starmer on #Brexit was the defining  moment of #Lab18 and @martinkettle captures the reaction in the hall perfectly.At @Remain_Labour, we are still buzzing.
The chair of @EPInstitutional committee who will steer #Brexit through the European Parliament says it's time to chuck Chequers - "It is frustrating to us that the UK has left the same unworkable arguments on the table for so long without changing them at all." 
Those calling for a Canada-style #Brexit deal are keen to ignore that an off-the-shelf deal designed for a country where 10% of its exports go to the EU is totally insufficient for a country like Wales where 60% of our exports go to the EU.#NotMyBrexit
1) Great article on why #Brexit is insolubleWe can rail about respecting the vote, the EU being stubborn,May being incompetent etc all day long.  The fact is it cannot be negotiated successfully, and anyone who believes otherwise is mistaken#Lab18
A lie from low tax Chloe. The EU doesn't claim to have defeated the Nazis, it claims to have maintained the peace by ending the rabid nationalism that has so often brought war to Europe. Why do we let dishonest, destructive immigrants like Chloe into Britain? #Brexit #StopBrexit
Ok well nothing for you to worry about then. If you're so sure of Victory, you can vote for #Brexit again & we will leave the EU after the #PeoplesVote. You can show us Remoaners how much MORE support there is for Brexit #FinalSay  shut us up with a whopping majority this time!
Labour MP Laura Smith calls for a general strike to bring down the government.How about a general strike to achieve a #PeoplesVote? This is massively supported by union members, who know how many jobs are threatened by #Brexit.
It is imperative that the people realise that the #ERG are not doing this for the good of the country, they are doing it only for the good of themselves. Nothing good can come out of #brexit for most of us. #Leavers must realise that the #ERG are in it for the money.
Today's thought:Why do many brexiteers think that allowing a vote on the deal would automatically mean overturning the leave decision of 2016?It's discussed as if another vote is a foregone remain conclusion.Surely if the country still wants #Brexit we'd vote for it?#FBPE
We can be sure that won’t happen! For any democracy to function it requires a competent, responsible and effective opposition. We don’t have one and that is a huge part of why we are in a #Brexit mess

to summarise the promised #brexit means  £200mpw alimony from the EU a controlled uncontrolled Irish border single market membership and trade with other planets I have every confidence such a brexit would be overwhelmingly endorsed in a #PeoplesVote
an acceptable #brexit must mean an end to open borders and simultaneously the Irish border the UKs only open border must remain open so the Irish border must be both controlled and uncontrolled at the same time no other #brexit is acceptable
an acceptable #brexit must mean all the existing benefits of the single market as promised by David Davis which Dan Hannan said no one was questioning our place in and Owen Patterson said only a madman would leave which Liam fox said would  be the easiest deal in human history

I am a democratic socialist and member of the Labour Party. I voted remain.I respect democratic outcomes so will vote leave if another referendum is held.I will play no part in overturning the democratic will of the people.RT if you agree#Lab18 #Labour #Brexit

We're a one stop place for all #Brexit related news at #CPC18.It's worth noting that there's another event at the #Birmingham Midland institute on 1/10/18 which is billed as the "alternate CPC" & it will feature MPs who have pledged to #StandUp4Brexit 
The same people who are saying Brexit will harm the UK are the same people who would vote Labour and appoint Diane Abbott as Home Secretary - you couldn’t write this shit  #brexit
From today's @FinancialTimes #Brexit #PeoplesVote #secondreferendum
Why does the PM dismiss Canada Plus?Is it because it beats Chequers in every conceivable way and she doesn't want to admit that she should have gone with Canada+ from day one.Irresponsible and wrong decision. Canada+ is the way!#StandUp4Brexit #brexit
1.  Hi there @theresa_may @DominicRaab @daviddavismp It's Laura from @BritishInEurope.Yes, yes unfortunately we DO still exist. We need to talk about #Brexit and my life & that of my husband & son.

An incredible response and standing ovation to @Keir_Starmer in the Conference Hall today. “Nobody is ruling out remain as an option.” The Labour position could not be any more clear. Oppose damaging Tory #Brexit plan and no deal. And back a #PeoplesVote #Lab18Fantastic!
Theresa May today: "If they have concerns they need to detail those concerns to us, and if they have counter-proposals let’s hear the counter-proposals, and then we can discuss those and take it forward."Here are all counter proposals summarised in a single slide.#Brexit

Six months to go and the Tories still don't have concensus on their #Brexit approach.Any #Leaver claiming they knew what they were voting for should take their crystal ball and get a job as a clairvoyant in Blackpool.#PeoplesVote
An excellent speech to #Lab18 by @elsieortong, in support of the policy change on #Brexit and our move towards a #PeoplesVote.Elsie's message was clear, outside the EU, I don't trust the Tories to protect my rights.None of us should. #Brexit is not inevitable. 
GET OUT THE EU NOW AND TRADE ON WTO RULES !!!TWO-thirds of those  who voted Leave in the referendum two years ago are not bothered about  the details of Brexit – just as long as the UK gets out of the EU#Brexit
.@BorisJohnson @DavidDavisMP & @Jacob_Rees_Mogg are now backing this #Brexit plan that would:Undermine workers' rightsPave the way for chlorinated chickenUnravel environmental protectionsNone of this was on the side of a bus in 2016. We urgently need a #PeoplesVote
You claim that #Brexit is non-elite. £16.7m of the £24.4m spent on the #Brexit campaign came from just 10 people with a combined net worth of £11.5bn. Nothing wrong with being clever and careful like Remainers.  Better than being unwise and careless.
PS it's only betraying 26.5% of the Ppl who voted 4 several versions of #Brexit, many of whom now regret it having seen the utter mess you're making of it. To deny it is the betrayalA #PeoplesVote is the only democ way to Confirm if the Maj Will is still 2#Brexit or #Remain
Brussels just blew a raspberry at Chequers #Brexit plan, so we need credible alternatives which deliver EUreferendum result & help UK businesses too. This from @ShankerASingham & @iealondon could be exactly what’s needed

Cracking speech on #Brexit from @Keir_Starmer today at #LabourConference2018 following our marathon composite meeting with @TSSAunion @GMB_union @CommunityUnion @bfawu1 and hundreds of CLP members.
I oppose #Brexit but this distortion of internationalism cannot continue to go unremarked. Internationalism is not defined by support for neoliberal governments joined together in a supranational union. The International Brigades did not travel to Spain to fight for Santander. 
The majority of people wanted #Brexit. You’ve had 2 years to get the best possible deal.(You told us it would be easy)If the majority of people would now vote to #remain, that only reflects your failure #LabConf18 #Lab2018

As farcically ignorant as this tweet is, the #thread of replies from @Jim_Cornelius make it worthwhile #Brexit 
Keir Starmer said it..if #Brexit deal fails 'nobody's ruling out a public vote & #Remain must be an option'.Not in approved script apparently.Standing ovation.Dennis Skinner's face a pictureNo doubt Corbyn, McDonnell, Gardiner McCluskey will do their damnedest to thwart it.
What I love best about the chaos amongst our noisy political elite is that it was brought about by ‘the little people’ - 17.4million of us, sick of not being heard. #Standstrong for #Brexit

A direct appeal to delegates to the @UKLabour Conference #Lab18: The British people deserve an opportunity to deliver their verdict on #Brexit. The lies have been exposed, vote for a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain. Thank you.
3) Firstly, no-one, least of all Rees-Mogg & the ERG, speaks for everyone or even a majority of Leavers.When various right wing commentators say "give us the #Brexit we voted for" or push for no deal, they speak for almost no-one but themselvesNo deal has very little support 
If you are tired of listening to politicians about #Brexit , listen instead to Ian Wright  , CEO of @Foodanddrinkfed as quoted in today’s @ScotNational :   “The consequences of a no-deal Brexit for UK food and drink are starting to be felt already. The impacts will snowball,”
1) Thread - Leavers "bored with the details" on #BrexitFascinating poll which reveals 66% of Leave Voters are uninterested in exactly how we leave the EU, they just want to leave.  This brings into question - exactly *what* are we achieving pushing for Brexit?#Lab18

If the #Brexit agreed still has majority support, it will win a People’s Vote. If it does not have support, using a three-year-old mandate on pretty vague terms, to ram through something that is actually against the CURRENT will of the people, is the very opposite of democratic.

Despite the promise that nothing will change for them, EU nationals in the UK and British residents in the rest of the #EU are to lose out from #Brexit. Here is a summary of the rights that will be lost, deal or no deal.  #citizenrights @EuropeStreet
Theresa May was bluffing throughout the #Brexit negotiations. She thought we are bluffing as well and would fall in the end. Truth is, we were never bluffing. Reality is as it is. Based on rules. EU is united and EU is in full solidarity with #Ireland.
My take on why the EU is taking a hard stance on #Brexit, published just in time to help explain #Salzburg.BUT: I wrote this in July! Nothing really changed in Salzburg, no matter how much British media thinks this was a "surprise ambush."
New details about a non-negotiated EU exit withdrawal and its impact on aviation and aerospace industries have been published: #BREXIT #AVIATION
Hi,  @bucks_herald! You have a journalist working for you (@Sam_BTT) who appears to despise those who voted for #BREXIT so much that he is happy to introduce posts like the one cited below to Twitter...Care to comment? 
"One of the options that must be available is a public vote" - @Keir_Starmer says there should be a general election if @theresa_may's deal is voted down - and another option is a second referendum. Read the latest here on Labour's #Brexit stance: 
Shadow Brexit Secretary @Keir_Starmer says @theresa_may was the only person "surprised" that Chequers was rejected as the basis of any #Brexit agreement at the Salzburg summit.  Read the latest here as Labour says it will vote against the PM's deal: 
Every day I sort of wake up with the vague hope that #Brexit will have imploded under the weight of its own lunacy. Guess I’ll have to wait till Wednesday.
TM stance on EU migrants freedom of movement post #brexit is catastrophic for the Hospitality industry. With such reliance on overseas workers how on earth is anyone going to operate and run businesses?
Stop lying. #WTO says #Brexit will mean £9bn of EXTRA cost passed on to consumers, £5.5bn to businesses. They know more about it than you. See @Jim_Cornelius's superb primer on how EU's 759 trade treaties work to ensure we have 0% tariffs on our food.
FFS. @BBCr4today yet again giving another one of the architects of the #Brexit disaster - Iain Duncan Smith - large amounts of air-time. No.1: Why? And No.2: Why isn't anyone reminding Duncan Smith that, when it came to the crunch, he had NO PLAN?
#Brexit Can we have a day without Brexit bashing please. Same bloody bores, out on TV & Radio crying everyday     . We’re leaving the EU, give it a rest. Theresa May get on with it grow a backbone, stop waving white flag to the EU. Jeremy Corbyn stop trying stop Brexit. 
No preferential treatment for EU citizens after #Brexit ? Well then don’t expect any preferential treatment from the EU, @theresa_may - free movement of goods, services and PEOPLE is indivisible! Anything else is robber capitalism. #getreal
David Eyles: "When Margaret Thatcher became too autocratic, too imperious, too visibly affected by her enormous power, the Grey Men of the Conservative Party paid her a visit in Downing Street." @Drystonesonnet #csm #Brexit 
Over many decades I've witnessed the manipulation of democracy to strengthen the cause of the rich, famous & unscrupulous. The #PeoplesVote is just another manipulative elitist project aimed at one thing only, the systematic reversal of #Brexit. Vote #NoDeal & #BringThemAllDown.
This guy's takedown of ill-informed (deliberately lying?) @DKShrewsbury is truly a thing of beauty. #brexit 
Since @Keir_Starmer's slap-down of @johnmcdonnellMP do we believe that Labour will eventually straighten up & fly right re #Brexit or is it all just more flannel ("constructive ambiguity")? (Pls retweet for stats).
Labour is set to vote against @theresa_may's #Brexit deal as it is yet to meet the party's "six tests" #LabourConference2018
I have always said, right from the start, we have to believe 100% that #Brexit will be stopped. If there is political will, they will find a way. Your belief will spread to others, don't let a shred of doubt stand in your way... We can, must and WILL #StopBrexit!

Correct @Jacob_Rees_Mogg we do want to #StopBrexit & remain in the EU. Public opinion has changed. We see #Brexit for what it is, the destructive, crazy result of continous, bitter Tory infighting. You lot carry on squabbling but we as a country will not be taken down with you 
Thanks to @IrelandEmbGB’s @AdrianGONeill for praising the work of our delegate @MartinWhelton for his Herculean efforts to ensure our language on no Irish border made it into the #Brexit composite at #Lab18.
Listening to the @UKLabour party speakers I cannot but wonder how all the pledges will be honoured while the #Brexit nemesis looms over, and will distract everything. You can do all you pledge but only if you are in government, you won't get there while you support Brexit.
Clearly, they can’t. Their incompetence is baffling - They’ll borrow money from banks but it isn’t borrowing because it’ll pay for itself and all the interest. And they want the Country to trust them to deliver #Brexit (if they can figure it out what it is beyond their stupidity) 
So with todays #brexit lies even worse than usual, here is my guide to spotting lies in the media. Please read and #retweet, add your own example and feel free to come back to it when you need it.
Oh god this is good. #brexit 
Tuesday's Times: "Hold your nerve on #Brexit, May tells Cabinet" (via @MsHelicat) #tomorrowspaperstoday
We should not be afraid of demanding a @peoplesvote_uk because the 2016 referendum was illegitimate #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw the #British people deserve a fair and #FinalSay on #Brexit. It is our DEMOCRATIC RIGHT.
After much misreporting, please note our #Brexit strategy: 1)Even if a Tory-EU deal half-decent, vote it down to force a no-deal 2)In chaos, try and force an election, causing civil strife 3)Call a vote with no ‘Remain’ option ensuring debate rages eternally 4)Economic collapse.
no deal #Brexit to ground aviation there was increasing anger and resentment about cheap air travel in the run up to the referendum & leave voters will welcome the grounding of flights as a sign the #Brexit they knew they were voting for will be delivered 
Theresa May tells ministers to 'hold their nerve' in face of #Brexit deadlock In other words, the Cabinet will continue to flog the proverbial dead horse known as ChequersMore unnecessary time wasting, when we could go for a Canada-plus deal instead
Required viewing for everyone living in Britain, frankly #brexit 
Thank you. My son & daughter both voted labour to rebel against #Brexit and now find that party threatening to undermine their trust. @KateHoeyMP, @LenMcCluskey & @johnmcdonnellMP be very ashamed. My daughter’s vote helped overturn @Conservatives in #Brightonkemptown , for what?
How can the Electoral Commission carry on if it’s biased against Brexiteers?  #Brexit
In recent months a variety of Tory ministers have refused to meet with anybody but DUP MPs when they visited the north; Steve didn’t, he and Tony Lloyd took the time to engage with local community in #SouthDown so I’m not surprised he has a sharp #Brexit analysis re: Ireland 
Labour MP: Everything since referendum in 2016 has validated case for Leaving #EUEU are arrogant, undemocratic, have no respect for the people of Europe.Ireland, France, Denmark, all had referenda EU Commission didn’t like & told to vote again.#Brexit

This! I've heard a lot of MP's talk about the border but none have fully grasped it, until now. Thank you Stephen Pound for understanding the issue completely.  #Brexit #NoBorder
You have to hand it to Keir Starmer, this is a superb exposition of how to avoid saying anything of any substance on a #PeoplesVote Entirely consistent, of course, with Labour's history of their positions on #Brexit since 2016.Labour members have been sold a #piginapoke
“There are more crossing points between Monaghan and Northern Ireland than there are between the whole of Sweden and Norway. 302 miles between Donegal and Dundalk, 282 crossing points. Solve that and you’ve solved the riddle of the universe.” #Brexit 
No country will be as affected by #Brexit as Ireland. Bluntly, for us there is no ‘good’ version of Brexit. I hope that our many friends in @UKLabour will vocally champion Ireland’s interests, so the Good Friday Agreement is not sacrificed in the final, fraught negotiations.
My interview on #skynews earlier today (spoiler: I mention #brexit):

This survey was taken last Friday in #Wigtown, where the local public and book festival goers gave their verdict on #Brexit and what it means for Scotland. 
Sorry, I just don't buy this "If there's a UK/EU border between NI and the Republic the IRA will bomb you again" menace. Terrorists don't determine #Brexit. As Margaret Thatcher said after the Brighton Bomb in 1984: "..all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail." 
We do not need migrant labour post #Brexit The TUV will ensure unemployed Roman Catholics take jobs, thus relieving the taxpayer of benefit payment burden.
At a meeting with young adults in Hanover, #Merkel makes it clear that the result of the #Brexit negotiations will depend on Great Britain's attitude. 
‘The second referendum campaign is nothing more than a P45 to Labour MPs in the Midlands and the North.’ @BrendanChilton #labourconference18 #Brexit
Finally, some sense in the #Brexit debate from a British politician. Please @UKLabour wake up and demand a #PeoplesVote. This is beyond serious for Ireland.
Simple. If the #Brexit agreed still has majority support, it will win a People’s Vote. If it does not, the suggestion that ramming through the worst version of something vague voted for three years ago, AGAINST the CURRENT will of the people, is more democratic than not, is tosh.
So I just got 73 quid back for 100 Euro. #brexit
There is no such things as a no deal #Brexit as any departure from the EU will involve some sort of an arrangement. This tactic to scare people is so disgraceful that Britain may as well stop calling itself a democracy and accept it is an autocracy run from Brussels.
ATTENTION: We are looking for international citizen journalists to discuss international topics in the #UK, #EU, #Russia and Worldwide. You'll be working alongside a dedicated US #MAGA team. If that is you, DM for info. #Brexit #Europe #Conservatives #RussiaThreat #Asia #NATO
So that's it - all 'technical notes' on no-deal #Brexit published and there's nothing on citizens' rights.We've got guidance for satellites, but if you're an EU citizen living here or a Brit abroad, you're on your own.Govt's priorities are all wrong. We need a #PeoplesVote.
#Brexit: Disruption to flights possible under no-deal, government warns 
No deal #Brexit will lead to planes being grounded. I’ve been pleading with Govt to get their act together for 2 years. They really must act fast now to avoid utter chaos.  
#Brexit: Pet travel warning in no-deal planning papers 
The @UKLabour leadership are going along with the @Conservatives on #Brexit.They are ignoring their members, ignoring voters and ignoring the huge damage Brexit is doing to the UK.Time to give people the final say and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit.
"'No deal is better than a bad deal?' Give us a break" @HilaryBennMP says UK risks no-deal #Brexit "abyss", as government publishes new contingency papers 
When the leader of a fascist government thanks British conservative politicians for their solidarity with their cause, you've entered the realm of Oswald Mosley.  Be very afraid Britain. #brexit 
Latest tranche of technical notices paint the grimmest picture yet of No Deal - higher costs, explosion of red tape, and new hurdles on movement of goods #Brexit 
An honour to be part of and address the #MarchForTheMany yesterday. As I said, backing a #PeoplesVote is the right for our country, right thing for our communities, and the right thing for the Labour Party. #Brexit #lab18
Labour MP Ruth Smeeth - "A people’s vote is absolute nonsense. It undermines democracy. For my constituents, they were very clear in their views. "I campaigned for Remain and I lost. So in order not to betray the electorate we’ve got to make this work.” #Brexit 
#Brexit Secretary @DominicRaab: "There are some risks of short term disruption" if Britain leaves EU without a deal, but government's no-deal contingency papers show "we're well prepared"Read more: 
British, EU airlines could see flights grounded in no-deal #Brexit 
The Customs Union is a racket that defends producers in rich countries against producers in poor countries,to the cost of the poorest consumers in the rich countries.#Brexit #Moggmentum

If you were unable to join the #MarchForTheMany at the @UKLabour conference in Liverpool yesterday, check out this video for the highlights.Next is the March for the Future on October 20. Join us in London to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. 
 Labour’s refusal to oppose Brexit makes them just as culpable as the Tories in destroying Wales’ economic prospects. @Plaid_Cymru repeats its call for a people’s vote on #Brexit. #PeoplesVote #LabourBrexitSham
#Brexit no-deal notices just out; little comfort for hauliers - little info, few specifics not enough time. We face customs chaos at the ports, disruption to food supply chain #freight @RHANews oh and price rises @RHANews
.@DavidLammy with a clear message. #Brexit is not a done deal. #OptionToRemain
We have released a batch of Technical Notices covering aviation, road haulage, motor insurance and coaches to ensure we are prepared for the unlikely event of a no deal #Brexit  Find out more: 
Put your Brexit inPull your People's Vote out Put your Single Market inPull your Customs Union outYou do the nationalised okey cokeyAnd kneecap your enemies That's what it's all about Clueless flip flopping!#Lab18 #Brexit #PeoplesVote
The only choice a ‘deal or no deal’ vote gives people is which foot to point the gun at.@LibDems demand better than #Brexit and want to give the people the final say on any deal through a People's Vote where they will have the option to remain in the EU.#ExitFromBrexit
Is this the secret weapon of the ERG? Mary Poppins to sort out #Brexit. 
Today, I’ve announced £6 million of business support to help prepare our important major employers for #Brexit – more here: 
I'll be live on BBC News just after 4. Talking about the compositing meeting on #Brexit last night and why this is a significant step forward for the @Remain_Labour campaign and ultimately a #PeoplesVote
Keir Starmer: New #Brexit ref under Labour could include option to #Remain. ME: Fine but if it ain't policy & in writing it ain't worth the paper it won't be written on.#PeoplesVote + Remain option or no Labour Govt.
Labour have made it clear they want to democratise everything apart from the most important question facing the country in decades. Eighty-six per cent of Labour members want a “people’s vote” on Brexit. Labour block democracy to help tories deliver #Brexit. 
There is plenty of authoritarianism in the European Union, especially within the European Commission, which is why the EU is trying so desperately to undermine #Brexit and the free will of the British people. Brexit is the single biggest force for freedom in Europe today. 
A Canada deal will cost us £57bn per year, that is £877m per week, according to the governments own impact assessments. Is that what people voted for? #Brexit #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Jezza &McDonnell are #BrexiteersAlways have beenThey're engineering a huge fudge of a resolution that'll offer a possible vote of the people on some aspect on #Brexit but will certainly NOT offer another IN/OUT ReferendumThat'd be political suicide.40% Lab voters voted Brexit
Are you ready for the #Wooferendum?!  Sunday 7th October thousands of dogs will march to #Parliament to protest against #Brexit  dogs stand up for their EU rights & #petpassports join us!  @wooferendum @JasonJHunter

EMA has revised the number of centrally authorised #medicines at risk of #Brexit-related supply shortages. The focus is now on 39 centrally authorised medicines, down from 108: 
Our favourite #Brexit phrase is back! @danutahuebner of @EPInstitutional says @MichelBarnier will decide if there's been "SUFFICIENT PROGRESS" in negotiations by the time of the October EU summit for there to be another one in November.

Drug shortages are already affecting the care of #NHS patients, even before the potentially destabilising results of #Brexit, doctors warn @traumagasdoc 
Public splits again on #Brexit - clearly a group of Labour MPs and this frontbencher thinks @johnmcdonnellMP overreached this morning when he emphatically ruled out a second ref
Oh but I was told on @bbc5live by "Jade the regional assistant for #voteleave in the North East" that "the EU has done NOTHING for the NE"  funny someone advocating #Brexit didn't bother to research the facts to substantiate their argument.. #StopBrexit
"Face the people for the way in which they've recklessly put our country's future at risk over the last two years" Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell tells #Lab2018 that he wants to see Conservatives 'face the people' over their handling of #Brexit. 
There’s a #Brexit solution waiting on the shelf for us.  We shld take it .  I & a number of us @NickBoles @jc4southsuffolk @Simonhartmp have been pushing this since the spring as a backstop.  It’s starting to look like we may need it. @bbclaurak @tnewtondunn @faisalislam
⁦@Jacob_Rees_Mogg⁩ says EU snubbed the PM by rejecting her deal. WTF is his continued rejection then? Is he not snubbing the PM, govt and party leader? Perhaps he should consider leaving the party - or  preferably the country. #brexit #PeoplesVote
1. Ok GE ahead? Not if Govt can avoid it before gerrymandering the boundaries but let's say we have 1Tories= Tory FUBAR #BrexitDUP= DUH Brexit & United IrelandLabour= Tory Brexit at some pointSNP= Brexit = Indy2 & sod UKWhat a choice.What if ALL #Remain voted LibDem?
Fed up with being ignored? Have a destructive ideology you wish to impose on the masses?Don't worry, there's a simple solution: just call it WILL OF THE PEOPLE!As if by magic, your insane project is now legitimate, and all opponents are "enemies of the people"!#Brexit 
No issue more urgent in our #Brexit discussions than ensuring Irish Goverment allocate the two additional EU seats to the North. No better way to ensure our voice is still heard at the heart of Europe.  Biz, community groups, trade unions, farmers would all have voice. 
Good thread, and at least EEA membership is on the cards. But, sadly, it also shows the leadership to be antagonistic to a #PeoplesVote and to remaining in the EU. I wouldn't trust them even with an EEA commitment. #Brexit #StopBrexit
A great takedown on the utter nonsense being touted by John McDonnell this morning, in which Labour logically end up campaigning for #Brexit "No Deal" in a #peoplesvote alongside Rees Mogg & the ERG (yes, really)#Lab18 #LabConference2018
Theresa May is the second woman in the United Kingdom to serve as Prime Minister, after Margaret Thatcher. @Jdickerson asked her about the  movement, plus the intense fight she faces at home and across the European Union over #brexit. 
Hands up any @UKLaboursupporters who think it's acceptable that the Lab. Shad. #Brexit secretary had to directly contradict the Shad Chancellor on the meaning of a key #Brexit motion raised *unambiguously* by 150 CLPs 6 months before we crash out of the EU?#LabourConference2018
Are you a #Brexit fighter? The 'Brexit Battle Pack' is being used by thousands!  FREE tools to lobby your MP & the media. Created by us and endorsed by TEN other Brexit groups. Click here:  and fight back!
It is crunch time @jeremycorbyn! Accept, as the @GMB_union and most Labour supporters have, that #Brexit will be a disaster for workers. If you don’t, you will share the blame for this mess with @Theresa_May.
So many leave voters are now aware that the #brexit they ordered isn't actually on the menu & can't be served.As a result they've changed their minds want to cancel their order & not have to pay. Surely they should be allowed.#PeoplesVote #RemainerNow
We need to #Brexit from arming regimes like the Saudis who are bombing #Yemen into rubble & killing 1000s of civilians.
Boris: If we go with Chequers, the public will spot it.They will see UK has become a vassal state,We have not taken back control, but lost control.They will take their revenge at the polls.Far better solution is SuperCanada free trade deal.#Brexit #EU
#Brexit: May to chair cabinet amid pressure for Chequers re-think 
The #Brexit Populists Handbook Create a false enemy and incite strong emotions such as fear, anger and hatred against it Offer simple solutions to complex problems Blame the enemy when the solutions don't workUnleash the fear, anger and hatred on the enemy
These are very wise words indeed on #Brexit from a superb former Conservative Trade Minister, and our ex-Chief Secretary to the Treasury. We would ignore them at our peril 
I find #Brexit offensive. #StopBrexit
Salzburg was unfortunately "all too predictable" - former #Brexit secretary @DavidDavisMP speaks at launch of @iealondon’s alternative Brexit plan  #PlanAPlus
Today's IEA #PlanAPlus marks the latest in a series of serious, constructive contributions (from the ERG, IFT, Cato...) to address the challenges and opportunities of #Brexit.(Remain economist: Ooh! I've found a problem with one of the footnotes...)
The second text was a step forward and formed the basis of the final motion. However, we were able to secure further concessions and move Labour policy on #Brexit firmly in the right direction.
I am still a bit bleary eyed after the #Brexit compositing meeting at #Lab18 last night, but it's vital that we establish what really happened. As you read this, a reminder that I was in the room as a delegate and John McDonnell was not.
.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg: “This plan is deliverable and would be popular with the voting public. The most exciting contribution we have had to the #Brexit debate in many months” #PlanAPlus
At a packed @iealondon launch of #PlanAPlus alternative #Brexit paper 
Unite's Tony Burke says Johnson and Rees-Mogg's knowledge of manufacturing probably extends only to watching their nanny assemble an Ikea flat-pack. #Lab2018 #Brexit
Dear Mr @JeremyCorbyn,As citizens of Britain from all walks of life, we urge you to come out in support of the public having a final say on #Brexit, with a vote that includes an option to stay in the EU.Sincerely,Over 60,000 Brits#Lab18
Theresa May is braced for cabinet backlash after declaring EU citizens will NOT get special treatment after #Brexit - as Home Secretary Sajid Javid 'plans to wave them into UK for 30 more months' 
A huge THANKS to all those @peoplesvote_uk supporters who joined our #PVfortheMany march in #Liverpool yesterday. All of us marching are clear what we want: a #PeoplesVote on the terms of #Brexit,whether there’s a deal or not, with the option to Remain on the ballot. Nothing less 
I am not just a Leaver-I am a Leaver's Leaver. Jacob Rees-Mogg and John Redwood have shown less ideological commitment to Leaving than I. Now, children, please - be good, wave your Palestinian flags and vote #Leave #Brexit #Lab2018 #LabourConference2018 #LabourPartyConference

It’s been a pattern for Labour in recent years. Get close to a good policy, see a chink of light at the end of the tunnel, and then John McDonnell comes along and snuffs it out. He really doesn’t like giving people hope. #Lab18 #Brexit
"It's a disaster, we must have a People's Vote" Thousands of protesters demanded second vote on #Brexit as they marched through Liverpool.@jeremycorbyn revealed that party members will vote on Tuesday on whether to push for a new vote.Do Brits want another referendum?
For Remainers the Labour Party is dead. Support #LibDems and get a #finalsay to stop #Brexit 
The @iealondon have produced #PlanAPlus which is a workable proposal to take us through #Brexit & make #GlobalBritian a reality.It is now time for No.10 to listen to remian, leave & the EU & #ChuckChequers and #StandUp4Brexit.Summary here 
There is NO such thing as EU money!EU has NO money of it's own.#EU budget money is from nation state contributions of which UK taxpayers contribute about £10+ Billion.#Brexit will allow UK to cut out the Brussels middleman & pay subsidies direct to UK farmers & businesses etc. 
Dear British friends,I hope #Brexit is just a passing nightmare. I know there are a lot of good people fighting for Britain to remain what it always was: a European country. Bon courage! Many Europeans support you! 
I enjoy #referenda  I’m quite good at them usually win them and predict the results better than the pollsters as @afneil knows. But they don’t settle matters. I rather think Britain has had enough referendums for a while. Better by far to reform the voting system now. #Brexit
1) Thread - Corbyn, #Brexit & Labour democracy - let's just be honest, it's deadSaddened but not surprised by this reversal by Labour Leadership.Labour members overwhelmingly support a People's vote, and they have been comprehensively overridden#LabourConference2018
Now we all know that only rich billionaires want #Brexit to avoid tax. Nothing like that would ever happen in the EU.
Jim Wells just told @StephenNolan that Northern Ireland voted to remain because "a lot of nationalists did" For the millionth time, #Brexit is NOT an orange/green issue.
Labour members in favour of a #PeoplesVote & wanting to #Remain in the EU have been sold a pig in a poke.For the Labour leadership #Brexit will happen.In contrast @LibDems want a #FinalSay referendum & an #ExitFromBrexit Time for Labour MPs & members to vote with their feet.
TL:DRLabour is unfortunately not a democracy but a dictatorship.Its leadership pays more respect to (mostly Tory) Leave voters than its own members.The Leadership has ignored the overwhelming position of its members & continues to opt out of #Brexit#LabourConference2018
This will be political suicide I’m afraid (if the vote is passed), as it will enable the Tories to say ‘You can only be sure of #Brexit taking place if you vote for us’:  Labour to vote on keeping option of fresh Brexit vote 
Bad news for all those many members who had hoped Labour might offer an alternative re #Brexit 
We prioritise the fate of the Palestinians over #OurNHS and #Brexit, because obsessing over the one Jewish state when Assad has been slaughtering hundreds of thousands of his own people does not look weird at all. 
So Labour nudging towards Norway option while Tories sliding over to Canada option.  Hobson’s Choice #Brexit then. Not what we want @Labour4EU @Remain_Labour @Women_4_Europe and many other #Remain groups. We fight on. 
Interesting. @UKLabour now supporting a second #brexit referendum, but then want to block #indyref2. Surely this isn't very consistent!
We didn’t have a ‘people vote’ last time, we had a gerrymandered advisory referendum where a backpacker from Australia or Malta could vote but not someone like me with 30 years NI contributions under his belt nor 15-18 year olds whose future is affected by #Brexit more than any1!
When someone says that #brexit may or may not be good for the country in 50 yrs time he's clearly taking the piss.  People have got over plague in less time.  It is the greatest act in history of asking others to clear up your own mess. Guess his nanny always did it.  #FBPE
The 9% Vat rate allowed us to reduce our prices by 4.5% and keep our customers through the recession.Now, as #Brexit weakens Sterling is NOT the time to raise prices.#KeepVat9 and keep Ireland competitive.A healthy industry pays more tax.
so, as suspected, Magic Grandpa & the Elves are still on the side of #Brexit.And you thought he'd 'listen to the membership'?Ha. Ha. Ha.
Retweet if you think puppy sleeping on a dashboard would be better at negotiating #Brexit than Theresa May's Tories 
Dear @UKLabour members who want to #Remain. A GE before March 2019 may get you a Labour government but it will also get you a Labour #Brexit. You have a leadership that does not want us to have a #PeoplesVote.
Proud & delighted @exeterlabour official seconder for historic  #Lab2018 motion on #BrexitShambles. Makes clear @UKLabour will vote against Tory #Brexit deal or no deal, &, in absence of general election, back #peoplesvote (& we now back “full participation” in #Singlemarket
Arron Banks, the sacrifices of WW2  were made to put an end to your kind of rabid nationalism. We crushed the far-right scum in 1945. We will again. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
So after 2 years of inaction and bickering the Tories are no nearer to agreeing what they want from #Brexit, let alone carry out meaningful negotiations - how pathetic! No wonder the UK is the laughing-stock of Europe@UnityNewsUK @mac123_m @Hepworthclare#UnfitToGovern
Has Labour, a political party that claims to represent working class people, ever been more out of touch with working class people? #Brexit #Lab18
@piersmorgan @GMB #Brexit isn't  simple but people deserve clear honest answers. That's what we're trying to do at our new website  - you might want to specifically check out the 'Leave with No Deal' PDF with many voices of experience / industries
If there's no General Election. I have passed more meaningful bowel motions than this. It still leaves a 'mandate' for a Labour #Brexit if there is a GE. Then what?Is this what 86% of @UKLabourMembers really want?
Len McCluskey says #Brexit referendum should only offer deal or no-deal options. That's what Theresa May wants to offer Parliament. A 'socialist' in bed with the far-right of the Tory party! #PeoplesVote #Lab18
Leave mean Leave spokesman stating a #PeoplesVote would disenfranchise those who voted for #Brexit.Disenfranchise = deny a vote..like happened to c. 5m UK/EU citizens directly affected, in the EURef.All voters including #Brexiters would get a #FinalSay U ****!#Remain #FBPE
Brendan Howlin is now calling for UK citizens to be made vote and vote until they come up with the right result in #Brexit.Europrats bullied Ireland into #Lisbon2,  fundamentally damaging democracy & eroding trust in the institutions. Methinks UK will not be so easily bullied
"Growing number"? We could count how many Conservatives back a 2nd referendum on our fingers. The rest believe in democracy and wouldn't do something as dishonest as stand on a manifesto commitment to deliver full Brexit and then go back on it#Brexit
.@DavidLammy is absolutely right on @BBCr4today:- Tory MPs tell us they will not vote for an early election;- #Brexit is already hitting families hard; - we need an UNEQUIVOCAL commitment to a #PeoplesVote; and,- Remain MUST be an option in any #PeoplesVote.#Simples
Labour motion: if we are forced into it, we’ll back a #peoplesvote & won’t tell you how we’ll campaign. @libdems policy: we want to stop #Brexit & a #peoplesvote is essential. Without it we would withdraw Article 50. If you want to stop Brexit, join Lib Dems.
Labour motion on #Brexit commits only to seeking a general election before a #PeoplesVote. There is no commitment that a promise to hold a #PeoplesVote will feature in a Labour manifesto. Labour election position will be: vote for us: We'll do #Brexit but better than the Tories.
It's genuinely gotten to the point where I couldn't give a shit whether there's another #Brexit referendum or not.I just want to get rid of the nasty leeching Tories and make the UK a fairer place to live.What I do know is that, in EU or out, life would be better under Labour
McDonnell confirms the #Labour fudge on @BBCBreakfast. "We respect the result of the #Referendum."  Only if no #GE will @uklabour call for a #PeoplesVote. A vote for Labour IS a vote for #BrexitNO, DEFINITELY NOT GOOD ENOUGH 
Labour back second #Brexit vote if there's no general election NOT a vote on the terms of any deal with the EU but a vote DESIGNED to OVERTURN the first referendum Let that sink in in Labour Leave heartlandsYet another #BrexitBetrayal
So no change...no commitment...no #Remain option...more #Brexit fudge...less time left..NOT BLOODY GOOD ENOUGH!Simple Majority, Binding #PeoplesVote for a Binary #FinalSayAccept the #BrexitShambles OR#Reject #Revoke #Remain #Reform#FBPE #ABTV
I find lies like this  plastered the length of the country to whip up xenophobic fears and drive voters to #Brexit self harm really offensive. Why not travel to London on 20 October where you can see a million of us saying "Bollocks to Brexit" for yourself? #PeoplesVoteMarch
'I think the Conservatives should be held to account for the last two years that they’ve wasted. The reckless way that they’ve treated the economy'Labour MP @johnmcdonnellMP speaks on a second #Brexit referendum this morning. 
How ignorant and stupid can you get. Peace is maintained by not making the mistakes that lead to wars. The EU was a response to the folly of the post WW1 peace settlement which created the conditions that led to WW2. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
Here we have it, Labour leadership will have to be dragged kicking and screaming to a #PeoplesVote and no guarantee that they would support a Remain option on the ballot. Labour will not fight #Brexit, they will only fight for power. 
17) this has been a calm #brexit thread, so it's not great to end on a "punchline", but the reality is Corbyn has showed far more respect for (mostly Tory) Leave Voters than the hopes & wishes of his own membersLabour is not a democracy anymore#LabourConference2018
"#Brexit is more damaging than the financial crisis, and the damage will be more lasting." The trick Brexiters played was to channel resentment at austerity & deprivation against the EU.They'll find other scapegoats for economic collapse post-Brexit.
I wish we could oust our Tory MP Dominic Grieve in Beaconsfield constituency - he has been trying to thwart #Brexit despite his constituents voting by a majority to #Leave
I know some nice people on this platform asking for #peoplesvote I don’t condemn them for having that opinion. I realise why they think that this is the way to prevent #Brexit but in reality they are actually supporting the gobshites that got us into this mess in the first place.
#Brexit: 100s of young Labour activists flock to newly created app to push party to back new ref.Don't let #Corbyn, McDonnell, Gardiner & McClusky misappropriate the #PeoplesVote..it's not theirs..it's the Peoples & it has a #Remain option at its heart!
Word is, yet another general election. #Brexit is so toxic, Cons want to hand it over to Labour, so that it'll be THEIR failure & nobody will ever vote for them again. And that's how Brexit will save the Tory Party.Don't fall for it #Labour! Give us a #PeoplesVote & #StopBrexit
In the event a snap General Election is called, will you lend @UKLabour your vote if their policy is still for a 'jobs first' #Brexit and they do not support a #PeoplesVote with an option to #Remain?Please vote and retweet for the best sample. Thank you.
Come on peeps this is vital...Jo & team have won the referral to the ECJ to consider our unilateral ability to #RevokeA50, stop #Brexit & #Remain in the EU with Rebate etc intact.Please give what you can to.the battle fundYou Country Needs You!Lets also get that #PeoplesVote

Retweet if you think these four Dalek egg cosies would be better at negotiating #Brexit than Theresa May's Tories 
Tory #Brexit combines two facets into a toxic & destructive mix. One is the pursuit of a Brexit tax haven regardless of the suffering & harm that inflicts. The other is an English nationalism infused with imperialist arrogance that knows little of Ireland and cares even less. 
BBC caller - For the government to play chicken with other people's lives & livelihoods is entirely irresponsible... so a #PeoplesVote is absolutely essential.#FBPE #bbcaq #brexit 
Perhaps you remember the draft legislation produced by the Government to ensure animals are recognised as sentient beings after #Brexit? If so, your memory seems better than the politicians’! Remind @MichaelGove to take action for animals:  #ProtectTheBill
Discussion on #Brexit motion underway. But while Watson/Umunna/Lammy all publicly calling for a clear cut motion on ‘people’s vote’ behind scenes expectation that GMB will fold & fudge will win out. “Jeremy’s got a total grip on this conference” says one senior figure #Lab18
Roy Hattersley - A #PeoplesVote is essential... the idea it's undemocratic to consult the people, about what they want, is farcical.. this is #brexit reality... do you want to face reality or do you want something different & better.#FBPE #Lab18
If they decide *not* to include #Remain as a voting option in a #PeoplesVote then the whole exercise will be rejected by the @peoplesvote_uk movement.The whole point of a #FinalSay referendum is for the British people to be given an opportunity to REJECT #Brexit#EndTheChaos
I would go as far to say that those who are calling for second referendum are endangering Britain securing a reasonable deal. EU under such circumstances would offer worst possible settlement  to encourage voters to reverse previous decision. #Brexit

If #Labour becomes a party of and for the metropolitan university-educated middle class it’s over #Brexit
Brexit is being attacked by Remoaners and this woman is going to bring about a Brexit-in-name-Only (BINO). @UKIP are the only party fighting for a true #Brexit. Come and join us, help us to become an INDEPENDENT Nation again. 
On the biggest issue of day Corbyn shows no leadership at all. He is delegating his entire policy on Brexit to Labour members. He cannot give a straight answer to a simple question. He is weak and there to be led. Imagine if he were PM#marr #Lab18 #corbyn #Brexit #PeoplesVote

So it comes down to this, defeat Chequers, call a GE, vote out the Tories and Tory #Brexit, vote for Corbyn and a @UKLabour Brexit? No fucking way! We are the King Makers. The two main parties would do well to remember that.#peoplesvote with an option to #Remain
German word of the day ‘Weltschmerz’ (n.) - the feeling of depression that comes on when you compare the current state of the world with how it could be ideally. #Brexit
.@sandyofipswich 83% of Ipswich's constituents think that Brexit has dragged on too long  and the sooner it is finished, the better. Do you therefore uphold the  2016 EU referendum result to ensure that Brexit is completed quickly?#Lab18 #Democracy #Brexit 
WATCH: Malcolm is a Labour councillor and member and he believes the Labour Party should demand a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit to support its membership. #PVForTheMany #Lab18
When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of September 23, 2018 at 05:50PM, £1 buys 1.1118€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Research and development in full swing here in #Lincolnshire as we prepare for a green #brexit 
We have seen trade unions increasingly backing a #FinalSay – they know #Brexit will be bad for workers & jobs.If @jeremycorbyn cannot bring himself to do the right thing for the country & shift position on #Brexit, then he should not be considered leader of official opposition.
"People will think we're mad."@PeterBoneUK says a general election to save #Brexit would be 'pointless'.Read the latest on Brexit here, as @jeremycorbyn's under pressure to back a second referendum vote:  
To the armchair warriors threatening civil disorder if #Brexit is stopped, look what happened when people realised the real cost of the Poll Tax.#Brexit will be a hundred times more painful to the average families pocket. I wouldn't admit to being a #Brexiter. Rope is cheap.
.@yasinmpbedford 58% of Beford constituents believe that regardless of an MP's personal  views, they should respect the 2016 EU referendum result in Parliament.  Is this still your position? #LAB18 #Brexit #LabourConference2018
The best @UKLabour MEPs are here in #Liverpool today to support a #PeoplesVote are you listening @jeremycorbyn?!?! The people are speaking and they demand a #FinalSay  if the #Brexit deal is no good then we should bin it! #StopBrexit @RCorbettMEP @julie4nw @JasonJHunter
At the front of the #SaveBrexit bus:- Richard Tice, multimillionaire property developer & disaster capitalist- Nigel Farage, tax dodger, expenses fiddler & friend to far-right extremists worldwideThe man who bankrolled their #Brexit campaign cosied up to Putin's mafia state. 
#LabourConference2018To all my fellow remainers.Would you give your support to labour if they in turn support a #PeoplesVote with a remain option?#Brexit #FBPE please rt
Labour now moving towards this intellectually incoherent LibDem position; supporting a second #Brexit referendum (because people have the right to change their mind but opposing a second #indyref (because people don’t have the right to change their mind.) Go figure.
A lovely sight, as more than 5000 @UKLabour members and supporters arrive at the #PVFortheMany rally in #Liverpool, to call on delegates to support motions calling for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal at this week's party conference.@peoplesvote_uk
At the @peoplesvote_uk #MarchForTheMany earlier. With Government #brexit negotiations in chaos, and the increasing likelihood of us crashing out with no deal, the people must be given the final say on Brexit. #peoplesvote.
David Davis: Think you can Bully our country, read some history books!We don’t just LOVE our countryWe BELIEVE in our countryIt's astonishing, a small islandSo powerfulSo successfulSo influentialSo affectiveSo magnificentGreat Britain!#Brexit #EU
In summary; no matter how disastrous #Brexit is for Scotland it must be our fate to remain in the UK. Under all circumstances. The Union trumping all other considerations. Not a winning message for Scottish Labour I suspect.... 
Excellent news. An EU court ruling on #Brexit. That should stop all the anti-EU feeling in the UK.
Labour, you are every bit as deluded and disingenuous as the Tories. This is just a string of ludicrous words that are not possible. Our country deserves representation which deals in facts not fantasy. #brexit is a disaster and labour are trying to decorate it with fairy lights 
#Lab18If the Labour party agree to a #PeoplesVote with an option to remain then they get my support and I would supect millions of others too. #Brexit #FBPE
Have had numerous messages this weekend from Constituents who voted Remain now wanting speedy withdrawal from EU due to appalling conduct of @eucopresident and his fellow unelected officials towards our PM. More and more people realising our long term interest not in EU #Brexit

About to speak at the #MarchForTheMany in Liverpool. We are calling on @UKLabour to support a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. We do not have to do this. We can still stop Brexit. 
With Labour looking likely to support a 2nd ReferendumHow did you vote in the 1st referendum & How will you vote in the 2nd referendum?#Brexit #2ndReferendumPlease VOTE, & RETWEET this poll
Dear @BBCNews It’s time to get @JasonJHunter on to national programmes, such as @BBCr4today or #bbcqt. His level of understanding of trade and the impact on the U.K. of #Brexit is light years ahead of our politicians. He’s a real expert and we need them more thanever these days. 
Labour currently describing their plans to force Scotland & Northern Ireland out of the EU against our democratic wishes & refusing us any say on the matter as "uniting" the country.I think you'll find the correct word for that is "subjugating" not "uniting".#Brexit #ScotRef
Fantastic turnout at our #PeoplesVote March for the Many. We estimate at least 5000 braving wind and rain in Liverpool to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal #PVForTheMany #Lab18
#Brexit people and the #MAGA’ts are two peas in a pod: petulant little children who want to have their cake and eat it, too. #Brexiteers: we demand ALL the benefits of EU membership with none of the sacrifice.#MAGA’ts: we want all the benefits, zero deficits AND no taxes.
Staying in EU should not be option in any Brexit second referendum, says Unite's McCluskey  #Lab18 #Brexit
Hang on. Jeremy Corbyn admits #Brexit was a protest vote against policies in THIS country. He admits it is damaging our country and the most vulnerable. YET HE HAS SUPPORTED IT FROM THE DAY AFTER. What am I missing here? Oh yea an opposition. #WATON #Remain #Stopbrexit
A second referendum would show the public that the political class holds them in contempt. #Lab18 #Brexit 
NO DEAL NOW! #Brexit  
Rees-Mogg and the ERG:1. Push PM to make demands the EU is certain to reject.2. Scream EU bullying when it rejects the demands, knowing that the Brexit billionaire press will amplify the message and ignore the hypocrisy. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #Brexit

PM has lose control of her party & #Chequers hits the rocks. Our country’s future cannot be left to the flip of a coin, with a bad #Brexit outcome whichever side it lands on. #ExitFromBrexit
The #EU’s greatest fear is #BrexitBritain succeeds because the EU’s very existence will be proven worthless.

At People's Vote March at St George's Hall. Terrific turnout. Very strong msg here to stop #Brexit 
Via ⁦@JohnRentoul⁩ (and also Tony Blair) this. Just this. FGS ⁦@UKLabour⁩ get your act together. #Brexit is going to massively damage the people you are supposed to be fighting for. Get on that you self-absorbed fools. History is going to be very unkind to you all. 
McCluskey-good grief if ever there was a good reason to have mandatory retirement age for union leaders he is surely it. The grizzled old fool happy to sacrifice his members jobs and future to crash out to  “achieve” his socialist dream-#Labourshambles #Brexit
The characteristics of Brexit were told to voters even by remainers. #Brexit meant leaving the #singlemarket #customsunion, #EUcourts, ending #freemovement, ending #EUfees, signing #tradedeals & reclaiming our #fishingwaters. A deal that doesn’t deliver these things is a betrayal
We've got to the moment where the villagers show up with flaming torches demanding Dr Frankenstein cease his crazed experiment.And he assures them that the creature is perfectly harmless & that any problems are down to their lack of belief in his genius.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
Says Rees-Mogg who has spent several weeks attacking Chequers and undermining the PM. One wonders how any normal human being could to stoop to such cynical and shameless hypocrisy. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
If Helen McEntee is the best @finegael have to put forward to fight Ireland's #brexit corner, we are truly f**ked.#twip
When Dominic Rabb was asked today if he had been to Northern Ireland, he replied ‘I've been to Dublin’. Having this man negotiate on this issue, is a deep insult to the people of Ireland, and a grave disrespect to our history and suffering under colonial rule. #Marr #Brexit
Bumped into the lovely ⁦@EdMiliband_MP⁩ on the train. Off to ⁦@UKLabour⁩ conference to press the case for a #PeoplesVote and an end to #Brexit  
#Corbyn not a clue what to do about #Brexit on #Marr. This country's in deep trouble.
If #LabourConference were to block #Brexit it would be worse than a crime it would be a blunder. A #KhakiElection would then follow. May for Britain #Corbyn for the #EU. The Tories would win. Bigly.
David Coburn MEP  - "The British people have not changed their minds and, if anything, they are more in favour of #Brexit than before because they do not like the way we have been treated by our so-called European allies."These people are supposed to be our friends." 
9 out of 10 Labour Party members back a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Join us from midday at the #MarchForTheMany #Lab18  @peoplesvote_uk
If only more British businesses were bold & brave enough to speak out against #Brexit as vocally as @PimlicoPlumbers Round of applause for Charlie Mullins OBE for putting up the BIGGEST #BOLLOCKSTOBREXIT sign in UK#StopBrexit#FlushBrexit & save British business!
Jeremy Corbyn has said he will back a second #Brexit referendum if it is supported by a conference of his party. A significant development, Labour finally providing an alternative voice in this debate, probably on foot of a poll showing 86% of Lab members want 2nd vote!
Scotland had a vote on #brexit and the wishes of 62% of our people were ignored. For the #secondreferendum if we vote the same way but England votes to leave, Scotland again gets ignored Why would we support that? Welcome any answer on this from fans of #PeoplesVote
Ditto on this. We all witnessed the Russian bots pushing #Brexit and bigging up Farage etc. We know of Arron Banks' extensive and questionable Russian links. But unlike the US no UK law enforcement agency is probing Putin's impact on the EU ref 
Nigel Farage - "I thought we had won the referendum and it was all over but we have got to go and fight back and fight back hard."Today the people’s army is being remobilised." #Brexit 
But where's the analysis of the IRA/Cambridge Analytica impact on #Brexit? Non-existent because the govt refuse to force Facebook and Twitter to give up the data.

Still seeing Labour members and voters talking about #brexit. FFS you're just making it easy for the Tories. Keep your fucking mouths shut or you'll blow it for all of us.

If @UKLabour back a second #Brexit referendum then I’m afraid they will have handed Theresa May a massive pr boost. As @georgegalloway says she’ll hold a snap UK v EU #KhakiElection & win it. It’ll be her ‘Falklands moment’ .
If #UKIP hadn’t made a wholesale lurch towards Brownshirt street fascism and anti-Muslim race-baiting this would have been their moment #Brexit
.@SophyRidgeSky asks @tom_watson if a pledge for a people's vote will be in Labour's manifesto if members back a new vote at conference.He says it's "inconceivable" that the party would not respect members' calling for a new #Brexit vote #Ridge
Senior @Conservatives MP @NickyMorgan01 says she does not "support a second referendum" as it is the responsibility of  MPs to "step up and sort out" a #Brexit plan otherwise democracy will be in "big trouble" #Ridge
This is the full & final list of CLPs that have passed a contemporary motion for #Lab18 on Brexit - the overwhelming majority of which call for the party to back a #PeoplesVoteThanks to you, we can change @UKLabour policy this week. Thanks to you, #Brexit is not inevitable

Do Labour have a definitive position on anything? #Brexit #Indyref2
That's strange. What we get on the doors most often is a sense of pragmatism; people saying let's get on with it and move on to the bread and butter issues of Governance. #Brexit 
Has Jeremy Corbyn finally found his wot-nots on #brexit or is he just rolling over and giving in? My #SundayMorning question for you...
Dear @JuliaHB1 the rest of us have opinions that are fact based, consisting of more than empty threats & mantras. We will have a #PeoplesVote.Nobody wants Chequers.U & Gov’t have no idea which #Brexit u voted for so how can they get on with it?Yours, people in the real world 
If ELEVEN #Brexit organisations are endorsing Pro-Brexit Facts4EU's 'Brexit Battle Pack', shouldn't you take a look? It's free and gives you the tools to fight back against Remainer MPs & media! 
Should the UK have another General Election before Brexit? - #Brexit: Labour 'would back members' on new vote, says leadership  #GeneralElectionNow RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters
For Ireland’s sake, but also for British workers and their children’s future, I hope the @UKLabour Conference does seek a 2nd #Brexit referendum. While I’m there, I’ll certainly be arguing that democracy does permit people to change their minds when new information is available. 
#Brexit is the single biggest issue the UK has faced in over 70 years. Started by xenophobic UKIP & adopted by the hateful Tories. Relations have soured internally & internationally; our reputation has plummeted. A bloody-minded PM. A weak opposition leader.We are in crisis.
#LPC #LabourConference “I'm hard-left, hard-remain”:grassroots bid for #Labour support for referendum on #Brexit deal 
"Jeremy Corbyn says he WILL back demands for a second #Brexit referendum if party activists demand one at conference"  Labour and democracy just don't go well together, eh comrade? 
Well there we have it: @UKLabour cannot be trusted on #Brexit .Despite claiming at the last election that they respected the #PeoplesVote of 2016 they now use political opportunism to try to force instability/a GE at this most critical of times. The public aren’t fools...
GMB is another group to join our fight against a Tory disastrous #Brexit. When will Corbyn listen & stop betraying his party’s supporters? It is time he took charge and found the political courage to provide the people with what they deserve: a #FinalSayOnTheDeal

Sunday reading for Brexiteers - A second #Brexit article today, on the uncomfortable fact for Remainer Labour MPs about the Single Market:

#Brexit: UK is now in the middle of its deepest political crisis since Suez 
Still waiting for some benefits of a no deal #Brexit. Had waffle about a period of readjustment, the millenium bug and Stephen Hawking being wrong about acid rain, but no actual substance from the Editor of the Sunday Express. 
Ireland is the EU. Bilateral trade deals are not an option. #brexit 
#Brexit is a crime against poor who are struggling to feed their families, the disabled and vulnerable, the Migrants who helped rebuild UK after tragic WW2 and more recent migrants who care for our sick, the elderly and help feed the nation!  #StopBrexit #FBPE #peoplesVote
So...the STRANGEST thing happened on Friday! I went on @LBC UK with @eddiemair to give my reaction, as an opera singer from & based in R.O.I. & working chiefly in UK, to the current #Brexit impasse! I may have sang a bit also!  @gavreilly @MichealLehane
If #LabourConference betrays #Brexit with #UKIP lurching towards race- baiting #Fascism the Tories will stage an early #KhakiElection with #May “standing up for Britain” and #Corbyn “in league with the #EU”. The Tories would win a landslide victory. And Britain a very ugly place.
As #Brexit descends into a chaotic mess that threatens millions of livelihoods, you might think Brexiters would take some share of responsibility.But no. They'll always blame anyone but themselves, as @MitchBenn observes.#PeoplesVote
I can't help you I'm dealing with #Brexit Lol! x 
Thank you @jeremycorbyn.We believe #Lab18 will vote to back a #PeoplesVote, because #Brexit is a right wing project that hits hardest those who have least.Thank you for confirming that if we win the vote, party policy will change. Democracy in action  
He said not a single job lost.He said we held all the cards on #BrexitSo anyone with any integrity or honesty would admit "I got it dreadfully wrong, I helped put the UK in this precarious position, I'm sorry"A chancer of course blames everyone else for his mistakes 
Well that'll be no vote for @UKLabour from me then Mr McDonnell @johnmcdonnellMP. You want #Brexit? You can do it without my support. 
There was to be no government running commentary on #Brexit negotiations. So instead, here is my running commentary on #Brexit negotiation milestones:Jun 2016 Fuck all achieved Jun 2017 Fuck all achievedJun 2018 Fuck all achievedSept 2018 Fuck all achieved
Agreed @georgegalloway. The Leave votes are basically stacked up in English Marginal seat where GE’s are won. Labour’s electoral prospects are about to be vaporised. The Tories are praying Tom Watson and the rest of the Europhile goons fall into the elephant trap. #Brexit
It's just the level of basic knowledge and basic facts - stuff you could get on one page of A4 - that confounds in the #Brexit debate. How can big sections of our political class be *so* ill-informed?
Defeat for #OpenSelection and victory for #Blair second #Brexit referendum spells disaster for @UKLabour #LabourConference2018
A new #Brexit vote ?  46% against 48 %. ...was the result To have another vote ? Will cloud the issue even further !  Call an election !
The @LibDems are edging forwards & offering a glimmer of hope to the millions of people worried by the incompetence & extremism of the politicians running the @Conservatives & @UKLabourSupport the @LibDems if you want to oppose #Brexit & get a kinder & more tolerant society.

If it's true that both @jeremycorbyn and @tom_watson are backing a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit if Labour members want it - then the political landscape has drastically changed.
One of the reasons they don’t want to shed light on the manipulation of the #Brexit vote. The Tories are compromised at all levels.
#Brexit is 'an absolute disaster' and Theresa May 'a disgrace', Sir Bob Geldof says  via @GibChronicle #Gibraltar

Narrow ideologues, doctrinaire Lexiteers, Putinapologists  and revolutionary catastrophists will hate @tom_watson's timely intervention calling for reconsideration of #Brexit. But nobody who really cares about future of ordinary people in this country will have a problem
Retweet if you think Kenny the wombat would be better at negotiating #Brexit than Theresa May's Tories 
Very heartening to see such strong support for EU membership and a #PeoplesVote among Labour members. Whatever the present difficulties it gives one hope about the future of British politics. #Brexit
#Brexit it's all gone to shit there is no back up plan, no real plan for no deal, we're all screwed, I'm writing this from our secret bunker I'm a whistleblower, this tweet will get deleted soon by MI5, so run now, head for Dover leave the UK save yourselves!

Here is the truth of it,Most of these people will never see the results of their actions,They will all be dead,The #Brexit vote to leave the #EU in #Wales was the single greatest political harm we have ever inflicted on ourselves,And it's our children that'll suffer...
Cold hard reality *All* brexits are Tory brexits.  From the far right, based on regressive values, supported by a majority of conservatives & a minority of Labour.  Any possible #Brexit will damage jobs & Labour's supporters  There is no Labour Brexit, it's myth 
This is the same Ms Hair who didn't vote in the #Brexit referendum because she found the issues too complicated.

In @TheGreenParty we believe people should have the final say on whether to accept the #Brexit deal or remain in the EU. But this is more important than party politics, as @sianberry makes clear we will work with other politicians to secure a #PeoplesVote
Theresa May has no respect for the disenfranchised 16-17 year olds, Brits abroad for 15+ years and EU27 nationals, or the majority opposed to #Brexit. No respect for anyone except tax and regulation hating libertarian fanatics & xenophobic bigots.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote

11) So here is the real question for Corbyn supporters.#Brexit is essentially a victory for all of the attitudes Labour supposedly stands against. It is an attack on the hopes & futures of young people & those most hit by austerityIts a movement of intolerance & division
I’m sure I’m not alone in thinking now’d be good time for @DMiliband to re-enter front-line politics. The UK needs his experience & clear articulation on  #brexit I’m also sure I’m not alone in thinking Labour are no longer the vehicle for him to do that.
Hi @DominicRaab It’s a bit awkward that you’re no platforming young people’s views on #Brexit.... Blocking @FFSake_ and @OFOCBrexit isn’t really going to help much with your terrible “negotiations”. It’s like you genuinely aren’t interested in future generations #FFS
I'm not proposing that we should adopt the Euro, but it has to be noted that for ordinary people and businesses travelling and trading around Europe, the Euro and Schengen are absolutely fantastic. #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE
6) This "austerity=brexit" is a deeply cynical ploy to excuse Labour for supporting #Brexit, and to tie one issue (albeit an important one) to anotherIt also provides the cheap shot of "well if you support Remain you support the status quo of austerity you selfish Elitist"
#GinaMiller, the anti-Brexit campaigner who took #UKGov to court to win Parliament's right to have a say on #Brexit, is now pushing for #thepeople to have a new say on the final Brexit options. Hear the interview on the @Reasons2Remain Facebook page. Link: 
At #LabourConference I aim to passionately pursue my dream of greater democratic power for the membership, except on any important issue where I passionately disagree with the dreams of the membership for greater democratic power. #Brexit
As #Brexit approaches it is important to ensure that Scotland & the UK do not lose our world leading scientists, or lose opportunities to lead major international research collaborations and clinical trials. We must ensure these things do not happen, but there remains concern. 
1) Austerity, #Brexit and fake narratives1 of 2 threads on fake Brexit narratives doing the roundsSome Labour types have continually tried to tie Brexit to Austerity as an excuse for Labour's Brexit appeasement - "we must respect the causes"This, frankly, is nonsense 
The #kendal #cumbria #brexitometer results are in! Good conversations with people of all views. Many #leave voters (green dots) having doubts about #brexit and wanting a #peoplesvote
Now at Tescos in Shrewsbury. Please remember EU protectionist racket means inefficient EU growers preferred to other non EU Mediterranean growers,due to massive tariffs imposed by EU. This leads to you paying more for your products! No more after March 2019! #Brexit 
Proud to sign this letter because no-one should win by cheating. There are international norms and standards which the U.K. referendum failed to observe #Brexit

So much for leadership and compassion for all those worried and actually experiencing damage  - this is from a senior Labour Shadow Minister , posted in response to Labour’s silence during the intenisying #Brexit crisis… 
At #UKIPConf talking to @ITVWales about why the @AssemblyWales should be abolished and how this policy gives @UKIPWales a purpose after #Brexit. It’s time for the Welsh voters to be offered a referendum on the existence of the Welsh Assembly @UKIP @UKIPWales #ForTheNation
Life is difficult enough as it is.  We are so lucky and privileged in the UK and have so much going for us. To self harm, create a crisis, divide the country and ignore what really matters for the good of our people is madness. We can’t allow this to happen #brexit
Rees-Mogg: A better plan is Canada-plus free trade deal for whole UK & solve Irish problem by looking at EU’s concerns, its rules & how it applies them on other borders.So solution is available much better than Chequers that ties us to #EU rules.#Brexit

I’ve had enough of the British press talking about the ‘Irish border problem’. I think you’ll find it’s a British border in Ireland and the problem is not Irish! #brexit #brexshit

I’ve moved my @ERC_Research grant from the UK, partly because of #Brexit. But let’s not forget the UK’s ideological disrespect of the cultural heritage sector (jobs are scarce & salaries laughable, we are paid less than construction workers or admin staff)
Retweet if you think this baby koala chewing a eucalyptus leaf would be better at negotiating #Brexit than Theresa May 
Scottish politicians behind a legal bid to cancel #Brexit last night welcomed a victory in their battle to get their case heard by the European Court of Justice. 
Mmmm. @Jeremy_Hunt - the man who handled the junior doctors' dispute with such panache - is stepping into the #Brexit debate and advising the EU how to behave. If they don't comply, will he try to enforce #Brexit on the EU?
Just watched @CNN & the headlines were all about #Trump & #Brexit. Absolutely nothing about the #Ahvaz attack. This is just like last summer when 12 people died in #Tehran and hardly any coverage was provided. Media outlets cannot & should not pick and choose what deaths matter.
I'm sick of reading and thinking about #Trump and #Brexit. We need a break, so here's a nice picture of a puppy with a hat on. 
What's ripping my knitting today?The idea that #Brexit is necessary to prevent RW thugs throwing a tantrumHow the fuck did the UK become hostage to fascists? Is this how we deal with them; by whimpering & saying "Please don't stamp on my face?"

John McDonnell's view on #Brexit:Election between a party who wants an impossible cake & eat it deal & a party who wants an impossible cake & eat it dealThis will give people real choices on Brexit and is far better than a #PeoplesVote apparently
This is how the media feed on each other's lies: The Guardian wrongly implies that McDonnell has ruled out another referendum and then Matt Frei repeats that lie on his #LBC show. @LBC #Brexit
When Theresa May and her No.10 team realise that getting pat on the back headlines from the Tory press isn’t the same thing as getting a good #Brexit deal... 
Threatening to push the British people off the no-deal cliff so that a tiny elite minority can make disaster capitalist profits and get themselves a low-tax, low-regulation, low-welfare #Brexit tax haven is not tough, it is criminal. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

I'm going to go shopping today. I'll make  what I think is a fair offer. If it's not accepted I'll take it as a mark of disrespect, go home and wait for the shop to contact me with their revised offer. Only a matter of time until they crack. I'll show them who's boss.#Brexit
When will Labour understand that there is no jobs first #Brexit and the terms the EU can offer will be worse than EU membership? Delusional people chasing unicorns 
if anyone wonders how government propaganda works in Britain they can take a look at the front pages of today's UK newspapers and get an idea how Theresa May's failure to negotiate #Brexit properly is turned into her finest hour. And the beauty is that the nation buys that crap.
I argued in June 2016 that #Brexit would be bad for Wales. Now we know that beyond question. Wales has NO SEAT AT THE TABLE; UK Tories have lost the plot; UK #Labour do nothing; Lab Welsh Govt hand EU withdrawal powers to Westminster.Think #independence.
S#Brexiters are hitting the media claiming it's the EU's fault that Chequers was rejected and that the EU has to come up with another plan. Why, the UK is walking, it wasn't kicked out. Time is tight, so here's your plan B. Postpone or cancel #Brexit. There sorted it for you.

YOU give it a rest.YOU serve us.We don’t serve you.Do what you’re elected to do, or don’t be in politics.Too many anti democratic, condescending, sneering politicians like you.That’s why trust in our politics is so low.#Brexit 
This makes it very clear where the Labour Party leadership stands on #Brexit. This is a position to which @TheGreenParty is entirely opposed. We want to #StopBrexit with the only democratic way forward from here, a #PeoplesVote 
@BBCRadio4 How dare @jeremy_hunt claim that Remainers will now want to speed up #Brexit because the #EU is threatening to break up the UK. One of the many reasons to #Remain is that we knew all along that Brexit, not our #EU partners, brought this very threat. #r4Today
Latest @YouGov @thetimes poll. In hindsight #Brexit right 40 (-2); wrong; 47 (+1). Equals record high wrong lead (recorded in May). Polling all/mostly pre-#Salzburg ???

Does @theresa_may not see the irony of her response to #indyref2 when she said to Scotland "Why would you leave your biggest trading partner?" Um, #Brexit ??? As a Cornishman in Scotland - bring it on #DissolveTheUnion
'A new referendum could stop #Brexit destroying this country's heartlands – it’s up to #Labour to make that a reality'
Extraordinary to see how many papers and columnists are seduced by May’s outburst on #Brexit, despite being such a distortion of reality. Guess it shows the seductive power of jingoism
Thanks to Martin Hannan & @ScotNational for a careful & accurate report of this landmark case in which I’m proud to be a party & proud of Scottish Supreme Court #Brexit - European judges to have final say on Scottish Article 50 case -

You spend 40 years in an unhappy marriage with someone, they cheat on you with 27 other people. They are overly controlling, take your stuff, use you, deny you individuality, then when you have the balls to call it off they guilt trip & bully you. #Brexit 
The EEA is a viable, stable, amicable means of exit. It is a whole UK solution which obviates the need for a customs union or an NI backstop. Theresa May and the ERG have lied through their teeth about it. It is their conscious choice to destroy British jobs.   #Brexit
Theresa May now rails against the #Brexit choice between Norway style EEA membership and a Canadian style trade deal.  But it is her own red lines that have made the current situation inevitable & the #EU illustrated that well  in a slide published on 19th December last year

Theresa May's modus operandi on #Brexit to date is to deliver a pre-scripted speech which sounds tough. Then she goes quiet for a few months and privately does the opposite of what she said publiclyThis time she cannot afford to go soft on the EU

I just accidentally heard this fraud’s laughable  attempt at Thatcherite macho. First thought: she’s relying on the hope that we are a nation with the memory of a goldfish. The reality: she’s relying on the belief that we live in a nation with the IQ of a goldfish. #scum #brexit 
Hi Ruth our group is in your party and we'd prefer you stand up for our membership of the #EU as we voted Remain and you said you'd fight for Scotland. You haven’t you have turned your back on your constituents. #brexit was rejected in Scotland.
TM has not treated the EU with "nothing but respect" during the #Brexit negotiations. The arrogant and bombastic Lancaster House speech threatened withdrawal of security cooperation if the EU did not cave in to UK demands. Hard to imagine anything more disrespectful to allies.

Yes there was a humiliation in Salzburg but it was Theresa May's alone. It's hardly the first time she's been told the single market is indivisible and that Chequers cannot work. She's been slapped down publicly for not listening to what she is told. She's embarrassing. #Brexit
They only have to look & see who is batting for their side.#Brexit is nothing to do with Left/Right, it's totally the Remain establishment against the working population of the UK.Freedom only matters, when you're the one in chains. 
3) The Tories put together a #brexit plan not based on what was workable or good for the country but on what they could barely accept between themselves. They then fought over this deeply flawed & compromised fantasy whilst trying to convince themselves it was the actual deal
1) @BBC & #Brexit in a nutshellThe Chequers plan was widely reported as unworkableOther media were reporting how the Tories were fighting over a pointless proposal deal@bbcnickrobinson *must* have known this & yet like others in the BBC he's calling it a "slap in the face"
Our position on #Brexit  is to bring the government down. The best interests of our nation can go hang. The End.

Impressed by the tough rhetoric of PM against the EU. Though we should have seen this previously. Now please drop #chequers, demonstrate strength by reining in doomongering chancellor & Bus/Sec. And let's delivery the #BREXIT people voted for.
I'm a privileged. Brexit took its toll on me two years ago when people stopped paying for what our business offers. We recovered because we can.It wont be so easy for others and that, my friends, is why #brexit must not happen and I will do my small part to stop it#PeoplesVote
I’m hoping against hope that when #brexit negotiations head towards the wire that a good deal will emerge. But if we face no-deal then we should have another referendum because it’s clear a no-deal Brexit will harm the poorest people in the UK most

There is no party - it’s a grass roots movement and we are all very proud of it and each other.  We have  a range of political leanings a range of opinions we are united by a belief that #brexit is a massive mistake.  Viva #fbpe @chesterforeu

Or - and here's the kicker... perhaps they don't respect a country adopting nazi-esque tactics and pushing the "will of the people" line despite the fact that... #Brexit is no longer the will or the people?

The #Brexit debacle illustrates why we must never give up even a little bit of sovereignty.

Isn’t it time to stop using stupid phrases? What “deep and special partnership” is there? What “friends” do we have among EU neighbours? These friendships and partnerships were bought and paid for by UK taxpayers for decades - one of the many reasons for the vote for #Brexit.
Just when you thought the #Brexit situation couldn't get anymore bizarre, UKIP conference stalls start flogging Nigel Farage condoms, boldly stating "For when you have a Hard Brexit" I don't think this is going to be a big money spinner for UKIP somehow, more like a hard sell  
Let's not forget, when @Nigel_Farage is on TV/radio bashing the idea of a #PeoplesVote /#FinalSayon #brexit, that back in May 2016 he said 52:48 result it would mean we would need another vote.

The distance between the UK’s demands for #Brexit & the EU’s position of #BRINO is as great as ever. #Chequers was never the answer but a Canada style #FTA is. Let’s hope we can now reset the debate. @theresa_may #PM delivered a robust & welcome speech @10DowningStreet  today.

Speaking with @rtenews this afternoon, Sinn Féin Leader @MaryLouMcDonald gave her reaction to Theresa May's speech on #Brexit"There cannot be a withdrawal agreement without an operable backstop, and there cannot be a withdrawal agreement until Irish interests are protected." 
Only 10% of #Cornwall businesses surveyed are in favour of #Brexit.82% say leaving the EU would have a "negative impact" on them.Fortunately it's still not too late to stop this pointless catastrophe, whatever @Theresa_May would like you to believe.#PeoplesVote
Crashing out because the over 700 agreements we have with the EU cease to be valid on #brexit day without a Withdrawal Agreement and the transition period that goes with it disappears. Your lack of understanding is shocking & irresponsible.
If there is a second referendum on #Brexit, all Boris and co would need to do is drive around the country in a bus with this on the side 
Wrong. A trade deal is not what is being negotiated. A Withdrawal Agreement is & Chequers’ role is what it does to resolve the backstop issue with the Irish border. After all the hot air you spout over #brexit you are still unable to grasp the basics. We will be crashing out.
Yo #TeresaMaySpeech the 'largest  democratic exercise' Ireland has ever under gone - was the 1918 Election in which Republicans won! The British ignored that democratic mandate then & ignoring it now! We don't want war this time - but we'll take a #UnityRef #brexit
Govt’s pursuit of destructive hard #Brexit could sever all ties and put crime & policing in jeopardy.We have long been warning of the risk of losing European Arrest Warrant, information sharing, & more.We cannot let Govt’s ideologies sabotage our security.#ExitFromBrexit
Perhaps because Theresa May is not the beleagured moderate she pretends to be, but the xenophobic authoritarian English nationalist her track record shows her to be. An extremist aiming for a no-deal #Brexit.

A myth the media have peddled on behalf of the Tories is to say “...but Labour’s policy on #Brexit isn’t clear.”Watch Keir Starmer put this lazy journalism right. Labour’s position has always been clear, it’s the media who choose not to report it. 
READ: Despite @theresa_may #Brexit U-turn, #PeoplesVote is still on the table:
How lucky are we to have an amazing negotiator as our @potus? Just look at how badly England’s #Brexit negotiations with the Globalist EU are proceeding under Theresa May.She should ask Trump for help! 
Teresa  May saying " she will not break up her country" , by christ Britain  has broken up more countries than the ice age! #Brexit #BrexitShambles

This man @eucopresident the former Polish PM had gone completely native with EU project. Not showing respect to our PM in negotiations. He dismisses proposals without any concrete alternatives and is doing immeasurable damage to trust and goodwill. #Brexit @rzeczpospolita
Watch: My comments on the PM Theresa May's Downing Street speech. #Brexit #maystatement
"We are discovering as time passes that Brexit is a fundamentally misconceived idea, there is no magic solution". #Brexit #PeoplesVote
The greatest enemy of #Brexit is Brexit. It is now dying right in front of our eyes. After Theresa May’s humiliation at the EU summit in Salzburg, no-one in UK govt knows what happens next. There is only one way out of the gridlock now: #PeoplesVote
Virginia Keyes says ...& I totally agree ..Anyone who still thinks #Corbyn hasn’t absolutely killed this #Brexit shambles is in serious denial....bossed it from day 1. Watched them implode from the sidelines like we all knew they would. My man 
Salzburg debacle shows it’s near impossible to have #Brexit with three unions: sovereignty of UK; economic unity of island of Ireland; and integrity of supranational EU single market incl “four freedoms”. Only Norway option reconcile the three; anything else will break something
The UK government is starting to realise more and more what #Brexit actually means. We are still ready to reach out, but the @EPPGroup will protect the principles of the EU. We should continue working on further progress in the negotiations.
Cambell has a workable & legal plan.You don't.I have a plan.You don't.#PeoplesVote has a plan.You don'tAfter promising a wonderful #Brexit, you don't have anything do you.You can't deliver anything.You have no ideas and don't have a plan.Pathetic.
So @theresa_may demands respect from the #EU. When exactly does she intend to treat the views of the people of #Scotland with respect? #Brexit #BrexitShambles @IanBlackfordMP @Feorlean
James Max tells @Will_DryOFOC to "go live in France if you're that worried about brexit"Will fires back... I think that's an awful thing to say... you're taking the right of young people to live in another European country away through the process of #brexit#peoplesvote #FBPE
At least you can say of the Captain of the Titanic that he didn't deliberately steer his ship into the iceberg... He made a mistake. It was an accident.Unlike @theresa_may he didn't increase speed, grab the wheel and aim headlong towards it, screaming #Brexit means Brexit !

#UPDATE British PM Theresa May hits back at the EU after it roundly rejected her #Brexit plan, saying its refusal to compromise was 'not acceptable' and reiterating the possibility of walking away from negotiations 
The #Trump #Russia #Brexit nexus again. Oh - and @BreitbartLondon described Papadopoulos as a senior aide - unlike other media. So was Bannon in on the act? He was a big booster of both Trump and Farage
Theresa May's reached the end of the road with her #Brexit strategy. It's time to get a grip. Parliament must be reconvened so we can break the logjam in the national interest - then give public the final say in a #PeoplesVote
Let’s not let @campbellclaret and  second ref crowd off the hook either. They’ve undermined Brussels’ incentive to give the UK a fair deal. So long as EUcrats think #Brexit is reversible they have little incentive to negotiate. Campbell et al have served their country v badly
From today's @FinancialTimes #Brexit #SalzburgSummit18 #TheresaMay #ChequersPlan #NoDeal
Announcement from PM suggesting that UK will lead the world on phasing out petrol & diesel vehicles is delusional. Their messy #Brexit will negatively impact our car industry & discourage investment in new, green technology. #ExitFromBrexit
Harry Truman said: the buck stops here.Well Mrs May the same goes for your #Brexit Chequers plan. It was naive of you to expect the EU27 to breach their red lines. You blew it, you own it. Having a public paddy, like a toddler, isn't going to make the EU27 change their stance.
Let’s just not and say we did. #brexit
Dear @NicolaSturgeon , you're a trumped up numpty county councillor. Instead of pontificating on #brexit any chance you can sort out the mess you've made of Health, Education, Transport, Police Scotland & everything else you've made a mess of. Thanks
Going ahead with #Brexit implies a difficult choice:-Either distancing ourselves from the EU, but at great cost to the economy-OR staying close (customsunion, singlemarket) but having to follow rules we won’t have a say on any more. #Salzburg simply confirms you can’t fudge it
Miscalculation the EU made was that we are happy to mock our national figures ourselves, but that doesn’t extend to themBritish people want a #brexit deal, but if the EU keeps treating them this way their support for walking away with no deal will go up and up #PoliticsLive
A national debate on how we’ll spend the 40 BILLION pounds we won’t now be paying the sleazy fat-cats and spivs in Brussels to leave their bankers ramp is now crucial #Labour #Corbyn #Brexit #Moats @talkRADIO
Theresa May has been trying to divide the countries of the EU. She's failed & is now trying to present their clear, united position as bullying.The fact that her own party is deeply divided & full of ruthless #Brexit bullies makes this look especially ludicrous.#MayStatement
After two meltdowns in two days, it's now obvious that Theresa May can't carry on leading our talks with the EU, her rank incompetence is driving us over a cliff, this is more important than the #Brexit vote, she must be removed ASAP, Article 50 suspended and a GE #VoteLabour
#Brexit is patriotic and non-elite. Here we see some patriotic and non-elite Brits posing with Trump in front of his gold lift, as ordinary folk do. Nothing to do with Bannon, Mercer, Cambridge Analytica, AIQ and Putin.  (diagram by @carolecadwalla) #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
May wants EU to respect UK in #Brexit talks. With respect, EU didn’t instigate this, we did - through a vote based on false prospectus. Now we know this mis-sold Brexit can’t be delivered, respect is owed to British public (esp. Leave voters!), by asking ‘do you still want out?’
#brexit which you said would damage oue economy you now put party politics ahead of the national interest. @theresa_may is wrong on everything. The #EU has been clear from the beginning the single market is based on 4 freedoms there is no cherry picking.  @ScotTories
#Brexit - who knew that such a stupid, backward idea based on lies, privilege, lies, greed, lies and racism would turn out so badly ? It's a mystery alright...
The U.K.  rejected @theresa_may and her horrible #Brexit in GE17. She then bought seats to ensure she could force herself on us.She is only representing the tiny Tory membership and most of them can’t stand her or #chequers either. #peoplesvote#voteleavebrokethelaw

Theresa May's speech today: "If I go down I'm going to make sure I take all you fuckers in this country down with me". #Maybot #ToriesOut #HELP #Brexit
Not come across any EU diplomat today who defends Tusk’s cherry picking instagram at Salzburg summit. His people say it was an attempt to reach out to a younger audience. If so, clearly mis-judged and ill-timed #Brexit

PM #Brexit plan rejected by EU leaders, rejected by many on both wings of her party,rejected by business,rejected by the vast majority of voters too,but she is to carry on down the same path. This is a PM who cannot get any deal,it's time for her to resign it's gone on too long.
This is the same Jeremy Corbyn who wanted to trigger #Article50 immediately after the #Brexit referendum with zero preparation. 
If anyone is befuddled, angry, pee'd off, frustrated, confused etc etc about the #Brexit nonsense that has just been peddled by Theresa May, here's a photo of Ripley when he was a puppy to send soothing thoughts to you all #BrexitShambles #DogsofTwittter #indyref2

#Brexit - who knew that such a stupid, backward idea based on lies, privilege, lies, greed, lies and racism would turn out so badly ? It's a mystery alright...

Also PM’s claim that the other side have a duty to compromise and respond to her proposals is not something she ever thinks when devolved governments put proposals to her - if she did UK position in #brexit would be much more sensible
Theresa May : "I will not overturn the result of this flight. Nor will I allow this fire to break up this plane. ALL ABOARD!" #Brexit #DowningStreet #maystatement
Can someone, anyone, stop May saying stupid things. We all know #Brexit will be a disaster for the economy and now it appears the lack of any UK plan is seeing Sterling tank. More than ever Scotland needs Independence. 
If a hard brexit is pursued only two good things will come of it - Irish unity and Scottish independence #indyref2 #Brexit
IF I SHOUT SOMETHING LOUD ENOUGH, AND IN ENGLISH, THOSE BLOODY FOREIGNERS WILL CAVE.#Brexit
#Brexit latest. 
Theresa May’s punchline for her #Brexit nonsense speech was pretty much ‘respect my authority’.She basically did a Cartman impression.This loser needs to go, we need a #GENow
We already know Chequers isn’t possible; so Theresa May just announced that she’ll continue with a shambolic No-Deal Brexit with no clear plan to solve the Irish Border issue that sensible people have been discussing for years.An utter shambles. #Brexit #BrexitChaos
Once again it's clear that if Brexit is to happen the best answer for the UK is to stay in the single market and customs union. (like we've been saying for over two years now)  #brexit
Absurd that Westminster isn’t sitting this week and able to debate this #Brexit disaster - all because the LibDems were having a get together.
If Theresa May has only just realised that Northern Ireland border & her failure to put forward workable economic proposals are the main issues  it really says something about how blind the Tories have chosen to be to the obvious truths evident since the referendum #brexit
This Tory Government has had 27 months since the Referendum to prepare for the UK's exit from the EU and the best that PM May can come up with is that the ball is in the EU's court. Where is the workable plan to take Britain forward successfully after we leave? #Brexit 
NEW: @jeremycorbyn on Salzburg Summit."We wouldn't have been playing games. And we wouldn't be negotiating within our party."NOTE: Filmed 90 mins before PM's statement. #Brexit @itvcalendar @itvtynetees
There you have it in black and white, it's the fault of the nasty EU says Theresa May, this is what she's been wanting all along, forget the country her concern is keeping the extremists happy in her party Rees-Mogg will raise a glass, no deal #Brexit and disaster is on its way
JC Juncker gives interview to Die Presse paper saying the EU and U.K. are not at war, they’re like two hugging hedgehogs who have to watch out not to scratch one another  #Brexit 
Fancy taunting a T1 diabetic with cake anyway. #Brexit 
Woop woop….no deal #Brexit.... Fuck off EU!!! 
Not sure that any Leave or Remain supporter voted for this damaging Brexit mess. After failed Chequers plan and humiliation in Salzburg the UK public deserves better from the UK Government. #Brexit 
UK Prime Minister Theresa May tells people to prepare for the prospect of "no deal" with the EU, stressing that "no deal is better than a bad deal" in a statement given at Downing Street one day after an EU summit on #Brexit 
I am very proud of our Prime Minister and support her in this statement 100%. If the EU wish to be this stupid, we must let them. #Brexit 
Solving big problems with little words:1) #Kavanaugh - VOTE NOW2) #Brexit - NO DEAL. 3) #Critics - DO ONE. #FridayMotivation
Disgusting attitude @theresa_may.Who the hell do you think you are? You have no authority and no right to demand ANYTHING from the EU. It’s our problem if we want to leave. They don’t need to offer anything. You should be coming up with the plan for #Brexit, not them. #ToryMess.
Theresa May on #BrexitIt's not my fault - it's them... Me trying not to laugh at her serious face ending.. How long had she practised it? 
So it’s off the #Brexit cliff edge we go.  #MayStatement #BrexitChaos
“We are at an impasse" #Brexit 
Theresa May's statement moves Scotland closer to a damaging #NoDeal #Brexit that would cost 80,000 jobs and shrink our economy by £12.7 billion. Here's just some of the other ways a no deal Brexit will affect our daily lives. 
Frustrating that the very people responsible for #Brexit keep looking to others to design it 
Hypocrisy.. What was respectful about Boris Johnson telling the EU to... "Go Whistle" exactly? #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Should UK citizens be given a vote on the final deal?#Brexit
When Dominic Raab was announced as chief #Brexit negotiator, the Tories and their press allies made a point of telling us he has a black belt in karate - as if that helps with negotiations. What was he going to do? Strike a blow to Barnier's trachea? Fucking idiots the lot of 'em
"No-one wants a good deal more than me, but the EU should be clear I will not overturn the result of the referendum, nor will I break up my country" - UK PM Theresa May gives Downing Street statement on #Brexit talks 
It looks like I'm going to have to get this one out again. #Brexit 
If we don’t press for an independence referendum now we are giving up the opportunity. #ScotlandCan #Brexit
To sum up the PM’s statement this afternoon:1) Those foreigners are rotters for not changing their minds.2) I’m not changing my mind, but I’m not a rotter.3) They’d better change their minds, or else.4) I’m now going to stick my fingers in my ears.#Brexit #SalzburgSummit
Theresa May says it's unacceptable for the "EU to divide the UK in two". The EU aren't doing that Theresa, you are. Northern Ireland will NOT be dragged out of the EU against our will #Brexit
I'd surmise the PM's statement in these terms, Fuck you EU don't try and treat us like shit and mug us off, we're not having any more of your bollox, sort it out or we're off without a deal, and you Peoples  Vote tossers can do one as well. #DowningStreet #Brexit
What an utter travesty of the truth...She has never attempted to take the 48% with her or Scotland.More hollow words and outright lies.#Brexit #DowningStreet .@SkyNews .@BBCNews .@itvnews
.@theresa_may it's clear that there is no good #Brexit deal on offer - only workable plan is a #PeoplesVote to give the public control on the final deal
If the EU thought the PM was uncompromising at the Salzburg summit .. Imagine what they’re thinking about her statement just now #Brexit
.@theresa_may is delivering a #Brexit statement in Downing Street.The Prime Minister says both sides want a deal but there are "two big issues where we remain apart". Follow the latest here: 
Theresa May just now:"Anything that effectively divides our country in two is a bad deal"The whole of Ireland just started laughing. The brits sure have some brass necks.  #Brexit
Theresa May channelling her inner Maggie: "I have treated the EU with nothing but respect. The UK expects the same." #Brexit
Theresa May coming out very strong against agreeing on a backstop that she previously agreed. #Brexit
Theresa May outlining the EU27 position on Ireland and free trade - positions which have been blindingly obvious for two years. #Brexit
Theresa May describes NI remaining in Single Market and Customs Union as "terrible" That's a huge mistake. DUP clearly fuelling this statement and were in No 10 this morning apparently. #Brexit
EU diplomats tell me their message at Salzburg summit was directly at people of U.K. not only at PM. That message: #Brexit is not an easy process. Suggesting it can be is a lie. Either a deal is done acceptable to both sides, or there is no deal or the U.K. changes its mind
Taoiseach says Ireland heading into a rocky patch in #brexit negotiations. Anglo/Irish relations are at an all time low, the humiliation of May in #Salzburg and footage of Leo and Macron strolling side by side doesn’t help those relations. We need to focus on getting a deal.
Errr - a flawed analogy !UK is a *driverless car* #Brexit 
LIVE: @theresa_may delivers a mystery statement on #Brexit at Downing St 
EU diplomats says surprised at PM’s ‘upset and emotional’ press conference post Salzburg summit. They ask why she was so surprised that EU rejected her #Brexit stance on Irish border and on single market. They say that rejection was well-known before the summit
Has someone tried switching Britain off and switching it on again? #Brexit #TheresaMay
Theresa May's statement has been delayed because of a power failure in 10 Downing Street. I mean power of the electrical type. You couldn't make it up! #Brexit
We can still reverse it.#chequers #FinalSay #Brexit #Salzburg
Just caught up with #PoliticsLive.The UK is standing on the edge of an abyss  !The chortling, chuckling, merriment & cracking of jokes - entirely inappropriate given the serious position re #BrexitIn my VERY humble opinion !
Theresa May set to make statement on #Brexit negotiations
Power has gone out on #Brexit negotiations too - important we have a #PeoplesVote to give the public the power on the final #Brexit deal 
Statement from the PM likely to be delayed due to a "power shortage" in No.10.I believe that's referring to electricity.... #may #Brexit #chequers
This hate headline from the Sun fits the classic fascist formula of accusing your opponents of your misdeeds. The real mobsters are the #Brexit politicians backed by Murdoch who are threatening to push the British people, as hostages, over the no-deal cliff.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
BREAKING: Live footage from 10 Downing Street as #TheresaMay prepares to give important #brexit statement 
"Not sure it was quite the good news that I was promised!" #Brexit secretary @DominicRaab after @bbclaurak reveals the 'good news' she had trailed on #politicslive #BrexitcastLive 
In Brussels yesterday and on Wednesday it was made very clear to me that the EU does want a deal.With the Cabinet split, don't blame EU for Tory #BrexitShambles @DominicRaab Didn't you and the #brexit fanatics have a deliverable plan?
Delighted Scotland’s Supreme Court has unanimously agreed with me & my fellow petitioners that it’s vital for MPs to know from #CJEU in Luxembourg whether #Article50 is unilaterally revocable before we’re asked to ratify any withdrawal agreement #Brexit 
Following a #UK government's greatest humiliation since Suez, @BBC think we're all brain dead by replacing #PoliticsToday with #brexitcastlive slapstick. #Brexit may be a laughing matter to #BBC chattering classes, but to most of us it is deadly serious! #brexitshambles #fail
I have a horrible suspicion that she is going to call an Election so the Tories can pass this festering bag of shit with #brexit on it over to Labour.... then it can be all Labours fault for the next 200 years
UK PM Theresa May to make statement in Downing Street on state of #Brexit negotiations at 13:45 BST
Another extraordinary #Brexit ruling driven by @GoodLawProject, @JolyonMaugham and other petitioners. Amazing result for all of the CrowdJustice backers who supported the case.
Even @NicolaSturgeon is calling for #Article50 extension, despite the U.K. crashing out being good for #Indyref2. THAT IS WHAT A LEADER DOES: what’s good for the many, not the political few. Compromise and guts! Where is that @10DowningStreet @jeremycorbyn - WHERE? #brexit 
#salzburg is a sign of the total failure of the govts negotiating strategy and symbolic of the damage #Brexit is inflicting on the UKs reputation on the international stage.There's only one route out of this #BrexitShambles#PeoplesVote 
Just withdraw #brexit 
Walk away. They want to make us beg. They want to split the UK as punishment for dare voting to  leave in a democratic vote. Take our £40bn and use it to mitigate any short term negatives from leaving. If they wanted a deal they wouldn't be 'cherry joking' about May. #Brexit
Great to have @elliereeves supporting a #PeoplesVote. Vital we give the public control of the final #Brexit deal 
We've been "rebuffed" on our plans without any "coherent explanation" or "credible alternatives" - #Brexit Secretary @DominicRaab tells #brexitcastlive 
When the Government’s shambolic handling of the #Brexit process has led us to a position between a poorly negotiated deal and the prospect of no deal whatsoever, the decision must now be handed back to the electorate with a @peoplesvote_uk
Reference to the ECJ on the question of whether a Member State can unilaterally revoke notification of intention to withdraw, and if so subject to what conditions and with what effect concerning that Member State remaining in EU. A huge case possibly upcoming. #Brexit 
Yes, UK press has led its readers to 'unmitigated disaster'. (What's new? They also led us to Thatcherism, Iraq war, austerity...)But don't think for a moment Macron's lecture cuts any ice in #Brexit-voting areas.#ChequersGoesPop is a gift to No Dealers.
What explains the main differences in strategies & outcomes of the EU’s & UK’s approache to #brexit? The EU views brexit as a problem to mitigate so as little damage as possible accrues to the EU.Brexit for the UK has been mainly about who gets to become Prime Minister.
1/ When Theresa May said there is no such thing as a citizen of the world she wasn't saying that there is no world state, she was attacking the concept of universal human rights, in favour of a dogmatic nationalist conception of values and rights.#Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE
#BrexitGender Apparently now #Brexit threatens women rights. I am bound to remind that suffragettes started their fight for equal voting rights here in Britain. Can you guess what actually threatens women rights? Shhh...
I've said it before, but I am convinced that the WM government want a No-Deal #Brexit The UK economy will crash and a few people will get incredibly wealthy off of the whole scenario. (including many in the government).
UK: LABOUR (S&D) could win a net gain of 1.5 million more votes by backing second Brexit referendum, pollster YouGov says. #Brexit
This is a must watch-profound, beautiful, poetic, suggestive & so at odds with the shrillness of so much discussion on #Brexit-Stephen Rea one of Ireland’s most powerful actors. Poetry & politics of @BorderIrish
President Macron - The #Brexiteers & their simple #brexit solutions are liars! #peoplesvote #FBPE
UK media appear to be giving the architects of the #Brexit disaster - Duncan Smith, Redwood, Rees-Mogg & Co - unlimited air-time. No.1: Why? And No.2: Why isn't anyone reminding them that, when it came to the crunch, they had NO PLAN (Or at least they said it was a secret).
No British PM should make such a fool out of herself.The EU is not the problem.#Brexit is a crime. You're in it and we'll fight you. We will #StopBrexit, so better get used to that.
May's track record suggests that she is a xenophobic, authoritarian nationalist. So it does not seem implausible to suggest that she is a hard line Brextremist and is seeking to engineer a no-deal #Brexit.
EU politicians tell me every negotiation has tough moments. That this one post-Salzburg summit will not be the last. #Brexit is a tough negotiation, no avoiding that, they say
Very , very bad news.We need a strong, united , focused and strategic  #Opposition re: #Brexit  now.There's loads of low-hanging fruit about...and #Labour is not picking it!#LabourConference#Brexit#ChequersPlan
1/ Redwood on @SkyNews saying that is no cliff edge and we'll trade on WTO rules with the EU as we do with the outside world now. Redwood is lying. The EU has trade agreements with 64 third countries. Those deals will end with a no-deal #Brexit. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
WATCH: "They are the generations which are going to be most impacted by the decisions we are taking." @nazirafzal makes the case for why we need a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit to support the younger generations 
So what on earth is going on with #Brexit?Come and join us for a special Brexit Briefing with @JasonJHunter on Friday 26th October.More details here:
Highlevel EU sources say PM’s blunt rejection of Barnier’s ‘de-dramatising’ Irish backstop, her uncompromising Die Welt op-ed pre-summit + #Brexit address to EU leaders Weds night meant they had to be unambiguous in their response or would appear EU about to bend its principles
When will any honest UK politician just admit to the British people that the reason why #Brexit is so complicated is that previous UK Govts took us into an EU superstate & deep EU integration (Maestrict/Lisbon treaties) without giving the public a vote on whether they wanted it?
Yesterday the leaders of the undemocratic EU showed their true colours. This isn’t some grand project, designed to bring the peoples of Europe together in one happy union. It’s a protection racket.  #Brexit
If you do anything today, take ten minutes to watch this - it will chill you #StephenRea #HardBorder #Brexit #ClareDwyerHogg
#BREXIT fail&we have Farage &Boris Johnson 2thank for the debacle that #Brexit has inevitably turned out 2be Did someone say we told you so? You guys were putin’s 1st experiment. When it worked in UK he sent his army of hackers here #BrexitShambles
Utterly astounding that @UKLabour was unable/unwilling to field a spokesperson for @BBCr4today on May's #Salzburg disaster.Our opposition is complicit in this #Brexit catastrophe. And the fault lies with #Corbyn. #SalzburgSummit18 #r4today #PeoplesVote
Real question now is can we honestly justify handing over an extra £39 billion of taxpayers money to EU on top of the £589 billion given since we joined, when they treat us in such an inconsiderate and obstinate way. #Brexit
Slouching towards #hard #brexit: a pessimistic thread on why the #NoDealBrexit deal catastrophe is now the most likely outcome
So... where are the men in Grey Suits that killed off Thatcher, Hague, Howard, Major and Duncan Smith ? How come Theresa May is allowed to make this country a complete laughing stock around the world ? #brexit @BBCNews @bbclaurak @bbcnickrobinson #r4today
Your grandfather and your father both die freeing your neighbours from tyranny. You then spend 50 years funding their dreams. Then you realise they are taking the piss so decide to distance yourself, and the neighbours spend two years threatening you and bad mouthing you. #brexit 
Backlash as #EU chiefs say #Britain should have ANOTHER #Brexit vote so voters can 'change their view' on leaving 
#Brexit, 'The easiest thing in human history'.More than a year on from this article, the best deal is likely to be no deal because actually, Brexit turns out to be the most difficult thing in human history. Stop the lies, demand a #PeoplesVote
Question Time: ‘I have NO trust in May!'Theresa May was never passionate about #BrexitShe wanted to stay.So why have we got somebody who wants to stay fighting for a deal?Having read Chequers.I am not seeing what we got promised a few years back.#EU
Prez @AnastasiadesCY addresses a full house at Bloomberg @business HQs London. How can #Cyprus make a big difference? Future of #EU &  w Min @Georgiades_H @GLakkotrypis. Biz leaders discuss co-location after #Brexit, macro-eco & sectoral policy #invest #growth @ConCotzias pic.twitter.com/nY1e8vtRgW
Every #Brexit "negotiating position" the Government comes up with reminds me of that line from Blackadder Goes Forth "This new plan, does it involve climbing out of our trenches and walking toward the enemy machine guns"?
Chequers is dead.A No Deal #Brexit would be disastrous.Brexit has failed.If Theresa May were to #StopBrexit at least half of Britain would be overjoyed.Why don't you do that, @theresa_may?You'll go down in history as the woman who had the courage to save the country.
You spend 40 years married to someone. You build a house together. You spawn new generations who take on the family name. You make friends with other families...Then they dump you and call you unreasonable for not letting them keep the house, the bank account and the sex#Brexit
This is one of the most desperate, embarrassing tweets I have ever seen. EVERYBODY knows #Brexit is finished. It would have ruined us. Yet May prattles on, and Corbyn bumbles on behind her. Two of the worst politicians we will ever have. Time to dump them both and raise the bar. 
Remain MP, Mr Crabb: EU 'BELITTLING' May is fuelling support for Clean #Brexit"They are wedded to this ideological purity of the single market model and it pushes us more into a position where we say the quicker we are out of this circus the better!"#EU
The EU also takes the ‘nothing has changed’ approach this morning and says it always took issue with the PM’s #Brexit proposals on Irish border and future UK/EU economic relationship. Brussels says no ambush in Salzburg 
There's been a solution to #Brexit staring May in the eyes ever since the vote. Just emulate Norway. It keeps the #Leavers happy as the UK will have 'left the EU' and keeps #Remainers happy as the benefits are broadly the same as membership.And ignore the ERG protestations.
Our future is being talked about over our heads. Only seat at the table has been given to the corrosive, selfish and destructive DUP who Tories slavishly obeyWe must shout LOUD! NO hard border NO cliff edge NO to Brexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote #BrexitShambles #ExitFromBrexit
The parade of commentators asked for a solution to @theresa_may’s #Brexit  problems are missing the point: there’s no magic bullet. Chequers = unacceptable. Canada+ = threatens Union. WTO = major economic shock.Slowly it must be dawning: seeking a clean Brexit is a fool’s errand.
May and the Tories handling of #Brexit has been an utter shambles. They’ve made a mess of it from day one. But don’t forget what they’ve also done to the NHS, the police, the rail system, schools, the council cuts, prisons, #Windrushscandal etc. Time for a new election #GENow
Everybody owns the result of #Brexit that is not actively either stopping it, supporting a #PeoplesVote or providing a workable plan.That is up to 3 million jobs lost that @UKLabour and the @Conservatives will be blamed for.Labour are the opposition, they own this also.
Incredible that on biggest political issue of the decade, with a Tory PM on the rocks and her party at war, the main opposition party refuses to talk about #Brexit & #ChequersPlan on @BBCr4today. How can Corbyn call himself a leader? Pathetic stuff
#Salzburg further exposes the shambles of #Brexit, the myths that were peddled and the fact there are no easy options. And now those who caused this mess - Johnson, Farage, Grayling and co - try to blame everyone else - but blame lies solely and squarely with them. End of story
1. FGS what's wrong with us?I was surprised by Saltzburg, not that it happened but that it happened NOW.I thought they'd let May get away with it as she hoped & kick her invalid harmful #Brexit down the road.Judgement Day sooner.No more Tory CON#PeoplesVote #Remain ASAP
James Brokenshire, 'The PM is acting in the national interest' ffs she's acting in the tory party interest, she knows #Brexit will be a disaster, if she was acting in the national interest she'd pause Article 50 and call a #PeoplesVote or a GE, stop lying to us #r4today
Pity Sinn Fein wouldn't join @NualaMcAllister on #gmu this morning - who very articulately explained why a #peoplesvote is so important. We are hurtling towards a No Deal & the electorate deserve the right to have their say on the detail, this is about all of our futures. #Brexit
What the hell is @BBCNews up to? Tabloid WW2 framing of #Brexit will just lead to more suffering for UK citizens. It's not a war. We are not in the Blitz. We screwed up the exit process. Demonising foreigners for that is proto Fascism 
Come on ⁦@UKLabour⁩   A majority of your supporters want a #PeoplesVote   It would stop Tory #Brexit hitting the poorest hardest And it’s the best chance of being rid of this utterly useless incompetent government. What’s not to like? 
The German word for Theresa May’s predicament is “zugzwang”. It describes a situation where a player is compelled to move, even though it would clearly be to their detriment.#Brexit
So after Dominic Grieve in her own party , virtually all the opposition parties & the Scottish & Welsh Government’s have said it now President Macron does too ;  “The Chequers plan cannot be take it or leave it”. #Brexit
It isn't "May's Brexit" it's the #Brexit of:EU families who face an uncertain futureBusinesses who face bankruptcyWorkers who will lose their jobsPoor people who will be unable to pay higher food/gas pricesOld folks who face no social care help to dress/eat  #finalsay
Thanks to @Leannewood for letter of support on #Brexit - and for continuing to be such a strong and principled voice for Wales. 
If you think that Sir Winston Churchill would stand for this shit from the EU, you are gravely mistaken.#Brexit pic.twitter.com/WUTpIctZkM
Because of #Brexit Some people will lose their jobs.Some will lose their homes.For some this will destroy their family.Can you honestly say that this is what you expected when you voted leave?#PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE
We are heading for a hard #Brexit which my MP, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, confidently predicts will be 'a Brexit for the poor.' I predict the poorest will suffer most from crashing out of the EU. Time, and hopefully the wise constituents of North East Somerset, will tell who is right.
The day starts once again with well informed concern about the effects of #Brexit being met with ill informed platitudes from @GovUK .   Medical research concern over Brexit - BBC News
There was a vote achieved by cheating and breaking the law Mrs May @theresa_may. I have no trust in your ability to deliver anything but a bad or no deal #Brexit, neither of which is what people voted for. If you respect democracy, you must allow the people a #PeoplesVote
#GinaMiller just wiped the floor with #r4today presenter. It was embarrassing, like her or loathe her she clearly knows her brief & is logical she is probably the only sane person left in the #brexit debate.
#Brexit was never going to work the way the #Leave liars said it would.Why would anyone ever believe the UK could have all the benefits of EU membership for trade, but not have to pay and not have to follow the rules.It was cleary a lie.
“Only an idiot with a remainer agenda could now support Chequers. Ladies & gentlemen, may we present…”Read our devastating #Brexit summary: 
#Brexit was the choice... of the #english people !!!!In #Scotland, 62% voted #remain and 38% voted #brexit. In #England, 54% voted #brexit and 46% #remain.If London centralizes all powers sent back from the EU to Westminster, a 2nd independence referendum will be justified.
Oasis frontman Noel Gallagher has told Good Morning Britain that politicians are 'still lying to us now' over the #Brexit deal.Lily Allen says 'nobody understands' Brexit - unless you're @PiersMorgan and 'know everything'
For two years, EU leaders have clearly, patiently & consistently explained that the EU can't compromise on its basic principles.For this, they are called "dirty rats" and "two-bit mobsters" by... the Sun.This is hate speech, pure & simple.#r4today #Brexit #PeoplesVote
I didn’t think @TheSun could get any more ridiculous but no there you go, their #Brexit splash is as off base as ever 
If you are not following @JasonJHunter you should be for fact based EU withdrawal analysis #Brexit 
Tory MEP @CharlesTannock puts his finger on the cognitive dissonance at the heart of much #Brexit thinking. It’s a pity that he has persuaded so few of his colleagues of this truth. 
This picture is all over the front pages this morning. @ChrisMasonBBC will attempt to make sense of it all on the @BBCBreakfast sofa this morning #Brexit 
The EU treated our PM, David Cameron, badly & with a total lack of respect.They now do the same to Theresa May.These clowns think they are above us, in many ways.Yet they want & NEED our dosh.Time to kick back, UK.Time for WTO #Brexit & only then we can talk about 'deals'.
Hello @jeremycorbyn. Since you’re still trailing the #Tories, even after #Salzburg, you are failing most spectacularly. The door of no. 10 stands open if you would only back a @peoplesvote_uk and stop #Brexit. @UKLabour @Remain_Labour @Another_Europe #Lab18 @women4PV @OFOCBrexit
Can’t wait to see Brextremists picking fruit in Lincolnshire fields because there’s no immigrants to do it If they ‘believe in #Brexit’ as much as they claim, they should be offering to do it for free#brexitshambles #bbcqt #Chequers #TheresaMay
And today's UK Government Press Release is BLAME THE EU. Even though our inept Tory Govt only produced a deal 6 months before leaving and it's not agreed yet #Brexit
When Theresa May refuses to cancel #Brexit and tries to reassure us that it’s going to be ok and we’re not all going to die. 
'@theresa_may is trying to destroy #Brexit. Her #ChequersPlan not only goes against the Brexit vote but May is trying to maintain EU control over the UK particularly our economy. Chequers does not provide freedom, it is our prison. #TheresaMay & #Chequers both have to go & quick!
#Brexit is under attack from the undemocratic EU & national leaders including UK politicians. The EU has never accepted #democracy, every time a nation votes against the EU they are ignored or made to vote again. Brexit won’t be 1 of those occasions. Brexit is worth fighting for!
Chequers - why we are in this mess. #Brexit 
There will be books written about the bastard politicians who supported  #Brexit and it will bring shame on their children and grandchildren... and anyone even slightly related to them...
There is widespread opposition to #Chequers as it stands let alone further concessions. It is seen as unworkable by the EU. But most importantly, the British people will not accept it. #Brexit #ChequersPlanThe full text of Davis' speech:
One foolish old man is stopping @UKLabour from saving us from #Brexit.It's time the many sorted that one out. 
Now that Theresa May has more of an idea about what a realistic #Brexit entails, it’s time to be straight with people. It‘s not what was promised or hoped for. The only democratic course of action now is to #suspendA50 & give people a #FinalSay #SalzburgSummit #dreamsmeetreality
I almost want a no deal #Brexit just so nobody ever listens to the Tory right about anything ever again. We'll get to see the full extent of how spectacularly wrong they are about trade.
How has Theresa May never gone home, drunk gin until 3am, muttered "eff this for a game of soldiers" and just handed the whole clusterf**k to Boris on a silver salver and said, "g'wan so"? #Brexit #SkyNews
You're going to look at this 1 of 2 ways.  Adults will recognise that trying to bully 27 nations into a bespoke #Brexit deal was never going to work5 year olds & Brexit supporters will ask "why oh why can't 27 other countries accept our #bespoke deal?"
I was thinking: "WE GOTTA STOP THIS SHIT NOW OR WE WILL REGRET IT FOREVER!" #Brexit 
Anyone else feeling politically homeless? No effective @UKLabour opposition to the gov by @jeremycorbyn to #StopBrexit - afraid if there is a #generalelection I cannot vote for my MP @ChukaUmunna despite his calls for a #PeoplesVote - would mean accepting Labour #Brexit position
May asks Corbyn to rule out a #PeoplesVote & he rules it out. Both R complicit in a #BrexitShambles, both invoked A50 w/o due diligence; both R responsible.We face a #Brexit disaster, our Rights removed, our country trashed yet neither allow a #FinalSay.Let's rule them both out
Goodnight Twitter. Tonight, I am very worried for the future of the UK. We are lions led by Tory #Brexit donkeys with very few  brain cells between them.  So sad to think we were on the road to economic recovery before the EU referendum. Now we are all in deep S**t. #bbcqt
I'm a #Remainer &I feel betrayed by the democratic process, #Newsnight. Remember the lies. I know s.o. who changed her vote because of Turkey. Now we know #VoteLeave broke the law. #May didn't try to a find consensus. #Brexit will damage our country. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay #FBPE
So Corbyn's position is to call a general election to "let the people decide what direction they want to go" on #Brexit, choice being the Tory party, who support leaving the EU or the Labour party, who support leaving the EU.... 
First time watching #bbcqt since after the first Scottish referendum and I have never felt so disconnected from the politics of the English public as now (and that's saying something). This political 'union' needs to end #indyref2 #Brexit #independence #DissolveTheUnion
Just watched @theresa_may on @SkyNews she was clearly sweating with nerves. Looks like #brexit will be a hard crash out affair. This will boast support for Scotland to leave the UK. Our party has created a real mess. @ScotTories @SkyNewsBreak
Thank goodness (again) for the DUP on #Brexit 
If the UK govt had insisted in 1998 that Northern Ireland could not be treated differently from the rest of the UK, there would be no Good Friday Agreement. #Brexit
Even before today’s failures by Theresa May at #SalzburgSummit18 , polls show that Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' by backing a #referendum on the #Brexit deal: 
Why, #newsnight, are you interviewing Chris Grayling on #Brexit?Brexit is not his area of expertise.Railways are his area of expertise.And look where he's landed the nation's rail travellers.I suspect the Newsnight dog would be possessed on more information on Brexit.
why has no British politician had the balls to put things as clearly as Macron -- it might have saved us from #brexshit #NotInMyName . . . #FBPE #Brexit #exitbrexit #FBR #stopbrexit #PeoplesVote
Slowed down, this is fascinating, the body language, the micro facial expressions, especially after she says “doubt”. This is a Prime Minister that doesn’t believe the snake oil that #Brexit is. #Peoplesvote
No, Low Facts Chloe - talking with EU diplomats is not "colluding with foreign governments".But some of the crooks who backed the #Brexit campaign *were* colluding with a mafia state that murders people in the UK, and that sought to reward them with lucrative "business" deals. 
My latest on how we ended up, entirely predictably, in the #brexit mess 
#Brexit was sold by 'liars' and Britain's exit plan is unworkable, UK told - CNN 
I’d wager that a significant number who voted leave didn’t vote for the disastrous #Brexit we are marching towards. As responsible elected politicians, you cannot allow a flawed, and as it turns out illegally funded referendum, to ruin this great country for generations to come.
However this #Brexit saga ends, the UK can't now emerge from it with dignity. We have been diminished in Europe & the world & have only ourselves to blame.
#Brexit #Retweet to get full sampleFBPE & Remoaners seem to think they can overturn democracy via a 2nd vote "if this happened" as a leave voter would you.A- fight to the deathB- Protest from your sofaC- Just Vote#ForBritain #MBGA #UKIP#StandUp4Brexit#leave #WTObrexit
From @donaldtusk’s Instagram....They are openly mocking us now because of this #Chequers mess.Get us out now!#StandUp4Brexit#Brexit 
Has anyone done a study on the role of the national media in Britain and how they discuss/frame/analyze the #Brexit process? Even watching the BBC is delusional. Everything is framed as a “shock” that Theresa May won’t get what she wants. It’s 27 against 1! #salzburgsummit2018
Cannot help thinking now that whatever possibly happens in relation to #Brexit and the UK, some EU members have behaved so abominably that they have destroyed what they presumably wanted to protect. Darkest hour indeed. But for the EU, ironically.
“The choreography has gone badly wrong...very embarrassing” @bbclaurak sums it up. Others calling it a “disaster”. Anger, frustration and isolation clear on PM’s face. What a mess. Time for @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit #Salzburg
Rees-Mogg: “British people voted to Leave #EU -date we Leave is 29 March 2019That’s been passed into law twice now & not to implement that law would be letting down people who voted to Leave & would be a considerable failure of Government policy.”#Brexit
I’m so, so bored of #brexit. Can’t we just tell the EU to fuck off, walk away, spend the £39bn on a knees up, then just deal with the consequences afterwards?
"Common Rulebook" Unacceptable"Facilitated Customs Arrangement" Clunky & Impractical”For a nation seeking independence, how can this possibly be acceptable?We cannot accept them as subordinate rule takers.No self-respecting democracy could"#Brexit #EU
Labour 'could win 1.5m more votes' by backing #Brexit referendumSo it would serve the party as well as the country if @UKLabour came out in favour of the #PeoplesVoteWe look to Liverpool in anticipation
The humiliation of Theresa MayAnd a #Brexit plan in tatters -Tomorrow’s Guardian 
Our fantastic @skynews political correspondent @lewis_goodall has somehow found time in amongst the #Brexit drama, breaking news, Sunrise shifts, Boris comments, Labour crises, Tory crises and Lib Dem exotic spresms to write a book!! A real book!!! #leftfordead
Here's Brexit in a nutshell. English Leave voters happy to jettison Northern Ireland. Presumably Scotland not far behind. That is why #Brexit means #Brexit - Britain as we know it exiting the world stage. 
If there really was a Deep State, I think it would be doing rather better at steering us away from the #Brexit cliff edge.
How others see #Brexit: German public broadcaster ARD accuses May of drawing up the UK drawbridge but failing to notice the enemy is within: Boris Johnson and extremist Brexiters. No sign of Berlin demanding a favourable deal for UK. That was always #fakenews
The country needs someone who can deal with a ganghanded chicken livered bunch to sort this #Brexit crisis. @theresa_may my love, I am ready to help. Look at my record, I defeated Nicole, I defeated the #Loosewomen mob so a man named after an elephants tooth will not beat me dear
Hot take on the sub-optimal #Brexit negotiating strategy that comes from the "anarchistic impulses" of Brexiter Ultras backing into the corner a PM who lacks a strategy beyond the wrong one of mistaking stubbornness for strength.  
Walk away from this corrupt & arrogant EU.Revert to WTO immediately.Then we can deal on a much more transparent playing field, as the TRUTH becomes apparent, rather than basing everything on the scaremongering & lies fed to us (& debunked) daily.#Brexit is NOT rocket science.
EU leaders call for UK public to have final say on #Brexit outcome with new referendum 
.@KateNicholl and @NualaMcAllister have called out Sinn Féin for their blatant disregard for the consequences of Brexit, after the party made “weak excuses” not to support a debate on the People’s Vote #Brexit #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk
I agree.  One of the most interesting and well informed speeches on #Brexit i have seen to date, an absolute must read from Sir Ivan Rogers. 
The British Government should get Rangers to negotiate the ongoing Brexit debacle.We have been all over Europe the past three months & havent came away empty handed once.#rangersfc#Brexit
Corbyn is prepared to see the economy devastated the NHS damaged the poorest suffer for #Brexit even if opposing #Brexit was a vote winner so if  belief  is judged by what you are prepared to sacrifice #Brexit is the belief @jeremycorbyn holds highest of all
They say it won't work, but Theresa May insists her #Brexit plan is only "credible" option
#BrexitShambles has already lowered the UK to minnow status & unless we #StopBrexit we'll fall a lot farther. Now that the only #Brexit available is #NoDeal, which we must avoid at the risk of hurling our country into self-inflicted penury, a #PeoplesVote is the only option.
The results are in! And it's a landslide victory for those viewers who think the UK should get a new vote on #Brexit. 84% say Yes! 
. @duponline deputy leader @NigelDoddsDUP tonight: "Salzburg represents more evidence of the unreasonable and inflexible approach of the EU to negotiations. The U.K. government must demonstrate a resolute determination not to be bullied." #Brexit
Theresa May's plans in Salzburg shattered as they collided again with the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone.Someone please buy her a copy of my new book, which will be in the shops just in time for next month's vital EU summit. #SalzburgSummit18 #Brexit 
So sad that Traidcraft, pioneers of #fairtrade face closure, blaming the fall in the value of the pound due to #Brexit vote. Sadly symbolic too. The trade deals Fox hopes to stitch up couldn't be more diametrically opposite to Fair Trade principles. 
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: “All the EU leaders who spoke gave me their absolute support in standing behind Ireland, and saying that an agreement that doesn’t work for Ireland doesn’t work for the EU. I am leaving here very reassured.” #brexit 
Slowly but surely support for #Brexit is being stripped back to the core of racists, xenophobes, Tory spivs and halfwits that started all this in the first place.
ICYMI: This is what Donald Tusk and the EU did to Theresa May's Chequers Plan today #brexit #ThursdayThoughts #ChequersPlan
It’s time for Theresa May to chuck Chequers and offer the EU a "take it or leave it" free trade deal ultimatum, says Nigel Farage @Nigel_Farage | #Brexit 
No sympathy for Theresa May's Salzburg humiliation. This woman is a remain voter who has refused to tell the truth about the economic disaster that #Brexit is. Prioritising party over country and dogma over facts.Signed.Citizen of nowhere.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
As I predicted, the Irish border issue will now be lumped together with other critical issues in the last minute negotiations. Ireland-specific matters should have been resolved last June, as promised by @campaignforleo #brexit 
Liam Fox wants to scrap EU food standards in order to get a trade deal with the USA.  US-UK right wing groups want foreign competition in NHS & a regulations bonfire. Rees-Mogg thinks Indian standards will do fine after #Brexit. They want a tax haven and damn the consequences.
A poll of 280K people shows increased support for #Brexit.   @borisjohnson #borisjohnson #boris johnson   Just saying.
"Europe isn't an a la carte menu," said Emmanuel Macron.#Brexit
The consensus between Tories and Labour to pull us out of the Single Market and Customs Union will cost thousands of jobs risking irreparable damage to the #Welsh economy. #Brexit #PeoplesVote 
2 productive days - last 48 hours 8  engagements across Belfast & South Down.  Everyone I’ve spoken with wants the backstop in draft #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement supported & amended to reflect rights protectionsThe #DUP on the wrong side of the people #Workinghard4UAll
We Remainers must seize the mantle of patriotism back from the Brexiters. #Brexit is absolutely not patriotic. It has been driven by foreign interference & offshore tax-dodging press barons, it damages our economy, weakens our democracy & divides the country. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Claire Fox has nailed this.We can simply WALK AWAY.It's not for the public to arrange this, we merely told them we want it done.Fine, they are too weak to get a deal, go out on WTO terms & you can have all the time you need to GET a bloody deal.WE WANT #BREXIT, no more crap. 
As the #EU rejects May's #ChequersPlan and May insists that Chequers is the only option, are we to assume that a no-deal outcome is the only possible #Brexit reality now? Because no one voted for that!A GE or a #PeoplesVote is where I see this heading.
How the European Research Group envisages Northern Ireland after #Brexit(spoiler: it's not exactly 'frictionless')  
It may, however, be a mistake to jump to conclusions. #Brexit 
It’s long past time Britain abrogated it’s partition of #Ireland in any case. To wreck #Brexit over the occupation of six counties of someone else’s country is absurd. Let the border between Britain and the #EU be in the middle of the #Irish Sea
Speaking with a close farming friend today , we will never go hungry we grow and produce our own , whatever the #Brexit deal brings we will be farming and feeding our family and hopefully other British families. Did make me smile  
Many thanks to the city of Salzburg, @sebastiankurz & @EU2018AT for hosting the #SalzburgSummit on: #migrationEU, internal security and #Brexit.Watch the highlights now  
The trouble for Theresa May is that she was playing #Chequers while everyone else was playing Chess.....#Brexit #EUNegotiations
Only 1 Q you need to answer, bearing in mind #Brexit at best represents the disparate wills of only 26.5% of the Ppl, if a maj of voters now wish to #Remain after seeing your #BrexitShambles Y is it undemocratic to allow them to express that yet democratic to deny a #PeoplesVote?
Not that it matters much, but my overriding emotions on #Brexit now are deep sadness that the UK finds itself in such a mess, and deep foreboding about what's going to happen this winter. 
Let’s pop over to #Brexit and see what’s happening... 
On @BBCNews in Scotland they are reporting that @jeremycorbyn would not stand in the way of a second Scottish Independence referendum if he was Prime Minister.So Mr #Corbyn - if the Scots can have a 2nd referendum then we can have a 2nd referendum on #Brexit@peoplesvote_uk
The EU leaders have made it patently clear to May that Chequers is dead. If she wants a #Brexit withdrawal agreement she needs to respect the #EUs red lines and she needs to come back with concrete proposals, not promises of details at a later date.It is so embarrassing.
‘Can Britain Stop #Brexit?’ In this 50-minute fast-paced presentation, with over 100 graphics and historical video clips, @Jon_Danzig’s resolute answer was, “Yes, Britain can #StopBrexit if that’s what Britain wants.” Please share:  #FinalSay #PeoplesVote
The ratio on this tweet is appalling. You have failed @theresa_may -You've had over 2 years to put a deal together - a deal that all #EU28 could find acceptable and you've failed in that task.Your #Brexit has failed.You need to go or put your failure back to a #PeoplesVote
I think the official term for the situation we find ourselves in is SCREWED. We need another a referendum so that people can actually vote for what #Brexit really means rather than the lies we were told #ChequersPlan
The problem with #Brexit is that it's ideology based and that's hard to break down. If every single one of us was looking at it from a logical viewpoint, it just wouldn't be happening.....#ThursdayThoughts #PeoplesVote #ThinkAgain #FinalSayForAll #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Truth to be told! Well done,  Mr. Macron!We are governed by liars. Time for Indy. #scotref #indy2 #DissolveTheUnion #brexitEmmanuel Macron calls Brexit campaign leaders 'liars', in extraordinary attack 
We told you so. We warned you repeatedly.This is #Brexit.
Is there a #Brexit plan that will get through Parliament, not cause widespread harm to the UK & get the thumbs up from the EU? If not, we need to prioritise, compromise or think again. And politicians on all sides need to collaborate rather than make #Brexit a career opportunity.
- @theresa_may and her aides are spotted frantically searching around Salzburg for a paddle store as her #Brexit negotiations are now officially up Excrement Creek. #BrexitShambles #SalzburgSummit18
.@JeremyCorbyn MP: My vote for #Labour was NOT a vote for #Brexit - Sign the Petition before the Labour Conference this weekend!  via @UKChange
There’s no reason to accept a hard #Brexit that abandons most of economy & consigns public services to #BrexitAusterity as a result. Parliament can overrule May & insist on #PeoplesVote as way out of this mess...but it depends now on votes of my Labour colleagues who hold the key
Will Theresa May's Brexit trade plan work?  #Chequers @donaldtusk @theresa_may #brexit RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters
Treasury Minister"Rejection of PM's Brexit plan could trigger 2nd referendumHe's undermined PM's public strategy.'We could have a second referendum and we could end up not leaving the EU altogether'Are all the Treasury Ministers trying to stop #Brexit?
Europe’s press fear a hard #Brexit 
Prime Minister @theresa_may should walk away from the EU & leave without a deal, saving £39bn to spend here instead. The @EUCouncil had their chance, they're unwilling to negotiate, Prime Minister, walk away now & give yourself some credibility. #Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
I would love to go 10 years into the future and see where whatever #Brexit will look like takes us. Amazed that some people can be so certain #Chequers
No. We voted for Brexit and we have a viable option which is @DExEUgov’s Canada+++ Norway is not #Brexit#StandUp4Brexit
Sorry Theresa, none of them are looking back #Brexit 
#brexit is totally bonkers!Resist the madness, join the #LibDems
Donald Tusk, speaking on behalf of the EU27, has explicitly said today that Theresa May's #Chequers Deal "will not work". It's time the Tories backed @theSNP calls to remain in the Single Market and Customs Union - the best option short of staying in the EU. #Brexit 
What's going on in the world when the @UKLabour leader is lining up with the Tories against the unions and against NHS staff?#PeoplesVote #Brexit
"The Chequers deal doesn't work. It doesn't deliver #Brexit or maintain the integrity of the single market" - @Jacob_Rees_Mogg of the European Research Group says a Canada plus free trade deal is the right way to go.Follow the story live here: 
The EU will always plan and futureproof protection for it's members. It's goal is to deliver economic stability for its States and ever increasing prosperity for its citizens. Practically the dead opposite of #Brexit .
#Brexit talks in a single image: one brave lady in a political predicament one wouldn’t wish on one’s worst enemy, dealing with an unprecedented constitutional change under pressure from all -her party, opposition, EU, Brexitters, Remainers -versus 27 arrogant uncompromising..... 
Emmanuel Macron calls #Brexit campaign leaders 'liars', in extraordinary attack'Those who explain that we can easily live without Europe, that everything is going to be alright, and that it's going to bring a lot of money home are liars' 
I tweeted this exactly 6 months ago. Just saying. #ChequersPlan #Brexit #DeadAsADodo
Don’t forget that Sir Ivan Rogers resigned as Ambassador to the EU as long ago as January last year. “He may have been seen as a pessimist because it fell to him to convey the hostility and scepticism with which other governments view #Brexit.”
Moment of truth for #brexit talks will be October #EUCO. We expect maximum progress and results by then. 
I’ve shortened this story for you, .⁦@BBCNews⁩ “The EU has told Theresa May to take her plan and ram it”.You’re welcome. #Brexit 
Shame the #BBC (@BBC ) doesn't  reply to @InFactsOrg 's measured, well argued criticism of its pro-#Brexit bias:
"Gentlemen, may I interest you in some Parsnip and nettle jam? No? How about some dog eggs? Anyone? Some finest Stevenage Sparkling Wine?Oh well, your loss." #Brexit 
How come the EU can manage to get 27 different countries to agree yet our own PM can’t get 1 to agree - and continues to cling to something no one wants?! #Brexit 
"There will be no second referendum, the government will not accept a second referendum" - @theresa_may addresses chances of a no-deal on #Brexit.Follow the events live here: 
Hang on... isn't it all of our responsibilities to find out what it is we're voting for? So who's fault is it if only 24% of women "felt confident in their knowledge of #Brexit compared to 41% of men"  #BrexitGender
.@JunckerEU #Salzburg #Brexit “We need a positive conclusion and we need it in October. No deal is not my working assumption. But would it happen, we are prepared. @EU_Commission has prepared all elements of a possible no deal. Don’t worry, be happy.”

European Council President Donald Tusk says EU leaders agree Theresa May's Chequers plan for #Brexit "will not work" because "it risks undermining the single market" 
The problem is that you are NOT delivering the will of the people. Labour can't call a 2nd referendum. I know you sometimes get confused at PMQs and question Jeremy Corbyn, but you are (unfortunately) in charge and are getting nowhere with #Brexit negotiations after 2+ years.
Amen Prime Minister. To have a second referendum before the first one has been enacted would be an insult to democracy. #Brexit #StandUp4Brexit #PeoplesVote
“The moment of truth for #Brexit negotiations will be the October European council” - says European Council President Donald Tusk 
Tusk says EU countries united in rejecting proposals in Chequers on future economic relationship between EU and U.K. after #Brexit
Morning Briefing:- U.S. ready to resume North Korea talks- EU leaders keep up pressure on May to take #Brexit deal- Japan hit by another cryptocurrency heist, $60 million stolen 
Who the fuck is Claire Fox? What is the Institute of Ideas? Whoever she is she's all for a hard no deal #Brexit, i assume it won't impact on her because like her pal Jacob Rees-Mogg she's cushioned by wealth, people like her make me want a #PeoplesVote even more #PoliticsLive
Amusing to see that great democrat Alastair Campbell wanting a re-run of the #Brexit vote with 3 options:- Remain, leave with Chequers, leave on WTO. In other words 1 remain option & 2 leave options thus splitting the leave vote. Duplicity comes naturally to him #PoliticsLive
Are people fed up of the #Brexit / Remain vitriol, backstabbing, sniping and character assassinations?Well trust me, if another referendum is foisted on the electorate, what we have now will seem like playful banter...It will be vicious and personal.. #WalkAwayMay
Q. Can we leave the EU without it harming the UK, and those residing in it? A. No.On this basis alone, especially given the FACT the ref was ADVISORY, #Brexit should NOT be pursued, until such time, if EVER, it can be undertaken WITHOUT harm whatsoever. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
May is totally on the hook when it comes to the #Brexit negotiations.   She would be DELIGHTED if Labour backs a 2nd vote (#peoplesvote) in advance of the deal being presented - she'd claim Labour's undermined Britain's negotiating position, an act of treachery, betrayed voters
#FactCheckJoel scrambled on #politicslive after @campbellclaret said there had been “a clear shift” towards a further #Brexit referendum in the polls. Not according to Sir John Curtice, says @Joel_Massey.
"You are now on Project Frit because you know the will of the people is changing." Watch @campbellclaret make it clear that people didn't vote for this blindfold #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Nicely illustrating why we voted Leave#Brexit 
The Irish border + post #Brexit EU/U.K. trade relations are difficult questions but there’s also an element of theatre here. Both sides need to be seen to stand tough: May bc she’s mired in domestic probs while EU wants to make leaving their club seem tough and unappealing
EU leaders support referendum on #Brexit and want UK to stay. So would most MPs in a free vote. So would the Lords. So would the British people according to polls. Brexit now only supported by ideologues and their government conscripts #PeoplesVote
At #FMQs @NicolaSturgeon slaps  down Willie Rennie & the Lib Dem’s sanctimony on #PeoplesVote if they want @theSNP support they need to give us guarantees that Scotland won’t be outvoted & ignored a second time #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
27 leaders now discuss #Brexit. They will focus on how to organise the final phase of negotiations with #UK, on #Ireland and on the EU-UK future partnership.Check our Brexit timeline for more info: 
Lord Heseltine - We're in a hell of a mess over #brexit... the case for the fudge is building up.. just get out then sort out the details.. the British people are being offered a pig in a poke.. public opinion is moving & in my view the brexit majority is dead#peoplesvote #FBPE
WATCH: Entrepreneur and founder of @ebookers @dinesh_dhamija shares why it's vital we have a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal because of the jobs, trade deals and funding that are at risk 
"Its a serious demolition of Britain's world stature, it's a loss of power, it's a removal of Britain from the top table". #Brexit #FinalSay
Lord Heseltine: We extend #Article50 & reopen negotiations with Europe on the issue they're going to have to discuss.. whether we are in or out.. which is immigration & if we can find a solution to this then the whole momentum for #brexit is undercut.. then hold a #PeoplesVote.
Doorstep @minpres at #SalzburgSummit18:“We have to make sure we maintain the integrity of the internal market. That is in the interest of the 420 million people who will stay in the internal market.”#Brexit 
Brexiteer John Redwood MP shuts down BBC remain stooge to get his point across that many within the Commons & Lords are working against the people to derail #Brexit 
#Brexit: EU leaders warn time is running out for a deal 
Joseph Muscat the Maltese PM now vocal in his call for Britain to have yet another referendum, this is the same bloke who said Britain will have to "bow to European laws for up to a decade" after #Brexit
Sigh...two years on and still this rubbish. The EU operates as a trading bloc. In a worst no-deal #Brexit scenario the bloc loses trade with 1 country the UK. The UK loses trade with bloc of 27 countries.  How is it "more a problem" for EU? #notrocketscience
WATCH: Life doesn't always turn out how you thought. It's ok to change your mind. If #Brexit isn't turning out the way you thought, maybe it's time to think again. It's time for a #PeoplesVote
‘The #EU helps us to be friends,’ says 3 year old Nancy, who has also called on politicians to 'sort it out.' #Brexit via @BBCNews#endthechaos

The debate on #Brexit so far has been dominated by those with the loudest voices and strongest views.How can we find out what the silent majority of @Conservatives voters thinks? The only poll that will give us a true picture is a #PeoplesVote.
Ireland’s Europe Minister @HMcEntee has been on the phone for a long time outside the #salzburgsummit2018 - and I imagine it’s not a call to work out her weekend plans. Critical time for the Irish border aspect of #Brexit. Compromises being made? 
Momentum are supporting a #PeoplesVote ? Well if that bunch of revolutionary Trots think something is a good idea then we know it's anything but.#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
Talk of EU leaders wanting second #Brexit referendum is somewhat of a red herring. They’ve never hidden fact that wish U.K. would change its mind but they do not believe it’s likely. Not something they’re actively planning for
Hey Tim Martin - instead of blathering on about the wonders of #Brexit, how about recognising unions at Wetherspoons and paying its staff a living wage?
Liam Fox believes "we are on course to negotiate with the US for an FTA and that will require compromise,".Why, Mr Fox, do Brexiteers find it acceptable to compromise with the US but not with the EU?Conclusion: #Brexit is NOT about Taking Back Control.
At these crucial times we need those Brexiteers in Cabinet to show leadership on #Brexit just like Boris Johnson & David Davis have demonstrated. We know that certain Cabinet Brexiteers want to be PM (Male & Female). Staying silent on #Chequers would certainly not win our support
In today's newspapers adverts about @LeaveMnsLeave Rallies. Looking forward to speaking in Birmingham. Six locations & some great speakers all standing up for #Brexit @DavidDavisMP @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @OwenPaterson @Nigel_Farage @DavidJonesMP @KateHoeyMP @BrendanChilton & Tim Martin

A chaotic mess that caused endless misery for millions, pushed through by incompetents despite repeated warnings of what would happen. That's the railway fisaco. In a few months' time Chris Grayling will be refusing to take any responsibility for #Brexit.#PeoplesVote
One positive thing that #Brexit has done is to expose our political classes as nothing but ineffectual middle managers. Too scared to speak truth to power. All hiding to keep their jobs. At the next GE they should all go. #PeoplesVote #FBPE
What is Theresa May's Chequers plan? Here are the key points from the deal published by the government in July #Brexit
'Cut those tariffs, forget Chequers' Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin has some advice for the PM on #Brexit 
EXCL: ⁦@patel4witham⁩ rallies millions of #Brexit voters warning them #PeoplesVote campaigners 'want to steal our victory'. She says: 'Their aim is simple. To reverse the result and put Brussels back in charge. To steal Brexit and take us all back to square one.'
Can #r4today @BBCNews stop referring to a 'second' referendum? The #peoplesvote is the first chance for the people to vote on the terms of any #brexit deal negotiated by #theresamay, and whether the British people think this is better than what we enjoy now as an #EU member.

Former ally attacks PM's #Brexit strategy “Does she really want to go down in history as the Prime Minister who gave us a Chequers deal that no one in her own party wanted, with Jeremy Corbyn’s help?”Frankly, the answer to that is clearly yes
Theresa May tells EU27 she won't delay #Brexit despite lack of a dealTypical pig headed May approach. In any negotiation, if you need more time you take more time, instead of rushing to an arbitrary deadline. Page 1 of Negotiating for Dummies

Absolutely ridiculous the Maltese and Czech PMs said in Salzburg that they want the UK to have another #Brexit referendum and change our minds. About time the EU learnt to accept democracy, instead of repeatedly telling countries to vote again when they make the "wrong" decision.
Ian Paisley REMAINS an MP after WINNING petition demanding he face by-election.Good news for #Brexit.   
The Today programme leads on TWO EU leaders wanting Britain to reconsider #Brexit. I’d be surprised if any didn’t want us to reconsider.
Even more reasons to fight May's Chequers plan.  Read #Brexit summary here: 
@davidallengreen offers a sober(ing) assessment of the current state of play, with a UK govt. in office but not in power & #Brexit politics behaving like a fareground walzer... if you need clear sensible analysis of #BrexitShambles this week, this is it
Michael Segalov tells @nick_clegg that he and the #LibDems “sowed the seeds of Brexit” when they supported #ToryAusterity. Is this fair comment? #NickClegg#Brexit 
Off to bed too late as usual. Dreaming of the days before #Brexit. Anyone remember what they were like? I read loads of books and went to bed about 11. Those were the good old days.

You do realise the party most against #Brexit the Lib Dems is also the one that did the most harm by lying to the electorate before they joined a coalition with the Tories to destroy the Welfare State. I wouldn't believe their words for a second on Brexit or anything. 
"The exact same benefits" - like the 'benefit' of London losing its financial status? How about $£€bazillions already moving out of the UK? Or banks and other companies moving or openly planning to. #Brexit already fails Labour's tests (@jeremycorbyn,  @Keir_Starmer).
If #LibDems knew how damaging #Brexit would be and were genuinely against it, why was it in their 2015 election manifesto? #LibDems #YellowTories
Informal #SalzburgSummit18 dinner finished. Tomorrow the summit continues on internal security and #brexit (eu27).
The #UK has become a doormat under #TheresaMay. May let the EU walk all  over us, May surrendered to all their demands, May sold out #British #democracy & she was more than happy to do it because she never backed #Brexit & has been working with the #EU to stop us really leaving!

BREXIT: Leaked Tory dossier reveals secret plan to replace May in April and ranks her possible successors /#Brexit 
An MP in the governing party of the U.K. tweeting this crap just sums up the abject failure, absence of intelligence and total dishonesty of the #brexit shysters
Progress is hard to make when you promise to:1. Protect GFA, no hard border2. Leave customs union & single market3. Oppose special deal for NI around customs union & single market Which are all together impossible...When will the UK Gov start dealing in reality? #Brexit 
The X’s represent how many times an account has been shadowbanned on Twitter in a week. It’s a common practise on Twitter you onion... But on that logic. You have a European Union flag in your name. You’re an embarrassment to Britain.  Happy #Brexit  
You’ll also find your relationship with the electorate will also profoundly change @theresa_may As you know there is now a greater proportion of the electorate against #brexit it than support it. That is why you’re afraid of a vote on your deal. You’re afraid of a #Peoplesvote
Great to have @TSSAunion's @SamTarry speak to a packed meeting of @TootingLabour this evening about why his union believes #Brexit would be a disaster for working people and why we need a #PeoplesVote. Thank you for coming.
Won't somebody please think of the children!This house is in the Republic of Ireland, the trampoline & swings are in the United Kingdom. In 191 days these kids will have to leave the European Union to play !#Bonkers #Brexit #Irishborder @BorderIrish
The body of EU law, essentially created by its government - the EU Commission, called the Acquis, is 187,000 pages long. And growing! This is what May wants Britain to be shackled to under #Chequers, with her slyly named 'Common Rulebook'. Doesn't look like #Brexit, does it? 
The rising star of the @LibDems is none other than @LaylaMoran A voice of reason and tolerance as all around British politics stumbles into extremism.An opponent of #Brexit who deserves our support.
Individual MPs have to be persuaded to make a stand if Parliament is to give people a #FinalSay on #Brexit. I can vouch for the fact that’s hard. But when our country is so divided on such a fundamental issue, the answer is more democracy, not less 
That’s a wrap in Dublin! Up next tomorrow we are in London at @LDNIrishCentre at 7pm Thursday 20th September. Help us make those with power listen and stop #Brexit #Borders Come on London we’re calling!

If the Tories had any sense they would arrange for a #PeoplesVote. It would leave Labour floundering & largely exempt the Tories from blame for what happens next. And it would be very hard for the Brextremists to successfully  oppose democratically consulting the public.#brexit
Honda have announced that they will keep producing cars in Swindon – no matter the outcome on #Brexit.Will this commitment to the UK be as widely reported as some of the Project Fear scare stories being put about? 
Saboteur's Diary.I remained absolutely FILTHY today. I loved it. Also decided to be much more elite than usual, so watched 3 episodes of University Challenge, back-to-back, during lunch, and listened to some Mozart. HA HA HA HA HA! If that doesn't defeat #Brexit, nothing will!
We spent 4 decades trying to opt out of various bits of #EUWe voted #Leave in a referendum.We NOW have a PM who wants to opt us BACK into parts of EU!I honestly believe if Mrs May presses reset button...I think they would now bite our arms off!#Brexit
I know Raab has just said he wouldn't use the word "chaos" to describe a no-deal #Brexit, but the businesses who are actually responsible for moving goods across the border think otherwise so far (common refrain from road haulage and freight transport)

The EU's decision to censure Viktor Orban is step in the right direction to stamp out such contemptible discrimination.It is shocking that Tory MEPs voted against this, just for the sake of getting somesupport in #Brexit negotiations.
"There has to a #Brexit debate on the conference floor, without doubt." Absolutely right.The energy and passion of grassroots Labour members has made it possible. At #LabourConference those members can convince the leadership to back a #PeoplesVote

Why do you, at sky news, never post anything positive with regards to #Brexit? What happened to impartiality in the media. All I ever see is scaremongering from Sky News. #disappointed
Listening to their #Brexit spokesperson #bbcnews  DUP obvs getting their retaliation in early.Remember the time the PM had dinner with EU partners ? - agreed a way forward - then summoned from dinner to take a call from Arlene Foster - & immediately reneged ?..#DUPcalltheshots
I think sadly the tone in Holyrood has become polarised as #brexit pressures bring #indyref2 closer, the opposition parties are all out to 'get' the SNP on any subject at all. This week it's childrens' education. It'll be something else next week.
Can we pencil in a crisis on the #Brexit backstop for next week? 
"A 2017 poll of more than 4,000 people aged 18-30 revealed that 1 in 3 had experienced a decline in mental health since 2016, with nearly half citing #Brexit as a cause" The hidden impact of the Brexit uncertainty is painful reading. Nobody voted for this
Thank you @RupaHuq we will continue until #Brexit is stopped. We stay visible & have a steady flow of people joining us from across the country to share the message that Brexit is #NotADoneDeal. It’s not too late, we will have a #PeopleVote we can stop this!

This is what Brexiteers have said all along. Surely this must blow #Chequers out of the water? After all, weren't we were told Chequers was drafted because the EU would't accept trusted trader/technological solutions? #Brexit 
I‘m surprised anyone is surprised that #Brexit will lead to the selling off of the NHS to US companies. It has been the Tory agenda behind Brexit all along. Now we are being prepared for the inevitable blow bit by bit #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Report out by @SMMT on the effects of a no-deal #Brexit  'U.K. buyers of a car from the EU would be faced with a 1,700 euro price increase if manufacturers and their dealer networks were unable to absorb additional costs.'
“Every day that is left, we must use for talks” - says EU Council President Donald Tusk as he calls for a new #Brexit summit in mid-November 
Today there is perhaps more hope but there is surely less and less time. On the Irish question and the framework for economic cooperation the UK’s proposal needs to be reworked. #Brexit
With all this talk about EU citizens leaving the UK due to #Brexit and taking their taxes and expertise with them - you Brexiteers know we're taking our British partners and families with us so the skills and tax gap will probably double, right?

Hmm: I have a company car, it’s leased. The lease company and their insurers don’t allow cars to be driven outside of EU/EEA. The lease company doesn’t know whether I will be able to drive my car to visit family in UK after 29/3/19. Applies to all Belgian-insured cars? #brexit

4) second reason is anger at Corbyn's piss poor #Brexit referendum performance.  I know he's a brexiter, and I know he was faking it during the ref campaign.It may be unfair to blame him as the reasons Remain lost were complex, but remain lost by a few percent.
3) Labour support however has always been & is increasingly pro remain.  Therefore in terms of changing a major party's position on #Brexit (vital to softening or stopping it) it was always going to be far easier attacking Labour Leadership prevarication on #Brexit  than Tories
They're discussing #Brexit on #VictoriaLIVE, two tory MPs and a panel of mainly Brexiters (how surprising) but what's even more depressing is a lovely German lady who's sold her business/house and is going home after 19 yrs, she doesn't trust this govt, how true #PeoplesVote

It's almost as if triggering the fixed timescale of article 50 before working out what #Brexit actually meant was a bad idea.
Leave want to kill off the NHS with #Brexit. Leave have already stolen 10 years wages from 30,000 nurses, 10,000 doctors, 10,000 teachers, and 20,000 police. Leave have nothing to offer UK. #PEOPLESVOTE

Four years ago today, after Scotland voted narrowly to stay in the UK, was the saddest day in my life apart from family bereavements. All that's happened since has confirmed it was a huge mistake to vote No to indy. Let's not make that mistake again at #indyref2 #SNP #Brexit

"Britain must suffer a little bit in these #Brexit negotiations. They can’t have a sweetheart deal.” -Angela Merkel reported to have said privately.Now that the cat's out of the bag, will Mrs May summon the courage to revoke her capitulation to the EU and walk away boldly? 
I think that many people believe that the #NHS is some kind of inherent thing...a British right.It was created.It can be de-created. Without us knowing it. Especially if a few billion are on the table. Which the nation will  need post #Brexit. No government could say no. 
This is EXACTLY what Brexiteers have been arguing for months; Irish border is an easily solvable problem with a little imagination and has been shamelessly politicised by the EU. Good to hear them starting to come to their senses#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit

#LibDems in coalition with the #Tories facilitated #Brexit, *not* Labour.  Lib Dem’s have reneged on every major campaign promise, whereas Labour has had 6 clear tests from the outset. The Tories have not met these, and accordingly Labour will be voting *against*.

What utter tripe. We are NOT better off economically, politically or socially. We are on the edge of disaster thanks to your bloody party in-fighting and lame-duck party leader. Get out of your self-interest bubble and btw, nothing has been as divisive as #Brexit

Lively debate on #Brexit last night with Jacob Rees Mogg. Leaving the EU with no deal and trading on WTO terms would be a disaster for the UK, not an "economic boost" as he describes it. See the full debate here:  (TD office)
Vince Cable's speech summed up the state of #Brexit & the state of Britain more accurately than anything I've heard in the past year.Yes - the LibDems are a comparatively small party.But they are the voice of true sense & it is the sense that must prevail at the end of the day.
Now this I completely agree with. Some very sobering discoveries by @JasonJHunter and his #3Blokes colleagues, on the impending disaster that is #Brexit. #3Blokesinapub
“#Brexit is not inevitable, it can and it must be stopped,” Sir Vince Cable tells Lib Dem conference

BMW moves UK Mini plant shutdown to just after #Brexit in case of no deal 
Many of us have feared all along that this was hidden agenda of #Brexit - Hannan’s think tank and Cato Institute drawing up blueprint for NHS privatization and regulatory bonfire. Believe me Brits should fear nightmare of US health system 
Might have used different words. But the thrust is right. We need to break through the learned helplessness, bullying & groupthink that blights our politics and is pushing our country to the brink. A new vote to give people a #FinalSay on #Brexit is the only way through I can see 
Car giant #BMW will shut its main British manufacturing factory immediately after #Brexit day 
Refreshingly direct. Not often you see the #LibDems forced to confront their role in #Brexit 
I know the @BMW plant well, one of the finest car plants anywhere in the world producing the ever popular Mini. This is the latest example of the looming #Brexit disaster facing Britain’s Automotive industry. @bernardjenkin, is @BMW ‘making it up’? @SkyNews @DailyMirror
Before #Brexit, the UK government asked for a report on the impact of EU migration on its economy. The key results (thread) : - European migrants contribute  £2,300 more to public finances than the average British adult. 1/3
Mini plant to close for a month post-#Brexit 
And people wonder why Ireland is doubtful about Brexit. Listen to Conservative MP, Andrew Bridgen on RTE's Morning Ireland today. Listen and weep, that is..... #brexit
BMW to shut its Mini factory immediately after #Brexit day next year for at least a month, because of the rising risk of a "no-deal" divorceNo one voted for this, that's why we need a #PeoplesVote

Project Fear said: ”The UK will lose the advantage of the EU policy removing roaming charges for use of mobiles around Europe.” This week the main mobile companies have confirmed they will not be imposing new roaming charges when we leave. #Brexit
Andrew Bridgen is a UK MP. Try to get your head around that. This Brextremist is utterly clueless about the implications of #Brexit for the Irish Border issue. Another woeful example of a high priest of this idiotic project parading his ignorance shameless in public.

1. I wonder how many of the MPs in the 100 constituencies now showing a majority in favour of stopping #Brexit & wishing to #Remain in the EU...or those shifting close to switching are reading the runes & starting to question openly the decision to leave & backing a #PeoplesVote?
He absolutely nails the state of #Brexit today. Brilliant from @mrjamesob No wonder everyone’s talking about a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay referendum leading to an #ExitFromBrexit

Barnier has stomped on @michaelgove suggestion that deal can be "unpicked".  DEFFO NOT. he says, then #May kicked Gove in the balls and agreed.  Since this was his rationale for backing Chequers, he will be resigning then? @borisjohnson #boris johnson   #borisjohnson #Brexit

very important point by @ChukaUmunna : If UK wanted to change its mind on #Brexit it could (the door is still open) and if the UK chose to hold a #PeoplesVote at the end of the process and needed more time to hold one this would be granted @peoplesvote_uk
Economic growth in Eastern Europe is much higher than in the UK. The tailing-off of pent up demand to move, and economic catch-up will mean that migration from Eastern Europe will naturally tail-off. There is no need for #Brexit to control this migration.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

.@ABridgen iv on @morningireland. Possibly the most uninformed, ignorant piece of nonsense on #Brexit.  Deeply patronizing and misguided. ‘I don’t think areas of Nth-Sth cooperation are related to @TheGFAgreement’ was my fave among many obnoxious mutterings..

It's a simple fact that public opinion re leaving the EU has changed.No benefitsUnsound resultMajority against leaving.These are the facts. The UK is no longer a democracy. It is an oligarchy.For the few. Not the many.#PeoplesVote#Brexit #FBPE
"People knew exactly what they were voting for!" We keep getting told. So I've devised a very simple test to see if it's true.#r4today#brexit 
#Brexit is not a political movement anymore.#Brexit is a religion with a congregation of zealots.What other way is there to describe a group that acts on belief only and is prepared to sacrfice everything for the cause.#PeoplesVote#FBPE
Jaguar putting workers on a three day week is not #ProjectFear, it is #ProjectReality. #Brexit is slowly breaking Britain. When will #Leavers wake up? When will the #PM wake up? When will #Parliament wake up?
I have many views on #Brexit and most are not suitable for public consumption. But here are some academic musings from our @LiminalSpacesWT project and what #Brexit might mean for #health #research #regulation #liminality Link:
Not a bad view for @BBCNaga this morning! @BBCBreakfast is live from #brussels this morning on #Brexit 
#Brexit #DearTheresa @theresa_may I've got the solution to this #BrexitProblem Let's call the whole thing off #Poll #BrexitPoll  Do you think #Brexit should be called off #YES #NO ?#Panorama @BBCPanorama @bbcnickrobinson
1. The now infamous Copyright Directive is a solid example of why we should leave the EU. Not of itself as some suggest but it gives us an insight into how the rest of the EU functions. (#Brexit thread)
Oh dear, sounds like Moggy  has a rather large bet ... on #brexit chaos ! I wonder how much he'll lose if we #StopBrexit ??? 
When politicians insist that a #PeoplesVote is impossible because cancelling #Brexit might provoke civil unrest, this is what they have in mind.A small rabble of racist thugs is being used as an excuse to deny us a #finalsay on our future.
Great snakes!Well over half the readers of Telegraph online and almost half of online Mail readers think Britain should remain a member of the EU if another referendum were held today.It seems the lies just aren't working any more.#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Gina Miller tells LibDems to put "values before vanity", arguing for referendum on #Brexit terms. Clearly no sense of irony. Message to Gina: the British people voted for #Brexit on 23 June 2016. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg has now completely lost the plot & is lashing out at anyone who talks down his dream of a #hardBrexit... he calls Mark Carney(BoE governor) a "wailing banshee" & someone "who's quite hysterical about #brexit & can't be taken seriously" #FBPE #peoplesvote
Fuck Off #NickClegg you had your chance and blew it. You should take responsibility for enabling #Tory #austerity policies, which has lead to disenfranchised people to vote for #Brexit
A reminder of why Murdoch wants the UK out of the EU. "When I go to Downing Street they do what I say; When I go to Brussels they take no notice."What Britain needs is not fictional independence from the EU, but real independence from Murdoch!#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
#BBC relentlessly bulling up the #EU funded IMFs latest 'fantasy economic predictions' today.They even stress Lagarde's claim that every #Brexit scenario would be bad for UK!Clearly implying #Britain should remain in #EU.#BBC have abandoned any pretence at impartiality
"Nothing is more favourable to the rise of politeness and learning, than a number of neighbouring and independent states, connected together by commerce and policy."Hume making the case against #Brexit ... in 1742
This latest blow, alongside the cheese famine, will be the tipping point for many in #Brexit Britain. It's the children I feel sorry for.
Misrerabilist Remoaner Philip Hammond claims that no-deal #Brexit threatens to set the UK back 10 years, in seeming collusion with the IMFThis ardent Europhile does not believe in Britain or #Brexit and consequently has no place in no. 11 Downing Street
Mes amis. I was in court today, and able to get divorced, after much complicated negotiation.I just want to thank you all for the love and support, including practical, you’ve given me. I wouldn’t have coped without you.Now time to kill #Brexit.I love you    all.
The “Chequers Deal” was DESIGNED to be unacceptable to the EU so they could be blamed for the “No Deal” #Brexit that’s been planned all along. It’s not just me seeing this, is it?
The European Central Bank has called on European banks to transfer capital from UK to the continent to guard against #Brexit. Deutsche Bank is therefore planning to transfer 450 bn euros to Frankfurt. DB to reduce *size and complexity* of UK business 
When you try & explain impact of Brexit on a very divided society &  how act of leaving EU forces NI into a position where fragile process and arrangements provided by GFA are threatened and compromised, you're accused of scaremongering. No scaremongering, just reality #Brexit
Lies,lies,lies,and more dam lies. If You and that deceitful prime minster pull this off the tories as you know it will be gone for decades. 17.4 million people will not be voting in the near future as democracy will be gone forever. #brexit#BrexitBetrayal
Allow me to translate: The people in charge will use #Brexit (if by some strange chance we actually get it) as an excuse to advance the #GreatReplacement - in crude terms, fewer Christian Poles, more M***** Pakistanis!
That's why Brexit is such a mess.She's ringing the wrong fucking Jean-Claude!#bbcpanorama #InsideNo10 #Panorama #Brexit pic.twitter.com/3mHnKNa4my
Dominic Grieve apparently upset at Theresa May's "my deal or no deal" attitude on #BrexitPerhaps he should have paid more attention when he buckled all those months ago and backed Theresa May at the last minute on the "meaningful vote".... 
#TheresaMay revives on #Panorama the discredited line that we pay “vast amounts” of money to EU. In fact, the 2% of public spending that we do jointly at EUlevel often saves us money at national level by sharing costs &avoiding duplication. Anyway, it’s less than cost of #Brexit
"America stands ready to boost US-UK trade and increase our shared prosperity" - US Ambassador to UK, Woody Johnson. Why is the British govt cowering to nations that spurn us rather than embracing our friends across the world? Why?#Brexit 
Clear from BBC #Panorama that #TheresaMay’s strategy (with willing assistance from the @BBC) is to present the #Brexit choice as between her deal or a no-deal #Brexit, hoping people will fall in line behind her deal. In fact, of course, there are other options, incl #StopBrexit
Getting a passport photo just in case I need to escape to a better country. #Panorama #brexit #TheresaMay
Robinson's lying already. "Chequers was a compromise with the EU." No it wasn't. It was a compromise between members of her own incompetent cabinet #Brexit #May #Panorama #BBClies
'Discussed #Brexit and #Malta #UK  bilateral relations with @theresa_may at @10DowningStreet' - Prime Minister @JosephMuscat_JM #London
One depressing thing to come out of the #brexit referendum is the idea that the elderly are all selfish, reactionary bigots. They were a radical generation that defeated Nazism, built the NHS, nationalised industry and established the welfare state.They deserve our gratitude. 
People think #Brexit will make them poorer, travelling will be more bureaucratic & difficult, and that the Government has made a mess of negotiations. And they’re right. What a mess. #brexitbourach
Sickening and shameful deceit from Daniel Hannan. The post-referendum resistance began as an entirely unorganised grassroots movement and only gradually & after a huge effort has it picked up support from more than a handful of politicians. #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
On tonight’s Panorama, shadow #Brexit secretary @Keir_Starmer says a new #referendum should be considered as an option in the event of a no-deal. 'Inside No 10: Deal or No Deal?' is on @BBCOne in half an hour. #InsideNo10 #BBCPanorama
He's left it a bit late, but @JunckerEU is finally joining the #Brexitcast bandwagon... sort of. And we've recorded a special episode to mark 6 months to go until #Brexit day!   / iTunes: 
With nearly six months to go until #Brexit, a poll commissioned by @bbc5live suggests the UK remains split over its impact on the UK
A damning indictment of the entire #Brexit process.The government has taken us to the brink of our darkest hour in peace time.The only way out is a #PeoplesVote. #Labour can lead us there if we listen to our members and change party policy at #Lab18.
Health board says #Brexit poses 'very high' risk of disruption to #NHS
Here are the #Brexit options available to the UK, and the order in which they are best for us:1. Remain in the EU.2. EFTA-EEA ('Norway plus').3. The Norway option.4. Ukraine-style.5. The Turkey option.6. Canada-style.------------------ 100. No deal.
- “Are you sure it’s ok to jump out of this plane with no parachute?” - “You were on the ground before and you were fine. Plenty of people on the ground right now and they manage. The ground won’t hurt you. Unless the ground is being unreasonable.” #Brexit 
Tory dickhead and hard right brexiteer Bernard Jenkin accused JLR of scaremongering and 'making it up' over the damage #Brexit will cause.... This afternoon a large chunk of their workers were put on a 3 day week, another Brexit benefit hey Bernard? #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit.
Remember these are the people who forced #Brexit onto the  mainstream parties and are still driving that agenda with the support & co-operation of lots of Tory & even some Labour MPs 
The House of Commons is advertising the ‘new role’ of Brexit Editor - to provide ‘MPs with the information they need to scrutinise the Brexit process’ - just six months before we actually leave the EU, FFS. Not bad for £50K. Not sure whether to laugh or cry. #Brexit 
Ah, good old Christine, a true European. She is right that #Brexit will be a disaster. We should all listen. After all, she was spot on with the referendum.
.@Andrew_Adonis: "Our 45 years [#EU] membership have been the most successful decades for the United Kingdom ... #Brexit economically damaging in any form ..." #CHEvents @SimonFraser00 @ChathamHouse

Once again, the IMF lines up behind the heart-of-remain Treasury on #BrexitIt was bad enough when chums Lagarde and Osborne conspired, unsuccessfully, to scare us into remainingNow it's the Hammond and Christine showMore doomed-to-fail Project Fear
READ: Charles voted to leave in 2016 but now wants a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit. As a Doctor, he has seen the negative consequences for the NHS and believes the people should have the #finalsay:
Why is this happening at #Jaguar?Because VW were caught fiddling emissions & the crackdown on diesel has caught Jaguar short.Let's not attribute this to #Brexit, even FT can't quite manage to stretch it that far (though manage at least 2 references to Brexit scaremongering). 
It's my #Brexit deal or no deal - UK PM Theresa May tells rebels 
Nigel Lawson says #JLR citing #Brexit as a reason for 3-day week “because they always do”. He suggests it’s an easy way for the car industry to avoid blaming them selves. #deluded #StopBrexit and free us from these fools. @LBC
No 10 admits a new Prime Minister could re-negotiate a deal with Brussels after #Brexit 
Likely outcomes of a 'no-deal' #Brexit: NHS could run out of drugs  Ambulances stopped at border  Spiralling costs for business  Huge lorry queues  Empty shelves  Increased credit card costs  Planes grounded  Manufacturing collapse

Find out how much Brexit will cost the UK with @ChrisMasonBBC#Brexit 
Who - the 17.4m electors who voted #Brexit ? 
The Tories have been catastrophic.Is it possible they want a #NoDealBrexit?In this way they can blame a likely #FinancialCrisis on #Brexit Meanwhile @bbcnews & other broadcasters are unwavering in theirsupport for the @conservatives & Theresa May.We must get #ToriesOut
Bernard Jenkin isnt daft he knows the #Brexit day of reckoning is close & brexist politicians like him will soon be seen as criminally irresponsible liars charlatans vandals and fools @bernardjenkin is positioning himself as a fool in the hope of leniency
There is no way I'll be watching @BBCPanorama and it's tory love in with @theresa_may, she's allowed to promote her disastrous #Brexit unchallenged by the sycophantic Nick Robinson, this is a disgraceful party political broadcast on behalf of the tories and we are paying for it.
Faced with the realities of #Brexit, UK is desperate to convince its partners of the need for a tougher sanctions regime against Russia, resorting to insinuations, unverified facts and media leaks. 
More than 3,000 Jaguar Land Rover staff will go to three-day week in a clear sign  of what #Brexit is doing to this major economic sectorWhen will @UKLabour act to protect jobs and #StopBrexit
.@PeterKellner1: A new survey from YouGov shows that by March 29, it will be difficult to sustain the argument that the British electorate want #Brexit to take place. We need a #PeoplesVote to give the public the #finalsay on #Brexit: 
We should have a referendum on whether we should have the death penalty for terrorist murderers.Most people would vote for that.So why don't we have such a referendum?Because the MPs think they know better than us plebsJust as MPs think they know better than us over #Brexit 
Again the thoroughly discredited IMF spews more laughable predictions of #Brexit doom and gloom. No Deal [on WTO terms] would require a period of adjustment but to say it would shrink Britain’s economy and cause “substantial costs” is wide of the mark
The government should listen to the  North East Business Community on #Brexit 52.4% say Brexit will have a negative impact on their business. A mere 14.1% believe Brexit will be positive @peoplesvote_uk @NEEChamber #brexitshambles
The Brextremists will inflict any amount of no-deal suffering, and risk unleashing any amount of violence in order to get their #Brexit tax haven for the rich. And there is no lie too big or too gross for them if it helps them to achieve that goal. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
#Brexit: The PM says 'it's either my deal or no deal' If I had my way, it would be No Deal - though again No Deal is highly misleading term - It is a WTO #Brexit which we should not be afraid of#StandUp4Brexit#ChuckChequers
It may, however, be a mistake to jump to conclusions. #Brexit 
In Madrid today, cordial meeting with @sanchezcastejon to prepare for #Brexit #Salzburgsummit18. A deal with #UK is possible if integrity of Single Market is preserved. Full support for Spain in its negotiations w/ UK on #Gibraltar, which need to conclude asap.
.@endthechaosuk will bring much needed clarity to millions of Britons about the implications of Brexit for them, their families and communities, complementing the good work done by @peoplesvote_uk” #Brexit
Today at the BBC. triple Brexit crisis1) strategic: May’s 2017 decision to take membership of the SEM & CU off the table.2) political: inability of HoC to approve ANY Brexit deal.3) constitutional: over NI and SCT & repatriation of EU powers.Gloomy.#brexit #mcrjmce

You may believe in EU membership, but the British people don’t. #Brexit 
Sadiq Khan called for a second referendum on the final deal. Some people just need to focus on THEIR job. It would make the world (or London) a better place. #Brexit BBC News - London mayor Sadiq Khan calls for second Brexit vote 
Conservatives have given us a decade of savage austerity that has ripped apart the fabric of our society and enriched them & their friends. They are now rubbing their hands with glee that #Brexit voters have given them the excuse for another decade of even worse savage austerity.
'It's so undemocratic': #SadiqKhan is lashed by the #Tories AND #Labour for saying #Brexit should be DELAYED to make time for a new referendum with the option of staying in the #EU 
WATCH: Dan is marching on October 20th to protect his rights and to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal 
Every day we will be releasing a video from a young person demanding a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit. Young people, who have the most at risk from #Brexit, will be leading the March for the Future on October 20th. Make sure you sign up: 
There are, apparently, about 400 MPs who think #Brexit is a bad idea.It would appear they are all too drunk to stand up, or have no spines. 
Somebody please give James O’Brien a slot on #bbcqt #PoliticsLive #Panorama and/or @MarrShow to knock some sense of balance into the #BBCBias reporting and to say a few words of wisdom about this #Brexit disaster. He has something relevant and important to say. @mrjamesmob 
I’d take what Christine Lagarde says about the expenses of #Brexit with a healthy dose of salt 
A cuppa, a quiz show and a big red box full of #Brexit problems.@theresa_may and Philip May relax in tonight's #Panorama at 8.30pm on @BBCOne.#InsideNo10
One  More  Time  For  @BorisJohnson The backstop DOES NOT in any way alter the constitutional status of Northern Ireland.What it does do: Give people of Northern Ireland an insurance policy to help mitigate a monstrosity that WE NEVER asked for #Brexit #Backstop

IMF and Treasury are singing from the same #Brexit costs song sheet. Here's why  My Economics Blog
Great vibe @LibDems conference. We are united to stop #Brexit which is already ruining lives. Now more people want to remain than leave it is our aim to turn this wish in to a reality, why not join us? #FBPE
Fact1. Any achievable form of #Brexit is going to be a car crash for UK. It’s just a question of how bad. Fact 2. @BorisJohnson is much more to blame for this sorry situation than @theresa_may.
Deal or no deal, #Brexit will take a sledgehammer to jobs, NHS, economy…Govt are blindly going ahead with their #BrexitShambles, and as @jeremycorbyn continues to dodge supporting a #FinalSay, he is just letting it happen. Be it Tories or Labour, it is all the same mess.
If #Brexit is stopped by the electorate in a #PeoplesVote, then it will be an example of democracy in action, with the Tory elite stopped in their tracks by ordinary people. I only hope they all lose their shirts on it too
Momentum for a #PeoplesVote is growing - Lib Dem @LaylaMoran and Labour @Andrew_Adonis sharing a platform at #LDconf with @Demos to discuss all things #Brexit and why fighting for a @peoplesvote_uk is vital.
Theresa May has said there are only two #Brexit options left, her Chequers deal or no deal. But there is still a third option, let the public decide by giving them a #PeoplesVote
How many times have I heard the cliche 'our children are our future' used by a variety of people to claim a variety of things. Don't speak in their name: LET THEM SPEAK! Let them decide about their future!They (78%) want to be part of the #EU!!#Brexit @Femi_Sorry
The real reason Brexiters are desperate to avoid a #PeoplesVote on any final #Brexit deal is very simple.They think that they would lose it.This is usually the reason why people wish to avoid a vote, but they will come up with all sorts of nonsense to disguise it.
You know you’ve written too much about #Brexit...When your iPhone autocorrect turns leave into Leave.
On 18 Sept the @EU_Commission's chief #brexit negotiator @MichelBarnier will brief #EU27 ministers on the Brexit talks. EU27 ministers will discuss withdrawal issues and the framework for future EU-UK relations. This'll be followed by a press briefing 
There is no #Brexit deal whatsoever that is more beneficial to the people of the UK, UK jobs or the UK economy than #Remaining in the EU.This is an irrefutable FACT. I defy any #Leavers to provide evidence to the contrary.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Christine Lagarde: No-deal #Brexit would lead to "reduced growth, increased deficit, depreciation of the currency"IMF chief warns of grave consequences if Britain leaves EU without a deal

Now we know the #Brexit options the Tories are offering.a) Brexit in name only orb) No dealBoth involve the continuation of Tory #austerity.Having failed in the negotiations, Ms May should act in the national interest and call a general election.
International Monetary Fund warns no-deal #Brexit would inflict "substantial costs" on the UK economy

BREAKING: #BREXIT deal HAS been reached - and will be unveiled at special summit in NOVEMBER.Let's see what that spineless EU quisling May has done. 
.@theresa_may says we will leave with ‘no-deal’ if Parliament doesn’t back her ‘Chequers Deal’.What she fails to say is that there’s a third way: a General Election..@UKLabour are not at #Brexit war & will negotiate a deal for the 52 AND the 48.Let @Keir_Starmer take over.
„It may, however, be a mistake to jump to conclusions...“ #brexit 
Theresa May says it's either my deal or a no-deal. This is the stance of a gangster threatening to inflict massive harm on the British people if she doesn't get her own way. The British people are being treated as hostages by a criminal government #Brexit
Scotland voted to:1. Remain in the UK The UK then voted to:2. Leave the EUSo yes, we did vote for #Brexit. 
What? The man, Ralf Speth who has transformed @JLR_News into a world-class success story, doubling the company in size to over 40,000, is ‘making it up’, according to @bernardjenkin on #Brexit? The irrational zeal of the #Brexiteers is breathtaking! @BBCr4today
This weekend, from Devon to Lincolnshire, to Talbot Green, we had stalls across the country campaigning for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Don't miss out on our National Action Day on Sept 29. Sign up now: 
Hey, @BBCBreakfast until you’re prepared to have actual trade experts on your show, I am not interested in what joe-public has to say. Get @JasonJHunter on and let’s get to core of the issue. #brexit #bbcbrexitBS
Why is @BBCr4today and MSM giving airtime to minority issues from unelected, undemocratic forces such as Clegg, Blair, Major and Miller? 85% of people at last GE voted for Leave parties. #BBCR4today We are Global Britain, let's unite behind #Brexit and our brilliant future.
JUST OUT! How independence is more devastating to Scotland than any Brexit scenario - my latest column in today's @TheScotsman  #indyref2 #Brexit
#SadiqKhan is what happens when you promote an incompetent milk monitor to class President. Now he's advising on foreign policy? #Brexit #SackSadiq
Why is #Brexit taking sooo long? 
#bbcbreakfast guest talking about #Brexit “We’re the envy of the world” and we can manufacture and grow our own crops if need be. Absolute. Fucking. Idiots.
When YOUR child has had 17 surgeries in 3yrs, THEN you will 100% understand that having the BEST people for the job is infinitely more important than what country they come from. #Brexit will deprive us of a multitude of medical talent - it's a tragedy that WILL cost lives.
Robinson allowed May to enunciate the benefits of #Brexit without pointing out to her that she said the exact opposite during the Referendum campaign. That's not journalism. It's public relations on behalf of the Conservative Party. #r4today
#Brexit Conference“Proud to have formed Brexit Advance Coalition with 10 other like minded organisations & look forward to inaugurating a fantastic programme of events & speakers in an alternative [Tory] conference in Birmingham in first days of October."
.@BBCBreakfast "The young" are idiots on #Brexit, they have done no research, they haven't lived 40 years under Brussels tyranny, all they masturbate about is mobile phone roaming and open borders for themselves.  Me, me, me - fuck the UK! #BBCBreakfast
Yet again, @BBCNews (@BBCPanorama  preview) allows #TheresaMay to go unchallenged in presenting the #Brexit choice as her deal v. no-deal, not mentioning the growing clamour to ditch the #brexitshambles entirely #bbcnews
Come on @BorisJohnson ... Don't bottle it just because the Prime Minister is threatening to call referendum if you challenge her. #Brexit has been one big bluff since the beginning ... call hers and we will vote for a No Deal 
#Brexit is the perfect deflector shield. While our A&Es and ambulance service and mental health services collapse; while homelessness rockets; while working people have to go to food banks and children go hungry, the Tories squabble over #Brexit and our media report the squabbles
Just heard MP @bernardjenkin on @BBCr4today claim that Jaguar Land Rover boss Ralph Speth “was quite frankly making it up” in relation to the £1.2bn/yr cost of a no deal #Brexit to the business @JLR_News. Extraordinary claim. No wonder the public is losing faith in politicians
#Brexit: Eight in 10 UK voters believe government has handled #EU talks badly, poll findsLess than a third of Britons think leaving EU will leave them better off, according to survey

Is this what it has come to? A battle of wills between the PM and Boris? Even more reason (as if I needed one) to fight for @peoplesvote_uk @FFSake_ #Brexit is about our children & grandchildren not about squabbling, self righteous, wealthy politicians  
This is their plan a political agreeement of warm words of good intentions a new leader will rip up. We will #Brexit  w no deal - no certainty for biz, another broken #Leave  promise & more Tory squabbling. Business & ppl must speak out or this will be our future @peoplesvote_uk

(NEW REPORT) #Brexit: six months to go - the progress made since the EU referendum and what to expect in the frantic few months ahead 
A binary vote, held on a particular day started the process. It said leave. Nothing more. Nothing as to where we should go. Those who voted for it could have a myriad  endgames. We started it, we should finish giving our consent to that held in our name. #PeoplesVote #Brexit
1. Observer view on giving voters a chance to deliver their verdict on Brexit terms A #PeoplesVote is the only legitimate way to sort this #Brexit fiasco but it must beSimple MajBinding &Binary #Brexit deal OR #Remain
For 3 yrs+ Remoaners told us we HAD to have a hard border in Northern Ireland.For 3 yrs+ #Brexit supporters said this was utter nonsense.Today the EU have said it can be sorted with technology & trusted trader status.Chalk that up to another Remain lie.....like we always KNEW. 
Looks like @Labour4EU met a number of leave voters who have #bregret now they see the effect #brexit will have on the lives of working people when they were.out in Nottingham this weekend.This is common all over the country, their voices must be heard.#RemainerNow
20k people of concern. 650 being investigated. This is a bloody outrage. We are ALL at risk. All those on watchlists must be DEPORTED now. @ForBritainParty #hardbrexit #brexit we have enough trash of our own. 
Lord Alan Sugar says #Brexit is 'going to be a complete and utter mess' and has called for those who promised £350 million a week for the NHS to be prosecuted. Perhaps, but even more urgent is to make sure that there is a #PeoplesVote on any final deal.
The EU has imposed a set of rules for investment communications so boneheaded, so riddled with flaws and so counterproductive that it is hard to believe even the bureaucratic tar pit of Brussels could have yielded such a monster:  #Brexit
I know @AndrewMarr9 pro #Brexit bias is as inevitable as the sun rising but take a look at this@SadiqKhan lays out in detail the *specific* impacts of no deal Brexit...and #Marr ignores all that because all he hears is "you're against brexit"The specifics? Just noise
Giant 55-stone tuna, accidentally netted by British fisherman, and which would have been worth £10,000, will instead be incinerated due to barmy EU rules:  #Brexit
But he does take a position on #Brexit unlike the spineless official opposition. So he seems  to have more integrity than you.Brexit  is your day job, pull your finger out and oppose it.
Hey @AndrewMarr9 Why didn't you mention on your show that the #Brexit vote was even more tainted than we thought & ask how a vote won with such illegality & lies can be allowed to stand?.. Oh yes, I forgot you blocked me for asking awkward questions. 
A very wise, moderate Conservative chum often reminds me ‘Never forget, 99% of Tory fighting over Europe has got nothing to do with EU, the national interest, geopolitics. It’s about careers & the party.‘If you look through that prism, much #Brexit irrationality becomes clearer
Boris Johnson: "We are heading for a car crash Brexit. And you know what's funny? I'm actually the main person responsible for the mess we are in now."#Brexit

"EU protects UK jobs" is the biggest lie we've been told during this whole #Brexit furore.Here's @FT in 2010, before they became an EU propaganda rag.@UKLabour used to be unhappy about this, before they abandoned the Working Class.
In this article, I tell @MetroUK that after years of austerity, #Brexit is adding devastation to the NHS and paving the way for £multi-billion healthcare firms (incl US) to accelerate privatisation. The NHS community is now fiercely against Brexit.
#Brexit betrays Britain because it is the tool of a transatlantic clique of the tax and regulation hating rich and super-rich who are using visceral fears of social change to destroy the liberal democracies that block the road to full kleptocracy. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
The #brexit debate has opened my eyes to the dirty underbelly of UK and international politics.Even when we have stopped this massive act of self harm, I'll be working to reform it so that it really does work for the people.#CountTheWins
Surprise, surprise: Sadiq Khan has now thrown his lot in with hardline Remoaners to re-run the #Brexit referendum.The arrogance of the political class grows ever more staggering. They still refuse to accept the will of the people. 
At our stall in #Camborne yesterday we talked with a farmer who supports Britain's continued membership of the EU because of the support it gives to British farmers.The NFU has warned that #Brexit could mean "apocalypse" for our farmers.#Cornwall #PeoplesVote
All done quietly, systematically and with the full intention of stitching the UK so far into the EU political project that we could never escape. Brexit is our last & only chance! #brexit 
Well, #Brexit has finally arrived at my door. The wife has told me that her work can’t take on any more EU business contracts. @meljomur - remember when I told you about Middle Edinburgh, especially financial Edinburgh waking up one day? Might be sooner than I thought. #Indyref2
Simon Clarke MP proposes not paying the #Brexit bill even though the UK is now legally required to do so up until 2064.Simon, are there any other illegal activities that you recommend? 
Right now @jeremycorbyn, while you're supporting #Brexit, knowing the destruction it will wreak on this country, YOU are also a threat to us. You CANNOT support #Brexit and claim to support us - it's one or the other. Get behind #PeoplesVote and we'll get behind you. #StopBrexit
Thanks to the courage of the whistleblower @shahmiruk & the tenacious investigative journalism of @carolecadwalla, we've seen how #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw Courageous people are standing up to the #Brexit bullies.#CountTheWins
Celia Imrie says #Brexit is a 'disaster' and that she would 'love' to reverse it

Correlation does not imply causation. Or so we're taught. #brexit #PeoplesVote #statistics
Sinn Fein leader @MaryLouMcDonald tells @SkyNews that #Brexit makes Irish unity “a more imminent reality”, accuses the Tories of “utter indifference to Ireland” and Boris Johnson of being “deliberately provocative.”
‘Attention to detail is noticeable by its absence’ that’s the core of how #UK is approaching #Brexit- lots of grandstanding but little attention to detail. The society not well served.  
A) Independence is a confident step forward, a “no deal” #Brexit is a frightened step back.B) Independence is about economic & social engagement with the world unlike #Brexit. C) If Scotland becomes independent the people will have voted for it. They never voted for #Brexit
Has anyone carried out a study on the effects of a Pot Noodle only diet plan? Only I am considering stockpiling Chicken & Mushroom for the #Brexit. This will be from week 2, after I have sauteed, fricasseed, slow cooked my cats, and those of my neighbours.

An overwhelming number of women think the #Brexit process has been a mess.Do you agree? Sign the petition for a #peoplesvote today
An important debate being had in Scotland about how we decide on our future and what that should be. In contrast we are being spoken for on the issue of #Brexit and dragged out of EU despite our vote to stay.  That democratic context should give everyone pause for thought. 
Problem with Ruth is she has failed to be honest about the bigots and racists in our @ScotTories party she has also U Turned on #brexit against the wishes of her constituents. Very disappointed in her focus on self promotion. 
It was great to visit @PimlicoPlumbers stand at #LDConf & take part in their plumbing challenge. Fantastic to support the great work @PimlicoPlumbers is doing in fighting #Brexit. Keep up the great work @PimlicoPlumbers!
French TV tells viewers that if Scotland was independent and in #EU it would wealthier than France. Interesting no wonder so many of our @ScotTories voters are now rejecting #brexit Britain

#food and #Brexit: @jayrayner1 looks at the prospect of our cupboards being bare :
Until there is electoral reform, I am prepared to put up with the hard left or hard right government fuckwittery in this country as it is only for 4 or 5 years. I'll be fucked if I will put up with #Brexit that will fuck up my life for the rest of my life and that of my children.
We asked Tory MP @ABridgen (who previously said 'negotiations with the EU have deteriorated into a state of complete capitulation') what part of #Brexit is going well. After asking who pays us - he said we'd have to 'wait & see' - which is clearly code for badly. #StopBrexit
Oi Brexiters!! Ever heard of 'CAUSE and EFFECT'? Without #Brexit, we wouldn't have CAUSE to fight it. Without #Leavers, there would be no #Remainers. You made us, dipshits - we're the EFFECT. Deal with it. We're there right till the bitter end. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
Michael Gove ducks criticising Orban on anti-semitism and press freedom.  Tories are turning into the excuseniks party... #Brexit-friend-in-need 
It's a fact that 95% of UK businesses do not trade with the EU. Their voice is rarely heard above the calls from the multi nationals who unsurprisingly want to protect their own profits even if that means democracy is denied. #Brexit has to consider the majority, not the minority 
From the very moment Britain voted to leave these individuals have been working to keep us in the EU. None have lifted a finger to help negotiate an optimal exit. Their defeat is essential - not so much for delivering #Brexit but to rescue the idea that voting can change anything 
The RESPONSIBILITY of an MP is, in this order - * COUNTRY* PEOPLE* PARTY * SELF The MPs in this country have completely reversed this and as such are FAILING in their duty as GUARDIANS of the State. #Brexit is just ONE result of this gross failure. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
How did Michael Gove go from being a leading Brexiteer to this duplicitous turncoat pushing through Theresa May's BINO, #Chequers plan for #Brexit that brings only economic vassalage with the EU?
"@michaelgove admits PM’s plan for #Brexit is temporary – and could be changed in years to come"Unbelievable, so why are Brexiteers in government backing this #Chequers nonsense If #Chequers is no good, stand by your principles and #StandUp4Brexit
"Rather than having a 'bad deal' or 'no deal', let’s put that to the British public with the option of staying in the EU"London mayor Sadiq Khan calls for second #Brexit vote   #Marr

Not sure I get this:Gove says a second referendum is an attempt to ‘frustrate the will of the voters’.This is insane. If the voters really want #Brexit they will vote for it again. If not, they won’t. Simple.#PeoplesVote
Sadiq Khan just said he wants to suspend Article 50 and keep the UK in the EU beyond March 2019. @UKLabour now need to make clear they rule out trying to delay #Brexit. Will they?

I'm a member of the Conservatives, but it doesn't mean I sit idly by & watch the #Brexit promises be sold down the river.Watch @michaelgove on #Marr earlier today imply that we accept the #Chequers fudge & then someone else changes it later.Unbelievable, & very dissapointing.
Lord Alan Sugar says #Brexit is 'going to be a complete and utter mess' and has called for those who promised £350million for the NHS to be prosecuted. 
815 days since the UK returned a #Brexit result.815 days later, we're STILL having to fight the same battle.815 days & we still have a govt incapable of enacting the simplest binary decision we've ever handed them.Yet it's UK *voters* who didn't know what they were doing? 
#MichaelGove soft-pedalling support of the #Tories for  odious #ViktorOrban  a 100% xenophobe & Jew-hater (he's channeled that to just #Soros ) shows you all you need to know re: how far #Ultras  like Gove will go to achieve their goal. He's  given us the  #VichyBrexit#Brexit 
I’ve met quite a few potential constituents now. I’ve met leavers and remainers who want to vote on the outcome, and leavers & remainers who don’t want another vote. No-one yet thinks we have the political talent to get out of this #Brexit mess and improve most peoples lives.
The problem with a General Election is the false belief by the @UKLabour leadership that everyone who voted #Labour in 2017 will vote for the #LabourParty again. So many of those votes were temporary. If @jeremycorbyn keeps supporting #Brexit he will lose another election.
Have you been to our #endthechaos'Questions and Answers' page yet? It is an easy to navigate page which aims cuts through the jargon around #Brexit.
Gove: Stating that Chequers is a temp stop gap as a future PM can change it.ME: So it's clear over time any #Brexit will become an ERG #BrexitShambles. The Ppl R twigging it's a shame the #Labour Leadership are naïve enough to believe in a Labour Brexit#PeoplesVote #Remain
This.This is what really worries me.Gove has now told us.If we leave the EU on any terms there will be no stopping the hard line Brexiteers.Any form of #Brexit will become a No Deal Brexit.Very very quickly.A #PeoplesVote is imperative to #StopBrexit. #Marr
Give Britain a new referendum on #Brexit, says #SadiqKhan 
Dear Prof. Goodwin,The next time you disagree with me, you are welcome to send me a (polite) reply, instead of tweeting a screenshot of my views. We clearly have opposite views on #Brexit & #Populism -I respect your opinions, and I would be grateful if you could respect mine.
I would like to support @UKLabour, but I cannot while their leadership insists we respect a vote achieved by cheating and breaking the law and denies us the democratic right to a #PeoplesVote. All the promises will only be deliverable if there is no #Brexit.

excellent news that the @ObserverUK newspaper has come in support of a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal

This is sad. Trying to drum up jingoism and thoughts of victory in WW2 to deflect the public from the catastrophe of #Brexit. They must think we're all fools. 
Sadiq Khan has called for a second referendum on #Brexit. 
The Observer calling for a referendum on #Brexit urges that: “Those advocating staying in the EU would need to run an altogether different campaign from the project fear of 2016, centred around a positive case for EU membership”. We agree wholeheartedly. 
.⁦@theresa_may⁩ stop acting like a wannabe Henry VIII & give us a say on #Brexit. The idea that the 2016 referendum is binding and we must leave at all costs makes a travesty of democracy! We were told there would only be upsides. Lie.  #PeoplesVote
#OTD 1982. Barbara Castle urges Labour to ditch their policy on European withdrawal. Having once campaigned for it, she claims #Brexit alienates the party from its traditional supporter base:"Anyone who believes withdrawal is a vote winner is living on cloud cuckoo land" 
Just a reminder that the Royal College of Nurses, the Royal College of Midwives and the British Medical Association all oppose #Brexit and want a #PeoplesVote, because Brexit will trash the NHS.
A #PeoplesVote was a foolish fantasy only a few months ago.Now it's emerging as the only way out of this #Brexit mess for Leavers *and* RemainersThe Tories are eating themselves & Corbyn is hiding.  A vote on the deal is the only way forward

Amazing that two years after winning in 2016 both #Brexit and @realDonaldTrump are now rapidly unravelling in a sea of recrimination, lies, undeliverable promises, bad governance and growing supporter disenchantment. Let’s see both go down in 2019 #LockHimUp #PeoplesVote
This is absolutely true. A journalist friend can't find any NHS staff who admit to supporting #Brexit. If there are any, they're few and far between. It's my duty as an NHS doctor to make clear: Brexit will screw the NHS. Your NHS. Brexit must be stopped.

Not quite. I believe we will find @BorisJohnson was in contact with the Russians during #Brexit.
If it was true that the post-#Brexit checks at the border are going to be so seamless and invisible and instantaneous, there'd be no problem with them being in the Irish Sea.
“The Irish Government has not altered course throughout these talks&the EU has backed us all the way. It has been humbling for me .. to hear solidarity from European leaders which is as forceful in private as it is in public” - Ireland’s Tánaiste @simoncoveney on #brexit talks.

"The Irish government's attitude towards #Brexit talks is completely baffling" says former Irish ambassador @ray_basssett after new #Irexit party @IrexitFreedom is up against little support for leaving the EU.Could you imagine Ireland following the UK out of the bloc?
As we have said: the approach @JeremyCorbyn & @Keir_Starmer have taken over #Brexit has been absolutely correct: v. clear what was expected from negotiations. @UKLabour aren’t in power, aren’t negotiating & have no majority.But they forced the @CONservatives to a corner. 
Well i will certainly not be insulting people with that emotive tweet.! The NHS had issues long before #brexit so please don't insult our intelligence. The NHS needs a long term cohesive package rather than the short term reactive policies that have predominated recently.

Monthly cleaner at my house today.I came back from a #Brexit street stall with my toddler who randomly handed her a #peoplesvote flyer.Unprompted, she said, she abstained in 2016 as felt she didn't know enough. She has regretted it since. She confirmed she's #RemainerNow
"It doesn't matter who is in the driving seat of Brexit if the steering wheel is broken" says @mikegalsworthy of @NHSvBrexit as he repeats the need for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal at today's #PeoplesVoteNHS rally.
Perfect summation for #Brexit Britain. Something to cheer as we turn our gardens into allotments and open a tin of Spam.
Interesting take on why there is such a growing momentum against #Brexit : 
"We will not remain passengers in this vehicle that is out of control" says Dr Terry John of @TheBMA as he calls for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal at today's #PeoplesVoteNHS rally.
#brexit in a nutshell, we voted leave for our children and grandchildren,  not for a few extra euro's holiday money or visa free EU travel like the shameful #Remainers
Suspending or extending #Article50 also way to rule out #NoDeal #Brexit too -but PM terrified of the extremists and can’t act in the national interest...Chancellor Philip Hammond angers Theresa May with idea to delay Brexit to fully prepare for No Deal

After its shambolic treatment of Leave campaigners, it's clear that the Electoral Commission is not fit for purpose.  #Brexit
Lord Alan Sugar says #Brexit is 'going to be a complete and utter mess' and has called for those who promised £350million for the NHS to be prosecuted. 
The pressure for a #PeoplesVote will become overwhelming, because there is no chance of attaining unity for any #Brexit plans in the Commons.The only realistic and democratic compromise is to give the vote back to the people. Our MPs would be wise not to rule it out completely. 
Doubly misleading from @bernardjenkin. Commons vote will be on the A50 withdrawal package, not Chequers. Chequers is UK opening bid in a second negotiation about the future relationship which will come later in 2019 after #Brexit. And not true British people voted for an FTA. 
High Court judgement confirms that the Electoral Commission acted unlawfully on its handling of the EU referendum. The #Brexit debacle just gets worse and worse. 
Today I’m speaking at the #PeoplesVoteNHS rally demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal because #Brexit risks the health of the NHS. Sign up to march for a #PeoplesVote on October 20:
#Remainers, especially @theresa_may , take note of this.  Your brave ancestors died often horrifically to save this country from a European tyrant. Honour your brave ancestor's and don't give away the freedom they paid for. #EU#Brexit 
There seems to be as many different versions of the #PeoplesVote vote as there are #Brexit. What would it entail?Do you reject or accept the final Brexit deal (or no Deal)? If the Brexit deal is rejected by a majority, do you wish to renegotiate Brexit or remain in the EU?
If you think that those of us who voted for #Brexit are ignorant racist morons, this one is for you.
Patience is running out with Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn and his 'respect the vote' achieved by cheating and breaking the law Mr Starmer @Keir_Starmer. You know #Brexit will fail your 6 tests. Stand up and oppose it and support a #PeoplesVote
This is a must read on the media framing of #Brexit & the particular responsibility of @bbc

2. We shld also note whilst not illegal c.5m UK/EU cits who face direct #Brexit fall out, were disinfranchised. That alone should cause MPs pause for thought..Quite evident a maj of them have no concern about the true Will of the Ppl, just in imposing their wills on the Ppl.
Even if Corbyn betrayed referendum result, how would he actually stop #Brexit and how many votes would Labour lose in next GE because of it? No power, no change to anything including a Tory hard Brexit. Do the maths. Tory referendum, Tory negotiations, Tory mess. Let them own it.

Dear British people,Stop saying you're "ashamed" for Brexit. Here on the continent, we are quite grateful that you dealt the undemocratic EU a major blow, because we don't have any more love for this institution than you do.So as a Dutchman, thank you for voting #Brexit. 
Correction. Following yesterday's lame puff piece with @BBCandrewkerr which technically is an "interview", I have had 1 interview with the BBC in the last 116 days. #indyref2 #Brexit The same number as the Salisbury assasins by their state broadcaster.

My take away from Geneva: However bad you think #Brexit is going to be, it'll be much, much worse.
If #POTUS @realDonaldTrump had a fictional double, it could only be Britain’s finest #007:Gets the job done, #MAGA@theresa_may however who more resembles one of the characters in #TheSpyWhoDumpedMe gets nothing done:Hard/soft Brexit when #WeThePeople just want #Brexit 
And so, Sir, support a #PeoplesVote to save your country, my country and all of the people who live therein from the damage that #Brexit would inflict upon us.

great to see @MatthewParris3 talking up merits of a @peoplesvote_uk on the final #Brexit deal  - more and more people getting fed up with complete and utter mess #Brexit causing #PeoplesVote
READ: Matthew Parris says vote on #Brexit "could save us from disaster": 
No deal #Brexit or Chequers fiasco - what a choice!? Both are terrible & like Lehman collapse, future generations will pay the price for this mess long after a terrible, delusional, selfish  govt has gone #FBPE
I seen me a mermaid onceI even seen me a UnicornBut I ain't never seen me no #Brexit dividend that don't involve making Mr Mogg richer.#PeoplesVote
When you realise the U.K. will hurt Scotland with #Brexit When you realise that U.K. policies hurt people in Scotland every single day. When you realise that the solution is self-determination. We can do things differently. Better. Fairer. Kinder. That’s when a No becomes a Yes.
The right-wing Brexiters only made immigration an issue so they could get votes for their low-tax, low-regulation, low-welfare #Brexit tax haven. They will be all too ready to import more workers from the 3rd world with far fewer rights than EU workers.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
#Brexit Britain is about to be destroyed by a mega-cyclone. It's no doubt been attracted by all the hate crimes since the advisory referendum. Luckily, the diversity and unity of the EU means it will be repelled away from our citizens.
In Ireland we didn't choose/vote for it but everyone was asset stripped & foreclosed because of banking excess. Governmental agencies basically wrote everything down to nothing, businesses closed, the vulture funds cleaned up! Same will happen when the economy tanks here! #Brexit
Read my latest blog, now online @An_Phoblacht on partition, #Brexit & setting out a road map towards an agreed, united Ireland. 
We are being held to ransom by a percentage of 27% of the electorate who voted to leave based on a campaign that cheated & broke the law. Even if all of the leave voters went out on the streets if #Brexit was stopped, that's still 63% of the electorate who wouldn't. #PeoplesVote
#Brexit - For anyone looking for footage of David Davis advocating a second referendum on the terms of withdrawal from the EU if the UK voted to leave, here he is talking about it in a speech at the People's Pledge Congress for an EU Referendum in October 2011: pic.twitter.com/Y3zBMveWye
The High Court ruling of the challenge to #Leave spending brought by @JolyonMaugham and funded on @CrowdJustice just found out that the elections watchdog was wrong over #Brexit expenses.  
A party in government should be confident enough to allow debate on party policy. We may not be allowed inside the secure area at Conference but our Fringe event on #Brexit will go ahead on 1/10. All welcome - no pass needed! @bestforbritain #FinalSay
On 14 July 2016, David Davis said by September 2016 Prime Minister would "trigger a large round of global trade deals... to be concluded within 12 to 24 months." Times up and we have zero, zilch, 0, #trade deals. #Brexit @Feorlean
A #Brexit young people did not ask for is being imposed on them -- and their voices and futures have been ignored. 16 and 17 year olds should be given a voice too. #VotesAt16
Dom Raab says business using #Brexit as excuse for poor sales. Fact: before Brexit UK top of G7 for growth, now at bottom. Fiction: Raab has a clue what he’s doing. #FBPE

Just heard Murdo Fraser parrot Ruth’s line about “we used to be #Brexit Remainers but…”. As Remain voters they knew - and still know - the damage that even the #Chequers proposals will do to Scotland.  Their duty as Scottish representatives is to stand against that,not accept it
This is part of the current Tory establishment ‘s hard sell of the Chequers proposals as a “good deal”. They aren’t and nor is a blind #Brexit. SM & CU membership only possible alternative . Davidson: Theresa May's critics must 'quit the noise' - BBC News 
Guy Verhofstadt - The #Chequers plan will not fly on trade & economics because it's pure cherry picking... we will not destroy the rules & values of the EU just because of #Brexit.. the victims of a #NoDealBrexit will be the workers & industry in the UK.#PEOPLESVOTE #FBPE
Writing for the @Telegraph, @DanielJHannan explains the growing momentum behind the #CANZUK campaign, and why cooperation with #Canada, #Australia and #NewZealand is the greatest option for the #UK after #Brexit.#cdnpoli #auspol #nzpol #ukpolitics
The British public have been lied to about #Brexit and the Leave campaign broke the law.  Important findings out today. These people simply cannot be trusted. They flout the rules and are now trying to spin their way out.
Great to see the excellent @WeAreTheMU backing @LabPeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk - no surprise given devastating impact this reckless Tory #Brexit will have on musicians. Always delighted to work with them to defend our creative industries and musicians. 
Now that #Brexit is going so badly & #Brexiters are losing the argument terminally I honestly think the term #Remoaner needs 2B superceded by #Bremoaner. Poor dears really are struggling to see their debased Brexit invalidated by reality & a majority in favour of #Remain.
This is an insult to the intelligence of Scottish Farmers - do you think they don’t know #Brexit is totally a Tory mess? The incompetence is all yours buddy! #BrexitChaos #Chancers
Our brand new briefing looks at a key issue in the current #Brexit debate: post-Brexit governance. How will a future EU-UK relationship be managed between the two bodies? And what has been agreed already? Our briefing has the details 
#ProjectFear #brexitProject Fear projections are coming in waves now. There are *many*people doing their utmost to block a clean Brexit.Take a look at this anti-Project-Fear "moment" page. It has some VERY useful info. Remember how Project Fear ramped up, before the Referendum. 
Gina Miller launches fresh action to end Brexit chaos #Brexit #EU #EUREF #endthechaos
Wow, this just so laughable! How you expect ANYONE to come up with post-Brexit Policies when you Tories can’t even decide/agree what #Brexit will look like! You are all fighting like #CatsinaSack #BrassNeck #BrexitChaos
The Brextremists cannot present a coherent plan to the public because their scheme to turn Britain into a #Brexit tax haven for the rich is one which they know the public would overwhelmingly reject. So they have to use the stealth tactics outlined by US economist James Buchanan.
Useful dialogue w/ @DominicRaab this morning on the progress our teams have made this week on the #Brexit WA. But substantive differences remain on the Protocol for IE/NI, governance and GIs. We are also continuing our discussions to find common ground on the future relationship.
"We have yet to see a single assessment or report that cites any improvement, economic or otherwise. It is now time to stop viewing #Brexit as an inevitability and re-assess whether we as a nation want to go down this route." @MarcBuehner#PeoplesVote #PeoplesVoteCymru #FinalSay
Amused to see the British papers during my 36 hours in London. For more than a year, headlines have reflected a permanent crisis over PM @theresa_may's managing of #Brexit. Whatever the date on the calendar, every day seems to be the (imminent) end of May!
I am flying the Pimlico red and blue flag at the @LibDems annual conference in Brighton this year, in support of the Lib Dems determination to stop the UK leaving the EU. #LibDemConference #Brexit #LibDems
Inside the EU the UK had high employment, a stable jobs market, strong workers rights, relatively low inflation, low food prices, high quality imports and a good standard of living for most.Remind me, why is this being risked on the alter of #Brexit. How will UK lives improve?
We already knew #VoteLeave cheated. Now the High Court rules that they were also wrongly allowed by the Electoral Commission do things they shouldn’t. The basis for #Brexit looking ever dodgier  
Not looking at all good for the Electoral Commission, and the advice it gave to Vote Leave, which it resiled from and fined them for relying on after the #Brexit vote  via @GuidoFawkes
When #Brexit is over & the lies/propaganda have ended.We'll look back & I really hope some are ashamed of the treatment of people like @darrengrimes_.We scream we want the young involved in politics, then the establishment craps all over them.Not a good look, UK.
Tuned into #PoliticsLiveListened for 5 mins to PUNDITS pontificating & passing their opinions on the current state of the Tories & #Brexit based on pure speculation & gossip, as peceived from within their own protective bubble.They DON'T a clue about *real people* #TunedOut
There are plenty of losers where #Brexit is concerned & none greater than the UK economy. I am not prepared to sit back & let Theresa May’s unhinged & frankly, dangerous #Government blindly walk Britain into a recession.  It's time to stop Brexit! #PeoplesVote #BollocksToBrexit
Ah yes, @BorisJohnson gets the coveted “Jared Kushner’s Backchannel” endorsement from Russia’s Embassy in America.It may be unclear to Britons why Russia’s Embassy *in the United States* should be boosting BoJo  amidst SteeplechaserGate   #Brexit #Skripal
No deal #Brexit could be as bad as the 2008 financial crash and may wipe a THIRD off house prices, BoE governor warns cabinet 
Good for .@UKLabour , announcing it will vote against any #Brexit deal by the .@Conservatives in order to force a general election. The sooner the Tories are out, the better! Remember 70 per cent of the UK public supports Labour policies. #PoliticsLive
So Vote leave and remain both fined (though the media mostly focused upon one of those fines).  But now turns out that the Vote Leave fine was due to entrapment.Which would mean that only Vote Remain lied and Vote Leave made the mistake of trusting experts.#Brexit
The bigger problem is: we have a UK Government that is highly manipilative of state funded media #bbc and with a long record of telling BIG lies about the economy, public services, privatisation #brexit, employment, immigration, homelessness, anti-semitism and much more.
Main reasons for a #PeoplesVote now proven wrong:- @ElectoralCommUK confirmed #VoteLeave's actions- £350m/week will go to the #NHS- Roaming charges unchanged after #Brexit ... but don't worry, utlra-Remainers will find another 'democratic' reason to try to overturn #Brexit
4. And this is not because of perceived "abuse", but the left realized after #Brexit & #Trump that it is losing in the war of ideas!But the good news: You can kill (ban) users, but you can't kill ideas!#Twitter #Censorship #AlexJones #InfoWars
Breaking: High Court has ruled that the Electoral Commission is "not fit for purpose" and its regulation of the #Brexit referendum was a complete shambles. In Scotland we should be asking if the same is true of the #Indyref referendum. Which we know it is!
My interview on @BBCRadioFoyle with @markyptweets about the possibility of EU mobile roaming charges returning if there is a “no-deal” #Brexit. 
Gina Miller on Brexit: "It is a time of existential challenge for our country and our country is crying out for clarity."  #Brexit #endthechaos
Miller: "It is morally and democratically right to give people as much information as possible about the implications of Brexit so that they can make informed choices." #endthechaos #Brexit
After some analysis it is clear that @PrisonPlanet orchestrated a personal troll attack at me the other day.  The trolls I reported have been found to be in breach of twitter rules on hate. This is further evidence of the fascist machine behind #brexit and @Jacob_Rees_Mogg #FBPE
Comment on #brexit just outside Londons Waterloo Train Station on the roof of @PimlicoPlumbers #bollockstobrexit @BBCLondonNews
Parliament watchdog probes Rees-Mogg’s hard #Brexit lobby over “other sources of funding.” #JacobReesMogg
Bank of England Governor Mark Carney tells his audience at the Central Bank of Ireland in Dublin: “Our job, after all, is not to hope for the best but to plan for the worst.” #Brexit
Never. I've never seen such a bunch of lying, rancid deadbeats in my life as that #Brexit rabble. I'm still waiting for ONE of them to give a single advantage of leaving the EU. These bastards are a fucking disgrace.
It’s time to #endthechaos! With new #brexit facts and information coming to light every day, it is morally and democratically right for MPs to let the people decide their future. 
Plenty of discussion about the risks of leaving, almost none about the risks of Remain. Suggest Remainers listen to this German on the Eurozone, Target2 and how the euro crisis is far from over. #BREXIT
Two faced traitor Gina Miller on #SkyNews #AllOutPolitics on her trying to stop #Brexit, in the background a hypocritical image of "Stop the chaos".... that's be the chaos the remainers like Mark Carnage Carney are LYING about in effort to stop Brexit. 
Are you as frustrated as we are that young people’s voices are sidelined on #Brexit? Can you make it to Harpenden's town sign at 11.50 tomorrow for a big group photo + #PeoplesVote banner demanding a say on our future? The time to be heard is NOW. Bring your friends!
The French crying they will stop Eurostar trains and turn them back in no-deal #Brexit. But as the French are majority shareholder in Eurostar and Eurotunnel, they will only be hurting their own workers. So, bring it on you dopey idiots. 
Hard for them to tell which Experts they need to ignore nowadays.If I weren't so bloody angry about the subversion of our Democracy & the #Brexit coup imposing a #BrexitShambles on the Ppl w/o a mandate or even majority Consent, I might even feel sorry for them.#PeoplesVote NOW

EU citizens! Another disaster story from #Brexit Britain. House prices may fall, allowing young people to afford their own home, And since youth unemployment in the UK is much lower than the EU, they have money to buy them. Shocking.
Today's @guardian cartoon...#Brexit #NoDealBrexit
So #Brexit is just like the Millennium bug claim the Brexeratti. #Brexit is the antithesis of the Millennium Bug. Like many 1000s of men & women I spent many weeks away from home helping businesses up & down the country to prepare & avoid the effects of Y2K. If as much time 2

It’s Friday.Could somebody please prod May firmly and remind her that #Brexit is not some noble mission to boldly go where others fear to tread. It is demonstrably harmful.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote
Of course this is an area , presently devolved, in which the Tories are  insisting there has to be a UK framework, limiting the powers of @ScotParl post #Brexit....#powergrab
A lovely Italian vet bandaged my paw.  What will happen after #brexit will there be enough vets and pet medicines? Cats support the #Wooferendum we want a #peoplesvote #CatsOfTwitter #eucats
.@ChrisLeslieMP is  correct. So so many leave voters did not vote for the #Brexit that is on offer and as a result they have changed their minds. They are #remainernow Democracy demands that they have a chance to reconsider now they see reality.#PeoplesVote #FinalSay
Because incompetent @jeremycorbyn’s a dyed in the wool #brexiteer & believes the dire consequences of #brexit will drive voters to his hard left policies in desperation but he & @PeoplesMomentum miscalculated as moderate #remain #labour voters like me will never vote for #corbyn

Workers are still unfairly paying the price of the 2008 crash.Now they’re told a no deal #Brexit could be just as bad.No one voted for this.So if May can’t deliver a deal that protects jobs, rights and peace in Ireland, we’ll demand a popular vote.
Reminder: #Brexit is a xenophobic UKIP project by tax dodging elites to destroy workers/environmental protections, to escape EU tax avoidance rules, also to sell off the NHS to US corporations and UKLabour should be ashamed of being part of . It makes us… 
Dear Mr Carney.The biggest risk to the UK is being stuck inside the failing EU when it undoubtedly goes 'belly-up' and we're stuck with footing the bill.#Brexit
Great article by leading #StAlbans #Labour Party activist @mccann_liz, calling for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. @HitchHarpLabour@Labour4EU@LabPeoplesVote @YoungLabour4PV @Remain_Labour@HitchHarpLabour@jh66111@malclab
The UK IS broken, if #brexit happens, #ScotRef will happen, and Scotland will become an independent member of the EU. Then the question becomes: is England broken? Frankly, it's not looking good. Deeply corrupt and run by the far right? England's broken.
#brexit  Bored out of my head everyday Brexit bashing & Donald Trump bashing. Morning noon & night in  give it a rest FFS. Same bloody bores out everywhere on TV & Radio. 17 million voted to leave EU. Donald Trump doing brilliant job in . Brexit & Donald Trump.  
Pat Condell Returns: "Brexit Morons""Nobody’s feelings were consulted during the making of this video. Anyone who has a problem with that can drop dead."Mark my words they will redo #Brexit and it will not be pretty. The elite always win it seems 
#Brexit was a vote to leave the #EU, it was not a vote to stay half in half out, it was not a vote to leave part of the EU, it was not a vote to negotiate a deal to water down our vote & it was not a vote for a transition period to keep us in the EU to 2021. We need a clean break
Fantastic defence of #Brexit from @JuliaHB1 on #BBCQT: There isn't a majority in the #HouseofCommons, I don't care! They asked us the question, we gave the answer and we want the Brexit that we were promised. If #TheresaMay can't deliver it, she should go!
Tory support for Orban exposes a powerful current in the Tory party which has little love for democracy and resents the rule of law over government. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
#brexitAbsolutely first class from Julia Hartley-Brewer.  Somebody needed to spell it out and she's done exactly that.  90 seconds of pure gold.  Watch. 
#jewellery #gold #brexit #Xmas #ChristmasHere's hoping there will be some affordable versions of this in the shops and online, before Christmas.
Rubbish on so many levels!1. Barnier has already said "Chequers deal is dead"2. Davis has zero credibility    - he lied about the #brexit impact reports    - he has hidden facts he doesn't like    - he only did 4 hours work in Brussels this year    - ERG shelved their plan pic.twitter.com/LRedflPHbk
Of course not everyone who voted for #Brexit was stupid.But Julia Hartley-Brewer's argument that democracy dictates that people shouldn't be allowed to change their minds *is* profoundly stupid.Being allowed to change your mind is the essence of democracy.#bbcqt #PeoplesVote
.@faizashaheen on #bbcqt: We've been lied to over #Brexit while at the same time we've paid less attention to schools, transport and health. 
If we have a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal & the people still want to leave the EU, that will be the result.There will only be a different result from the 2016 referendum if the electorate has changed its mind.Common sense!And entirely democratic.#bbcqt
#BBCQT None of the panellists  articulating clearly the point that the emerging #brexit bears no resemblance to what was promised, so people should have the chance to vote on it
The only thing the Prime Minister and the #Tories have created Rory Stewart is chaos, uncertainty and suffering. It will be ordinary people who face the consequences of her appalling leadership. It’s time for a #GeneralElection Theresa May.  #BBCQT #GTTO #Brexit #BrexitShambles
Hear Hear . So many of Britain's youth are having their futures stolen from them.. It just isn’t right. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #bbcqt
Excellent points made by @JuliaHB1 on #BBCQT on #Brexit.The rebels in the Party are actually those rebelling against the Conservative manifesto. The decision on Brexit has already been made  
#BBCQT Interesting that @JuliaHB1 Hartley-Brewer says the #brexit decision is not a matter for Parliament but for the people. So, presume she supports #PeoplesVote on the deal...
Chris Leslie wants a #PeoplesVote instead of a #GeneralElection He wants to stop #Brexit yet keep the Tories in power.He should cross the floor as soon as possible. #BBCQT
Steve Richards nailed the #Brexit scaremongering on #SkyPapers.It is ALL coming from UK Gov.Because they are weak, they're trying to scare us into accepting whatever crappy deal they can come up with, simply because they are incapable (& unwilling) to deliver #Brexit. 
Wasn't EU red tape a major objection to EU membership?Yet #Brexit appears to be delivering red tape in every direction.And to almost everyone in Britain.Perhaps the manufacture of Red Tape will be Britain's new industry. To replace all the ones destroyed.  #Newsnight

BοE's Carney delivered “chilling” warning to UK cabinet that a no-deal #Brexit cld lead to economic chaos, incl a property crash that cld see house prices fall by a third. Carney said that in scenario of disorderly Brexit, BoE wld not b able to avert a crisis by cutting rates ~FT

Patchy is better than wholly inaccurate though, Kay. Well done to @ThreeUK for dispelling your latest #Brexit fearmongering.
A no-deal #Brexit would inflict massive harm on the British people. By using it as a bargaining chip the government is violating its duty of care to the people & acting like a criminal gang threatening to push the hostages over the cliff if its demands are not met.#PeoplesVote
Daniel Hannan MEP - "The alarmist predictions we’re getting about economic slippages are as absurd as the predictions we heard during the referendum - all of which have been falsified." #Brexit 
Owen Paterson - "If you get outside the M25, you hear five words - just get on with it.The public are miles beyond the Government and the establishment on all this. They want us to get on with it." #Brexit 
Another batch of #NoDealBrexit papers released today and still the government haven't addressed the most fundamental question. What is the fucking point of #Brexit?
#Eurostar will not run if there is a no-deal #Brexit, leading French minister warns Brexit, the gift that just keeps on giving.
British government just published update on Common Travel Area in event of no-deal #Brexit: "If you are an Irish citizen you would continue to have the right to enter & remain in the UK, as now. You are not required to do anything to protect your status." 
The EU’s decision to censure Viktor Orbán is a step in the right direction to stamp out such islamophobia & anti-semitism.  It's therefore shocking that Tory MEPs voted against this, just for the sake of getting some support in #Brexit negotiations.  
Despite............................................ Oh I give up.  The Doom-mongers will just never accept that #Brexit has brought a breath of optimism to the UK economy. 
THE HEAT IS ON.   @theresa_may suffers body blow as DUP backs  Brexiteer plan for Ireland, not hers.  This could be awkward.  @borisjohnson #borisjohnson #boris johnson  #Brexit

Gina Miller will be announcing her new national programme of #Brexit-focused action tomorrow morning at Dover Town Hall! If you’d like to attend, then let us know!! Travel is being provided from London.Contact me for further details! 
Young people and their futures are being ignored by @BorisJohnson and @Theresa_May. Who knows how the Tories' calamitous #Brexit will affect them? We can still turn this around, whilst also including young people in the decision #ExitFromBrexit
UK driving licence 'may not be valid in EU' after no-deal #Brexit 
If people are so angry about  a #PeoplesVote then they can vote leave in bigger numbers than before and remainers will have to accept #brexit  if on the other hand its a vote to cancel #brexit well the will of the people would have changed so what is the problem
And a gentle reminder that we were conquered. Nothing voluntary. Still looking for an arrangement that works, a relationship of equals. Let’s say... independence for Wales, then? But an outward looking independence, making new partnerships - in contrast with insular hard #Brexit! 
The British tories were the only Conservative Party in Western Europe to vote not to impose sanctions on the far right Hungarian govt, far right politics is being normalised in readiness for #Brexit think about that, they supported a far right party #ToriesOut @BBCNews @SkyNews
The anti-#Brexit propaganda from @SkyNews has been poor quality of late.Faisal got caught lying over air travel, now the mobile phone companies are debunking today's con.They don't even care, the con is all they know now.
Under its new editor the @DailyMailUK is betraying its large number of #Brexitsupporting readers who regard Jacob Rees-Mogg as a hero, not a traitor and regard the #ChequersPlan as a #BrexitBetrayalIt is now the mouthpiece of RemainBoycott@MailOnline
Today we’ve published the next batch of Technical Notices informing citizens and businesses on how to prepare for the unlikely event of a no deal #Brexit 
People will ask, what’s a long standing Tory donor doing at the @LibDems conference, donating money and putting up an exhibitors stand? The answer is pretty simple, Vince and I are drinking from the same teapot.  I want to stop #Brexit, not soften it. 
And I told you about the pharma companies stockpiling 6 months of medicines at extra cost to them and the NHS - not the red bus we were promised. Time for @peoplesvote_uk . #ProjectReality #Brexit
The same bots, the same commercial electioneering companies, the same Russian interference, dark money and cheating were involved in #Brexit. Let's not pretend we weren't gamed too. 
Will Corbyn finally take the opportunity to listen to his voters & back giving the people a deserved #FinalSayOnTheDeal? He keeps side-stepping the question. As @GMB_union have warned that a hard #Brexit would be a disaster & are joining our fight, Labour must now respond.
A reminder that the primary threat to democracy, liberty and human rights almost always comes from sovereign governments and never from international organisations like the EU. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Oh. This isn't quite what the red Boris bus promised. Not only is #Brexit going to make people poorer, it may actually kill them. #BrexitReality @NHSvBrexit
Ministers are discussing the frighteningly real prospect of a no-deal #Brexit in Cabinet this morning.Yet no one from @DefraGovUK has met with @wto.DEFRA could soon be responsible for 41% of food imports. Failure to discuss Brexit plans with WTO is grotesquely irresponsible.
In her Lancaster House speech the Prime Minister stated that the U.K. would seek “a new, comprehensive, bold and ambitious free trade agreement”. Given the EU is offering this can we now #ChuckChequers and unite around a free trade #Brexit deal that works for both sides. 
Feeling deep and dark today, because I realised that whatever the outcome of the Brexit debacle, the country I knew has gone forever.I lived an illusion, thinking Britain incapable of these events, and safeguarded against evil.Little did I know.#brexit
If true, this is extremely positive. #Brexit is the biggest issue facing our country and this needs to be a priority at @UKLabour Conference. The calls for a #PeoplesVote will only get stronger. @LabPeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk @FFSake_ #ChangeTakesCourage
Bernard Jenkin.. like Dominic Raab.. rubbishes  #JohnLewis's claim that #Brexit was partly to blame for their fall in profits. He also says there maybe a little short term disruption if we have a #NoDealBrexit but he doesn't think people will notice #peoplesvote #VictoriaLIVE
We're calling on the Govt to fully engage with the veterinary profession before making changes that could impact the UK’s ability to trade animal products safely & in line with high #animalwelfare standards #Brexit @theRCVS @BBCNews 
Bernard Jenkin on the consequences of crashing out with no deal: “I don’t think people would notice.” I’m glad we have these words on record. #Brexit @bernardjenkin
Yesterday Scottish Tories farcically tried to blame @theSNP for #Brexit chaos.   Today UK Tories blaming  business for the problems .   Time  @GovUK blamed  its self for its own utter incompetence & the Tory party for the damage caused by its 40 year long civil war over Europe
Here's today's #Brexit #cartoon #illustration #sketch @standardnews
Tories were only governing conservative party in western Europe to support Hungarian far-right in EU voteMore evidence that #Brexit is a threat to democratic standards and the rule of lawI’m quoted 
Andrea your party & in particular the PM is going to try & railroad Chequers thru, hardly surprising. #Brexit now lies in a General Election, as they're not willing to mount a leadership challenge. @UKIP @AMDWaters & whoever all need to come together as one with Brexit MPs.

#Brexit - slowly destroying everything.BBC News - John Lewis profits slump 99% in 'challenging times' 
. "Dominic Raab" is in daily contact with Rees~Mogg and the Ergs. He's deliberately making sure you /your family will suffer as much as possible by antagonising the #EU & initiating a #nodealBrexit.Encountered him while legitimately protesting #BrexitNasty manNasty Party #fbpe
I don’t often swear on Twitter but I am livid with this...FUCK OFF @DominicRaab!!!! Brexit is KILLING RETAIL.STOP PRETENDING (aka LYING) that it isn’t.Any retailer will tell you that costs are up MASSIVELY b/c of #Brexit & profit wiped out.#PeoplesVote#StopBrexit
The Tories should not use Hungary as a political footballOrban is standing up for Hungarians, against Soros and the EU, and for a fair #Brexit deal for the UK
Dominic Raab rubbishes John Lewis's claim that #brexit is partly due to their fall in profits "There will be some temptation from businesses that aren't doing so well to blame #brexit.." #Unbelievable#peoplesvote #FBPE
With their trillion-pound #Brexit dividend & a Plan they won't tell us about, I thought 'Phew. The madness is over now. They've been exposed. Nobody will take Rees-Mogg & his chums seriously again. They'll be ignored.' But then I turn on my TV & they're the first item on the news 
No-Deal cabinet today kicks off at 8.30am; Told ministers will go through about 300 (I Know) various contigency plans for a No-Deal Brexit. We have seen just 25 technical notices so far (28 more today). Gives sense of how much planning going on that we don't know about. #Brexit
Tories & Labour say we have to go through with #Brexit otherwise 'the far Right will rise up.'No - they're only worried about supporters going back to UKIP. This is solely about votes. They're doing it for the good of their own parties, not the good of the country.Shameful.
"Theresa May's entire #Brexit approach demolished" - Read our important summary of @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and ERG's report, on her capitulation to EU over Irish border: 
A BBC presenter inadvertently called the Breakfast Programme the #Brexit Programme - @Andrew_Adonis has been right all along!
So, the #Government is again talking about a No-deal #Brexit. Here is my list of some of the practical consequences. It’s pretty horrible: 
Surely, this is the defining image of #Brexit and its exposure for what it is? 
It is reassuring that “The European Research Group” has begun it’s so-called “research” at the 11th hour of the #Brexit proceedings. From the lot who weren’t so keen on experts anymore, it becomes more credible by the day.
“Even after the child has declared that there are no magic clothes....the naked, shivering emperor does not turn back. He suspects the jeering crowd is right but he feels the procession must go on. He walks “more proudly than ever”.#Brexit #BrexitShambles
Can someone direct me to the option for:Hokey-Cokey Deal: neither in nor out. #Brexit 
More good news for the @Remain_Labour & @Labour4EU campaign!Thank you to members in @richmondclp for becoming the latest local party to call on the party to back a #PeoplesVote and campaign to #Remain in the EU.#Brexit is not inevitable 
#Brexit means workers lose protections like minimum wages, protection from unsafe working practices and protection from cheap immigrant labour. No wonder the Tories are foaming at the mouth at the thought.#Leavers, thar's another one of your arguments that has evaporated. #Mugs
One thing unites many Leavers & Remainers & they often don’t know it.The #brexit chaos can’t & won’t end. Whatever brexit or even remain happens, UK will be riven by brexit for decades & engaged in endless negotiations with EU for just as long.There’s no end to this.No end.
U.K. Cabinet: “if we leave without a deal, we will not be paying the divorce bill”No deal is PRECISELY the Brexit I voted for. #Brexit

Jesus Rees-Mogg drives the businessmen out of the #Brexit temple 
Gawd almighty. You have to ask twice if you want to leave a flipping Windows application, so why is it so goddam dreadful to ask if people really wanted to leave the EU once the terms of doing so have been identified?! Are #Brexit supporters all chickens?#PeoplesVote Now!!
Dear @BBC: 99% of economists -loosely defined- agree there’s plenty to fear. 100% of world leading, research active, academic economists agree there’s plenty to fear. Why does a public service mislead the public? #brexit #WhatEconomistsReallyDo
So our farms only produce 60% of our food&farmers who get 60% of their funding from the #EU voted overwhelmingly to leave are about to lose all that money £3billion & have nowhere to sell their produce if they can even afford to produce it? #Brexit is going well don’t ya think?
Pleased to discuss #Brexit and Scotland with a very experienced & engaged group from #BadenWürttemberg this evening in St Andrews House . Complete bemusement at what @GovUk is inflicting on itself - and us .
@bbclaurak @faisalislam @PestonAppears that David Davies might have insufficient awareness to be so confident over Ireland, ask @JasonJHunter#brexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Today, the #EuropeanParliament voted in favor of starting the process of placing sanctions on #Hungary.Viktor #Orban claims that it's revenge for him not allowing Hungary to be flooded with illegal migrants. Nigel #Farage told the Hungarian PM to join the #Brexit club. 
To any #QueensOfRemain out there. Thank you. This isn’t a love in. It’s a battle for what’s right. And sometimes a group hug is necessary. Just to say I appreciate your efforts. #brexit is shit. Stay strong and let’s support each other as we fight for #remain 
#QueensOfRemain huh? One thing I like abt the #StopBrexit campaign is that there are so many women who are stepping up to save the country from the midlife crisis of middling, white, male MPs who've driven us to the edge in the #Brexit bus ('cos they're too cheap for a sportscar)
The unelected House of Lords once again show how out of touch they areTrying to sabotage #Brexit as usualAbolishing the whole useless chamber should be in the next Tory manifesto#StandUp4Brexit
It appears the People’s Front of Brexitland has fallen out with the Brexitland People’s Front.I’m looking forward to the next scene in the where one of the #Brexit disciples asks what the EU has ever done for us.
Theresa May knew that the Leave campaigns may have violated campaign law when she triggered Article 50. Whether or not she broke the law, it is clear that she showed complete disregard for the norms of correct democratic practice. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
So come on @BBCNewsnight, when is @maitlis going to interview @JasonJHunter about the true consequences of the government's disastrous #Brexit obsession? #newsnight
"Good deal, bad deal, leave, remain - Brexit is a big deal, so we should have a voice"Elizabeth on why she wants a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Agree? Please RT 
This is what #Brexit means to us. Suddenly after decades at HOME in the UK we’re seen & treated like outsiders who have to prove we have the right to be here. No one seemed to have a problem with me during the last 3 decades, what changed? Maybe I was naive. #BrexitIsPersonal
Any sums Britain has to legally pay the EU if there's a no-deal #Brexit can only be decided after a  time-consuming process of arbitration, admits Chancellor Hammond. While this may take years, the EU, which is counting upon this money next year, will be in dire straits? 
it's cool, Kay. we offered this before the EU regs changed. and we'll be offering it free - deal or no deal. #Brexit
So the EU succeeded in doing away with roaming charges & now the UK is leaving that very same EU, it is a surprise that #brexit will force the return of these charges? I am shocked!

Criticisms can be made of ⁦@BorisJohnson but no other leading light of Vote Leave has protested more inside Cabinet and outside at each stage of Theresa May’s fake #Brexit ⁩
So then. #Brexit. Convince me.Let's assume that I'm not a race-hating, ultra-nationalist extremist, and let's assume that I don't need to squirrel away my cash in a tax haven. Let's therefore assume that I won't be swayed by appeals to either of the above.What's in it for me?
.@Telegraph cartoon#AgricultureBill #TheresaMay #BorisJohnson #Brexit 
Tory infighting demonstrates how stupid #Brexit is. They can't even agree amongst themselves what #Brexit means. There are supposed to be 17.4million #Leavers out there who claim they knew what it meant when they voted for it, can't one of you give them a clue 
Talking #Brexit tonight in our Group meeting with the EU Chief Negotiator @MichelBarnier. Citizens rights, ensuring there is no Irish border and protecting our single market are among our top concerns in this unprecedented negotiation.
#SkyNews are being told roaming charges will return in event of no deal #Brexit, credit cards charges/visas/more expensive holidays, all these Brexit benefits keep on coming, but it won't bother the Rees-Mogg's, they can afford it, I've no sympathy for leave voter's #PeoplesVote
London's just lost its top spot among the world's financial centres.#Brexit - the gift that just keeps on giving!

“I believe that @WelshLabour should unite and clearly support a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. We can’t afford not to” My statement below- 
London looses top spot to New York as a financial centre due to #Brexit. London is a huge generator of jobs, incomes, taxes & spending. If it is hit badly the rest of the country will suffer with it. More unemployment, less welfare #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of September 12, 2018 at 05:50PM, £1 buys 1.1207€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote

Greens have long led the call “public money for public goods” in farming. But Gove’s 'flagship policy' doesn’t stand alone. Access to market is more important for viability of farms than subsidies. And here #Brexit poses a huge threat.  #AgricultureBill

A reheat of ideas already shown to be unworkable. EU & UK negotiating teams are rightly focused on a #Brexit that delivers on the commitments of last Dec. & March and the guarantee of no hard border. Time is short, we don’t need distractions like this. 
1. The ERG have proven adept at making noise but they don't seem to be able to grasp policy. They get shot down every time they put their heads above the parapet and they have not been able to produce a credible alternative to chequers. #Brexit thread...
The EU parliament just voted to censor the internet via #UploadFilters. An exception for satire, parody and memes voted down. The #EU really is like #BigBrother in Orwell's "1984" but it outsources the surveillance of #Thoughtcrime. #Brexit #linktax #Uploadfilter
The Electoral Franchise Bill by @scotgov will protect the right of #EUcitizens in #Scotland to vote in Holyrood & local government elections. Time for the UK Government to do the right thing and extend the franchise to Westminster elections too #Brexit #ScotPfG

“The PM is unfit to govern, she is incapable of leadership” - Leader of SNP at Westminster Ian Blackford highlights anniversary of #FinancialCrisis saying “people are poorer” and could suffer if there is a no deal #Brexit  #PMQs
Something tells me the ERG is not that interested in avoiding a hard border in Northern Ireland, but very interested in blaming the EU for the hard border they know that their position will require. #Brexit 
What this means is that we are being held to ransom by 5 - 6 MPs who stand to gain from a hard #Brexit whilst the rest sit & look on in despair at having to respect a vote achieved by cheating & breaking the law. They are unhappy with #Chequers because #Brexit is undeliverable. 
Scottish Tory meltdown continues. Earlier @Murdo_Fraser  tried to blame @theSNP for the possibility of a no deal #Brexit.  Now their Head of Media responds to request from a BBC presenter for an interview with his party leader in Scotland with a hysterical claim about cybernats: 
The world economy is booming, the pound is weaker, ergo UK manufacturing should be booming as well. Instead, manufacturing growth has hit a two year low. This shows that uncertainty, caused by this anarchic #Brexit, is already affecting the economy.#ExitFromBrexit #fbpe
In a further boost for leavers #Brexit could shut down north sea oil production this was frequently cited by ecobrexiters as a major factor in their decision to vote leave and is the will of the people 
I joined ERG colleagues to launch our proposals to solve the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the EU as part of the #Brexit negotiations. It’s a considered and constructive approach to ensure a far reaching free trade agreement with the EU.
Good to see David Trimble at launch of #ERG border plan.Go on, someone have the nerve to suggest one of the architects of the Good Friday Agreement (who fought for it, costing him lots politically) is risking that agreement by backing the ERG & #Brexit .....#StandUp4Brexit
Ultimately you have to decide, what will people care more about in 10 years time?a) that a #Brexit decision was reversed, to the annoyance of a number of leaversb) that a Brexit decision was followed through on, with all its attendant problems, because we felt we had no choice?
ERG’s #Brexit document on Ireland seems to have been whipped up in a bit of a hurry, footnote 7... 
Didn't you lose the argument a few months ago? @bbclaurak asks David Davis Davis says Brexiteers' plan is 'logical' and it looks like the EU will reject PM's Chequers plan  #Brexit 
Let's take a look at the ERG, Rees-Mogg/Davis/Owen Paterson/Villiers/Caulfield, etc all affluent, some extremely affluent, do you really think they have our interest at heart? They are greedy hard right disaster capitalists who want to feed off our #Brexit carcass #PeoplesVote
At this point, the best way to #BackBritishFarming is to #StopBrexit.#PeoplesVote #Brexit(HT @Rev_BJohnson)
The govt responsible for the causes of #Brexit, is now responsible for delivering the Brexit to address the causes of Brexit.No wonder they're stalling, their bluff has been called, they know it can't be delivered.Brexit can't be done, but it can be undone by a #PeoplesVote
I am offering some resistance, but the best hope of unseating @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is with a grown-up progressive alliance uniting around the candidate most likely to win. There is however a fair chance that @Jacob_Rees_Mogg may defeat himself in angry hard #Brexit desperation. 
"There is absolutely nothing new in here" - Former NI secretary Owen Paterson says ERG plan could allow the UK to leave single market & customs union without need for hard border, and plan is based on procedures that exist around world already  #Brexit 
Senior MEP Guy Verhofstadt taunts Britain over #Brexit 'chaos' saying it has stopped other countries leaving the #EU 
 Senior Scottish Tories pushing for a bad #Brexit deal, while hardline Tories are pushing for the worst possible deal (or no deal at all).  SNP support the best possible deal - staying in the Single Market and Customs Union.
#Brexit will be calamitous for the UK, the economy, jobs and NHS. We are fighting to give the people what they deserve: a #FinalSayOnTheDeal - pity @jeremycorbyn does not feel the same. Will he listen to union members who now back a #FinalSay?#ExitFromBrexit #FBPE

You don't defeat bullshit by giving into bullshit. #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
This isn’t remotely new. But it’s true.To be blunt. Pensioners escaped the pain over the past decade and are imposing it on the young with #Brexit over the next. Doubt they will be thanked 
Wonder if the warning from the boss of Jaguar Land Rover has sunk into the PMs skull yet. Or whether she's happy to chuck the company and the staff under the #Brexit bus just to cling on to her job. Let's face it, that is all #Brexit is now about, a megalomaniac clinging to power
BREXIT |❝We would like to have a fair #Brexit because we love the British and we always cooperated well and you deserve a good deal, a fair deal.❞— says Hungary’s PM Orban 
Cacao has to be grown south of the equator. And so is imported from to the UK from Africa and South America. Last time I checked they weren't in the EU. More #brexit bull from #cadbury who shifted some production to Poland (free movement of Global capitalism)
#ERG now openly planning to throw May under the #Brexit bus. The 50 ERG MPs think they're running the country now. It bis an open coup attempt. How long will she last and what will the consequences be for the country? 
This just proves what we’ve been saying for more than two years. There IS no #Brexit plan, it WILL be an economic disaster, and will ONLY benefit the filthy rich & disloyal tax avoiders. NO ONE ELSE WILL GAIN, not even those who voted for sovereignty or against immigration 
Tory MPs are rallying support to oust the PM from Number 10. At least 50 MPs are said to be involved the plot, said to be the most threatening to her leadership. But there is a way forward for the PM - scrap her #Brexit plan and sign up for a Canada-style free trade agreement. 
Leaving Theresa May in place to run out the clock & slavishly, traitorously, agree to whatever punishment beating the EU hand her at the midnight hour, is a preposterous thing for the UK to do.  Get on with replacing her with a #Brexit Leader in accordance with the EU vote, #ERG.
Obama asked Brits to vote remain, they voted #Brexit; he asked Americans to vote for Crooked Hillary, we voted for President Trump. Now he’s asking us to vote DemocRats; guess what we’ll do.  #VoteDemsOut #VoteGop
The thing is, I'm genuinely concerned by the number of Brexit supporters who genuinely believe that the reason it is going so badly is solely the fault of @theresa_may. NONE OF THEM have a clue. There is no plan and there never was. #Brexit was doomed from the start. #StopBrexit
There's a choice to be made: we can either have medical care, free of charge by medics willing to provide it -Or we can have #Brexit.For anyone with a brain and an ounce of compassion this is a no-brainer.#PeoplesVote to #StopBrexit
#Brexit has been one of Putin's major foreign policy goals.So when fraudulent sockpuppet accounts that spread Kremlin propaganda start abusing leave voters in Cornwall who have changed their minds, we know we must be getting somewhere."Substandard13" is just one of these. 
Perhaps, Chloe, we could courteously enquire who has funded the "Taxpayers' Alliance" to lobby for a hard #Brexit? Do they include ultra-wealthy donors who prefer to keep their money offshore in order to avoid paying tax? We await a reply at your earliest convenience. 
#BREXITTory party looks to be heading for a split or a leadership electionWill #May inner circle advise its all over and she must resign (Shades of Maggie's end)Leadership election ensues - Membership has final say

Brussels “not negotiating, they want to punish” says #Italy’s Deputy Prime Minister @matteosalvinimi on #Brexit.

I have just listened to the fantastic Chloe Westley @LowTaxChloe in conversation with James Dellingpole @JamesDelingpole in another brilliant episode of his weekly podcast. It's vastly better than anything you will ever hear on Radio 4 these days  #BREXIT
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "I have one ambition, my ambition is that #Brexit should be delivered properly. What everything that I am doing is about is ensuring the country gets what it voted for." 
We’ve worked for two years to build this case to #ProsecuteBoris. This is about fighting #fakenews and dishonesty in politics. Focussing on #leave or #remain with #Brexit is a mistake. We need to deal with the misconduct that divided us first. #Boris
The U.K. doesn’t seem to get that the EU isn’t a group of 27 individual states. It’s a union and has to be dealt with as a union. ⁦@ChrisGraylingMP⁩ can’t manage the U.K. rail system, no wonder he can’t manage U.K./EU transport arrangements. #brexit 
#Brexit, even the BBC have rubbished @Jacob_Rees_Mogg's childish, ill informed alternative hard brexit plan.Crikey, if the BBC rubbish it, it must be crap.

Covering #Syria, @SkyNews couldn't even get the lies straight.1st they tell us there is a "massing of rebel forces in Idlib", then follow it immediately with "there are only a few Al Qaeda here".We're witnessing a complete breakdown of truth on UK media, #Brexit has broken them
Catching up with what’s happened in British politics at the end of any given day turned into a theatre of the absurd some time ago. Today, we seem to be in the throes of the amateur circus. #Brexit #CompleteGuide
A pleasure speaking at @ChathamHouse today about Turkey’s trade policies, economic potential and the future of #Turkey UK commercial relations post #Brexit. Thank you @RobinNiblett and the entire Chatham team.
I have detected a small flaw in the Cadbury's hard #Brexit narrative. Cadbury moved much of its production to Poland in 2012. We gave them an EU grant to do it. Please don't tell the leave voters
Another sobering dose of #Brexit reality.The prospect of leaving the EU is already causing huge damage to UK exporters.Yet more evidence of why #Labour must oppose Brexit in any form and back a #PeoplesVote.
People are tired of #Brexit & just want to get on with it, what, like suddenly on 30 Mar 19 all will be well like some soiled gusset wet dream nirvana will materialise out of Mr Mogg's arse? Bad news, this is just the fumbling foreplay before we all get fucked then fucked again.
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "Chequers doesn’t take us out of the EU it leaves us subject to the acquis communautaire, the single rulebook......and would leave us subject to the European Court of Justice on goods and agri-foods. So it is not a proper #Brexit at all.”

Lord Hain - The #Brexiteers have no plan for their cherished #brexit.. the govt admits we've no idea where we're going but we're going there anyway. Thankfully the trade unions & others are providing a lead to rescue the country from this madness by demanding a #PeoplesVote.
In #Brexit Britain, wages have collapsed upwards. Costs are spiralling out of control, as they cannot get an endless supply of workers from the EU. More proof that immigration has no impact on wages, despite far-right lies.

What a surprise, not a peep on the @BBCNews website about Jaguar Land Rover's warnings about tens of thousands of job losses and plant shutdowns in the event of #nodeal #Brexit. Guess it doesn't fit with their pro-Brexit agenda

It looks to me as though UK is now ruled by a crime cyndicate made up of MPs from the two largest parties. Each has weak and wobbly excuses for doing nothing to oppose #Brexit. The ordinary people of Britain will be left worse off, some much worse off, by this dreadful project.

#Brexit is going to turn into a huge humbling of the news industry. Endless fretting and, afterwards, much greater distrust of its general doom-mongery.
A clear warning: all main parties in Sweden’s election ended up taking a hard line on immigration. Nearly a fifth of voters chose a party with neo-Nazi roots. Similar sentiment drove our #Brexit vote. Europe must respond with an effective new internal & external migration policy

Today #TUC150 Congress voted overwhelmingly for the General Council statement on #Brexit. The message to Mrs May is clear: if her deal fails to protect jobs, rights and peace in Ireland our movement will demand a popular vote on the terms of the deal: 
How can our party cover up the embarrassment that @theresa_may creates? She is dragging the UK over a cliff. #brexit should be cancelled or the UK will lose both Scotland and Northern Ireland.
This woman wants #brexit as do millions of others. You do NOT speak for us. We voted democratically and you can stick your #stupipeoplesvote where the sun doesn't shine.
A #Brexit thought 200 days out. Scots voted four years ago & were promised a near 'federal state' by Gordon Brown. It still hasnt arrived & no plan was unveiled. Why dont we stop Brexit until we work out that near 'federal state'? Surely Scotland's vote should be enacted first? 
The European Union is ready to strike a Brexit deal within 6 to 8 weeks, chief negotiator Michel Barnier has declared, sending the pound soaring.#EU #Brexit
If you understand that #Brexit is what #SteveBannon and #Putin really want and you voted #Leave....it might be time for a rethink.#PeoplesVote, Don't get fooled again by the big lie.
Barnier says agreement on #Brexit possible by early November
Mark Serwotka: The TUC is not with Chuka Umunna. But it is not with Jacob Rees-Mogg either.I want a vote for workers’ rights, to scrap austerity and to renationalise all services.The TUC should accept the referendum result but insist on a general election. #Brexit #TUC18
Hugely disturbing to hear it likely "Game over" for #ScotchBeef #ScotchLamb under WTO tariffs & #Brexit No Deal scenario says CEO Scotland Food and Drink at @CommonsScotAff today
The tories obviously want the recommendation of the Boundary Commission to come into force, it will be rigged in their favour, but if they're disastrous #Brexit happens, they will be forced into a GE and be booted out of office and into the abyss where they belong, #ToriesOut
So why are you ignoring Gibraltar on #Brexit? They voted 96% Remain!Very least should remain in EEA!!
Met with my #Brexit counterpart in the Lib Dem’s, Tom Brake MP @thomasbrake Great to get an opportunity to hear the Lib Dem’s perspective. Just over five weeks until the next EU Council meeting. Focus on achieving a deal must be the priority for all involved. @fiannafailparty
There isn’t  any #Brexit worth pursuing! Time to ditch Corbyn or ditch Labour if you are a #Remainer #Brexit is a crime scene #ParliamentDoYourJob and #RescindA50
No doubt that when London’s economy starts to fail due to the inability in being able to travel freely and operate within it due to the elite capture utopian dream The same individuals will blame everything and anything but themselves including #brexit 
Lots of #Americans didnt know #Obamacare is same as #ACA.They prefer #ACA but voted against Obamacare.Lots of British who voted for #Brexit later on went to check out what it really means on Google,now they're  against it?Do #Nigerians really know what restructuring entails??
An overwhelming majority of Labour members & supporters back a People’s Vote on the final #Brexit dealJoin us in Liverpool on September 23 as we demonstrate our support for the delegates who will be voting in favour of a #PeoplesVote at conferenceRSVP: 
200 days to #Brexit!  
Dear Guardian Readers and everyone else. If you want to understand the soul of Ireland in advance of moving here due to #Brexit here's a much better reading list ...   @IrishTimesBooks @MarianKeyes @MartinDoyleIT @caitlinmoran @RossOCK @maevehiggins
Britain remembers when Obama overstepped the mark - threatening that the UK would be at 'back of the queue' for a trade agreement if they voted to #Brexit.That didn't pan out too well for the Remain camp. I suspect his interjections now won't play too well for Democrats either. 
For any Leavers who were wondering: this is why Remainers don't "get behind Brexit". #brexit #notmycircus #howmuchworsecanitgetoh
Severing all ties with the EU also means jeopardising our national security.The Govt is blindly pursuing #Brexit without thinking about the risks to security that play right into hands of criminals.We can only reverse this with an #ExitFromBrexit#StopBrexit
Lord Mandelson - Jeremy Corbyn needs to demonstrate his national credentials as a real British leader & standup for the interests of working people over #Brexit & taking the fight on #Brexit to the Tories... but sadly we haven't seen that yet.#peoplesvote #FBPE #PoliticsLive
1. So today it looks like #Brexit has gone on the back-burner for the Tories. They have now entered a full blown civil war where Brexit is the proxy issue but the row is more to do with who will lead them into the next election. That's all that matters to them.
Interesting that the Isle of Wight (which voted 62% for #Brexit yet has anti Brexit MP) is to get 2 MPs according to the boundaries commission.  This means that Bob Seely MP will have to apply to be candidate for a new constituency
'Now we know #Brexit will disrupt #healthcare , shouldn’t we get a Final Say on the services that keep us alive?'
Hi, @SteveBakerHW. You’re in the news demanding a Hard #Brexit. Your briefing before the #EUref considers EFTA/EEA acceptable Brexit outcomes with “advantages and disadvantages” and WTO the “worst case scenario”. Can you explain why you now claim this isn’t “proper #Brexit”? Ta. 
#Brexit: What would ‘no deal’ look like? Our brand new analysis looks at what could happen if the UK leaves the EU with no deal, and the possible impact on key policy areas. Read our quick overview  and for more detail, our briefing 
Why remain in the single market?It protects workers’ rightsIt allows state aid but cracks down on monopoliesIt avoids economic damage #TUC150 #Brexit
Just watched @MissEllieMae say #brexit isn’t the most immediate political crisis on #politicslive honestly, where do you start?
"If you can't deliver a #Brexit that protects jobs and rights... Mrs May stand down" - TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady tells #TUC150 
Stop spending £3billion on #Brexit and fund the #NHS insteadBrexit is a failed projectWe now need a #PeoplesVote to #StopBrexit#MondayMotivation
John Redwood: Exiting #EU - Facts: where we now are:Referendum 23 June 2016:17.4 million vote to #Leave EU,16.1m vote to remain in #EUTold by Govt in a letter to all households that voters would decide & Parliament would carry out the decision.#Brexit
Without the opportunity to start trading under WTO rules after #Brexit, just imagine true scale of the crisis we would have to face as result of Tory Govt’s failure.And even if the Govt do secure a deal, Brexit is still going to hurt British jobs & families. #ExitfromBrexit
"I'm serving notice on the prime minister" - TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady gives #Brexit warning to @Theresa_May at #TUC150 
“Last 25 years exports to #EU from 4 leading non-EU states have grown 4 times faster than exports from UK under single market.This fact alone shows why we have nothing to fear from trading on WTO terms.Let Brexit mean #Brexit & let us flourish under WTO”
Good discussion on final stage of #Brexit negotiations w/ PM & Foreign minister designate @MiroCerar Trust and unity on EU core principles. Determined to work hard for agreement on orderly withdrawal, incl. Ireland/NI, and political declaration on ambitious future relationship.
How can #Leavers expect anyone to believe they knew what they were voting for, when the Tory party still haven't all got behind a single vision of what #Brexit looks like. The only people who spoke as one were the #Remainers.
200 Days Till Brexit you say? Well, Bollocks To #Brexit I say!A few weeks ago I crossed paths with @jeancoulson who is charging on & spreading the golden message that Brexit is NOT a done deal! Thanks for the t-shirt Jean...this is only the beginning!
#Brexit is not an event - it's a process of entropy. Think of the UK a few months before the referendum and look at us now. The country is unrecognisable. For what? Brexiters cannot answer. They have no plan and absolutely nothing to show for the chaos they've brought about.
Theresa May does not have the numbers to get her #Brexit proposals through Parliament. If she can’t pass her proposals she can’t remain prime minister.The Tories will need to hurry up with their leadership contest, a general election may be looming.
So the Guido blogger & Sun columnist Harry Cole spent years bigging up #brexit & telling voters to trust Boris Johnson & aiding his march to Prime Minister only to now find out Boris has been having an affair with his wife Carrie Symmonds.Karma doesn’t get funnier than this.
There is no way on God's earth that 17m people voted for #Brexit and thought we'd end up with 'no deal' i.e. nothing. Even most remainers thought there'd be 'something'. The only way forward now is a #PeoplesVote with an option to remain and avoid disaster.
Pre #Brexit Boris Johnson couldn't decide who best to be to become PM.So he wrote 2 articles; 1 for, 1 against.He'd love to be Churchillian but impulsive buffoonery's put pay to that.So Britain's Trump it is.You can expect some very distasteful bedfellows to come.#NastyParty
Former minister @SteveBakerHW tells @BethRigby the Tories face "a tremendous amount of political crisis and rupture" if the PM doesn't alter her #Brexit plans 
It's 200 days until the UK is due to leave the EU. So now, more than ever, we need to ask "What future do we want for the UK?"If the answer is "a positive future", join the campaign for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. @peoplesvote_uk
Daily Briefing:- Sweden faces political deadlock after gains by far-right party- UK PM's #Brexit plans opposed by 80 party rebels - former minister- Asian stocks slump on Trump's trade threats

I never joined a political party till #Brexit. Quite proud to say it was the @LibDems, who, throughout this sad time have been steadfastly on the right side of the debate. The only party united behind "the many" right now... @uklabour hope you can join us in 2 weeks!
Amazing to see how many members of @UKParliament have not understood yet they'll soon have to vote on the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, and NOT on any trade agreement. @PickardJE  via @FT
A weakened pound is the price we are paying for #Brexit, and sterling is unlikely to rebound anytime soon. My latest article in @thetimes today
Anarchy in the UK: Police brace for riots, mull army help in case of no-deal #Brexit – leaked report 
Refusal (inability) of #Leave leaders & those who bang on for #NoDeal #HardBrexit #ERG #ChuckChequers to provide their #Brexit plan notably on how to avoid a hard border #NIreland is height of irresponsibility. Time to see off these people & back #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk
This'll be income tax for the wealthy. It was SO predictable what #Brexit was about for the Boris, Rees-Mogg and their chums. With less tax, they'll then say we've got to cut more of your services: NHS, education, police, fire... 
They don’t have an alternative #Brexit plan, except to enrich themselves further - these hard Brexiteer charlatans. #BrexitShambles #PeoplesVote

What will Britain's borders look like after #Brexit? Courier Ciaran Donovan says they will "gridlock from day one". @Stone_SkyNews has travelled to the Swiss-EU border to see what @theresa_may's Chequers plan could deliver. Read his experience here: 
Ciaran Donovan, the white van man who spoke at our march in June, took @SkyNews to the Swiss border to show the problems that the UK will face if a hard border goes up due to #Brexit.This doesn't need to happen, which is why we need a #PeoplesVote.
200 days until we leave the EU #Brexit 
The @Conservatives will suffer a massive loss of public confidence if Theresa May is not sacked before the Tory party conference. @BorisJohnson brings 3 positives: 1. Harder stance on #Brexit; 2. End to Hammond's Austerity; 3. Finally we will have a PM who is proud to be British. 
Former #Brexit minister says @theresa_may faces a "catastrophic split" in her party if she persists with her Chequers plan

Here comes the #Brexit Scottish car crash. We did not vote for this & have not any of our concerns listened to or respected by Westminster. A Brexit made by English right-wing elites for English right-wing elites. 
Of course the #EU are now chomping at the bit to get a deal agreed. With all the concessions of the #ChequersPlan it puts a post #Brexit Global Britain in just the place the EU want us to be - not very global at all. #ChuckChequers #SkyPapers #PressPreview
.@Femi_Sorry is absolutely right.#Brexit in any form will sharpen austerity and hit hardest those who have least.@UKLabour must have the courage to argue for a #PeoplesVote and campaign to #Remain in the EU. We need to commit to it at #Lab18, not for it be a last resort.
If we dont leave #Brexit backer Crispin Odey who is again patriotically shorting the pound will tragically lose a fortune 
‘just a more cheerful #Brexit’ must rank as one of the most inane comments amongst many on the topic. This is not a joke-jobs & futures are at stake-UK in danger of becoming a laughing stock

Crowdfunding is underway to potentially prosecute Boris Johnson over his repeated £350m NHS bus lies. Lots raised already. Much more to be raised. #Brexit
When will politicians realise that most of us don't give a toss about their internecine battles. What we voters want is credible government and opposition - particularly now as we face the challenges of #brexit We have neither. 
The Tory MPs who refuse to vote for the manifesto commitment to deliver #Brexit should be de-selected.Replace them with Tory candidates who will honour manifesto commitments.
Gisela Stuart - "It is not just Sweden. In Germany, there is the AfD. Look at what is happening in Italy and Hungary."This does not bode well for the European Parliament elections in May, so the pressure to come up with a deal before March is useful for us." #Brexit 
Priti Patel - "Those who want to stop #Brexit have succeeded in influencing the Government, and as a result, the Chequers proposals would shackle us to the EU forever."

Whenever the Tories have to write something down about #Brexit it leads to a split.  The #Brexiteers have now decided to have no written thoughts at all , making their #Brexit as blind as May’s version. No country can base its future on such a farcical approach to vital issues.

It seems that the Unions have finally realised that #Brexit will hurt the working classes.Funny how Labour don't appear to give a fuck.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
From an MP who dismissed #Brexit as the "blue-collar, urban, traditional Labour" working class being "stirred up by an image of immigration which made them angry and throw a bit of a tantrum".Whose comments are the more "disgusting" in the eyes of the public, I wonder...?

Tragedy of the Lexiteers:They voted to leave EU, which they thought was a capitalist club. A no deal #Brexit will deliver a laissez faire free-market (ie Thatcherism +++). A Labour Government wouldn’t be able to do much about it, either. The global markets will dictate policy
We shouldn't be fighting for or standing up for #Brexit.Leave won and #Brexit should be delivered, unequivocally.We should be fighting to remove those in government, who would deny democracy being delivered to the UK's people, from their positions of power.#MayMustGo

Reminder of one of many failures of media coverage during 2016 #Brexit referendum: "men enjoyed 85% of the press, and 75% of the television referendum coverage". And often covered as though Tory leadership contest (still ongoing). 
He is right but it also illustrates the reality of #Brexit now - the end game of a #civilwar in the Tory party which has lasted 40 years.  The rest of us are onlookers though being damaged by it every day.
You utter clown Jeremy. Utter, utter, *utter* clown.You are tweeting stuff that says women in general don't want #Brexit. That Jeremy is complete and utter twaddle.When will these remain folk figure out that their nonsense just makes them look foolish

A referendum held June 2016 gave a mandate to Leave #Brexit
A very simple idea was behind #Brexit, which was Britain should be governed by the British people. We don’t need the EU to make our laws, we don’t need our economic decisions made by Brussels & we don’t need the EU to control our borders, trade or courts. #Britain ruled by Brits!
Why have percentages of Leave vs Remain have stubbornly stuck so close to each other for eighteen months and now we’re suddenly seeing such a dramatic shift in poll after poll? Well, I have a little theory. #Brexit THREAD.1
This is the ‘Big Lie’ at the heart of #Brexit- it’s advocates can’t publish a plan because they have no plan-they just want their country to sleepwalk into chaos- its the ‘Loosing Control Plan’

Great to see my good buddies from @SODEMAction and the mighty @EUflagmafia givin out #EUflags at the #Proms tonight, with musical accompinament too! It ain't exactly rock n roll but I like it like it yes I dEU!  #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE #FinalSay #Remain
Irexit Freedom Party launched. The Irish now have their very own party campaigning for Irish freedom from the European Union. Very good luck to it. We here in the UK will watch with great interest as it gathers steam ahead of #Brexit, and beyond! Follow for news @IrexitFreedom
I am a woman and I voted leave and still would. Stop generalising! #Brexit
Thanks #PromsEUflags for your campaigning today! I am about to go on stage here in Germany with a British orchestra. Our rights to work in this way are at risk due to #Brexit so thanks for help raising awareness of our concerns. #FreeMoveCreate @WeAreTheMU @theoae @tpearce003
Utterly disgusting & complete nonsense. #lastnightoftheproms #Brexit #OutNow
Leaving the EU is going to result in less not more government money. The #Brexit berserkers are now talking about entering a ‘space race’ with the EU. If you have seen the light and changed your mind, join the campaign for a #PeoplesVote.
Sally in action at #peoplesvotecymru describing the devastating impact Brexit is already having and is going to have on small businesses. Just one of the compelling reasons why we demand a #peoplesvote on the final #brexit deal. 
Even the WTO have warned that there is no certainty that we can fall back on WTO rules immediately after #Brexit, calling the Govt’s hopes “not realistic”. They must face facts: no matter what the deal, Brexit will be a calamity for businesses and families.
Going to #LastNightOfTheProms? If you have an EU flag, take it in support of the artists and musicians who stand to be seriously affected by #brexit.If you don't have one, @EUFlagsTeam are outside right now with 20K flags to give away.Turn that hall BLEU and spangly!
We already knew any kind of #Brexit could be brutal for business; adding to this, the No Deal papers have revealed the web of red tape just waiting to strangle small and medium-sized businesses.
our new merch store is open #irexit #freedom #brexit 
The results of the #woolwich Brexitometer are clear. People think #Brexit is damaging the economy, that it’s bad for #woolwich and they want a #peoplesvote on the final deal. Take note @mtpennycook and @Cllrjfahy. @GreenwichInEU @Open_Britain @OFOCBrexit @FFSake_
How many #brexit ministers does it take to change a lightbulb? One to promise a brighter future and all the rest to screw it up!A good laugh to finish the session on from @RCorbettMEP at #BrexitNorth, reminding us the importance of continuing to use humour in our debates.
Huge applause for lady from Lincolnshire village who says she has listened to @BBC for 70 years and totally horrified by their lack of challenge & scrutiny in #Brexit debate. #BrexitNorth
Dear Mr Privileged, as an MEP I can state that EU caused terrorism with Schengen/open border policies. When I asked for a debate on returning jihadis, I was outvoted. Globalism will be stopped by nation states, EU is globalist. #Brexit was a democratic vote against you, the elite 
Absolutely packed venue at #PeoplesVoteCymru rally in Cardiff today. Wales demands a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal! 
#Brexit summed up...RT if you agree 
Brexitometer doing well in Beckenham today #FBPE #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FinalSay #LibDems
I’m here today at the #PeoplesVoteCymru rally in Cardiff Bay. People have turned up from across Wales to demand a say on the Tories final #Brexit deal. We must have a #PeoplesVote #ChangeTakesCourage
If these were Russian gov assassins, they were the most incompetent assassins in history.No attempt was made to hide their origin or movements & the target wasn't killed.Alternatively its a frame up by the UK gov as a #BrExit distraction & to stoke up anti Russia hysteria. 
Exclusive interview with ⁦@matteosalvinimi⁩ on ⁦@BBCWorld⁩ Wednesday #Migration #Brexit 
A home truth: if the Government doesn’t act on the growing demand for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit, it will be blamed for what follows. @Conservatives need to realise that, if we don’t give our people a #FinalSay, we stand to lose both our country and the trust we need to govern it
If ⁦@The_TUC⁩ backs this motion, it could be a real game changer in stopping Tory #Brexitshambles. Great to see #NHS unions leading, given damage #Brexit is already causing our #NHS #PeoplesVote
The honourable @GutoAberconwy explains why a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit is right on #r4today (from 1:38). @theresa_may must heed the irrefutable logic and growing demand to grant a new referendum if her legacy is to be positive. That’s the only way to reunite our country & Party
It is now crucial the MPs stand up for the country. The concern is that they put their careers first, thereby ensuring the #brexit was created by a career politician and secured by career politicians... all being manipulated by the Far Right machine...
In Oxford today for the British Irish Association annual meeting - big focus on #Brexit, Northern Ireland and the future UK/IRE relationship. Important meeting to reinforce relationships and the value of British Irish Co-operation for future.
I think this is my favourite ever exchange with a remoaner. #FBPE #Brexit 
Please remember when we are sending £200 million NET a week to EU it’s the poorest in society who miss that money most from their local schools &  hospitals as wealthy more insulated from these shortages. #Brexit
In two years all Brexiters have come up with is empty rhetoric because in the end it comes down to a simple truth:Any meaningful #Brexit is too painful to be accepted by the publicAny painless Brexit is meaningless & not worth implementing
Absolutely packed house at the #BrexitNorth Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference in #Leeds just now!
So much of #brexit woes lie in the false legitimacy of the bloody 2016 referendum. On such a rickety, corrupt & badly framed process no consent or policy can be foundedAll sides lost in itEnd Brexit & have a grown up political conversationRenew & restore our democracy
"Up until the last couple of years, the centre left was always considered to be a legitimate part of the Labour tradition" - @ChukaUmunna is urging @jeremycorbyn to "call of the dogs" and "fight this Tory #Brexit".For more on the story: 
#brexit This is what 17 million who voted leave. Think of same MUPPETS trying to derail Brexit everyday. Owen Jones, Chuka Umunna, David Lammy, Anna Soubry, Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair, John Major. Others   
Sorry to say this but Corbyn may care for the poor & "the many"He may knit mittens for orphans in his spare timeBut as long as he's supporting #Brexit, normalizing "Foriners are taking our jobs" & misleading the public on a "cost free jobs first" option he's a bad egg 
Once more with feelingYou don't get to accuse the LDs of propping up *anything* as long as the Labour Leadership ignores it's members & common decency & props up a Tory #BrexitCorbyn doesn't even have the moral fibre or courage to admit it's bad for the country 
If ever Britons want a reminder of the need to break free from the EU’s authoritarian, quasi-imperialist rule, then the case of the European Commission’s sinister secretary-general Martin Selmayr provides one:  #Brexit
Filling up already at the #BrexitNorth Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference in #Leeds. T-minus 30 minutes!
Well said @PeterBoneUK The people want #Brexit which ends free movement, stops us sending billions to Brussels, and gives us back control of our laws"We need to #ChuckChequers and we need to have the Brexit that British people voted for. That's why I'm standing up for Brexit"
Best wishes to Hermann Kelly and the new Irexit Freedom Party launching today to fight for Ireland's independence from the EU. #Irexit #Brexit 
Increasingly difficult for ⁦@UKLabour⁩ to back away from a #PeoplesVote, with the option to remain on the ballot, as unions, the public & MPs add diverse voices of support amidst an unstable & desperate political disaster zone. #Brexit 
More encouraging news ahead of @The_TUC conference. #Brexit in any form will sharpen austerity, cost jobs and hit hardest those who have least.To stand up for union members, we need @UKLabour to back a #PeoplesVote and campaign to #Remain in the EU  
#Brexit what’s shocking about this is the fact the interviewer didn’t pick up on the phrase “filthy Remainer”; just accepting that fascistic phrase (associated with vermin, viruses etc) as a normal part of the conversation. Hate speech is being normalised by the #bbc
Very big news! @GutoAberconwy and I disagree on plenty but both  agree that the future of our country comes first. The people of #Wales deserve a @peoplesvote_uk on any #Brexit deal - not this chaos. Look forward to him joining us in #Cardiff later!
Ok here it is. Following the bonkers poll which saw Lammy and Corbyn take the lead (Starmer & Cooper out) Labour Leadership Contest. Final poll. #Labour #Brexit #FBPE #PCPE #JC4PM just add more hashtags & RT if can 
This lady speaks for millions not just in United Kingdom but across the whole continent. Hundreds of millions from Helsinki to Lisbon feel the EU is unaccountable, over reaching itself and does not respect their nation’s sovereignty. More will want to take back control #Brexit 
Across the UK, millions of people are completely unaware about why the #EU was started, how it functions, or what are its benefits. Today, spread some knowledge about the EU. Share this 4-minute video. Because knowledge is the best defence against #Brexit. 
Here's the article referred to by @Andrew_Adonis . @thetimes reports that the #Brexit team can't agree their own strategy largely because of @BorisJohnson . They are scammers and we need @peoplesvote_uk .
Last week as a #nufc supporter I agreed with you 100%. Today as a #Brexit supporter I feel you are talking tosh. You can’t keep voting until you get your own way. That’s not how democracy works.
The UK will dump the EHCR on #Brexit day, leaving citizens with next to no Human rights from then on.Brexit apologists speculated that the UK might create a shiny new rights bill to replace hard-earned set currently enjoyed.So where's the text?  Tick tock.#BrexitHumanRights
When you fight back against #Brexit you do so on your own. Because in your heart you know this is bringing our country down. And you tweet and Facebook and do all you can. And you hope that there’s a tribe who will understand your passion. And hurt. #FBPE is my tribe x
Weirdest interview I’ve ever witnessed on #newsnight Julie Burchill behaving like a spoilt child. Two middle class rich famous jouronos saying they like #Brexit cos they like “chaos”. It’s alright for you but not for the most vulnerable in this country. Grow up the pair of you 
‘My people’ Dear god this is just shocking. Is it arrogance? I’m guessing not stupidity as she’s educated. The last thing #Brexit should ever have been is a protest vote. Brexit changes the fabric of British society in favour of the elite and rich. Burchill has sold out her own 
Excellent day -  we learned how unprepared #Plymouth & #Southwest is for #Brexit -  #PeoplesVote way to #StopBrexit. @Femi_Sorry @BenPBradshaw @LukePollard @SKinnock @DevonLibDems @nickhopkinsonEU @LibDemEurope @Devon4Europe @MollyMEP @catherinemep @CornwallLibDems #plymbrexit pic.twitter.com/mWNsTIgHWC
Democracy in Britain Tory Party serves its membership of 60k irrespective of the country’s views to deliver #Brexit.The Labour Leadership is propelled by sub group momentum ignores wider membership and serves #Brexit. Ignore the county’s needs.
Boris finds a bottle on the beach and rubs it,A Genie pops out and offers him a single wish. "I want a bridge between here and France""Impossible, choose something else!""Okay, I want a simple well organized #Brexit that benefits Britain"" Do you want 2 lanes or 4?"
Just realised that when David Davis said that the Chequers proposal was worse for the UK than staying in the EU he was being honest. There's no #Brexit solution that can possibly be as good as simply remaining in the EU on the existing terms. Davis is a #RemainerNow 
My constituency Labour party, @ShipleyLabour CLP, has just adopted motion for Labour Party Conference, calling for #Labour to oppose the emerging Tory #Brexit and supporting GE or referendum on any Brexit deal.

We have made arrangements to stream the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference live from 11am tomorrow. Go to the Event page on Facebook to catch all the action: 
And yes, we are in that area now. 3 million people have just been threatened by a man who could very possibly be the next Prime Minister, because they're not British. Things are *that bad*No decent person can continue to support #Brexit regardless of how they feel about the EU.
Can I have the attention of people who voted for #Brexit, liberal Leavers, Lexiteers, and people with concerns about national sovereignty.Please, stop supporting this now. This entire thing has gone too far. Please read this thread, I'm begging you.
On a crowded train to #Sheffield, Someone recognised me, said hi, & I gave her some #BollockstoBrexit stickers... then a couple asked me to explain about #EUsupergirl now we're all having a chat about #Brexit and what a mess the country is in & laughing at #Boris getting dumped
Hey Scotland - happy for the WM Tory Party to sit round a table and decide what #humanrights you and your family can have post #Brexit? No?Me neither. Let’s get the hell out of this union and decide our own.#DissolveTheUnion #ScotRef #SNP
Belated but important recognition by BBC that “balance” does not require including points of view detached from factual reality.  Might be worth bearing in mind when discussing #Brexit

A few years ago for a minister to admit this would have even a resigning issue. Like a NI secretary who knows nothing about NI, it’s hard to say whether this is incompetence or just disinterest in the risk of Brexit to the U.K. and the well-being of its citizens. #brexit 
Join us in #Liverpool on September 23 for the MARCH FOR THE MANY At the Labour Party Conference, delegates should have the opportunity to vote for motions recognising that we need a #PeoplesVote to sort out the mess the Government have made of #Brexit. 
I am just going to come out and say it. The promise from the SNP on #Scotref was simple. It would be called when the details of #brexit are known. We know the details - Hard brexit or no deal! They now need to get their finger out and call #Indyref2 (1/2)
Not bollocks, just more filthy, #LeaveLies deliberately misleading voters and perverting our democracy. Democracy requires an informed electorate. Misleading the electorate to this degeee destroys democracy. #JailTheLeaveLiars.#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Julia Hartley-Brewer - "It’s not a Brexit-supportive Government. Philip Hammond, if it was up to him, he would not have #Brexit. “It’s a Remoaner, not even Remainer, it’s a Remoaner Government." 
When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of September 7, 2018 at 05:50PM, £1 buys 1.1109€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
#Brexit Sec knew nothing about the #EUForeign Sec knew nothing about diplomacyDefence Sec knows nothing about defenceHome Sec knew nothing about Immigration controlNorthern Ireland Sec knows nothing about NI is par for the course for #Tories
UK Unity took to the streets of London this week to make sure the 17.4 million Britons who voted for #Brexit get a complete departure from the EU. 
No Deal Brexit is 8% damage to GDP A Deal (FTA) is 6% damage to GDP Either are awful 2008 crash was 2% damage #context #Brexit
Latest EU GDP stats out today show that over last 3 quarters for which data available, UK is lagging behind the pack - hardly surprising that more and more people are demanding a #peoplesvote on the #Brexit deal @peoplesvote_uk
Our intrepid #Brexitometer team were in #Helston today, just a step from Wetherspoons.Even so, very few peope thought #Brexit was going well and the big majority wanted a #PeoplesVote (including some who voted Leave & now regret it).The tide has turned in #Cornwall!
The people spoke 2 years ago, but that wasn't the end of #democracy... Stop pinning 100% of the blame on @theresa_may, she's not a scapegoat, #Brexit was doomed to be a disaster from the start... Let the people speak again when we know the reality of #Brexit not fantasy bullshit 
The Chancellor warned Govt could be borrowing around £80bn a year more by 2033-34. This emphasises the scale of the crisis we face if this #Brexit nightmare goes ahead. The Govt must wake up, see the looming catastrophe, and give the people a chance to #ExitFromBrexit
#Brexit. Read this thread. 
Our Founder @GeorgeFreemanMP on why the #Brexit #CivilWar is dividing & damaging Britain. And needs to be ended - by recasting this as a moment of profound #Renewal.  In @timesredbox:
UK’s Brexit proposals 'not workable, basically' says EU's Michel Barnier. He re-iterated to MPs that the EU would not accept splitting up aspects of the single market, and that it would not delegate EU customs duties to British officials after #Brexit 
Project fear has been proven completely wrong. There was no recession, no 800,000 jobs lost, no emergency budget and no plagues.  Yet still remoaners can't admit they were wrong. They do not respect democracy and think we are all stupid for wanting our country back. #Brexit 
Tory MP Neil Parrish tells #PlymBrexit summit that although he doesn’t support one there could be a #peoplesvote if Parliament rejects #brexit deal or no deal.
Sir Vince Cable: "I'm not putting a timeline [on it]" Lib Dem leader says he will lead party through #Brexit and local elections before standing down 
'What do we want? Theresa May OUT, OUT, OUT!Voters take to streets of London in FURY at May's Chequers plan shouting while holding placards:“We want Brexit”“Treason May Out Now!”“What do we want? Theresa May Out. Out traitor!”#MayMustGo#Brexit #EU

Is it time #EU #citizenship had an upgrade? Could #Brexit be the spark behind a whole new way of imagining what it means to be "#European"? Decide for yourself. (the initative is open to all, not just #Brits!)
Wonder how many billions of tax payers money has already been squandered on a pointless #Brexit that will damage the economy, jobs and people lives?
If @michaelgove wants world leading fisheries after #Brexit, he needs to minimise and eliminate #bycatch of protected species in UK waters by enshrining measures to do so in law say @dolmansarahj and @Natures_Voice in a new blog. Photo ©: Colin Wood

This is Femi. Talk to him about #Brexit. This is the view you will see the most, as he runs away on yet another mission to #StopBrexit. What a hero. He stands for our shared EU values.
Between 2014 and 2020, #Cornwall will receive over €1,000 (£800) per person from the EU Structural and Investment Fund.No-one we talk to here has *any* confidence that this investment will be replaced by Westminster post-#Brexit.#PeoplesVote
Rees-Mogg getting more and more desperate. The words of a politician that can speak eloquently but totally lacking in compassion and understanding of the very real fears created by these destructive words. Little Britain #Brexit at its vile worst. 
Just got back from our successful interviews for CdS at the Prefecture.  We now have residency rights come what may. Interviewer told us that her children would no longer be going on school trips to the UK as the education dept had decided post #Brexit it would be too difficult.
Good to meet with @AJPhillipson this morning to discuss U.S.-UK relations post-#Brexit, trade and of course, our shared appreciation for the Big Apple! #specialrelationship
technically @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is correct: this has always been the logic of #brexit and why i said 2 years ago repeatedly, and was mocked for it, that #brexit = ethnic cleansing
We have published the transcript of the evidence the Committee took from Michel Barnier in Brussels on Monday, read it here  #Brexit
#Blair is on the TV talking about #Brexit, while "journalists" nod along like he isn't one of the greatest war criminals & profiteers in history.Later today they'll talk about "#Nato values" & "human rights" & "rules based int'l order" without a shred of irony.
Dominic Raab holds crisis talks with Michel Barnier in #Brussels after #EU negotiator brands PM's #Chequers plan 'dead in the water'  #Brexit 
Boris is leaving his wife.I assume he will expect continued access to her bedroom.Just because he's leaving the club called marriage doesn't mean he shouldn't have access to all the benefits of marriage.#BrexitLogic#indyref2 #brexit #dissolvetheunion
ANTI-#Brexit activist and student Femi Oluwole refused to answer questions about other pro-European Union groups helping fund the campaign for a second #Brexit referendum.He obviously has something to hide
We must not accept #Brexit at any cost. If it's not best for #Plymouth or for Britain we can change our minds. #PlymBrexit 
It's quite incredible that @PatKennyNT spins the narrative that "it suits both the SF  & the DUP not to have an agreement with #Brexit happening".Pat, there was an agreement which the DUP withdrew from. How does that tally with your narrative?Why not call out the DUP for that?
Quite right - and we need the initial findings of the investigation while we still have time to change our minds about #BrexitPlease @nca tell citizens what you are doing to protect our democracy against foreign manipulation 
THERESA May is to launch a campaign across the UK in a desperate bid to rescue her soft #ChequersPlan Our PM still does not realise that the game is up and people fully realise that her unsalvageable blueprint is not #Brexit#StandUp4Brexit
Minister who was in charge of delivering #brexit the last 2 years is now demonstrating & protesting against the people who....didn’t deliver brexit over the last 2 years.Perfect encapsulation of brexit: very good at protesting but unable & unwilling to deliver what they’re for. 
In case you somehow thought British government incompetence and ignorance about their brief was confined to #Brexit ministers, foreign secretaries, etc. 
This country is currently being *run* by Rees Mogg/Johnson/Farage & the ERG group. They are calling all the shots, getting the air time & dictating governmet policy.I lost family under a hard right Fascist regime.I am NOT going to let it happen again!#fightfascism #brexit 
I never thought I’d see this. A bit of common sense from the @guardian. I don’t agree with him on #Brexit and #Trump, but he sees the bigger picture.

Oh, is that “the people”! I wondered who they were.  We, who voted were obviously the non-people. I support #Brexit more every day. Thanks Katie. 
Starting today w @BBCNorthampton at 7.40 to explain why @WEP_UK Conference is in Kettering, where #VoteLeave launched & Tory council wouldn't invest in care - and now expects women to work unpaid and in poverty to compensate. A foretaste of a no-deal #Brexit. #JoinWE #WE2018
Reminder: #Brexit is a xenophobic UKIP project by tax dodging elites to destroy workers/environmental protections, to escape EU tax avoidance rules, also to sell off the NHS to US corporations and UKLabour should be ashamed of being part of . It makes us…

I can’t quite remember ⁦@BorisJohnson⁩ how much was it that we will get as a brexit diffident? What’s happened to that extra money the U.K. would have as a result of Brexit. And brexit voters still claim they knew what they were voting for?! #brexit 
An inquiry takes time which is limited. Labour must take the initiative & back a #PeoplesVote for a #FinalSay with a #Remain option NOW. Pls don't wait for a No Deal, there's enough evidence already to invalidate the Ref. No more stalling #Brexit removes Rights & makes us Poorer

Oh so the FM goes to a dinner, hoping to pontificate over a potential ‘brain drain’ #Brexit and the Director General of the CBI tells her that businesses are objecting to her call for Immigration to be devolved. You know @NicolaSturgeon you’re not doing well by our country.

Operation Yellowhammer It's coming unless we stop this madness now with a #PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE
Our trade with the #EU is bigger than our trade with the rest of the world combined. Just one of the reasons why #Brexit is so damaging & why we all need a vote on any final deal, including the option to stay @BestForBritain @peoplesvote_uk @Wales4Europe
Wow.A govt dept account responsible for emergency planning didn’t know what operation “Yellowhammer” was so tried to look it up on twitter and ended up tweeting it.“Yellowhammer” is in fact the code word for emergency #brexit planning....Man this government is screwed up. 
See how easy it is to cancel something? #brexit

EU proposals that Northern Ireland remain in parts of the EU are unacceptable. I am glad the Government have re-stated that the constitutional and economic integrity of the UK must be respected. #Brexit 
Tony Blair - Losing our say over EU rules is a bizarre way of taking back control. If Theresa May can't get a majority for her #brexit position in the HoC then the obvious thing for her to do is to go back to the people & have a #PeoplesVote.#FBPE @campbellclaret @Andrew_Adonis
So proud of the Welsh people for understand the impact that #Brexit will have on our amazing nation. You are allowed to change your mind. It is democratic. Wales no longer backing Brexit- YouGov 
This is a map showing every country in the world that trades solely under WTO rules. #Brexit
Fascinating listening to @BBCMarkMardell 's latest #Brexit podcast. Cameron told EU leaders he'd win because 'we won in Scotland'. He didn't win Scotland, he didn't lose. Big difference
Govt are now planning for No-Deal #Brexit in the way they did with "Foot & Mouth, Floods, Terrorism" etc.. Just let that sink in a moment. 
Coming up this autumn: #EUCO, #UNGA, #ASEM12, #G20, internal and external security, migration, rules-based multilateral cooperation, economy, trade, and of course #Brexit.Bring it on!

We’re repeatedly told that #Brexit is the Number One issue affecting the country.Why, then, is there endless coverage of antisemitism, which is a very small problem & is being dealt with? Anyone who says @UKLabour is a racist party does not know Labour & has an agenda.
Looks like #TheresaMay will seek a “blind Brexit” - leaving without the key issues being solved, as she can’t face down either wing of her party...Key problems to be sorted only after #brexit  -  the height of irresponsibility!.

RUMOUR IS @theresa_may offered a plum EU job to betray Britain keep us in EU.  Tories who backed Chequers deal, #Gove, #Raab, #Leadsom,  Fox, Javid, taken for mugs, and have terrible judgement.  THEY BETRAYED #Brexit for their jobs.    @borisjohnson
Here lies the #Brexit solution 
Brexit is 204 days away. #brexit
 This morning I asked the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell MP, if we should be stock-piling medicines in the event of a 'no deal' #Brexit. 
The super-rich are getting richer, while more & more people struggle with crippling debts.This stark inequality caused by disastrous govt policies is the real driver of the #Brexit vote. We must urgently tackle it with living wage, wealth taxes and more.
Meeting the port authorities, customs,Honda and CroPorts at the ⁦@northseaport⁩ #Ghent as they prepare for #Brexit. It’s not good news as it will hit all our economies. Time for ⁦@peoplesvote_uk⁩
I don’t disagree with @InklessPW often, but I really do this time.  The consequences of #Brexit are too hurtful and harmful to deny the British people the right to a second chance to express themselves. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg tells us about his plan for Brexit and why we don't have to pay £39 billion in a letter to Lord Adonis on how we can save £100 billion. Extract below. Great stuff!Full letter here... #StandUp4Brexit #Brexit 
I find it shocking that the govt and @BBCNews are reporting stockpiling of medicines as if it is normal in a developed country like the UK with no actual need to do this other than #Brexit We need #FinalSay #PeoplesVote to put this right @BestForBritain @MattHancock
New poll reveals the @ScotTories are the party of choice in Scotland with the out of touch #snp government losing support everyday #brexit #indyref2 #BetterTogether #Hogwarts
UK’s biggest insulin supplier is building up a 4 month stockpile of insulin in case of a no-deal #Brexit.No one voted for stockpiling medicines. No one voted to stockpiling anything. #PeoplesVote please.
It is clear that the UK’s healthcare would be at risk with Govt’s disastrous plans. Tory Ministers are talking down the impact of #Brexit on healthcare, whilst pharmaceutical companies are being asked to stockpile drugs. We can only turn this around with an #ExitFromBrexit
If the reason you voted Leave was because you had nothing else to lose. Then you are mistaken. Things are gonna get a whole lot worse. #FBPE #PeoplesVote #Brexit
Our #NHS problems could be solved if we tackled #TaxAvoidance properly. Thankfully new EU laws kick in, in March 2019.Oh, wait that date seems familiar. Oh, yes. #Brexit. Funny, that. Must be coincidence, surely. 
Wales wants a People’s Vote on the #Brexit Deal! New poll out today shows the tide has turned  in favour of a final say - and that a narrow majority would now vote to stay in the EU. 
This government’s level of inanity, insanity, irresponsibility and inability to grasp detail is unforgivable. We need some adults in the room too. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Massive news ahead of @peoplesvote_uk rally in Cardiff in 2 days. Polling out today shows  hat in a #PeoplesVote at the end of the process, Wales would vote to stay in the EU - the will of the people to have their say at the end of the #Brexit process is growing 
Nissan to sue Vote Leave over EU referendum flyer.Good - it's time these people were held accountable for their lies & disinformation.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
How could ANYONE have known what #Brexit meant 2 years ago when even now, 2 years later, the government cannot agree on what Brexit means. I voted #Remain, I didn't know what Brexit meant, & neither did 'the people'. Now we know it isn't going to be good, time for a #PeoplesVote.
Leading MEP Verhofstadt advocates expelling Poland and Hungary from the EU.  Interesting..... Distinctive #Brexit research & news: 
#Tradeunions move towards demanding a #PeoplesVote on the actual #Brexit deal : 
A day in the life of mad #Brexit : the Gov announce a visa scheme for 2500 non EU farm workers to replace departing EU workers and the Health Minister confirms Gov will pay pharma companies to stockpile medicines to prepare for No Deal. Ah, the benefits of Brexit! #FBPE #Libdems
Representives of the Brits living in Europe, many of whom feel very uncertain about their future, STILL have not met the minister in charge of #Brexit. They’ve met @MichelBarnier numerous times but have never met either @DavidDavisMP or @DominicRaab despite consistent lobbying 
The Petition to rescind Article 50 if #Leave broke election laws (they did) is to be debated in Parliament on 10th September. The government initially dismissed the petition but then it reached over 190,000. So now it must be debated by MPs. Well done everybody.#Brexit #Remain
Boris Johnson is facing a court room showdown over the £350 million a week lie he repeatedly told during the #Brexit referendum campaign.This is just so delicious. 
EU diplomats shrug at what they view as U.K. hysteria over Canada+ or Chequers #Brexit debate. The EU says the choice was never the UK’s alone 1
Scotland has already lost 14% of EU Drs since #Brexit vote. Now a SLab MSP thinks it’s a good idea to tell EU citizens, who may have worked here for decades, they should have their democratic rights taken away? Well done - I’m sure that makes them feel their future is safe here!

Listening to the audio recording of @Feorlean at this evening's (actually last night's now!) #Brexit talk, and I'm just so impressed at the calibre of the man's intellect and communication abilities. He's the David Attenborough of politics, in my opinion.
There's v. little direct action UK can do on our own to counter Russian aggression but here's 2 damn good responses that would really stick in Putin's craw & avoid retaliation1. Increase UK's military capacity.2. Stop #Brexit & #Remain in the EU.
Interesting.  Labour moving closer to #SingleMarket /#CustomsUnion model proposed by @ScotGov in Dec 16.  A welcome development in support of the least damaging form of #Brexit ( though no #Brexit still preferable and is what Scotland voted for) 
Tom "believed Britain would be “better off” outside of the EU" and did so in a  "convenient vent of political anger against a political elite I felt deeply disillusioned with"He now thinks #brexit is not worth it and his blog is now on our new website. 
Brexiteers don't do plans.. They only deal in wishful thinking, fantastical delusions and bigoted ignorance. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
One of these politicians is on the right side of history**It's @darrenpjonesThe other is an ex member of Matthew Elliott's #VoteLeave Campaign Committee. Promoted to #Brexit Minister he appointed the Director of Comms at Elliott's IEA, Stephanie Lis, as his 'special adviser.'

1. Chequers deal was never 'alive' because the proposals simply didn't make sense.2. Barnier ruled it out on Monday to me, and to a German paper.But don't worry. Raab says the Latvian Foreign Minister muttered something positive!Time to back an #EEA-based #Brexit

Or to put It another way, Matthew Elliott blames the failure of #Brexit on Theresa May and David Davis.Brexiters are beginning to fight like rats in a sack.All the more reason for a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay leading to an #ExitFromBrexit
It has to be said again and again. Without the resources of the machine behind the rise of the Far Right globally, the international funding, the tech, troll operators, CA, Bannon, Mercer, Breitbart et al #Brexit would not have happened. It is a false result. #FBPE

A #Brexit vote, whether in 2016 or #PeoplesVote, that does not include EU27 nationals, Brits abroad for 15+ years, and 16-17 year olds, but includes Commonwealth nationals cannot be regarded as anything other than absolutely unfair & unjust.#StopBrexit

On Monday at the @CommonsEUexit in Brussels @michelbarnier actually said in no uncertain terms that Chequers has positive elements, w/ reference to security & foreign policy and to an FTA as a common denominator for the economic partnership after #Brexit. 
Today I'm proud to stand & fight anyone who thinks they have the right to oppose a democratic vote. For my children & their children futures. Be warned 'racist Lammy' - lionesses are relentless & ferocious when protecting their cubs. #Brexit 
Would all the people who have told me, over the last year and more, that Corbyn was "playing the long game", finally admit that today's #PMQs showed beyond any possible doubt that he is a #Brexit fanatic?Don't bother to apologise. He is losing the next election right now.
Darren Jones(European scrutiny Committee) - #Brexit is based entirely on an illegal campaign & that just seems completely nonsensical to me... if this had been any other election/referendum the decision could have been voided in the High Court. #peoplesvote #FBPE

We need a @peoplesvote_uk on the final deal with the option to remain. Labour must take a lead. It’s what our voters, members and supporters want as we see the real disaster that is #Brexit for what it is - making our communities poorer and damaging us for many generations. 
Theresa May had no response when @ChrisRuane2017 challenged her to guarantee that #Wales will not be worse off because of the Tories botched #Brexit negotiations. Only @WelshLabour is #StandingUpForWales.
Now we need a proper investigation into the role of Russian money in the #Brexit referendum. Brexit is a far bigger prize for Russian foreign policy than the  #Salisbury attack was.

#Brexit and Ireland: A Personal View 
Former David Davis aide says no-deal #Brexit warnings are unfounded, claiming “very low friction” at Bulgaria-Turkey border. Tell that to truckers.
This weekend you will no doubt hear and see that Ireland has 'lost' €200 billion in fish to the EU since the 1970s.Here, I briefly explain why this figure is false and should be viewed as just a very expensive red herring.#Brexit #Irexit #Fisheries
Tánaiste @simoncoveney speaking to media in Vilnius and thanking Lithuanian  FM @LinkeviciusL for solidarity on #Brexit - strong support across the entire Nordic-Baltic region greatly appreciated in Ireland

When the Lab party should be fighting #Brexit they are too busy fighting each other. Unions can see disastrous impact of Brexit on jobs, hence GMB now agreeing to support #PeoplesVote. Corbyn is out of touch on so many things - being positioned as future PM is laughable #FBPE

Looking forward to meeting @DominicRaab again tomorrow, continuing our work on the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement & on finding common ground between #EUCO March guidelines and Chequers w/ a view to creating a new, ambitious partnership, as I said on Monday to @CommonsEUexit
This is the first time I've seen a brand taking a very obvious public stance on #Brexit - are there any other brands doing the same thing, as in, actually advertising their position? I can't say I'm not skeptical. I did wonder if it was just a PR stunt, but it seems not...

There is sufficient evidence to charge 2 Russian nationals with using a deadly nerve agent on the streets of Britain. If they enter the EU, we can apply to arrest them under an EAW. If the UK leaves the EU, we will lose this right.#Brexit threatens our national security.

"No deal is a bad deal - the Chequers plan is dead" -  A feisty exchange between @jeremycorbyn and @theresa_may over #Brexit negotiations ends with the PM telling the Labour leader "he should be ashamed of himself".Follow live updates of #PMQs here: 
Pathetic from @jeremycorbyn. Given the opportunity at #PMQs to back a #FinalSay on #Brexit he has yet again refused. No matter the Brexit, leaving the EU will be a disaster for the UK. Corbyn is betraying his own supporters. Only the @LibDems are fighting for an #ExitFromBrexit
At #PMQs PM Theresa May tries to maintain the pretence that the Chequers plan is still breathing. It isn't. It is as stiff as a board. With the only alternative she is offering, No Deal, a catastrophe, we must have a #FinalSay and a chance to exit from #Brexit
In these very troubled chaotic #Brexit times - and when so many of our people are suffering from Tory policies - I attempt to respond to matters in a mature & considered manner.The PMs conduct on #PMQs day was SHAMEFUL.It does NO credit to the office of PM or to HER personally
.@theresa_may is all over the place answering @IanBlackfordMP's questions. This Tory UK Government has no clue on how to deal with #Brexit. Scotland deserves better. #WeCan
Not clear why PM thinks saying #Brexit “won’t be end of world” helps her case, + desperately listing a few hundred new jobs while tens of thousands now at risk of being lost. Chequers is a shambles. No deal is a catastrophe. Government is in chaos. Time for @peoplesvote_uk #pmqs

Dear UK #Brexit New Poll:       Remain in the EU = 59%Leave the EU = 41%A massive shift in public opinion. There is one holdout though, he wants you to leave the EU. 
Busy day on the #Brexit trail - Helsinki early this morning, Tallinn for a political lunch and Vilnius for late afternoon/evening meetings. EU solidarity remains very strong. Back to Dublin tonight to drive to Galway for @FineGael think-in tomorrow! 
We must know what exactly the country could be facing, prior to the final vote on departure from the EU. The Govt’s refusal to guarantee MPs will be able to see the full impact analysis of a No Deal #Brexit must be reversed; we cannot, and will not, be kept in the dark.
What a quote #brexit 
“Right now, the best way to support the charities that support the most vulnerable in our society is by actively campaigning for a #PeoplesVote”FFS-supporter @KieranCutting writes about the impact of #Brexit on the UK’s third sector 
Fascinating. Not only do recent polls indicate that a growing majority of Brits would vote against #Brexit in a 2nd referendum -They also indicate that a (slimmer) majority now claims to have voted against Brexit in the first place. A public version of "It wasn't me"? 
Dear @theresa_may there was a vote two years ago that split the country roughly down the middle. At the time nobody knew what the ramifications of #Brexit would be. The public are now far better informed and polling suggests they're now strongly #Remain.Why no #PeoplesVote ?
Nearly 60% would now vote against #Brexit, according to new study by one of UK's most respected political anaylsts.So why are we proceeding with something that the public doesn't want and that will cause such massive damage?#PeoplesVote

Update on this: the opportunity to amend #Brexit Cross Border Trade Bill in Lords yesterday was squandered. @UKLabour could have pushed for ‘Customs Union’ and probably won. But frontbench didn’t even try. They let it pass. Utterly disappointing.
More bad news for #Brexit Britain. Atlantic storms, sent across from the USA by the far-right Trump, will batter britain. The Uk will be plunged in to chaos. The EU, however, will be protected by the single market, customs union and our shared EU values.
Polling reveals between 24% and 38% would support a new far-right  party. We must not pander to such people and their bigotry. Unity against the far-right must override all of our party-political divisions. #brexit #FBPE #StopBrexit
#Brexit approach 'incompetent' - Lord King
'You can draw a stright line from Lehman to Trump, from RBS to austerity and #Brexit  And what have we learned? Almost nothing'-Powerful by @chakrabortty
I think that Lord King’s assessment of the damage being done by the Tory @GovUK’s  gross incompetence in negotiations has more truth to it than Jackson Carlow’s apologia for that same Government and petulant criticism of those who (like he once did) regard #Brexit as a disaster. 
Given how reliant the UK is on the service economy , the way we have ‘serviced’ #Brexit has been a terrible advertisement to the world. ‘We are incompetent, confused and poisoned with continuous political infighting. Please invest in us.’
I wish broadcasters treated the minutiae of Irish border and #Brexit in the depth that internal Labour politics is covered #r4today

Any sensible person could work out it’s best to revoke A50 and call public inquiry rather battling through #brexit. Especially as @A50challenge proved the decision is PMs and @UKEUchallenge will prove whole thing is illegitimate. Sadly Brexit dogma blocks  pragmatism.

See, the passport thing. I loved my green passport. Then we got EU ones. And I love them too. Then I bought this in Dealz. So, to all my #Brexit friends, why give up all your benefits for the sake of a #Poundshop quid? Are you bonkers?
If only Owen @OwenSmith_MP, but I believe Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn wants #Brexit more than he wants to lead his party into government. Now, if ever there was a time, is the time for him to prove me wrong. He could start by supporting a democratic #PeoplesVote.

Has the UK Government ever before removed rights from adult UK citizens who've committed no crime without giving them a say, other than the denial of votes to UK nationals resident in the EU? They are directly affected by #Brexit, despite assurances, so MUST get a #PeoplesVote

Tánaiste @simoncoveney meeting with Finnish  FM Timo Soini in Helsinki tonight. Excellent conversation on #Brexit and a range of foreign policy issues. 
When a party whose leader's being squarely condemned over racism gains a 4-pt lead over the party of govt, you can see how bad the Tories are doing. Thanks to #Chequers. When will the Tory leadership stop being tone-deaf and listen to the British people?#ChuckChequers#Brexit 
It isn’t the Govt, isn’t Bank of England, isn’t an economist, isn’t a politician.It’s a Swiss investment bank & financial services co. advising its clients, but I’m sure #brexit #leave fanatics’ll be along to tell us it’s all project fear & they know more about banking than UBS.
Lord Hain - Regardless of the consequences.. the people have spoken.. we're going.. we know not where but we're going anywhere.. #Brexit is rapidly becoming an act of collective national madness.#peoplesvote #FBPE
The likelihood of #Brexit has already cost #Britain more than 2% of its economy (= about what the Govt spends on transport), according to analysis by (non-UK) UBS  via @markets
It’s tragic that whilst we are entering an exciting new era of cancer management and treatment, the #NHS is being brought to its knees by an austerity-obsessed right wing Government. And NHS problems will only be exacerbated by #Brexit
A @BestForBritain poll shows a majority of Scots favour #independence if the UK leaves the #EU. Today I asked @DominicRaab if that was a price he was willing to pay. He looked even more uncomfortable than usual & sat down before finishing his answer #Brexit 
There's a good case for Mark Carney to stay on at the Bank, to continue overseeing monetary policy & the supervision of the financial sector through #Brexit. But, I trust, with a positive attitude to #Brexit!   
.@CommonsHealth hears a trade deal with U.S. if #Brexit happens would include UK having to accept U.S meat from animals routinely treated unnecessarily with antibiotics, threatening our battle against deadly anti-microbial resistance.
Just asked the Sec of State at DEXEU how much money has been allocated to stockpiling medicines in the event of a hard #Brexit  The answer was "waiting on applications from suppliers." I think that means nothing which would be very troubling if true.
Our #Brexit spokesperson in Westminster, @HywelPlaidCymru calls for a people’s vote on the final terms of the Brexit agreement.

Great shout out from #StandUp4Brexit activist @JoePorterUK on @bbc5live with @Chloetilley this morningListen to the full debate on #Brexit here: It’s time to #ChuckChequers and #StandUp4Brexit
Conservative Ministers are talking down the impact of #Brexit on healthcare, all whilst pharmaceutical companies are being asked to stockpile medication. This only underlines just how shambolic the Govt’s Brexit plans are – we must do all we can to secure an #ExitFromBrexit
This is the Brexiter spirit - to petulantly blame anyone apart from themselves for their own failings. Devoid of any sense of responsibility, they are charlatans oscillating between loud-mouthed bragging & whining victimhood, utterly unfit to take control. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of September 4, 2018 at 05:50PM, £1 buys 1.1095€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
I care not for the Torys but a clean #Brexit & my big fear is Theresa May will happily sign away British / Christian values without a thought, her lack of vision for an independent Britain & her PC leadership is truly frightening that lies not just with her but within the party.
 GDP down 2.1%  Investment down 4%  Inflation up 1.5%  Consumption down 1.7%  Real Effective Exchange Rate 12% more depreciated And all this before #Brexit has even happened:
#Brexit will do untold harm to my constituents and the prosperity of the whole country. There should be a #finalsay on the final deal through a #peoplesvote @BestForBritain
Richard Branson - The British Public were misled during the referendum.. If #brexit happens it will be a disaster for Great Britain.. it's very unwise for business leaders & other leaders not to speak out as they can see people just shooting themselves in the foot.#peoplesvote
Please keep the ball rolling on theis one. RT as widely as possible: whatever happens with #Brexit and the EU, a future for Europe must be based on the rights and shared values of its citizens, not just corporations and central banks. 
Just finished a very constructive meeting with @michelbarnier in Brussels. He has an excellent grasp of the situation in Ireland.He also appreciates the practical unanimity of the Irish political community on the core principles that need to be protected in #Brexit negotiations.
'We can be a free trading nation!'JD Wetherspoon founder Tim Martin calls for Brexit NO DEAL #Brexit #trade #PoliticsLive
EU citizens! The far-right is on the rise all across #Brexit Britain. The toxic atmosphere of xenophobia has even permeated in to the suprmarket. Today the vegetable aisle, tomorrow the gas chamber. This is why we are stronger together. #FBPE #IAmEuropean
If #Brexit falls to party-political pieces & we don't get another chance to vote on it could we at least put some experts in charge who know what they're talking about & will work together constructively and collaboratively to come up with the best possible deal? Just a thought.
IT'S HERE! The  Brexit Battle Pack has been launched TODAY! Don't get angry, do something! All the tools for you to take action to secure #Brexit are here:
Autumn will see @LibDems lead the charge against  disastrous #Brexit. More voices calling for #PeoplesVote daily. Tories selfish & myopic, Corbyn mired in racism. Meanwhile families suffer as £ falls #FBPE
Serious discussion of international colleagues boycotting events in the UK in protest at visa restrictions. This is the real impact of #Brexit. Very frightening. #barriers #museums #CIPEG2018
My statement on @GMB_union's announcement that they are calling for the public to have their say on the terms of the final #Brexit deal: 
“I am from Suffolk. I am a #Brexit...” - nah, this new account doesn’t look dodgy at all mate. 
Very proud that @GMB_union standing up against a reckless Tory #Brexit deal and putting our members interests first. Well done @Tim_Roache @Remain_Labour @LabPeoplesVote 
2 years in, I can't find 1 Brexiteer who can tell me (honestly) why they want it, or can name 1 single undeniable benefit. 2 years in, I can't find a single French, Spanish or Portuguese friend here in SW France who understands why Britain is doing it. #Brexit - The age of stupid
A proposal to resolve the #Brexit deadlock... let me think... I know: Let people decide if Remaining in the EU is a better deal than the alternatives with a #PeoplesVote
This is hugely significant news from @Tim_Roache I met with my own @GMB_union branch last night to hear how a reckless Tory #Brexit risks members jobs in manufacturing and so many other sectors. Time for @UKLabour to follow suit and back @peoplesvote_uk
#BreakingNews - The GMB union is calling for a public vote #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal because promises made during the referendum are not "reality we are facing"#FBPE
Sounds about right.Belief in #Brexit is an act of faith.But faith is often blind and often stupid.And in this case it absolutely is. 
Imagine being a self serving remainer who is concerned about next years holiday in Greece, while Greeks are dying from the continued austerity, imposed on them by the #EU.#Brexit 
Dear @theresa_may How can you say you’re ruling nothing out on #Brexit & then rule out a vote on the outcome? If a majority of people want a vote, we should have it. If most people don’t want one, we shouldn’t. We need sufficiently large & diverse opinion polls to determine this 
2 urgent questions in the Commons today:1) #Windrush - @HackneyAbbott2) HMP Birmingham - @RichardBurgonAnd a statement from @DominicRaab on #Brexit negotiations and no deal contingency planning
When it comes to our data economy, #Brexit means losing control: following EU rules which, until now, we’ve helped write. That’s relinquishing sovereignty, not taking back control of it as Brexiters promised.#PeoplesVote
My piece for the @telegraph on how Ireland can & will be the UK’s best friend post #Brexit - focus now must be on a deal 
1. There's a subtle shift in tone from the ultras this morning who are now pushing for a Canada+ agreement. That + is going to have to do a lot of work because we'd still be subject to third country controls thus having a similarly damaging effect to no deal #Brexit.
JUST IN: 2.6 million Leavers now back Remain.STILL IN: Brexit is an irresponsible and detrimental decision for the future of the UK.TO COME: A People’s Vote.#Brexit #PeoplesVote #NoDeal
How about we start by stopping #Brexit & ending the home office #HostileEnvironment then YOU ABSOLUTE PLANK. Universities are seeing EU staff and students turn away in their droves. We will also be less competitive & attractive to international applicants after #Brexit!  
As an MEP, @Nigel_Farage has achieved not one tangible benefit for his constituents. But he's done well out of it himself. Good salary. Good pension. Lots of profile as a springboard for lucrative jollies like his trip to Australia, TV in the States, Russia Today ... #Brexit
When people say that fascism isn't behind #brexit one must only ask people to look at Steve Bannon and ask them "what do you think he is?!"  Same goes for Farage, Rees Muck, Breitbart etc... it's like some people have had a perception bypass...this is fascism in broad daylight 
The People have spoken argument is nonsense When we buy anything there is a right to change yr mind once  if it doesn’t work, fit, not fit for purpose @BestForBritain #brexit #FinalSay it’s time to give the people the final say on the mess government is making of negotiations
#Brexit is estimated to have wiped 2% off the UK's GDP even before the exit date... For the Tick #brexit voters that means recession, at least we have got our country back innit 
#Brexit is perhaps the most monumental ****** the Tories have ever had - and that's saying something.What they clearly need now is #Ruth_Davidson as Leader: in favour of Remain and Leave, a fan of everyone's plan and of no plan at all, but most of all, of her own career plan.
So much about #Brexit is outrageous but one of the most disgraceful parts – has to be the blind faced lies told by the Vote Leave Campaign. In reality Brexit has put a huge drain on the public purse and we are miles away from being "better off". 
Typical deceit and hypocrisy from Farage who has brandished threats of violence on several occasions in order to intimidate public and politicians into accepting #Brexit, and whose industrial scale mendacity has been undermining democracy. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
You and your fellow MP's chose to offer us a simple In/Out vote to a hugely complicated issue, and now you insult people's intelligence because they didn't make the 'sensible' choice you favour.  If you think #Brexit is a mess, it's a mess of your making.

Tuesday September 4th, 2018. It is 106 days since my last interview with the BBC.But only 20 days until my chat with BBC journo Andrew Neil to promote my book Yes She Can't - exploring the life lessons of one of the world’s most hypocritical women.#indyref2#brexit#Tories
WATCH: "BRITISH ARMY GENERAL, wearing EU insignia, salutes EU flag and salutes EU anthem".  Shocking full #Brexit story here: 
Brexit is undeliverable concluded BBC  #Newsnight last night. #Chequers dead as EU won’t compromise 4 freedoms. Only #Brexit is EEA but won’t satisfy hard Brexiters and has NO benefits (#democraticdeficit). #NoDeal destructive with no solution for Ireland, #StopBrexit
Well, after voting for Labour in every possible election since Michael Foot, I now realise that the Labour party is no longer my party. Goodbye Labour. #PeoplesVote #brexit #FBPE
It needs to be said again and again: "no deal" is not any kind of viable option. The government is not capable of managing an orderly #Brexit. We need to #StopBrexit with a #PeoplesVote
Seven months to go until the UK formally leaves the EU - here is your handy timeline for the rocky road ahead. #Brexit
UK national debt is now £1,800,000,000,000. Can anyone spot on the chart below when it suddenly started lurching higher. It corresponds exactly to the Tories coming to power. All that austerity and the debt is still growing. Can the UK afford the #Brexit hit to the economy? 
#Chequers is dead. A hard #Brexit is acknowledged by all but a few hardliners as a disaster, otherwise UK would have simply left two years ago. So what sensible option remains? Simple, put people's lives back on track by cancelling the whole thing. #BetterOffIn #StopBrexit
The bleak comedy that is #brexit britain. It’s ⁦@MattCartoonist⁩
The shift is what we are hear in our street stalls being run by @Devon4Europe , over and over again people are saying that #Brexit does not match what they voted for. Either it's too strong or too weak. They now just want it dropped and to get on with running the country properly 
As Westminster returns today halting the madness of #Brexit & realising #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope is top of my agenda. Here is a timely reminder from Ireland of what it looks to be an independent member of the #EU as opposed to the underdog in the U.K.
#Poll #PeoplesVote I know there isn't yet a #FinalDeal yet but I suspect everyone knows except @theresa_may what it will be So when the time comes how will you vote in the #PeoplesVote #TheDeal #NoDeal #RemaininEU ?#Remain #Leave #Brexit #BrexitMeansBrexit #Brexiter #Remainer
WATCH: The key themes behind Britain's advice in the case of a 'no-deal' #Brexit - more red tape for firms, more expensive holidays for consumers and difficulty accessing UK banks for EU-based citizens 
If anyone ever asks me what I’m proudest of, I’ll now say it’s #StandingUp2Brexit. I’ve never been particularly political. But the lies, fraud and manipulation of our country must stop. We are the worlds most respected democracy. #brexit diminishes us all. We are better than this
Thank you. The legal standing of the citizenship of my father and his parents  changed in 1938 Austria, when the Nazis made my father a 'citizen of nowhere'. I always thought #Brexit stupid, but I knew it was truly evil when banal @theresa_may uttered those words.

Ruth Davidson seriously wants us to cut off our only avenue of escape from #Brexit because she's that much of a "patriot" that she's slavishly following her party's disastrous and imperialistic policy instead of what Scots *actually* voted for.
#Brexit I’ll say it again, first question at PMQ’s should be “How can this house be certain that leaving the EU remains the ‘will’ of the people?”
Dear @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, as the benefits of #Brexit may take 50 years to realise & I'll be long dead, I wondered if I could have a down payment now to tide me over? A couple of million should do it. Thank you in anticipation. My family will pay you back from any #Brexit dividend.
“End the uncertainty” is what every business I meet says about #Brexit.  Let’s see some honesty from you - 2 years ago you were desperate to mitigate damage of #Brexit by ensuring a #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion solution.  You know without that the future is very bleak indeed…
People are sussing #Brexit out. It offers absolutely nothing positive and people are growing wise to the damage it will cause. #PeoplesVote
We need a @peoplesvote_uk on the final #Brexit deal, and we certainly can’t rely on the Tories to give us one. #Labour must stand up and speak out against this disaster - it’s what our voters and our members want, and it’s for the good of our country. 
Chester for Europe with @Andrew_Adonis at the launch of @WarringtonForEU event- inspirational speech and common sense on #Brexit . There may yet be a way out of this mess. 
Very little comment in @Telegraph about how #Brexit negotiations are affecting our defence relationship with EU countries. We need more scrutiny on this. @JamesERothwell
What do you think is @UKLabour's stance on #Brexit?Please RT after you vote for a larger sample.
This is laughably bad.And to think that this is supposed to be a pragmatic way forward Oh and remind me, who set the #Brexit timetable? The Tories when they triggered Article 50. 
EU citizens! The UK will literally be destroyed. The army will have to deal with violence and disorder. Despite them saying they have had no requests for assistance or any plans put in place. Millions will surely perish in the disaster that is #Brexit. 
Keep an eye open for this #Brexit debate we are going to try and cover! 
In adopting #Chequers, Britain has gone into battle with the white flag fluttering over our leading tank - Boris Johnson. Thank you Mrs. May. Now please will you step aside as you don't intend to deliver #Brexit? 
Any politician who uses such warlike rhetoric with regard to our democratic friends and allies can quite reasonably be regarded as a traitor colluding with Trump and Putin in their war against democracy. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
Tony Blair - Theresa May just can't bring herself to say #brexit is a good idea & she's been asked often enough. It's truly remarkable to see the British government take the country down a path that collectively they think is a bad idea.. it's a very odd thing. #peoplesvote

Different opinions on what #Brexit should look like - or whether to have it at all - don't just divide the country and the party - it divides families too. Let's get beyond that by holding a #PeoplesVote#C4PV
#Brexit update: UK government currently torn between a Chequers deal already rejected by the EU and a no deal fantasy which isn’t going to happen because you can’t rip an entire country away from all of its international relations without being absolutely insane.
First they tell you that you're all bots, then they tell you that the Indy movement is embroiled in civil war, and then they tell you that the polls are all wrong.I can only imagine what they'll say when Scotland finally votes for independence. #SNPCivilWar #indyref2 #Brexit
We must not accept #Brexit as inevitable. For Our Future’s Sake #FFS are a youth-led anti-Brexit campaign, making young people’s voices heard on our EU relationship; their wishes and their futures have been ignored. We must get what we need: a #FinalSay.
1. Watching the #Brexit debate unfold on my timeline is increasingly surreal. Tory drones are mounting an anti-chequers campaign despite all the signals from Barnier that the EU is not even willing to entertain it. And it gets even weirder...
So. A renewed dismissal of the idea that there is a fundamental #Brexit @BorderIrish problem at all.Here's a response to an earlier version of this trope, with a link to more detailed analysis of such proposals via @UKandEU
Both @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and @hilarybennmp emerged from their select committee's meeting with @MichelBarnier saying the same thing: he and they agree that major elements of the UK's #Brexit White Paper won't work.
After summer kick-off of @employers_EESC - debate with @EESC_President on the #priorities of the @EU_EESC. 2019 will be the crucial for the future of Europe due to #EPelections #Brexit and other factors. #Employers are to be active in this debate!
A quote for the future; 'No-one ever said on their deathbed they wished they had spent more time at the office trying to make sense of #Brexit' 
On the one hand, Tory ministers are talking down the impact of #Brexit on healthcare, then on the other, they ask pharmaceutical companies to stockpile medication. This causes grave concern; the health of the public is clearly at risk with No Deal indeed Any Deal #Brexit
European Parliament has just had an update on #Brexit from @danutahuebner who chairs the @EPInstitutional committee and is on the Brexit Steering Group (1)
The more I learn about the consequences of #Brexit, about just how much of our infrastructure depends on EU membership, the more utterly, unforgivably irresponsible it seems ever to have called a referendum. How could one of the most mature democracies on Earth have allowed it?
The #Brexit dividends just keep rolling in.  Considering the weakness of pound sterling, this is hugely worrying, especially to anyone who understands that market loss of confidence is rarely a smooth curve, and more often a tipping point. And we are near it, I think. 
We are already aware that any kind of #Brexit could be brutal for business. The No Deal papers further revealed the web of red tape just waiting to strangle small and medium-sized business, which could put them at risk and put them off trading altogether.
Don't Fall for the #Brexit Decoy! …
British PM Theresa May's #Brexit blueprint has come under heavy attack, with pro-Brexit figurehead Boris Johnson calling it a surrender that hands 'victory' to the EU  #ChequersPlan
May slaps down BoJo over his claim Britain had gone into #Brexit negotiations waving a white flag.Typical Tory infighting and jockeying for position, instead of doing their jobs.Worst government in living memory.
That's a silly take on it Boris. People reckon @GaryLineker talks more sense on #Brexit than you do.
1.  A Ref won't stop #Brexit unless a maj want 2 #StopBrexit2. If a maj now wish to #Remain it's the Will of the Ppl3. Those denying a #FinalSay R Autocrats4. Those forcing thru an invalid #BrexitShambles R Tyrants5. A #PeoplesVote doesn't subvert Democracy it Reinforces it.
Theresa May vows to STOP second #Brexit vote as poll shows 90 percent would vote the SAME 
Sheryll, your constituents did not vote to be made poorer or to lose their jobs. Some of them voted on the basis of a lie about the NHS and some empty rhetoric about "taking back control".Many of them are now aware they were lied to.#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
“We’re not selling chocolate” German industrial leaders explain why @theresa_may #Brexit plan won’t work & why they think the UK side (not the EU) must give (yet) more ground. 
Within this article it is clear from  recent @YouGov polling (with 18k + sample) that the UK is #remainernow.(51% men, 56% women).As more & more 2016 abstainers & leave voters realise #brexit reality & that it's not inevitable, this will only increase.
Both Labour and Tories are only united in being so disunited.  Neither offer a solution to #Brexit that is credible or workable. No wonder EU looks across at UK with mixture of frustration & sorrow. We must not pass on this mess to future generations #FBPE #PeoplesVote
Voting for #Brexit like:Lobbing the grenade at the EU, but finding it has rolled back into your trench.That nice warm feeling when you piss yourself, until it goes cold, & starts to smell. Giving the establishment a kicking, but realising it still has control, even more so.

The UK could never abide the EU 'superstate'. Why? Because the UK is a post imperial superstate itself. But with #Brexit it will break up into a federalised system and each component will rejoin the EU.That's why #Brexit is the exit of Britain as we know it from the world stage 
Brexit persuading Scots to support independence. New poll shows majority will back independence after Britain leaves the EU. Pls RT.  #scotland #brexit 
Rejecting #Brexit via a #PeoplesVote would not be the end of the world, nor the end of democracy, just the end of Mogg, Johnson, Fox, Gove, Farage and May.
No @BorisJohnson it's the inevitable result of embarking on a project built on lies, most of which you have spouted some time or another. Those who have peddled those lies deserve lengthy jail sentences for harming the country. #JailTheLeaveLiars#PeoplesVote #brexit 
I don't blame those who voted #Brexit in 2016 - they were lied to.I do blame anyone stupid, racist or bloody-minded enough to still support it in 2018.Stop ruining our country.#PeoplesVote
Another aspect of the serious health harms from #Brexit that is leaching real jobs, investment & expertise from Britain.  
Yet another indication of the cost of #Brexit....and never put on the side of a bus...Britain loses medicines contracts as EU body anticipates Brexit | Business | The Guardian 
This’ll be the non ‘traitor, mutineer, enemies of the people’ Tory rebels - the ones who won’t be losing their jobs if we crash out #Brexit #nodeal That’ll be #Leave voters working in our manufacturing sector
How would a #FinalSay *vote* be undemocratic? The #Brexit ref was, even ignoring the meddling, too close for a hard cliff-edge Brexit mandate to be read from it. Imagine #Remain had won 52-48 and that had been taken as a mandate for the Euro, Schengen, and full federalism.
Boris describes May's #Brexit negotiations as rigged.'I am afraid, the inevitable outcome is a victory for the EU, with the UK lying flat on the canvas and 12 stars circling symbolically over our semi-conscious head."Unless May goes, Boris is right
#Leavers how is any #Brexit deal the UK gets better for the economy, jobs and people's lives, than the one it has now?
“CHEQUERS ISN’T LEGAL” SAYS EU. "It would be an invitation to fraud." Read our explosive #Brexit account of what Barnier told German media yesterday: 
It doesn’t quite fit on the back of a fag packet, but it is that sort of plan .  It is also riddled with factual errors and based on the false assertion that there can be a “good” #Brexit.  There can’t. 
If you're of working-class & in a workers union then I'd recommend opting out of @UKLabour party contributions (I have) their apparent U-turn & lack of clarity on #Brexit with freedom of movement of a cheap labour force is driving your weekly wage down, along with everything else
Boris Johnson on #Brexit this morning emphasises the Unionist perspective and in so doing shows how 20 years of devolution would be ignored if he ever became PM :   “The answer is to go for the one solution that both delivers Brexit and treats all the UK in the same way” ....
.@BorisJohnson , your serious blunder over Nazanin to your offensive racist jokes and comments designed to stoke tension have lost you the right to speak on issues as serious as #Brexit #FBPE
The vandalism of #Brexit continues... 
It's pantomime, a make-believe that the EU is bending over backwards to accept Chequers, utter bolloxI predict that Chequers will be put to the council for ratification. A Merkel & May production, that has #Brexit betrayal written all over it & is why we must chuck Chequers now

The Captain of Titanic didn’t see the iceberg until it was too late. Brits have watched #Brexit iceberg approach for 2 yrs and still chose to ram right into it.  
The conservative Polish government is one of the UK's closest allies in its #BREXIT negotiations with #Brussels.
No, @BorisJohnson. The scandal of #Brexit is that unprincipled liars like yourself casually ruined our country to further your own personal ambition.Your shamefaced look look the morning after suggested that you may even have realised this yourself, albeit briefly.#PeoplesVote
WATCH: 'We must be ready' - Britain's Raab outlines a contingency plan in the event of a 'no-deal' #Brexit 
Terrible news - and yet more evidence of the massive act of self harm which is #Brexit 
Your job now @Keir_Starmer is to OPPOSE the government rather than facilitate this disastrous #Brexit farce. Please persuade your “leader” that his fortunes - and the country’s - would improve immeasurably if you committed to a #PeoplesVote and a swift end to this catastrophe
Independent front page:Hundreds of staff leave #Brexit department.Gives a whole new meaning to "Vote Leave". They're voting with their feet, and who can blame then for wanting nothing to do with this unholy mess?#PeoplesVote
A new poll shows a majority in Scotland favour independence & majority in Northern Ireland (52%) favour an United Ireland - post #brexit.   #indyref #borderpoll
David Davis says we can't go back on #Brexit because it's a once in a lifetime decision. Which makes sense, because it's clearly wrong to reverse a decision that will mess up the rest of your life while you still have the chance.... That's obvious, isn't it...?#PeoplesVote #FBPE
Incredible, this lad spent over two years in cabinet when no credible #brexit plans were presented having faced a campaign with no plan either. 
Vote for meat we said and we showed you pictures of a juicy steak. Turns out it’s not steak; it’s raw donkey testes. But meat means meat and if you change your mind now democracy will fall. Eat it. #Brexit
Andrew Adonis - We need 1 million people on the streets of London on the 20th of October 2018 demanding a #PeoplesVote & an end to #brexit.@cambridge_stays #FBPE @Andrew_Adonis
It's all very well asking what we could do were we not tied up with Brexit, but when you ask what we actually *would* do, the answer is more of the same. And that is why we have to leave the EU. #Brexit 
52% & rising every day as how serious the Tory #Brexit shambles is, becomes ever apparent! 
German business fully backs EU negotiating position on #Brexit: here is the clear economic case for the integrity of the #SingleMarket and the indivisibility of the 4 freedoms.
Mrs. May called an election after ppl who voted tory in 2015 expected a 5 year parliament, she said no election when she took over, she called one, she lost her majority (haha) now she's saying no #PeoplesVote, thankfully #Brexit will destroy her and her horrible party #ToriesOut
I do not pretend to be an authority on #Brexit, but as an outsider I would recommend...If the British people feel strongly that there should be a second referendum, they should assemble, march and demand it.Especially given the revelations of Russia's influence campaign. 
Momentum to take no position on #Brexit At Labour conference.No position on something that threatens to destroy countless jobs & livelihoods?On an issue that could enable Labour to bring down this abysmal Tory government?Pathetic.#PeoplesVote
The inmates are completely in charge of the #Brexit Asylum; Jobs lost, Rights to be lost, National Wealth lost & with both a PM & a Leader of a so-called Opposition opposing giving the People a #PeoplesVote 4 a #FinalSay , it appears our Democracy is lost..FGS stop this madness!
Fact is that there is no majority either in Parliament or the country for a cliff-edge, no-deal, no-transition #Brexit Which is why @theresa_may has no mandate to inflict such radical high-risk surgery without seeking #InformedConsent We need a #PeoplesVote
JRM "The government unfortunately believes that #Brexit is not a good thing in itself.Brexit is enormously positive, a huge opportunity for the country - and I’m afraid the Prime Minister doesn’t see that.“And it’s why I think she is a Remainer who has remained a Remainer.” 
The enthusiastic youth group opposing #brexit, Our Future Our Choice (@OFOCBrexit ) is asking for support:
Dear @MarcusFysh,We *already* sell English sparkling wine to the US & Asia, incl. wine from #Cornwall's excellent Camel Valley vineyard.We can't sell it as Champagne for the same reason we can't sell red wine as Bordeaux.It's pretty simple, and won't be made easier by #Brexit. 
This is probably the worst causality of #Brexit so far!Britain loses medicines contracts as EU body anticipates Brexit 
This is getting ridiculous. The EU cares deeply about GI - rightly - but thinking that this means they’ll do any deal to avoid UK importing US ‘feta’ is farcical. UK has never understood how little leverage it has in #Brexit 
Uncertainty around freedom of movement, a hit to the value of the Pound against the Euro - all caused by #Brexit is already negatively affecting football. Hate to think what would happen to the beautiful game if Govt’s anarchic #Brexit plans go ahead. #ExitFromBrexit
#Barnier trashes #May's #Chequers plan for #Brexit'EU firms must be prepared to disregard UK manufacturers once the UK has departed the bloc, in order to preserve other trade agreements'That clearly spells the end of the UK automotive parts industry
The more I read about #Brexit the more it feels like those firms that beach and then cut up huge ships to sell for scrap. Except they're eager to beach and cut up a fully functioning cruise ship with 65 million people still onboard.
'No Theresa May, #Brexit without the option of a second referendum would be a gross betrayal of British democracy' 
I’m not sure the PrimeMinister dancing awkwardly in a far off continent whilst her own country is splintered and facing a national crisis on an unprecedented scale, is either amusing or indeed anything to be applauded. But that might just be me. #brexit #peoplesvote
The status of EU citizens in the UK remains at risk due to #Brexit. Despite PM’s announcement that they will be allowed to remain, regardless of no deal, how can we trust the Home Office to process cases fairly?  Remember Windrush?
.@JuliaHB1 on #Marr points out that @theresa_may has given in to the #EU with #Chequers, whilst they have not budged.She also points out that by "giving them 39 Billion quid, & pretty much what they want, funnily enough it will unlock the deal"Truth!#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
The decision by the European Medicines Agency to cut Britain out of its medicines contracts seven months ahead of Brexit is a devastating blow to British pharmaceutical companies already reeling from the loss of the EMA’s HQ in London and with it 900 jobs #Brexit 
So @Keir_Starmer does that mean that you are supporting either staying in the EU or a #PeoplesVote as the third option? There won't be time to negotiate another deal.#Brexit #StopBrexit
In 2017, May called an election to 'strengthen her hand on #Brexit' only 2 years after last GE.She now has the audacity to claim that a #PeoplesVote 2 &1/2 years after the vote in 2016 would be a 'betrayal of democracy.'It is absurd and she knows it.
Where does this borderline pathological hatred of the EU come from? Nothing worse? Really? “Fox said he was behind the Chequers plan and and could not imagine many things worse than remaining in the EU.” #Brexit 
Barnier delivers his most damning ever assessment of Theresa May's post-#Brexit trade plansHe says 1) He is "seriously opposed" to the #ChequersPlan2) May's customs proposals are illegal3) Her common rulebook would kill off the European project
The reason we are in this mess...Most MPs are useless party drones, collecting their pay and expenses, and voting the way they are told to. When the #Brexit advisory referendum result was announced, the correct next step should have been a Parliamentary debate on whether...
We had a great turnout at today's #PeoplesVoteEast rally, with hundreds of people from all over the East of England hearing from our local and national speakers about why the UK needs a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. 
"When people ask me 'can we have a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal' I have just three words to say.... Yes you can" says @DanielZeichner MP at today's #PeoplesVoteEast rally in #Cambridge today.
PM knows Chequers deal has been rejected by the EU. PM knows the consequences of a no deal #Brexit will wreck the economy, lives and jobs for generations. PM knows the referendum was won by cheating. Why the fuk won't she let the electorate change their mind.#Meglomaniac
ICYMI: Britain straps on its #Brexit crash helmet in case it's forced to leave the EU without a trade deal 
Proves you don’t need to be in a political union with countries ( which are rapidly heading towards a supranational state)  in order to trade effectively with them. As we thrive outside of EU I anticipate other nations will follow us to freedom and sovereignty. #Brexit 
Theresa May has crossed all of her red linesFew now believe that she is genuinely committed to ending free movementSo Prime Minister, you are being judged by your action, not your platudinous wordsWith you and #Brexit, seeing really is believing
What has #Brexit given the United Kingdom? The largest most active energetic pro European Movement in Europe.
Latest @YouGov survey from @peoplesvote_uk campaign shows 72% think it’s important to know the terms of #Brexit before leaving. Even among Leavers, 65% don't want a #BlindBrexit.
As predicted the #Brexit loss of jobs from the City of London was never going to be a Big Bang. More of an adjustment with gradual flows. But this shows it’s happening - with Luxembourg  and Ireland  the main destinations for asset management.  
Let me help you Carole. No one is going to investigate this because outside of your head there is nothing to investigate. No evidence of anything. You've spent two years freaking out whenever a Brexiteer is pictured drinking a Smirnoff Ice for nothing. #Brexit 
Dictators May and Corbyn both continue to harness the #Brexit Armageddon. Irrespective of all logic, facts, laws and politics (given there’s now a majority for another vote), they continue to drive the #brexitanic in to the iceberg. History won’t be kind.
If #Brexit is NOT a religion, then it is not above scrutiny, the law or ongoing democracy. As a Remainer I’m more frightened of the political stranglehold on democracy than I am of Brexit itself. Every political policy must be able to be questioned and parliament held to account
This unredacted version isn't going away...This is the UK party of Govt in charge of #brexit many with 'allegations' about Tory MPs....I bet ye didn't hear about most of these on yer @BBCScotlandNews Tories - GOODSNP - BAD
#Brexit: Liam Fox responds to David Davis saying the Chequers proposal is "almost worse than staying in" the EU #Marr
The last flag is coming down #efa18 Promise we will raise the Union Jack  again next year at #efa19 #brexit does not mean the Uk is leaving #europe
When is N Ireland getting their devolved Govt back?What's happening with the NI border?What's happening with Gibraltar?What's happening with EU Nationals?What's happening with the £Bill for #Brexit What's happening with future trade deals?Anyone know what's happening?
Every time I meet an EU doctor I ask them about #Brexit. Most want to stay in UK, but all of them have anxieties and are trying to future proof themselves with a plan B to leave. This is awful for them and awful for the #NHS
CAMBRIDGE: my slide into full time activism continues as I will be hosting the  #PeoplesVoteEast rally at Clifton Way at 2.30pm today.The madness of #Brexit is NOT inevitable, but it’ll take every one of us to stop it.Please attend if you can
The PM & #Brexiteers pontificate about the *will of the people* Yes - *leave* won - by a NARROW majority - and YES that result has to be respected.BUT 48% voted *remain* - & that should be taken into account in ANY #Brexit settlement.I also believe public opinion is changing.
Really looking forward to it, thanks!Young people would have to live longest with the consequences of #Brexit so it’s vital your voices are heard 
"The point about referenda is that they are once in a generation"  - Former #Brexit Secretary David Davis on prospect of a second EU referendum #Marr 
Great to hear @BrexitStewart on @IainDale set out the positive #Brexit future for Britain - top man top work
You've got David Davis/Liam Fox/Julia Hartley-Brewer/Jo Coburn all fronting up on #marr this morning, yet some people are still trying to tell me the @BBC is not #Brexit biased, fuck off, #PeoplesVote
Nick Boles MP says he doesn’t support Theresa May with her flawed Robbins #Chequers plan (few do), he proposes EEA/EFTA instead which is not #Brexit. Why are MPs settling? Because like Boles they want to remain. The EU don’t / won’t/ can’t negotiate. Embrace #WTO#StandUp4Brexit
What a brilliant thread @JasonJHunter should really be on #Marr #BBC @MarrShow While the politicians have been away (unbelievable, I know) then the BBC should have brought in experts on various topics to explain the reality of #Brexit
Effing unbelievable that an org that purports to represent the most vulnerable in society, & seek a more equal society can't be arsed to make a stand vs this flawed #Brexit that'll REMOVE RIGHTS & leave us all POORER no doubt in case it harms Jeremy. SHAME 
Note to PM: 1. Democracy didn’t end on 23 June 2016.  2. A #PeoplesVote on final deal is an extension of democracy, not a denial of it 3. Our movement for a #PeoplesVote is growing fast - and with your Government’s chaotic handing of #Brexit, it will grow still more 
Surely @theresa_may the “gross betrayal of democracy” & trust was perpetrated by those who based their campaign for #Brexit in 2016 on distortions & lies, not those advocating a second vote now we have so much better information on what Brexit will mean.
The PM says letting the people have a say on the final #Brexit deal would be "a gross betrayal of our democracy"But the real betrayal of democracy would be silencing the people over something that will affect us for generations. We demand a #PeoplesVote!
Next week in #Leeds we will be “Creating A Vision Of A New Britain Without #Brexit”. What great & ambitious things could we be doing to make life better for our people if we weren’t consumed by the negativity of #Brexit? See  for more.
And that's great.Now have a look at the guest list for #Marr this morning.John McDonnellDavid DavisLiam FoxJulia Hartley-BrewerAll in favour of #Brexit. Not a single guest on the list has an anti-Brexit stance, or one that's top of their agenda to communicate.
BREAKING: May vows to STOP second #Brexit vote as poll shows 90% would vote the SAME.“To ask that question all over again would be a gross betrayal of our democracy – and trust” It's a shame you bowed down to EU's every demand, you spineless imbecile
"UK dominates entire world in foreign currency trading" - UK does 78% of the EU’s foreign exchange trading. UK does 21 times more than Germany. Read our #Brexit summary  and brighten your Sunday! 
Mr Verhofstadt, you don't have to be 'far right' to be against the United States of Europe that you want. Just ask millions of people across the EU. You totalitarians are yesterday's people selling yesterday's news.Original #Brexit research & news daily: 
I was born in Belfast the year the troubles started. This made me cry. With absolute pride. But heartache. Please support these young people. Northern Ireland matters. Look at these fabulous kids. They deserve so much better than #Brexit We all do x #peoplesvote
Would a second referendum on #Brexit be a 'betrayal'? RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters
Why is our government allowing us to be blackmailed by the socialist monolithic European Union. Australia needs its own #brexit from the EU. 
.@BBCRadio4 at Midnight:@theresa_may has dismissed the prospect of a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal because it would be "a betrayal of trust""TRUST"...?!Trust in Politicians to deliver on their promises?She's deluded if she thinks she has a shred of trust to lose
Whose opinion on #Brexit should we seek next?
Welsh Lamb from NZ?Scots Salmon from Canada?Melton Mowbray Pork Pies from Denmark?Hereford Cider from Normandy?#Brexit is for mugs. Time to take back control. Time for a #PeoplesVote.
#roxannepallett should be in charge of #brexit as she is the only person I've seen unite the country
If you value our #NHS take a look at this photo & you'll know why you need your #FinalSayWe need a #PeoplesVote on halting #Brexit, the public has a right to change its mind when it's apparent we're walking off a cliff.Time to #StopBrexitSaveBritain#fbpe #ENGvIND @BrexitBin
A new legal challenge on the blocks & one that looks almost impossible for #ukgov to defend. If as High Court found in @A50Challenge case @theresa_may took #Brexit decision under A50 then that decision is unlawful after @ElectoralCommUK found #EURef2016 tainted by overspending.
Today my family mark #800DaysInLimbo.We hope common sense & common decency will prevail and look to both sides to deliver on their promises to ensure that the people potentially most affected by #Brexit will be able to live their lives as before.@The3Million@BritishInEurope
#bbcnews So #TheresaMay says that allowing people to vote on her #Brexit deal would “betray democracy”.  New concept of democracy: avoid asking the people, even when what you deliver bears no resemblance to what was promised!
.@theresa_may saying there will be no #PeoplesVote because it would be undemocratic. Is she really so stupid not to realise this could be a "get out of jail free card" for her. Does she want to go down in history as the PM who was responsible for #Brexit & huge damage it will do?
This is a non-partisan event. It doesn't matter who you vote for, if you've got questions about #Brexit, then this meeting is for you. 
Fantastic news that #Bridgend & #Ogmore CLPs have said #NotMyBrexit and backed a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal! 
Why dont Brexists want a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal? Because they know they won't win
Surely Farage’s support for the far-right in Germany, France and elsewhere is sufficient reason for any sane person to reject #Brexit?#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote#FaceDownTheFruitcakes
Almost 8 years ago I landed in the UK feeling like a new home. I was preparing to get the British citizenship when the referendum left me speechless. Now, after #800DaysInLimbo I'm preparing to leave #brexit land for a new place I hope it will become my home.
The Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference next Saturday will open with a keynote speech from renowned Observer journalist @williamnhutton titled "What Is Wrong With Britain? – identifying the main drivers of the vote for Brexit". It is hard to think of anyone better qualified.
Why would you be concerned about making an uninformed decision? Didn’t bother you about #Brexit.
I have now left the UK because of what #Brexit is doing to my - former - country. I intend to apply for residency in Spain - where I will be an immigrant. But for the next few days I will be in France, where I am...?A refugee? An escapee? In limbo?  
"A YouGov poll of 10,000 Britons shows that 72% of people are opposed to a #Brexit in which the details of the future deal are unclear when the UK leaves." #PeoplesVote

Conservative party donor calls for second public vote on #Brexit 
Today at the Llanfair Caereinion Show I have been speaking to people about  #Brexit and reiterating the @WelshLibDems call a #FinalSay on the #brexitdeal via a #PeoplesVote. An #ExitFromBrexit must be on the cards, especially if we face a #nodealbrexit or a #HardBrexit. #FBPE

How serious are @jeremycorbyn & @johnmcdonnellMP about stopping hard Tory #Brexit? Simple test coming on Tues in House of Lords on Cross Border Trade Bill We could build cross-party winning coalition & pass Customs Union negotiating objective for UK. Will they try?Hope so

I, like many others, do not want to see the beautiful game of football tarnished by the disaster that is #Brexit. Glad to hear that managers of high profile clubs have spoken out against policy that could damage a treasured sport.
Crispin Odey calls for hard #Brexit and demands that Theresa May is replaced with someone who will force it through (his friend Rees-Mogg, maybe). Simultaneously, he shorts the shares of companies that would be badly affected by hard Brexit. Always, always, follow the money.

I don't know how small an object the most powerful microscope can see, or how distant an object the most powerful telescope can see, but you would need a combination of both to find the doubt I have that #Brexit is not a fucking terrible idea. A good idea though is a #PeoplesVote
It is indubitably clear that the Tories have made an absolute mess of #Brexit, and Labour is doing nothing but blindly assisting them. We can still find a way out of this nightmare. We must give the people a final say and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit.
I don’t recall the uproar when #JeremyCorbyn voted against the last #Labour Government 428 times? #FrankField #Brexit

N.B. for eventual U.S.-UK #TradeDeal - U.S. will demand access to UK services market. Canada pushing back but needs the U.S. market...as will the UK. Advantage U.S. #Brexit #FDIU.S. to move ahead with Mexico trade pact, keep talking to Canada
Look on the bright side, every few months a few more of such leavers...er, ‘leave us’ and a few more youngsters join the electorate in their place. #Brexit as a confirmed position will only last a few years at most. Demographics will be kind to the cause. Rejoining EU inevitable.
If you want a better or some understanding of #Brexit #WTO #InternationalTrade you should be paying attention to this series #3Blokesinapub

#Brexit is lose lose...it's that simple...#PeoplesVote for a #FinalSay with a #Remain option
Quitlings are destructive. Even if they managed a success of #Brexit they still want to destroy whatever. It's the bully in them
UK is not a homogenous blob. Only 37% voted for #Brexit. Half the country want to #Remain. We do not want to lose our EU citizenship & are fighting desperately to #StopBrexit. We are the first people to have to fight fork EU citizenship so we know how precious it is.

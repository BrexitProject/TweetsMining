I'm a left-of-centre passionate Remainer, obviously enough given the tweets here. Corbyn has utterly lost my respect & support. NO #Brexit.
Ok: time to take action to rescue our beloved country from the insanity of #Brexit. Let's do it. 
We need a centrist grouping committed to stopping the lunacy of #Brexit. We will get it, & we will prevail: as sound good sense always does.

Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party in hopelessly divided #Brexit mess

I still fail to understand why anyone would object to a second referendum on whether we're happy with terms of the #brexit deal #bbcqt
Zanny M-B's remarks on the #EU & #Brexit epitomise why I junked The Economist over 5 years ago. #bbcqt
#BBCQT is stuck in a time loop in June 2016, endlessly debating the same #BRExit arguments and never learning anything.

Did labour moderates move too quickly? Very possibly but #labour as divided as Tories on #Brexit -but most of its voters aren't (remainers) 
And in the end 80~% of MPs voting for hard #Brexit won’t result in hard Brexit. Because none actually know how to do what they’re voting for

Stupid #brexit tweet of the day 
#Labour Remainers. Don't get into a lather over #Brexit yet. We need to remain united. The MSM are whooping up the split. THINK!
Seriously, who the feck does Chuka Umunna think he is? 13 million voters were satisfied with Labour's position on #brexit, but now this! 
So Labour in a bigger mess than Tories over #Brexit. Three sackings and one resignation as Labour abstain on single market.
Astonishing that not a single Scottish Labour or Tory MP voted for membership of Single Market - huge damage to scotland without it #Brexit 
Young voters should feel betrayed by @UKLabour 's support of government on #Brexit with today's @HouseofCommons single market vote
It’s clear which side have done their homework for #Brexit negotiations. Astonishing that in 27 v 1 its the 27 that speak with one voice.

Corbyn achieved his electoral success by supporting #brexit not by being against it.  #QueensSpeech

Magic, Labour brexit and magic, Liberal brexit would be equally calamitous. Many of us oppose #brexit. We want democratic representation. 
EU nationals have come here & made lives here in good faith. Reducing their rights is inhuman and should be a criminal offence.#Brexit

Tory whips must be incandescent with rage!Credit where it's due, kudos to @Anna_Soubry for her honesty. #Brexit

By pushing #ScotRef until after #Brexit, @NicolaSturgeon has forced @ScotTories to talk about Tory/DUP Government. No wonder they're glum!
Our response to today’s announcement by @ScotGovFM on #Brexit & #indyref2
 @NicolaSturgeon has today made a statement on Scotland's future and #Brexit. You can read it in full here.

BREAKING: @NicolaSturgeon drops plans for #indyref2 until after #Brexit deal. 
#indyref2 in 2019/20 is highly likely, by then we will see the devastating effects of #Brexit. Between the Tories and DUP the UK is fecked!
Breaking: #indyref2 is still on the table but legislation will not be introduced immediately, it'll be revisited when #Brexit deal is clear.

The way British mainstream media is undermining #Brexit it's safe to assume that the EU is paying hacks in UK for anti--Brexit propaganda.
UK includes #Gibraltar in key #Brexit document. How it should be: Britain looks after British citizens.Why is a foreign state wary about it? 
If I work abroad I have to pay that countries taxes but I can't claim benefits.Why should that be different for EU citizens after #Brexit? 
The DUP deal shows the Tories will do anything, destroy anything, pay anything to get their #Brexit & maintain party unity#MagicMoneyTree

It is excruciatingly obvious how disastrous #Brexit is. One vote in Parliament could stop it & restore sanity.
After #Brexit EU citizens in UK should not be able to claim benefits and freedom of movement should end on #Brexit dayTory Gov is too soft.

More than 50% of UK citizens don't want the EU to compromise on its core principles in #Brexit talks - I agree. 
UK started #Brexit negotiations with NO PLAN! Isn't it time to STOP this self-inflicted HUMILIATION and listen to the TRUE WILL of  PEOPLE? 
And so it begins: #Brexit 
#Chancellor emphasises need for "mutually beneficial transitional arrangements" in #Brexit negotiations. He's right. 
#Brexit Fact: IMMIGRANTS are key to make UK ECONOMY GROW! A somehow missing truth from the populist #GE2017 campaigns of the Tories & Labour

#Brexit is not independence, it is a stumbling and confused retreat from Europe #Remain
The #Brexit ref was utterly undemocratic. From the lack of proper thresholds, to the disenfranchisement of EUtaxpayers, 16yo & UK migrants.
The UK's #Brexit negotiations have got off to a bad start. 
Naive 2think UK was going 2 get a very good deal. If so,then it would encourage other countries to leave EU. Labour have better Team#Brexit 
The government thinks it is negotiating. In reality it is making harrumphing noises, while the EU presses home its demands. #Brexit

Frightening that UK Team supposedly negotiating Brexit have so little understanding of how important EU27 is to France & Germany #Brexit

Why do the media & politicians all blindly accept #brexit will happen. Sign the petition – tell them to stop it.

Better to remain opaque about your #Brexit negotiations hand and be thought a fool than to be transparent and to remove all doubt....
#Brexit is SOCIAL DUMPING sold under the name of "SOVEREIGNTY"! #remain #StopBrexit #hungparliament @UKIPNFKN @nickreeves9876 @EUflagmafia
#Brexit As nothing is agreed till all is agreed, sequencing doesn't really matter. We can do without silly hacks' hyperbole of "caving in."
#Brexit #InThread - reality of today's concession by Davis1) Today the UK agreed to the EU's "sequencing", ie sort out the divorce bill &
UK "has decided to leave the European Union, it's not the other way round," says @MichelBarnier, rejecting need to make concessions. #Brexit 
After all his bluster about "the row of the summer" @DavidDavisMP caves in to the #EU timetable for #Brexit negotiations on day one 
German news just reported that there are 96,000 Brits in Germany. That number could rise sharply if #Brexit is not stopped.
Article 50 negotiations-Terms of Reference agreed by EU & UK published.Our aim:maximum level of transparency  #Brexit 
#Brexit Must we suffer daily bulletins from the commentariat? Like an iceberg two-thirds of this negotiation is hidden below the surface.

For both, EU & UK, a fair deal is possible & far better than no deal."I'll work for that. I'll work with the UK, never against it." #Brexit 
Barnier is clearly in charge and will set the terms of the #Brexit negotiation. Davis looked flustered and out of his depth.
David DavisWhat he wanted: 'the fight of the summer' over sequencing of #Brexit talks.What he got: nothing
.@MichelBarnier & @DavidDavisMP agreed on dates, organisation & priorities.1st orderly withdrawal of the UK. 2nd future partnership #Brexit 
I see the #Brexit negotiations are off to a flying start. 
LIVE: British #Brexit minister Davis says more time spent on Ireland in today's talks than any other subject. 
.@MichelBarnier @DavidDavisMP #Brexit "A fair deal is possible and better than no deal. I will work for that." 
This press conference presents a significant problem for much of the #Brexit camp. It refuses to play into their chosen narrative.
LIVE: EU #Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier and UK's David Davis hold news conference on first day of talks. 
Michel Barnier says there will be one week of #Brexit negotiations every month. So like a period. Only more painful.
I KNOW this is petty & mean spirited but watching TV news clips of David Davis parading himself on EU stage is DEEPLY irritating !#Brexit

Dear @GuyVerhofstadt. Am closing this poll, because meeting is upon us. Almost 90% of these Britons feel UK too unstable for #Brexit talks. 
While British Muslims are dying on a pavement, the @BBC has already moved onto talking about #Brexit.Show some humanity!#FinsburyPark
Davis goes to Brussels full of bluster & posturing & nothing else: empty hands, empty head, no mandate or authority. There'll be no #Brexit.
So here we are: 19 June 2017, it's the day #Brexit negotiations start. And here's the UK on its way, strong and stable as always, of course. 
So why does @jeremycorbyn say 'the issue of Brexit is settled.' Public mood already turning against #Brexit 
Any ideas about who to blame after #Brexit? Will it be finally time to acknowledge Britain's bad economic policies? #hungparliament #GE2017
Waiting for Theresa May's 'strong and stable' #Brexit negotiating team, EU be like...

Clear as a Bell that #Brexit  has strengthened the EU and damaged Britain. It's barmy.
I see Phil Hammond has come out and contradicted #May by confirming no deal from the EU would be a bad deal. Her days are numbered. #brexit
Which is why there's no #QueensSpeech...except one involving #Brexit. So no domestic agenda as such.  It's a #landgrab. For now.
France about 2 take a greater leadership role while UK decides 2 cast adrift into an irrelevant backwater...#Brexit shames our great country 
And neither is @jeremycorbyn because, quite simply, @UKLabour *lost* the #GeneralElection #GE2017  so Labour has no mandate for #Brexit 
Let's remember Friday is brexit days first anniversary Share the news & ruin a leftist pricks day#Brexit

#British people have changed their minds on #Brexit, poll finds:

A superb piece of writing on #Brexit from @MarinaHyde
Forget the Single Market myth – the UK has little to lose from being outside it   #Brexit
Let the games begin#Brexit 
It takes Russian journalist Alexander Nekrassov to talk sense on biased BBC News. #Brexit  
#Brexit is and always was about money - the 1% who think they can profit from deregulation and tax avoidance, the Redwoods and Rees-Moggs
Never fear! There is a backup #Brexit negotiating team in case things get difficult 
These idiots think that we will get better deals when we are desperate and vulnerable outside the EU, than the EU has already got.#Brexit 
Keir Starmer needs to drop the idea that any #Brexit is better than staying in the EU.
The vandals and hooligans are the Tories and their billionaire press baron friends who are wrecking this country with #Brexit.#Remain
#Brexit isn't an accident it's by right wing #Tory design - its holy grail is mass deregulation at any cost - not to themselves - but to us.

You are deluded Single market means all the obligations but no say in the rules. Less control and sovereignty than we have now. Drop #Brexit
May has no mandate to start negotiating #Brexit on Monday. She is playing a high risk game with our futures 
UK to agree #Brexit divorce bill before trade talks, EU sources tell the BBC
Most of #Brexit's benefits come from shredding regulations - regulations that protect YOU but reduce profits. Be careful what you vote for.

After #Brexit, no desire amongst Europeans to follow Britain out the door. 
Common sense from the Duke of York: UK firms should make best of #Brexit. (Yes, we have to leave #CustomsUnion.)
We have to start saying it, don't we? #brexit isn't really about immigration (that was just to get the votes of bigots) but deregulation.
Our country is in a total mess. And absolutely none of it has anything to do with the EU. Why weaken ourselves further with #Brexit?
Even though talks start on Monday, the Govt has failed to submit #Brexit position papers to the EU 
"The world is your oyster!" Prince Andrew urges UK businesses to view #Brexit as a "glass half-full" opportunity.  
Thread by @davidallengreen comparing "mandate for #brexit" with "mandate for poll tax" very good. Manifestos & mandates never the last word. 
Emily Thornberry was utterly humiliated on #BBCQT after she failed to recall Labour’s #Brexit plans...
They told us we'd gain from #brexit, but reality shows further #brexit losses on their way: 
The fat, corrupt, philanderer "Prince" Andrew shares his #Brexit "wisdom" from behind a palace wall. 
Theresa May & David Davis have no mandate to negotiate for whole UK on #Brexit. "Will of people" is now for cross party / 4 nation approach.
More like they want stupid people to believe it's possible so that they feel good about #Brexit
No one in EU institutions wants to harm the UK John. They keep offering olive branches. #brexit is self-harm for 99% of population.
None of the 52% regret it.  It's utter garbage propaganda to claim we didn't know what we voted for, or that we have 2nd thoughts. #brexit 
Those 'difficult' #Brexit talks:UK "We're leaving the EU!"EU "OK"UK "We want to keep all the good things"EU "No"UK "OK"
V important to mention that the 'plan' May enters #Brexit talks w/Monday is of less regulation, less health and safety, less accountability
Nearly 12 months of chaos and subterfuge from government, we need to keep applying all our efforts in exposing their flawed #Brexit plans.

"Worst since" & "in my lifetime" just to date this. I quite agree that #Brexit is many times worse because it is fundamentally an act of war

FM: "There has to be a change of approach...every voice in the UK has to be listened to." #brexit
As other parties bicker and confuse on #Brexit @theSNP make a clear and coherent case to remain in Single Market.
Theresa May currently at bargaining stage of grieving process#hungparliament #Theresamay #Brexit #Election
All talk of leaving the EU has subsided in all other member countries who have watched us. It's time to stop this #Brexit nonsense.
lets face it - #Brexit is a car crash and the vast majority recognise it. We need to slam on the brakes.
Look at the complete mess #Brexit has caused. All this because bigots don’t want hard working Polish in the UK. Scrap it NOW. Queen's Speech
EU citizens can vote in local elections. If they did so as a block in May 2018 that would have a devastating impact on #Brexit parties.
Reminder to Leavers. Tory Brexiters expecting a #Remain victory were clamouring for a 2nd referendum. #Brexit #Leave
“I think we're probably headed towards a Norway-type situation” – Former @UKIP leader @Nigel_Farage #Brexit #GE2017 #newsnight
Shameful and concerning that #Brexit is preventing our NHS from hiring the nurses is desperately needs #LeaveWatch 
Number of EU nurse applications drops from 1,304 in July 2016 to 46 in April 2017   #NHS #Nurses #Health #Brexit
The Tory right sees #Brexit as a chance to create a tax haven for the rich that will never recur. They will do anything to get it.#Remain
Included in the lists on my profile page is a Pro-EU campaigners list with over 3,000 members. #Remain #Brexit #brexitshambles #NoBrexit
Interesting, but will the Tory moderates have the guts to stand up to the Brextremists? I doubt it.#Remain #Brexit
It is about time the United Kingdom stops being held hostage to #Tories civil war over #EU #brexit  @nickreeves9876
#NHS is 40,000 nurses short of what is needed, EU nurse applicants drop by 96% since #Brexit vote 
The Tories' hard #Brexit plan has been rejected - we now need a cross-party, four nation approach. Here's how. 
Timely report from Harvard University on why May's extreme damaging #Brexit would be a disaster for jobs and investment in Britain 
96% drop in nurse applications since #Brexit. We spoke to several EU nurses earlier this year. Watch our film here:

There is now talk that Theresa May will delay both #brexit talks & the Queen's speech which indicates the Tories aren't fit to govern.

It's #Brexit.Not 'soft Brexit' or any other manufacture of UK media.Remember how they tried to con at EURef?Don't believe their lies now.
A message for the deluded media: Anyone who thinks the #DUP want a soft #BREXIT does not understand the DUP or the BREXITEER #ArleneFoster

Theresa May does not look well, looks like she's in shock and not acting in a rational way. No way should she be negotiating #Brexit.

Hard Brexit, soft Brexit, good Brexit, extreme Brexit, and now we have clean Brexit! How about 'just get the bloody thing done' #Brexit?!
The election result could not have been better for Labour. Tories in hung parliament position puts all the blame for #Brexit chaos on them
The only Brexit we should go for is a hard one.A soft one just won't satisfy anyone.#Brexit 
Now #Brexit to be negotiated by the 'stable competent government' that couldnt 'win' an election w 20 point lead.Ya, this is gonna end well!
I'm certain that #Brexit economic effects will completely will make a complete nonsense of both Labour & Tory manifesto plans.
I hope @labour MPs never, ever vote with the Tories again on #Brexit whatever their leader tells them to do...
Is Labour above the self-interested, careerist behaviour of the Tories?  Ditching #Brexit would convince me it is. Otherwise, plus ça change

Reflection, some deep reflection on the mass youth vote & seats like Kensington (and doing the sums) will go a very long way. #Brexit 
Absolutely. I think it's important we all let @UKLabour know on what conditions they've had our vote. It's all about stopping #Brexit!
Piece in @mailonsundaySTL p. 14. @theresa_may must launch multi-party talks for compromise on Soft #Brexit for unified #BrexitNegotiations

There is no such thing as a 'soft #Brexit.' Brexit, remember, means Brexit: 'soft' means staying in without any say; absurd. Just junk it.

Four reasons why May is now wrong person to lead #Brexit negotiations (written in car so sorry for handwriting) 
Over 80% of the electorate voted for parties who want to leave the European Union, time to implement the will of the people.#Brexit 
.@jeremycorbyn: if you truly want a "jobs-first" #brexit as you said on #marr this morning then you'd better start fighting for no brexit.
Labour should hold a convention to determine its #Brexit stance. Over 60% of Labour voted Remain. Probably more now. Realistic proposal?
Jeremy Corbyn says he wants a "jobs first" #Brexit and "tariff-free access" to the EU market #GE2017
And to think #Brexit negotiations are in May's hands. This has disaster written all over it 
Can genuinely see #Labour delivering a fantastic #Brexit deal of compromise, something for both remainers & leavers.#Marr

No rush Theresa. It's not like there's anything else that needs doing. Oh wait there is..now don't tell me.. #brexit 
It's clear to me that the British political establishment wants to subvert #Brexit and a weakened PM simply helps that. A scandal.
'Drop hard Brexit plans', leading Tory and Labour MPs tell May  And then let's drop #brexit plans entirely. Thanks :)
The #DUP is pro #British, pro #Brexit, pro Business, pro #Israel and anti terrorism.That's why the media Luvies hate them 
Our Chair @stephen_dorrell is clear - the #Brexit that Theresa May sought before this election is now impossible

Congratulations to our Best for Britain champion @DavidLammy reelected in #Tottenham. Let's stop extreme #Brexit #GE2017
A more consensual, cross-party approach to #Brexit negotiations is the best way to achieve a good deal for Britain
#Brexit was "won" by a vicious, sustained, xenophobic campaign by a mafia of right-wing press barons. It will damage our economy hugely.
@campbellclaret saying what a lot of us are thinking let's park #brexit until we have a functioning stable state.  Just not the time!
Tories can elect new leader without then having a General Election.They should elect a Brexiteer Leader to ensure #Brexit happens.

If May managed Man United, she’d get them to foot of Division 2 in three years. FFS, the UK is going be eaten alive in #Brexit negotiations
What worries me is May’s lack of judgment in following bad advice. How the hell is she going to defend UK interests in #Brexit negotiations

So, let me get this straight..@theresa_may doesn't have the authority to reshuffle her cabinet. But she does to conduct #Brexit talks?
So,after electorate declines to endorse her #HardBrexit approach , May stays on through deal with DUP, which wants an even harder #Brexit
I'm including this election cost as part of #brexit expense. Unnecessary spend that could've gone on services. #brexit makes us poorer.

When May called the election she said it was for a mandate for #Brexit: meaning she didn't have one. She certainly hasn't got one now.
Irony of #Brexit vote--a protest against an unrepresentative political elite--is that UK has not yet found a political leader to act on it

Serious point. With the clock ticking & our government in chaos, should we revoke Article 50 now? #Brexit
Once again the @Conservatives call a vote for self-serving party political reasons and it spectacularly backfires. #Brexit #GE17
#GE2017 huge moment in history of #journalism. The age of 'The Sun wot won it' is over. Pro #Brexit press could not deliver May a majority
re #BernieWouldHaveWon: No.USA ≠ UK. Bernie ≠ Corbyn. BS would've faced REAL OPPO.#Brexit & #Trump HAPPENED > Shock > Mobilization.
If UK goes to EU “look, we are stuck, we need more time” they’ll get it. If UK keeps up its ballistic vocab then they won’t. #brexit #ge17
Maybe Theresa May should call a second #Brexit vote, too #GE2017
UK prob has 55 working weeks for #Brexit roughly ... who will negotiate... and when...#mess
There’s no way British can deliver on their side of #Brexit Article 50 timetable now. What does the EU do? Carry on? Or - sensibly - pause?
Honest assessment? millions of votes bought by the lure of free tuition fees / funds for #waspi women. #GE17 was about #BREXIT. Just BREXIT.
The producers of #Brexit present: #Therexit - the Reckoning#GE2017
Tories would lose mandate to leave EU single market if they lose their majority, says David Davis. #GE2017 #Brexit 
The public have spoken and a hard #brexit is not exactly looking popular. Good to see @LibDems successes.Onwards to our Macron  moment
Officially a hung parliament. May has lost the mandate to negotiate #Brexit. She must resign now #Elections2017
Looks like it's going to be a hung parliament and we may have another general election by the end of summer. #Brexit also at risk. #GE2017
Does this result damage #brexit negotiations ? #hungparliament #GE2017 #election
Despite UK election shock, reaction across global currency markets is falling well short of #Brexit day. Pound now down only 2%. 
Tories called1 - Scottish independence2 - #Brexit vote3 - #GE2017Which party is causing the instability?#BBCelection#GeneralElection
The secret to Labour's #GE2017 success? Winning seats that voted strongly for #Brexit
Theresa May gambled our #Brexit and lost. Disaster.
I reckon @nick_clegg should offer to negotiate #Brexit on the side of the EU. He's the best negotiator we had, and voters couldn't see it.
Accepting the #EURef result does NOT mean #Brexit is either desirable or inevitable. If leaving's not in the national interest, #Remain.
318 Tory MPs (likely) + 10 DUP = likely governing arrangement. Not great for Britain or #Brexit but it's basis for passing legislation
The good news - as far as I can tell - is that no dedicated #Brexit MP who re-stood has lost their seat. #ge2017results
WAS THIS ALL A SET UP TO KILL #BREXIT????? I say yes. 
The British public has swung from #Brexit anti open-borders to endorsing #Corbyn who calls Islamic terrorists Hamas & Hizbollah his friends
UK's #Brexit & US's election of Trump are two sides of the same coin. Except UK could respond 4 months later-- We must wait 2 years #GE2017
No, June has seen the end of May. All her authority in Tory party has gone. And we need someone with emotional intel to lead #Brexit negs 
#GE2017 Looks like Britain will have a weak govt and a weaker hand at #Brexit negotiations. Terrible miscalculation by May & the Tories.
OK, so #Brexit...how strong do we think our negotiating position is now?The Tories should never get elected again.
"Theresa May's election loss attributed to #Brexit and her support of Donald Trump" #TrumpRussia #FlipThe6th #gapol 
A hard #Brexit may be off the table as #GE2017 results don't pan out as the Tories had hoped 
BBC confirm: Corbyn played #Brexit exactly right. Dugdale must resign #GE17 
The man who was set to take over #Brexit negotiations from David Davis has lost his seat #GE2017
Clegg defeated. Now maybe he will stop lecturing electorate about their stupidity on #Brexit or will he call for a 2nd vote #GE2017
Nigel Farage suggests 2nd EU referendum now a possibility. Says would be  forced to return to politics if hard #Brexit threatened #GE2017
Osborne: We are seeing the "revenge of the young". A reminder of the demographics on #Brexit. 
3/ Be careful what you wish for.#Brexit led to the end of UKIP. UKIP, in turn, seriously distorted British nationalism.
This election has restored my faith in the people of this country following the disappointment of #Brexit
Brussels already stated that if there is a new PM, they are prepared to delay start of #Brexit negotiations#ge2017
Andrew Marr is now discussing how a Labour/SNP government might hold #Brexit talks.
I'd say London is a bit angry about the that whole #brexit thingy
Really disappointing if @nick_clegg loses his seat since been such a coherent voice on #Brexit. Ditto @Anna_Soubry
This was a #Brexit election. Even #NigelFarage says so.:"Brexit doesn't look good "#ElectionDay2017@TheNewEuropean
The key thing about this election. Hard #Brexit has been rejected. That is good news for everyone in this country
May is paying the price for ignoring the 48% when she kep telling the world she had the mandate of the people. #Brexit #ElectionDay2017
Always remember this. 17.4 million people voted #Brexit and if it's not delivered there will be riots. Guaranteed
Globalists pushed ISIS to attack soft targets in UK.#BrExit talks in 11 days.PM May gets blame>hung parliament.
#GE2017 #Brexit 1) Q to be asked repeatedlyTory Gov-Why did you trigger A50 with tight 2 year limit THEN call a GE to waste more time?
The young were betrayed by the #Brexit vote and now they hit back by voting for #Corbyn. Good for them!
If no party has clear majority, start of face to face negotiations with EU (planned for 19 June) may have to be pushed back #GE2017 #Brexit
Is Hard Brexit, is Brexit, being stopped in its tracks... The people have voted on @theresa_may's #Brexit mandate poll, and it ain't pretty
Boris Johnson's dad just said, "it's the revenge of the Remainers." #brexit
So refreshing to hear @KenClarkeMP: frank,sensible stuff. #Brexit: "I hope we never hold referendums on anything again" #GE2017 #BBCelection

Yuk! #Osborne suggesting problem for May was turning to UKIP-types. Sneering attempt to delegitimise #Brexit - oh well, back to BBC #GE2017
I'll be happy to see the Brits #GeneralElection17 punish the party that pushed #Brexit
Theresa May outmanoeuvred by her own aides. Next, #Brexit negotiations. 
Some people just don't have it.Theresa May's poor campaign sure wasted a strong winning hand.We CANNOT afford such poor #Brexit choices! 
Young people realised after #Brexit their vote is important and wasn't going to let it go to waste during this #GE2017
Hey, Daily Mail! #Saboteurs pretty effective, aren't they? Thanks for inventing our movement. We love it. May threatened. Next stop #brexit

There never was a majority for #Brexit. The truth is, no matter what the outcome of this election, Brexit can & must be stopped or reversed. 
Exit poll = EU #Brexit Taskforce take all their annual leave this month, while UK spends time sorting itself out #GE2017
Oh. Katya Adler. EU didn’t care what May’s majority was. And the EU didn’t trust May anyway. #brexit #GE17

If it's not a Tory landslide, and it looks like it's not a Tory landslide, May's gone, and #Brexit isn't a done deal. Massive#BBCelection
May's arrogance & failed leadership over Muslim immigration & terrorism cost the greater #Brexit movement dearly. That's truth to power.
If confirmed UKIP getting 0 seats , UK is leaving europe following an old propaganda of a dead party. #UKelections #brexit
Meanwhile in Brussels, Donald Tusk lights a massive cigar... #GE2017 #Tories #Brexit #ExitPoll
Our best hope for a soft #Brexit and #Leveson2 and a clean up of our offshore kleptocratic element depends on this #GE2017 result
#GE2017 voters deny #TheresaMay strong mandate for #Brexit negotiations. Voters don't believe May will create UK that works for everyone
UK: Google 'Shy Tory Effect'. It tells you why #May might get a majority tonight. #Brexit #UkElections2017
Yes. That was it. While @theresa_may campaigned on #Brexit she was streets ahead. #GeneralElection2017
If #GE2017 exit poll is right, UK goes into #Brexit negs politically weakened, fragmented. The reverse of May's election calculation.
If this exit poll is right, or even close, there's no chance of #Brexit negotiations starting in just over a week as planned? #GE2017
If exit poll correct EU will wring its hands. Wants #Brexit done + dusted now. Hung parliament means confusion, delay #GE2017

Could @theresa_may have made the second biggest electoral blunder since the #Brexit referendum? Find out @talkSPORT and @talkRADIO from 1am
I love this summary by David Dimbleby on the #ExitPoll#GeneralElection17 #Brexit #brexitshambles
Definite danger to #Brexit process. Definite danger to governability in short term. Union of England and Scotland much safer.
If Exit Poll is correct, weakens rather than strengthens PM's #brexit hand. Euro partners will be pouring an extra glass of red tonight...
The #exit poll, if correct, creates massive uncertainty for markets and #Brexit negotiations. First comments from James Knightley. #GE17

If May does indeed lose her majority, she'll be gone by tomorrow lunchtime. And then we have ANOTHER Tory leadership election. #Brexit

@NicolaSturgeon says 'difficult' Theresa May will struggle with #Brexit talks - by @GuardianAnushka @severincarrell
Bye, bye London! Mein ganz privater #Brexit for today.... 
The only reason we're having this bloody election now is so @theresa_may doesn't have to go to the polls after a shit awful #Brexit deal
Does @Jeremy_Hunt still strongly believe in a 2nd referendum on #Brexit or a general election to vote on the deal? 
#Labour's Secretary of State for #Brexit: Sir Keir Starmer KCB QCHuman rights lawyer & former DPP & head of the CPS
No one can get #Brexit "right".  This is a false prospectus from a leader of proven incompetence ,as demonstrated every day of this election 
"Strong and stable" or "Liar, Liar"? #May claims that public supports #Tory #Brexit. Evidence shows this is false: 
1) Thread - #Brexit and PatriotismOne major theme from Brexit was the “patriotism” of the Brexiteers.  They “believed in Britain” 
How is it possible that May still doesn't understand there is no such thing as a #Brexit that benefits us all?
Dear Theresa, tx for yr letter. The printable part of my answer is printed in tomorrow's @guardiancif .TGA #brexit #Maybot #election2017

Who will negotiate #Brexit:LAB: Sir Keir Starmer QC - Leading lawyer of generation.CON: David Davis - Thinks 'No Deal' is decent option.
You're haemorrhaging doctors @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn. #brexit racism and bigotry is what is making people leave - not party politics. 
God Bless Paul Nuttall ... If UKIP voters listen to him he might just have saved this election.#Brexiteers #Brexit #GE2017

Not directly #Brexit related, but the devalued pound has put a second Tim Peake space mission in jeopardy.
So sad to see Theresa May desperately trying to turn the media's attention to #Brexit as Corbyn is now seen as better choice on security.
The way EU leaders see the UK and #Brexit is like if one of your friends sells their house and moves away to join a cult.

If you're that worried about how @jeremycorbyn can negotiate #Brexit why did your party call a snap election you absolute buffoon?
Much bigger issue is #brexit which as you know @RuthDavidsonMSP was rejected by 72% in Edinburgh. Why do you ignore your constituents?
We have got to overthrow the deeply sick 'elite' #EU.For sanity, for our future, for our culture.For our lives.#Brexit #Trump

In 1954 the idea was to have a European Defence Community, but FR voted no. After #Brexit,Trump, Putin time has come!
The majority of MPs in the parliament just dissolved were Remainers. How badly they've let the country down. But #Brexit can be beaten. 
We've got a PM who thought #Brexit would be a disaster selling it as a huge opportunity to people who won't tolerate being worse off #yikes

Heart leapt with joy when No1 son said he is voting #LibDem. For the policies, for Europe. Against #Brexit. Clearly did something right.
It cannot be overstated or repeated enough that the #Tory party & its #Brexit plan of walking away from the EU are fully aligned with #Trump
'It’s no good boasting about being a "bloody difficult" woman unless we know what May intends to be bloody difficult about, & why.' #Brexit

The Tories insist no deal is better than a bad deal - but this is nonsense . Labour will put our economy 1st in #Brexit negotiations - RLB.
David Davis and T May have both now said that the SNP have been a pain in the arse over #brexit. What better endorsement to vote @SNP ?

Here are the signs that #Brexit is starting to hurt the #British economy :
Talking about #BREXIT consequences a week prior to #GE2017.Not the easiest of tasks, but looking forward to discussions with @alzscot
Despite concerns around #Brexit, @JeremyCorbyn and the gov's attack on BTL, @LendInvest has just had it's best month ever lending over £50m.
Wow DUP followed the lead of Tories on #Brexit now following the lead of Theresa  May on TV debates. 
Martin Wolf in stellar form on why it's absurd to claim UK could #Brexit without a deal  Trade would grind to a halt
I've just realised there is something more catastrophic than #Brexit, May's election campaign!
May’s failure to condemn Trump shows weak and isolated #Brexit UK. Scared to speak out and lose trade deal crumbs 
#May refuses to sign a joint declaration with Germany, France and Italy. #Brexit cuts us off from our closest allies. #ParisAgreement

#Brexit is monumentally stupid. A change of government is perfect excuse to #stopbrexit and halt the economic down slide. #tactical2017
This is the Europe of dignity, peace and responsibility from which #Brexit would cast us to the #ClimateChange denial of trumped up despots.
David Davis is showing that the @Conservatives negotiating a #Brexit deal would be utterly disastrous & chaotic for the UK. #bbcqt
David Davis brands our Scottish government 'troublesome' for trying to do the best for Scotland re #brexit. Surely reason to #Votesnp #bbcqt
What's saddening/maddening is that the arguments over #Brexit now are the very ones we should have been hearing before the EU vote. #bbcqt
So Barry Gardiner is basically saying we will stay in EU on the EU terms. No #brexit from #labour it seems #bbcqt
Cat's out of Corbyn's bag: Gardiner basically saying we should stay in the EU #Brexit #bbcqt
It is absolutely clear listening to Barry Gardiner Labour do not support #Brexit. They are only doing so for 'political reasons'.#bbcqt
#BBCQT May's suggestion of #brexit without a deal is dangerous :
I'm partying like #brexit

#Corbyn just backed single market access as part of Brexit , which isn't #Brexit , and would come with enforced free movement#GE2017
Corbyn blowing hot air on #Brexit. Promises no Free Movement and tariff-free EU trade, but rules out "no deal". What if that's not on offer?
May's #Brexit pitch. We can have a strong ec AND cut immigration to sub 100k. It's simply not true, why won't she be straight about it

I'm really disappointed to see Theresa May out campaigning today. When she ought to be at home, thinking about #brexit

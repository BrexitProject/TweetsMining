Your advice on EU isn't wanted, IDS tells Obama  #brexit
This EU referendum must settle it once and for all. (My @CapX weekly newsletter)
#bbcaq Referendum should never have been called. Utter stupidity. The press has amplified EU failings & uneducated people believe it #bbcaq
Farage dismisses Obama's warnings, pointing out that he will not be in office for any post-referendum trade deals.
The British public are not easily led by propaganda and half-hearted speeches. Obama will have no effect on the referendum so go home now!

Someone's been reading that book again. #Brexit #EUref
Whether #Brexit succeeds or not, Cameron's legacy is assured as a traitor. Why are Tory backbenchers not in open revolt at his duplicity?
The EU referendum should accurately reflect the views and needs of the British people.
Shame on Nigel Farage & Boris Johnson for attacking Barack Obama's Kenyan heritage! Racism out of the referendum! #EUref
Dear BrexitRemember the post war Marshall Plan that you paid off in 2006?Short memories my special friendUSA

Scenes from President Obama's UK tour: a blast against Brexit
According to my time line, #PresidentObama has encouraged #Brexit even more. People are furious with him for interfering in UK politics.
.@BarackObama's message to Britain's voters: say no to a #Brexit
Somethings in life are just not right & the #EU is one of them#EUReferendum #LeaveEU #VoteLeave #Brexit #remain
Obama's warnings re Brexit might carry slightly more weight if he showed the slightest understanding of what EU is or why folk want to leave
Well done @nsoamesmp in nailing Boris #Brexit. Let's remind ourselves of what #Churchill said in '42. #EUref
If we leave Europe do we get our Opal Fruits and Marathon back? #Brexit
@adamclarkitv Just waiting for bounce back! #Brexit for me now, I was sitting on the fence but Obama just knocked it down. #BackOfTheQueue
If the EU was such a great thing its advocates would have reasonable arguments instead of threats and scare stories #Brexit #ObamaInUK
Obama is in the #UK today lecturing the Brits. Simply said, it’s wrong for a #POTUS to inject himself into a debate like #Brexit.
Barack Obama says Britain will go to the 'back of the queue' after Brexit. Which is fine, because we love queuing. #ObamaInUK
If any Brits would like to celebrate with us when this limp-wrist leaves office, you're more than welcome!! #Brexit
That the Leave campaign are prepared to place the race card against Obama tells u all u need to know about them #Brexit
'BREXIT' STRATEGY: Obama defends advice to UK on EU vote |
Isn't it sad to see a British Prime Minister reduced to enlisting the help of foreign politicians to mislead the British people #? #Brexit
David Cameron looks pretty desperate having to wheel out a failed US president who will be out of office in 8 months. #Brexit
I don't particularly care what Obama has to say about #brexit but he should lift the US ban on Welsh lamb and beef before going home
Barack Obama: Brexit would put UK back of the queue for trade talks. Says the worst President ever.

I bet all those Mexicans are really looking forward to that political union and open borders with the US that Obama clearly endorses #Brexit
There is no queue (line) of trade deals with the US: EU has WTO rules deal & Brexit UK entitled to same immediately
More than 34,000 Brits have signed a petition calling for Obama to be banned from speaking about the Brexit issue:
US soldiers died for freedom in Europe. But @potus now betrays them siding with the antidemocratic imperialist EU. Shame on the USA #Brexit
Hmmm...it's a difficult one...#EUreferendum#Brexit
Maybe 'Leave' could chisel the outline of six post-Brexit trade deals on an 8ft limestone tablet?
Obama’s 'Part-Kenyan'. Foreigners 'bear grudges'. It’s the happy world of Brexit.
OK, I'm partisan; but this hasn't been a distinguished day for arguments from the Brexit camp.
Obama isn't worried about what happens to the UK if we leave the EU. We'll be just fine. He's worried about what happens to the EU. #Brexit
Obama warns Britain will be "at the back of the queue" for a trade deal with US if it votes for Brexit #ObamainUK
Pres Obama is entitled to give his opinion on #Brexit but he speaks for US interests not Britain's. That threat was the BIG giveaway.
Obama's intervention highlights what our EU Referendum is all about: not being told what to do by people we never elected and can't remove!
Greatly hoping that Boris Johnson's "Kenyan heritage" comments end the chances of both the Brexit campaign and BoJo's own political future.
The United States of America would never accept being part of a federal coalition of independent States .... #@POTUS #Brexit
Brexit would leave UK 'at back of queue' for U.S. trade deal: Obama

@JuliaHB1 @SkyNews If I wasn't voting Brexit before I definitely am now the UK and the British people have just been blackmailed by Obama
Is President #Obama really a friend of the UK?#ObamaInUK #Brexit
For those of you who keep asking me how I intend to vote in the European Referendum. I have just written this.
Barack Obama: Brexit would put UK back of the queue for trade talks
#ObamaInUK punctured the #brexit campaign's repeated claims that we could #LeaveEU and get a good deal with USA
@David_Cameron @BarackObama Suspect rest of country not seeing it the same way. All this patronising driving us to vote out #brexit
#BREXIT: Boris confirms that leaving the EU will give Britain 'the power it needs to ban half-Kenyan hate preachers from coming to the UK.'
Obama: I'm your friend. I'm not threatening you. No trade deal any time soon, we're too busy. Tell him to F off by voting #Brexit
Boris Johnson fails to convince that his Brexit campaign is about more than xenophobiaHis comments today say it all
Time to end the "Special Relationship" and refocus on The British Commonwealth#Brexit #ObamaInUK
Obama warning that Britain wd be "at  back of the queue" feels like potential killer blow in Brexit battle
Empty warning from Obama on supposed threat to US/UK trade deal post-Brexit: he won't be there.
Obama tells us if BREXIT no TTIP well thank goodness for that and isn't it a threat No friend to Britain
#ObamaInUK RT to tell @POTUS Don’t smash #NHS with #TTIP if you want to avoid #Brexit in #EUref@EU_TTIP_team
Believing the UK will have power after #Brexit is the geopolitical equivalent of your gran at a wedding insisting she can still break dance.
Obama goes for broke against Brexit: unequivocal statement in favour of Remain and swipes Boris on Churchill ("I love that guy")
'Brexit will send UK to the back of the queue for US trade.' Obama.Take your Disney, McDonald's, Coca-Cola shit-mountain and shove it. x
We're supposed to be a sovereign state. Obama went way beyond what is acceptable from a foreign leader. #ObamaInUK #Brexit@BBCNews @POTUS
US -and the world-will now officially look at #Brexit as cuckooCam slamdunked thisHis work is done#PresidentObama
Barack Obama: Brexit would put UK back of the queue for trade talks
EU referendum could be over by the time this presser ends
US is terrified that an EU after #Brexit might be less a vassal state & lapdog than before, hence Obama's tour to instruct Brits how to vote
Nigel Farage dismisses President Obama's 'back of the queue' Brexit comments
Obama's views on security & Brexit "diametrically opposite to the reality". My comments to BBC.  @VeteransBritain
The Brits are a strong people who do not take kindly to intimidation or veiled threats. These days will boost support for Brexit. #VoteLeave
Obama backing Britain in Europe in summary: disastrous, catastrophic, ruinous, cataclysmic for the Brexit mob
Obama saying no TTIP for UK if we Brexit. I do hope Labour supporters think that one through.
Leavers asked for this. Spent years loudly assuming US interest in a trade deal post-Brexit. Turns out the US has a say in the matter.
This is most significant presidential intervention in a UK campaign I can recall. Obama states obvious -but obvious is devastating re Brexit
"I've not come here to fix any votes" insists Obama, but you can stick your trade up your British asses if you Brexit. One must be untrue.
President Obama won't be in office by the time we're out of the EU post-referendum. Trade deal of course in both countries interests.
Obama says UK will be "at the back of the queue" of future US trade deals with Brexit. Wow!! Hold on though. We don't have a trade deal now
There hasn't been a UK/US trade deal for 43 yrs cos EU hasn't negotiated oneAfter #Brexit UK can negotiate one.
#PresidentObama:"No man is an island.Even an island as beautiful as this"If #Brexit:"UK will be in back of the queue"And that's a wrap.
Now Obama plays the Nato card. Machine gunning Brexit
Obama says post-Brexit UK would be at the back of the queue for a trade deal with the US. Big stuff.
#POTUS:"All kinds of folks have said what US will do.You might want to hear from ME:UK will be in back of the  queue"Like I said.#Brexit
Great day for #Remain. Boris Johnson and Farage have demonstrated the ugly nature both of themselves and the xenophobic #Brexit campaign.
Significant intervention. Obama quashes Brexit campaigners hopes of a trade deal with US to replace single market
Barack Obama: a US-UK trade deal in the event of Brexit is "not going to happen any time soon" #StrongerIn
Obama on #Brexit: "I'm not coming here to fix any votes," I'm offering my opinion
Obama just knifed Leave campaign front, back & sideways over any post-Brexit US/UK trade deal.
Obama: Leave Campaigners are talking about what the US would do in the event of Brexit; I thought you'd like to hear from the President.
Wow. Obama says a UK-USA trade deal isn't going to be any time soon, in event of Brexit vote.
Obama on UK/EU referendum: "I'm not casting any votes, I'm offering my opinion ... you shouldn't be afraid to hear an argument being made"
Reporter asks Obama if he should just keep his opinions about UK #brexit to himself
Should Obama have a say on #Brexit? His speech LIVE now #ObamaInUK  @POTUS
Potus right to weigh in against #Brexit; US has legitimate interest in UK staying in Europe & not add to its further weakening/unraveling
Boris is failing to prove his Brexit campaign is about anything more than xenophobia
"Is Brexit in America’s interest? With smart policies, the answer to that question is yes."
After recent referendum-approved ban on marriage equality, #Slovenia parliament legalizes same-sex partnerships in 54-to-15 vote
83% of people polled in the UK by IpsosMORI say that Obama's view on the EU Referendum will not be 'very' or 'at all' important to them.
Boris Johnson is failing to convince us that his Brexit campaign is about more than xenophobia says @nashriggins
Still unsure what #Brexit is (or why it matters to the U.S.)? Don't miss @NileGardiner in @CapX
The Brexit debate takes a backseat as the Obamas lunch with Queen Elizabeth
Now on my way to Belford to discuss the EU referendum at a public meeting. Looking forward to what should be an interesting + lively event!
I wonder if the Queen thinks voters should "think very carefully about the future" before they vote in the EU Referendum?

Of all the many despicable falsities peddled by the Remain side, Michael Fallon's claim that ISIS supports Brexit is the worst. Shame on him

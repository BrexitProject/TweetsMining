My partner and her niece who's visiting were out shopping this afternoon. They're speaking Polish and some guy walks past "fucking Polish scum". If I was there I probably would have hit him. Anyone who thinks #Brexit  hasn't made the UK more racist isn't paying attention.
#Brexit ferry contract revealed 
I wonder which #tory has a friend or shares in #Seabornefreight to give them £14m to transport freight after #brexit when they don’t even have a boat?
EU citizens and their families will need to apply to the EU Settlement Scheme to continue living in the UK after 31 December 2020. Find out more:  #Brexit 
Let me get this straight, I was born in Scotland near 28 years ago, to Scottish parents, but an Italian person, for example, who's worked and had a family and life here longer than I've been alive has to apply and pay to hopefully keep their right to stay?Fuck off#Brexit
Parris: "the public, for a while, have been wrong about many great issues: hanging, flogging, the imprisonment of homosexuals... Politics negotiates with popular opinion: it doesn't just take dictation." The Times.#Brexit#PeoplesVote
Whether you are pro #brexit or not, the failure of the politicians to implement the will of the people is concerning. It sets a disturbing president where the vote is only adhered to when the ruling class deem it agreeable to them. You are witnessing the demise of democracy.
Probably the best succinct article on the underlying rationale for #Brexit that I’ve read all year. 
Following extensive due diligence, to help cope with a No Deal #Brexit, the Govt are appointing Postman Pat to provide extra international postal services, the Fat Controller to run supplementary trains and Popeye to boost food supplies.
Just so I've got this right... the UK is VOLUNTARILY putting up BARRIERS TO TRADE with 35 of the wealthiest, least corrupt and most democratic nations on the planet.In order to get worse deals..... with the poorer, more corrupt and less democratic nations??!WTF?!!#Brexit
Jean-Claude Juncker has called on the UK to "get your act together" on #Brexit 
Imagine a German writer pining for the days when they "governed" most of Europe "within living memory" and getting that printed in a major German newspaper. The UK has a long period of moral rehabilitation to undergo if these are the attitudes that prevail there #brexit 
If anybody believes that I will forgive a single Brexit voter for making me apply to continue living in my own home (of 30 years) with my own husband and kids, they must be deluded even  beyond the  average. This is war. #Brexit

#Brexit baloney in all its jingoistic pomp. #SundayTimes conveniently forgets we were “the sick man of Europe” before joining #EU & it was a British PM (Thatcher) who championed #SingleMarket making us 5th largest economy. Now 6th & we haven’t even left
Chief Economist of Germany's biggest bank on #Brexit: “The UK economy has it in its genes to do well, to be innovative, it doesn’t have this bureaucratic construct that the Europeans struggle with and it’s got flexible exchange rates!” 
Recently, @jeremycorbyn came out saying that if he won a snap General Election he'd carry on with #Brexit - This triggered a backlash against @UKLabour with numerous members resigning.As a result, #Corbyn supporters are hitting back against #FBPE.Why? We are the majoriry now.
What is #Brexit? It's the self-mutilation of a nation based on an outdated superpower nostalgia; fantasies of national autonomy in a globalised world. What we are witnessing is a baseless political artifice and the exportation of toxic provincialism. #FBPE
As the government starts forcing EU residents in UK to apply to register and pay to Remain, it’s worth recalling the lies that were told by #brexit campaigners: 
Not only nonsense, but deeply worrying nonsense - #Brexit as the means to indulge Tory yearning for backward looking, quasi colonial military adventurism....

The No Deal #Brexit fans on the Tory hard Right like like Rees-Mogg, Redwood etc say No Deal will be great. Britain can be free to have an aggressive trading economy like Singapore or Hong Kong. Here's the truth of what means..

Love her or loath her, Margaret Thatcher wouldn't have have put up with all this #Brexit bollocks.
The gov must adhere to transparent tendering, under exceptional circs this can be wavered.But justification pt2 states lead times to source ferry capacity as a reason for urgency. They have therefore awarded the contract to a company with no ships  #Seabornefreight #Brexit 
Cycling along an nondescript boreen/road between Co. Armagh and Co. Monaghan this morning forcefully brought home the problem of a hard border to me. One pony is in the EU, the other in the UK. A drain running underneath the road is the border!#Brexit

As I have said many times I will support politicians who are against #brexit, no matter their political colour.   There is no version of #brexit that is good for the country.  It is utterly destructive to all that we have worked for all our lives. Inexcusable. #FBPE #PeoplesVote

In fairness, John has given an inordinate amount in time and effort, but just encouraging the retreat of the UK into isolationism in pursuit of a lofty superpower nostalgia and the rejection of cultural pluralism #Brexit #FBPE
Two centuries of tolerance. A refuge for European exiles and migrants. An internationalist outwardness. A reputation for pragmatism, evidence-based thought and a stickler for the rule of law.These were all things that made Britain seem exceptional. All destroyed by #Brexit 
The civil service is ready for a No Deal #Brexit.  So certain ministers please stop scaremongering. And, of course, trade with the EU will continue after a No Deal #Brexit much as it does now.  It's in the EU's interests. 
Let’s clear up these questions about the #EUreferendum. Is #Brexit the 'decision' of the British people? Or was the #EU referendum advisory only? If so, who made the decision for Britain to #Leave the #EU? Share @Jon_Danzig’s report. Link: 
Charging people to check their residency status is provocative and unnecessary. It’s being done deliberately to cause bad feeling and discredit #Brexit. They want to make it as ugly as possible.

Juncker’s two key replies on #brexit in his weekend interview. It’s all about the choices. Still. Note 1) impatience: EU cannot shield U.K. from its choices. And note 2) warning against expecting EU to deliver fixes...as May prepares to seek them. 
Non-existent drones, invasion by half-drowned folk in a rubber boat - what other ploys (crises) will the Tories think up to try and distract us from the total cock-up that is #Brexit over the next two or three weeks. #BewareToryLies Don't be fooled.
As we finish the year, 3.5 million of our fellow citizens are being asked to pay in order to stay? This is the appalling nature of a Tory #Brexit. This is the appalling nature of a #tory government whose monstrous creation this is.

It's flipping Brexit!  #Brexit 
For years, Tories told us there was "no money", & that's why we had to endure "austerity". But now Tories are spending millions preparing for a #Brexit that, by their own admission, will leave UK citizens even poorer. Apparently this is "patriotic".

The #Brexit referendum was a violation of human rights. The three most affected groups were denied the vote when inclusion of any two of those groups would almost certainly have reversed the result. A gerrymandered & unjust referendum.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
At risk of breaking the B-word embargo. Santa sent me the best of AA Gill. His early June 2016 essay on Brexit starts with a predictable if sharp assault on the nostalgia trip, but then this on the central fallacy of #Brexit which v prescient. 
Simple Question:Q: Why do the #FBPE only attack Jeremy Corbyn and never the Tories over #Brexit Why do they personally attack Jeremy Corbyn and never the Labour party members?A: Because the Red & Blue Tories in the form of the #FBPE trolls, want a hard Tory Brexit & no blame.
If I was dared to jump blindfolded over a wall with 3ft drop the other side into feathers I might. If my blindfold was removed & I saw a 30ft drop into rocks I would change my mind #Brexit always was a blind leap of faith because nobody, not even MPs knew what out was #RevokeA50
More people voted for remaining in the EU than have ever voted for any political party.More people went on the last #Brexit march than the membership of any political party in Europe.Just think what a political party could do with that backing.#PeoplesVote#FinalSayForAll
At this point, the only acceptable political position on #Brexit is to revoke #Article50 and conduct a full inquiry into the criminal activity and perversion of our democracy. We need a #BrexitInquiry, so do your thing and get the hashtag trending. Crime shouldn't pay.
I can understand those people irritate the Labour left but when you’re threatening to cross the #Brexit road to stand alongside Tommy Robinson, Nigel Farage, Jacob Rees Mogg and Julia Hartley Brewer, I wonder what sort of socialists they are. 
I'm left wing and the only thing I hate more than the EDL, BNP and Mogg are Lexiters, projecting 1960s politics into the 21st Century and being the useful tool of proto fascists.   Content for the poor and  vulnerable to be sacrificed on their altar of puritantanism. #Brexit

A view on #Brexit from a #Fowey bookshop?
‘Speaking other #languages and working with other cultures is a global fact and, post-#Brexit, Britain will need to work with countries all over the world more than ever.’ @gorrara67 on Britain’s linguaphobia  @ConversationUK
So there are some upsides to fucking #Brexit then. 
The #JC4PM lot are perfectly entitled to back #Brexit but I’m going to conclude it’s purely because #Corbyn does & not for any principled, sincere reason It’s also absurd to claim to oppose austerity & support social justice yet disregard what Brexit will do to the economy
You think she’s gullible? That’s nothing. I still believe in #Brexit. 
If you do one thing this #BoxingDay sign this #brexit petition: Leave the EU without a deal in March 2019. Let’s get it over 500,000#StandUp4Brexit
People say ‘pooling sovereignty’ is a great thing. Try telling that the 10,000s of British workers who have lost their jobs to #EU grants and relocation schemes.And guess where that grant money comes from? The UK taxpayer - paying to make our own citizens redundant #brexit 
If we had proportional representation, we might never have had the conditions that led to #Brexit. It is precisely because a few swing voters in a few swing seats are the only voices that matter a majority can be simply ignored and marginalised. Thoughts.
Corbyn doesn’t decide party policy.Membership does.At conference.Then it becomes party policy.Including policy on #BREXIT So..Corbyn..doesn’t..decide..Brexit..policy...Corbyn isn’t your man Don’t be as daft as ‘Rolling in it’ Rowling Be @jeremycorbyn savvy.
It looks like there has been a surge in support for the @LibDems and a #PeoplesVote on Twitter over the Christmas period.People are sick of #Brexit yet Corbyn parrots May's UKIP agenda.Support the real opposition...
#Brexit is a political choice which will utterly fail our country. 
The 2016 referendum was marred by crime, data breaches & Russian interference. As far as I understand, it would have been voided had it been mandatory. Instead it was advisory & the fact that the government treats it as mandatory doesn't count.A travesty of democracy.#Brexit
My father in law voted #Leave in 2016. He's retired and working class and lives in a staunch leave area. He's just told me over Christmas dinner that he wants another referendum and he's a #RemainerNow"We didn't know what we voted for in 2016. We now know the facts"#Brexit

Happy Christmas to all my #FBPE tweeters and friends.It's been another tough year, fingers crossed for a great 2019.Thanks to everyone who is fighting against #Brexit and making me realise it's not a worthless cause.Have a great one all.#ChristmasEve
Don't let #Brexit ruin Christmas. Demand a #PeoplesVote... it's the #OnlyWayForward. Are these sprouts from Brussels #RevokeA50 #FinalSay 
1/ After 2 days at festive celebrations with family friends, the  overwhelming mood is "we're sick of Brexit, it's so tedious." I follow the developments with great interest but am very aware of most people's #Brexit fatigue. Unironically I was wearing my "Apathy Kills" hoodie
I hope Santa brings you everything you want. Except #Brexit. Even Santa couldn't deliver that.
"With Independence we can be rid of this Westminster dismay" #brexit  SNP Christmas message and springboard to 2019!! #IndyRef2
A mere 30,000 views short of HALF A MILLION. @omid9 with THE funniest take on #BREXIT EVER. Watch it. Share it. Remember it was always advisory and non binding. You always had sovereignty and control over your borders and laws. They lied. Happy Christmas.
I don’t know whether to laugh or cry at the #CorbynCult If parts of the country are seeing their economies shrink by nearly 20% due to #Brexit then how exactly is that going to help to fight austerity & invest in our country? Brexit is a right wing project & must be opposed
#Brexit: After March 29, UK's 73 MEPs will all become redundant. The UK will no longer be represented in the EU Parliament, and get no say in making EU laws – even if it still has to follow some of them.A very sad day.
WATCH: Don't let #Brexit ruin your Christmas.Write to your MP to demand a #PeoplesVote on the Brexit deal. It's the #OnlyWayForward: 
The ultra-priliveged son of a billionaire defending a policy won by cheating, crimes, lies, hate & Russian interference that will benefit only a wealthy elite seeking to cripple the power of democracies to tax and regulate them. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
A sickening pack of lies. A vote that unjustly excluded those most affected, 37% insufficient for a public sector strike, a narrow victory won by a campaign of hate & lies in the tax-dodging #Brexit billionaire press, electoral crime & Russian interference. An abuse of democracy.
Contrary to reports, nothing Jeremy Corbyn has said in the last few days has contradicted the official Labour Party #Brexit policy agreed at this year's conference. It would therefore by apposite if those wanting to remain in the EU aim their ire at Theresa May and the Tories. 
And lo a MESSIAH did come to LEAD the people into the SUNLIT UPLANDS of #BREXIT, and in the PROCESS he did DELIVER a strategic victory to RUSSIAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE #ProudBearChristmas 
#Rothschild panic? Good. Bring back the GOLD STANDARD and this satanic banking family and its #scams such as #debt, central banks (including #FederalReserve) around the world  will be destroyed.   #primagliitaliani #gold #m5s #lega #Italexit #brexit #goldstandard #Salvini #Qanon

Corbyn is not Labour. If Corbyn alienates too many people with his own idiosyncratic brand of politics, then Labour needs to find a new leader, otherwise it will condemn itself to more years of opposition. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
Corbynistas can mock some of us for obsessing over #Brexit but consider the economy shrank by 5% in 2009 yet the govt’s own figures show the economies of some areas could shrink by up to 20% in the worst Brexit scenario - so is Jeremy just going to wave his magic wand or...?
If we allow foreigners with close connections to their own country's dictator, to fund a British political party, wouldn't it be fair to put that country's flag behind the name on the ballot paper, so we know what 'ally' we're voting for? #Brexit is a crime!#StopBrexit pic.twitter.com/JHFziUVPvK

I know it's kinda late to put things on your wishlist, but anyways. #Christmas2018 #MerryChristmas2018 #ChristmasEve #ChristmasEve2018 #Brexit 
Some Brexiters are still frothing and foaming at the mouth because the ECJ affirmed the UK's sovereign right to revoke Article 50. They only want sovereignty when and where it suits them. They are fake patriots and fake democrats.  #PeoplesVote #Brexit
If #Brexit represents the politics of decline, then remain can, and must, stand for the politics of revitalisation. It cannot do that without the full-blooded leadership of the Labour party 
Tyranny, dictatorship or fascism - whatever we call it, there's no doubt that #Brexit and the Tory government have stolen democracy from us. #StopBrexitSaveDemocracy #PeoplesVote #Remain
Merry Xmas to all my friends. A couple of days off then back to stopping #brexit so Wales can have a great 2019 and a more prosperous future
I've waited exactly 2 & a half years since I woke up on 24th June 2016 to the shock of the UK's vote to leave the European UnionAnd in all that time, I am yet to hear of any reason that justifies all we as a country are set to lose from #BrexitTHEREISNOBREXITDIVIDEND 
Just to be clear: Theresa May is effectively saying God supports her #Brexit plan!
Corbyn's given up on EU.He provides as much of a false promise of better times ahead as May. Both are deceiving the Ppl.There's no good #Brexit/#Lexit!The waste time & money will continue for yrs & hamstring politics.#RevokeA50 Stop the Rot #Remain
When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of December 24, 2018 at 04:50PM, £1 buys 1.1125€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote

What would you call the situation when a minority (Remainers) are so loud that there's an impression that "half the country" is against #Brexit? Petition for #NoDealBrexit got more signatures than the one for #PeoplesVote.
If #Corbyn thinks he will win a #GE on a #Brexit ticket he is even more deluded than I thought. Local activists have already contacted me to say they cannot campaign if this is the policy. Who will knock on doors? Who will deliver the leaflets? #CorbynOut
But it's now clear that possibly the biggest fraud has been @UKLabour "Six Tests"! Essentiually nothing more tha a smoke screen for Corbyn and his Putin apologist cabal allowing them to run down clock on #Brexit! We need a Mueller type investigation on Russia's role in #Brexit!

Before we all hibernate in much-needed rest,& to acknowledge all the wisdom, wit, encouragement & inspiration offered on twitter this past year, I'd like to gift an epic thread on #Brexit, @BorderIrish & @BelfastAgmt. Using powerpoint of course. 1/28...

@BoyGeorge and everyone! Merry Christmas! And can we make it #Brexit free. The ONLY #brussels I wanna hear about are on my dinner 
If you believe campaign spending makes no difference on the Ref result, then why would anyone donate to a campaign? Then why would we have campaign spending laws?Deliberately breaking these laws means you engage in undermining democracy. #Brexit is a crime!#StopBrexit

Historians will not believe sheer ignorance of #Brexit supportersFuture scholars will have to try to distinguish between three kinds of ignorance: deliberate unknowing, crass self-delusion and what we can only call pig ignorance.

This country has been divided over #brexit & it’s time to come together for Christmas. We’re all human beings- it doesn’t matter whether you are a strong minded, self determined leaver, or a bed wetting, limp wristed remainer, we all deserve respect.
'Fishermen are NOTHING to May!' Furious skipper launches SCATHING attack on Prime Minister #Brexit #BrexitBetrayal
Earned her money legitimately - pays taxes - a heartwarming rags to riches single mum story.  @JohnClarke1960 you really are a #brexit or #corbyn zealot for claiming @JK_Rowling, is an elitist celebrity £millionaire. Corbyn's #Brexit stance is unrealistic.
I hear @theresa_may has published a letter in the @Daily_Express calling for everyone to pull together over #Brexit. The Daily Express? The crazed fascist hate rag that no Remainer would even wipe their bottom on, let alone read. Surely she can’t even be fooling herself. #FBPE
#Brexit will be the best thing that ever happened to this country!It will free us from the money-grabbing, mafia-style dictators in that failing EU political bloc, who stifle our competitiveness, boss us around,  and hold back our commonwealth & global interaction. @UKLabour
So @jk_rowling is in & batting for the tories.She doesn't want the right's solution to #brexit so she's doing all she can to secure just that whilst blaming everything on Corbyn & Labour!Confused?It's just the neoliberal way; it's what they do.Theresa May's lucky to have her.
JK Rowling, an elitist celebrity £millionaire, mocks Corbyn's #Brexit stance. So what’s new?
Hello @jeremycorbyn If you were pro EU you would now be calling for revoking Article 50 because #Brexit has failed.#RevokeA50
My family is split between Brexiteers and Remainers. Neither side will vote @UKLabour now because neither side trusts Labour following #Corbyn's open attempts to use #Brexit to push for power. General belief is he doesn't care about Europe either way and it's all just about a GE. 
The mental contortions required to believe Daniel Hannan (let alone be him) are breathtaking.Apparently Dan believes Remainers should be “blamed for no deal brexit” but that no deal #Brexit is now also “the best option”...
Interesting how few people in Australia are focussed on #Brexit. Not met anyone who thinks it will diminish Britain’s place in the world.
A cheery thought for my British friends: #Brexit will make your permanent seat on the UN Security Council, which is already hard to justify, look ridiculous.It’s not too late to avoid this pointless act of self-harm.
Reminder of AEP’s piece in @Telegraph on why we should ironically, listen to forecasts of transition period ‘screw jobs’, by ex civil service. 2nd we should know EU will ‘come running’ on No Deal for FTA on in particular, German export weaknesses! #Brexit 
In sum trying for a  GE is simply a device to avoid calling for another referendum because @jeremycorbyn  is a brexiter. He could have called a no confidence motion last week but did not do so because he'd then have to call for another ref and he wants #brexit
Here's a strange one:If @RBS already has a #EuroZone subsidiary in the form of corrupt @UlsterBank, why is it looking for a license in #Germany?#JonathanSugarman#Brexit #Ireland #UK #Deutschland

Merry Christmas to you Mr @jeremycorbyn! Your commitment to #brexit has now ruined my Christmas and ended my membership of the party!! No chance of a Labour Gov in 2019 now mate!! @angelaeagle @meaglemp @Alison_McGovern @MetroMayorSteve
Corbyn looks like a busted flush now he has come out in favour of a disastrous #BrexitHe is a feeble politician. Shamefully he is also tangled up in anti-Semitic politics. I'm backing the @LibDems who offer hope and support a #PeoplesVote
Andrea Leadsom now attempting to intimidate  MPs by claiming they cannot stop no-deal #Brexit if they reject May's deal. But they can by forcing govt to revoke Art. 50 unilaterally. Just more disinformation and deception 
At this moment, 30 months ago to the day, 17,410,742 of us had cast our vote in hope. Here we are 3 months away from the freedom we never dared believe we would regain. The prize is in sight#Brexit
They've stopped showing 'Oliver' on the #BBC at Christmas because it is no longer a musical based on Dickensian conditions, it has become an accurate dystopian prediction of post #Brexit Britain.
Which of the following are the least helpful in persuading people to rethink #Brexit? a) The #FBPEb) The Red Toriesc) The fake Tory rebelsd) The Lib Fibse) The celebrity luvvies f) All Of The Above
Yes, it was great to sing with fellow Europeans and celebrate this festive season with them; many of whom have been greatly upset  by the uncertainty that #brexit brings.  We share many traditions with our European neighbours it was good to reflect on that #scotlandforeurope 
We'll be OK after #Brexit says a country brought to a standstill by a toy helicopter.
Why is nobody talking about a leadership challenge against @jeremycorbyn ?Seems a perfect time to get a more competent leader who will actually oppose this government! This might be the time that his support is at its lowest in the party ranks#Brexit#labour
To all those Labour members and supporters who now understand Corbyn is in favour of #Brexit, it's time to act, as I did in June. I left Corbyn's Labour not because he's too radical but because he isn't radical enough.

Jeremy Corbyn told supporting #Brexit could lose Labour seats:  #PeoplesVote
In light of Corbyn’s admission, that he also wants to destroy the economy by enacting the ruinous Policy of #Brexit it was only fitting, ‘Team Brexit’ put out a joint Christmas Card! 
The government must remain committed to delivering the result of the referendum, which means leaving the EU on 29th March - or the whole credibility of British democracy will be thrown into chaos:   #Brexit

James Dyson should be in charge of #Brexit negotiations.

Repeating my position on #Brexit. I’ve always said it’s not abound ‘should’ UK leave EU, but ‘can’ they. What I’ve seen living there is an incompetent, shambolic clusterf*** and the idea they could pull off a Brexit is risible. It’s a moronopoly of fuckwits. 
"Police say it is 'a possibility there was never a drone'"Britain halts movement, inconveniences everybody, and wastes millions of pounds over fears about something that isn't true. It's all the rage in Britain at the moment. #Brexit #Brexit #Brexit
I don’t understand how anyone can possibly argue that a PM (who lost her majority) deciding the final outcome of #Brexit is democratic but the people deciding is undemocratic as letting the people express their will is somehow defying their will Very confusing#PeoplesVote

Hard-line Remainers reject democracy itself in elitist attempt to subvert #Brexit This so chimes in with the experiences I’ve had with #Remoaners on twitter it’s not true.
I know several people who, like myself, would vote Labour in a General Election if its leadership would oppose #Brexit@peoplesvote_uk #FBPE
Almost all sectors having to sign NDAs. I thought #Brexit was about democracy? Without information we can’t make choices. Without choices there is no democracy. ⁦@theresa_may⁩ has already undermined the rule of law & sovereignty of parliament.

I'm afraid #Brexit won't deliver any of these things that decent people want?Better NHS? NoBetter public services? NoBetter Transport? NoBetter housing? NoSo why does Parliament think the majority or British people want #Brexit? They didn't vote to make things worse! 
Wow, ‘midwife to delivery of Tory Brexit plans’ - that's aptly brutal. The sad truth is that with less than 100 days to go until the #Brexit cliff, Labour is without leadership. This matters to all of us.

British companies in China believe that #Brexit could boost business in the Asian giant according to the British Chambers of Commerce in China.About 2/3rds of respondents said they were optimistic about the business outlook for their industry for the next two years.
You have abandoned us to the horror of this right wing coup called #Brexit. If there's a general election, Labour will take a terrible hammering. We'll all be voting for 3rd parties: Lib Dems, SNP, Greens & Plaid Cymru.
Listening to callers on @LBC it is clear people will never forgive or vote for Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn if he does push ahead with #Brexit or if he does not. So it's all about the numbers Jeremy, and how least buggered you'll end up?
“A managed no deal #Brexit”. Like all the phrases trotted out by the Brexiteers since that fateful EU referendum, it’s just a smokescreen, a massive bluff, a fantasy inside a unicorn, wrapped up in a Union flag. My @ScotNational column.

#Tory remainers are EU extremists. They will do anything to try & stop #Brexit despite standing on a pro Brexit #manifesto. They are going against British people, British #democracy & they need to be sacked. People like Soubry, Gauke, Hammond & Wollaston are enemies of the people
#Brits didn’t vote for half a #Brexit, we didn’t vote to stay in key #EU institutions or keep #EUlaws just to make loser #remainers feel better. Brits voted to fully leave the EU & that is what #MPs must deliver.... whether they like it or not! #StandUp4Brexit @theresa_may
#Brexit and black people. The inevitable recession that will follow will see the raging fires of British racism explode into democratically elected fascism, as the working class betrayed by Brexiteers, begins to look for scapegoats. When the economy declines, racism always rises.
#Corbyn: #Brexit would go ahead even if #Labour won snap election 
Corbyn peddling the myth that Labour would get some new, magical deal from Brussels. He wouldn’t. But it’s increasingly clear that he’s using his leadership to enable #Brexit & avoid a #PeoplesVote - against the wishes of his own party membership.

The answer, as everyone knows, is that they wanted the 4m lab leave votes, and then once in power would simply have ignored ref, ignored manifesto, and Remained. True democrats, one and all. #Brexit 
So @jeremycorbyn is being attacked for sticking to the manifesto that he and all Lab MPs were elected on. Why didn't all these brave MPs and tweeters insist on a manifesto saying 'we don't give a damn about referendums'? Lying is now virtue, honouring commitments a sin. #Brexit
But unless you change your stance on #Brexit you haven’t a hope of winning. I’ve voted Labour all my life but would switch or stay at home.
"Merry Final Christmas". Try to enjoy this year's seasonal TV offerings knowing that they may be your last.  #XmasApocalypse #Brexit
Blogged late last night, so re-posting this morning. Looking at the extreme partisan nature of the #Brexit debate, I conclude that delay and fudge (extend Art 50) are now most likely. As that allows the UK’s party structure to stay intact. 
I can't wait for the #MSM to turn totally against @jeremycorbyn & write hit-piece after hit-piece over #Brexit I just wish they would've done it over his #antisemitism #misogyny his sympathy for terrorist organisations & his hatred of this country & the West in general instead.
We would urge people to support our Founder @thatginamillerstrong letter to @jeremycorbynafter you read his #Brexit stance in this article - letter link is below 
Labour & @jeremycorbyn should tell #Leave voters the truth. #Brexit will hit jobs & living standards. It’s a project of the right recruiting working class voters by lying about the causes of poverty & inequality #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote 
Despite what Centrists say, Jeremy Corbyn is right to say we will still Brexit if Labour win a snap election. We cannot alienate our core vote in the North. He is playing the long game and in a few years, we will realise what a smart game he has played. #Brexit #JC4PM
"206 MPs were elected with lower vote share than the 51.9% of Leave voters" They accept democracy when it elects them...  Essential #Brexit reading: 
The ‘shackles’ from Which Rees-Mogg would free you are your employment rights, equality legislation, welfare provisions and NHS. #Brexit is a con,from which Rees-Mogg will emerge richer and you will emerge poorer. #StopBrexit
Perfect.  #DissolveTheUnion #indyref2 #indyref #yes #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Just remember they want #Corbyn #Labour to commit electoral suicide over #Brexit In fact, that’s the whole point... 
Yes you were, 200 years ago. Now WE'RE all for it being put out of its misery. #Indyref2 #ScotRef #Brexit 
Absolutely truly brilliant from Mike. Thank you for such an honest post. ‘Tonnes of us have had enough now.’Corbyn is NOT labour. Labour backs #remain. So we fight on more united than ever to stop people dying outside Westminster and to stop #Brexit breaking Britain.  
Excellent thread.Jeremy Corbyn tells Guardian that Labour will decriminalise rough sleeping. Guardian ignores and goes with deliberately misleading headline about Labour's #Brexit policy in order to provoke a negative reaction among remainers and more anti-Corbyn headlines. 
One can only pray that Remain Labour members who have finally realised how fraudulent @JeremyCorbyn’s position was on #Brexit realise that his anti-racist, man-of-peace posturing has been equally deceitful: that he has turned his Party into an institutionally antisemitic cesspit.
Mrs May @theresa_may threatens you with a No Deal Brexit, so she and the Tories have to go. Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn threatens you with a delusional vision of an undeliverable utopian #Brexit.What will you choose?
Should labour change policy and back a #PeoplesVote or continue with their soft #brexit compromise? Mainly looking for @UKLabour members' views. Please retweet and share for wider sample size.
The scale of Child poverty in the UK is beyond shameful.  Brexit will make it even worse.  The Tories are responsible and once voted out must never be allowed into power again. #ToriesOut #StopBrexit #Brexit 
George Galloway backs #Brexit. Tommy Robinson backs #Brexit.You can judge Leavers by the company they keep.#PeoplesVote
If Labour backs #Brexit in an election it would come 3rd with 22%. So why does Corbyn take this stance? My view is that on foreign policy, Ukraine, Iran, Venezuela, Syria, NATO, Skripal & #Brexit Corbyn far too often favours the Kremlin.#PeoplesVote
“Students & young people wont forget or forgive politicians who sell them down the river by backing #Brexit that limits life opportunities, makes us poorer,” @jeremycorbyn faces backlash over backing #Brexit @FFSake_ @ChukaUmunna @MaryCreaghMP @Labour4EU
This thread about the impact of #Brexit on a small business is an eyepopper. You must read it. 
It's somehow the perfect, bitterly appropriate end to this skid-mark of a year that despite #Brexit being the result of the Tories being unable to fucking sort out their fratricidal bollocks, the only hope to stop it, appears to be to keep them in power.
Do you want to control your country? Laws, taxes, immigration, freedom of movement etc etc? Then support Brexit so that Britain is not governed by an external force. #Brexit
Jeremy Corbyn faces furious Labour backlash over backing #Brexit -- Labour leader accused of betrayal on second poll and ‘in danger of losing young backers’  /via @guardian
I’ve been thinking about political partisanship in UK and #BrexitThe way forward is the way that doesn’t rely on collaboration across party linesThat, I conclude, leads to  asking  to extend #Article50New blog post:
Not even a Christmas miracle can save the sanctimonious, obsolete and Orwellian BBC:  #Brexit
It seems that some people are already taking advantage of the current uncertainty over #Brexit
The idea that those running the EU are our "partners" is lie. They are our dedicated opponents who wish us nothing but misery.It would be so nice if the May Government woke up and smelled the coffee. #Brexit 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "You lost the referendum. This is a democracy and that one vote is enough."What it said on the ballot paper was “do you want to remain in the EU or do you want to leave the EU?’ It didn’t say ‘do you want a Canada or Norway-style deal.’" #Brexit 
Hard-line Remainers have been willing to push their campaign beyond legitimate politics - by encouraging foreign authorities to resist the policy of the UK and by attempting to delegitimise legal votes:  #Brexit
It should be a criminal offence for any government to remove citizenship rights or threaten to remove rights or otherwise create uncertainty about these rights. #The5Million #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Hi Clive. I'm an Ex @UKLabour member and lifelong Labour voter until 2017. I quit because of #Brexit and will no longer vote Labour so long as Labour supports #BrexitSame goes for other family members.#Brexit isn't Labour.#PeoplesVote #FinalSay #FinalSayForAll #EndTheChaos

Former Chancellor #LordLamont dismisses #ProjectFear claims over a clean  #Brexit: "If you take Mr Azevêdo, the Director-General of the #WorldTradeOrganisation, he has said that a #NoDeal scenario need not cause  disruption."  #StandUp4Brexit #Brexit
Do you know why our politicians don’t want #Brexit? Their EU pension & less work to do! Because the EU does all this hard work for our politicians & YOU pay for it & their wages on top! Lazy politicians is what we've got!
A Government that refuses to reassure the country it runs that this scenario will never happen, but instead deliberately uses fear of it to rally support for its floundering Negotiated Deal, is morally wanting. A shameful exercise in cultivating fear for political gain. #Brexit

THREADThe House of Commons has never been representative of the people’s views on the EEC/EU and that’s why 17.4m voted for #Brexit The latest manifestation of this is the self-imposed gridlock in Parliament with the majority wanting something other than what we voted for /1
OK Teresa, we give in. What's the safe word for #Brexit?
Amazing to think that this will be the third Christmas under the menacing shadow of #Brexit.And there is still no credible explanation as to why we are pursuing this madness. 90 days to go and the future of millions still hangs in the balance. Vandalism unbridled.#RevokeA50
Corbyn & May are what you get when you allow party leaders to be chosen by self-selecting  party memberships composing a tiny fraction of the electorate. Party leaders should be elected by MPs who are elected by a much representative electorate.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #PutinsBrexit

Seriously? We shd disregard what our own Chief medical officer has to say and just stick with the argument that our average punters take knows better? #Brexit is turning some people into worrying article-of-faith truthers
Did you lie about voting remain in the #Brexit referendum Jeremy? 
#Brexit has revealed the deep divisions in both main parties which are irreparably fracturing. Meanwhile the interests of British business are ignored and the aspirations and  values of millions of people lie abandoned. We simply cannot go on like this #NewYearNewBeginnings
I implore the UK intelligence community to confirm to @BBC, or any major paper, that my story is true. We are in a chaotic state when our #Brexit referendum was thrown by Russia. I say this as a LIFE-LONG Leave supporter who is still a Leave supporter. 
Almost no Christmas shoppers in Truro today like @Theresa_May's deal.Some want a no-deal #Brexit. But the big majority prefer our current  EU membership - and overwhelmingly they want a #PeoplesVote.Are you listening, @jeremycorbyn?How about you, @SNewtonUK?#Cornwall
Now we know for sure where Corbyn stands on #Brexit it’s time to decide the next steps. Is it fanciful to think there could be an alliance of MPs from all parties to argue for and achieve a #PeoplesVote? We can’t let tribal politics kill our #Remain movement.
Corbyn must be aware of this poll showing Labour slumping into 3rd place with 22% if it backs #Brexit. This means that not only is Corbyn willing to hurt the poor & vulnerable he's willing to sacrifice Labour on the altar of #PutinsBrexit.#PeoplesVote
#JeremyCorbyn says he would secure a better #Brexit deal if he became PM after a #snapelection. What do you think? RT for a wider sample! #PoliticalLanguage
Dear Brexiters opposed to a #PeoplesVote the 1975 referendum was a vote on whether we shoud Remain in the Common Market which we joined in 1973, so why shouldn't we have another vote in 2019 to determine if we still want Brexit? #Brexit

I’ve voted for @jeremycorbyn twice as leader and fought and campaigned for @UKLabour abour at numerous general elections.I love my Labour MP but I’ll be damned if I’ll campaign for a Labour manifesto offering Brexit at a snap election. Am I alone in thinking this? #Corbyn #Brexit
Too many brilliant lines in this but think this is my favourite:Much of the #Brexit discourse has revolved around people who seem inbred telling us that diversity is bad
This guy is poison, folks. If Labour had a real leader right now, #Brexit would be dead.  
As we have come to expect from @joannaccherry, a first class and informed take down of Jacob Rees-Mogg and his right wing irresponsible and deeply damaging #Brexit project. Well worth a listen. #Remain 
@jeremycorbyn has confirmed Labour policy on #Brexit and it is the same as the @Conservatives. Their version of brexit at the cost of damaging the country.Would you vote for a NEW party at the next GE?Retweet for a larger sample.@RenewPartyAlso 
With the support for a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay #ExitFromBrexit & #Remain shown in these figures. I think we can safely conclude Jeremy Corbyn is pursuing a #Brexit policy for the few and not the many. 
State aid will be needed in buckets as our economy will collapse after a hard #Brexit. Then again WTO rules may prohibit this. Only solution is North Korean hermit model. #Lexit delusions!
It’s Saturday.And despite the fact that Putin has removed all doubt that #Brexit is his wet dream, #Putineers are out in force today oblivious to the truth that they are fulfilling his will. To err is human. To keep on erring is plain weird.#RevokeA50
‘We just need to stay in and reform the #EU’ is a pathetic argument.Blair even gave away a huge chunk of our rebate in return for CAP reform. Did they keep their end of the bargain? No, they stuck two fingers up and took our rebate anyway. #brexit #ManagedNoDeal
Remember this? It was all bollocks. #Brexit 
Great interview with @jeremycorbyn in yesterday's Guardian. He's spot on in respecting democracy and committing to delivering a #Brexit that works for everyone in Britain. Imo a referendum would increase cynicism about politics and facilitate the far right
Sad to read in the Guardian that @jeremycorbyn is as committed to delivering #Brexit as @theresa_mayHe is hiding behind a big lie that the EU will allow a completely fresh set of negotiations.To beat Brexit, back the long term supporters of the #PeoplesVote - the #LibDems
Remember when Theresa May lost the Westminster paedophile dossier? Remember when she was home secretary and started the Child Abuse inquiry? Lord Janner? Leon Brittan? Cyril Smith? Ted Heath? Jimmy Savile? Elm Guest House.  Funny how it's all forgotten. #Brexit
Two people who will today be ecstatic at #Labour leader #Corbyn's comments....1. Jacob Rees Mogg2. Vladimir Putin.#Brexit #CutTheCard #FBPE
If the Tories went into a snap General Election as the only major party supporting #Brexit, they'd win by a landslide. While Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, Plaid Cyrmu and the Greens would be scrapping each other for Remainers, the Tories would have a complete monopoly on Leavers. 
Absolutely right @doctor_oxford doctors should be presenting the truth not spinning a myth that there will be no harm from a cliff edge #Brexit Best way to avoid it would be for Govt to rule out No Deal & hold a #PeoplesVote on deal vs remain
With thanks to MSM for coverage today - here’s what I said about the #Brexit nightmare and how to wake up...  Watch in full on YouTube: Or on Facebook: 
60%?! Don't make me laugh!If your political view is "Remain in the EU at all costs" you could always vote for the Lib Dems. The fact that the Lib Dems are consistently polling around 7% should tell you all you need to know about how unpopular stopping Brexit is. #Brexit

The battlefor #Labour is lost. The battle over stopping #Brexit continues. Join a Remain Party. 
Poll shows that if Labour backed #Brexit at a referendum it would slip to 22% behind the LibDems on 26%. The split of the progressive vote would give the Tories a huge majority. This is what Corbyn supports. 
Has anyone else noticed that as #NoDeal is mentioned more & more as the most likely outcome the mood of the people has become more enthusiastic & upbeat?The British People love a challenge, #Brexit for many will be a challenge as great as discovering a New World. #LoveNoDeal
What a coward #JeremyCorbyn is. Comes out against party policy and for #Brexit just after parliament goes into recess. He's become as despicably untrustworthy as the PM. 
It’s funny how this morning I see on my TL a lot of posts from accounts with more numbers at the end of their handle than followers telling me my story is wrong/rubbish/not true.  And that sums up the corruption of #Brexit

These people who are 'never going to vote' for Corbyn's Labour now he's said he'll incorporate #Brexit if he becomes PM - were you okay with the cod Marxism and the virulent racism?
FRANKIE BOYLE ‘The Labour party somehow managed to achieve a Brexit position more incoherent than a government of opportunists at war with itself. There is definitely something odd about Labour supporting free movement for goods and not, well, labour.’ #Brexit
There are many Labour policies that I'd happily get behind and support, however #Brexit and leaving the #EU is a deal breaker.Both leading political parties are actively delivering the will of the Russian people, ignoring the harsh impact this will have on everyday Brits. Sad.
Labour cannot win a GE with Corbyn as leader. Remainers will not vote for him. If @UKLabour allow #Corbyn to facilitate a Tory #Brexit, they will be out of power for years perhaps forever. I do wonder why #UKLabour bothers with policy decisions at Conference. Car crash interview
Jezza isn't going to stop #Brexit.He knows he can't implement his left wing plans in Government if we are still in the EU. 
Just going to assume that anyone clutching their pearls over Jeremy Corbyn restating a #Brexit policy agreed months ago at Conference is either acting in bad faith or an idiot, as it'll save a lot of time.

Every remainer, every young person and every young adult should note this very well. Voting #Labour is a vote for #Brexit. Corbyn has been against the EU for 35 years, he is desperate for Brexit but Labour trying to trick & con the electorate. Failure of @BBCNews to show this.
Can we just clarify?@UKLabour⁩ policy is to try to get a General Election in which they would stand on a pro-#Brexit manifesto.If they can’t get a General Election they will support a #PeoplesVote enabling us to #StopBrexit. Is anyone else confused?

2019 may well be the year that sees #Brexit cancelled, #Trump impeached, #TommyRobinson behind bars and #Labour in government. 
Young men play too many videogames, which is why banks crashed the global economy in 2008 and also #Brexit Corbyn must resign Learn to code Protectionism!

We now go live to #Brexit. 
Dear Twitter. I think that's me done for 2019 - they've all gone skiing in Brussels, #Brexit falls silent until 2019, except for that faint sound. What is it? Ah, yes, the ticking of a clock.Tick...        ....tock... See you in 2019.

You spent 2018 campaigning 'remain' for a referendum that happened in 2016. You fought and lost the #Brexit debate, can you spend 2019 talking about the future instead of the past?

Across Europe people are revolting against the technocratic elites. From #Brexit voters to the gilets jaunes to Eurosceptic Italian youths, they’re rising up against the old order. This is the beginning of a European Spring.

WATCH: #Brexit has made this year bonkers. The government has lurched from one crisis to another, and we’re still none the wiser what it all means.It is now clearer than ever that the only way forward is a #PeoplesVote.
As an EU member, the UK works closely with partners to monitor and share information on disease outbreaks and response planning. After #Brexit the UK will be excluded from the European Centre for Disease and Control and will no longer be able to influence ECDC decisions 
People are starting to realise the whole #Brexit campaign was the biggest exercise of political spin and outright untruths in our history, designed to persuade people to vote to damage their country. This is not democracy! 
The mental contortions needed to believe this thread let alone write it are truly breathtaking.Apparently we’re against #brexit but out of principle we can’t have a #peoplesvote as we’d definitely lose as Corbyn is such a remainer the media would use the vote to destroy him.
NHS and Social Care both vital areas of domestic policy that have been squeezed out by #Brexit but there was nothing to stop these plans being published so that scrutiny could begin.

Just in case you havent noticed: -Jeremy Hunt & Sajid Javid have both come out pro-No Deal. -PM May is meeting JRM to "mend the wounds". Looks like if u want to be taken seriously as a Tory, Hard #Brexit is still the way to go. And if that's proving tricky, embrace No Deal.
I am rapidly drawing the conclusion that the UK has an inordinately high percentage of Homer Simpsons in its population. #Brexit

I applaud the efforts of #SNP in #Westminster and on a cross-party basis to mitigate the insanity of #Brexit - or even reverse it.But I also recognise that they are consequently operating as a part of the Union and, albeit reluctantly, reinforcing the concept of Union.#indyref2
My @theSNP colleagues @drewhendrySNP & @AlanBrownSNP have repeatedly warned U.K. Govt about this issue but Tories too busy infighting over failed #Brexit project to govern on practical issues like #Drones hence the current mess. Does not bode well for #NoDeal
Why won't Westminster just drop the weasel words and be honest: 'there is no majority in the House for accepting the referendum result'. That's the bottom line. #Brexit
Russell on the radio doesn't want brexit to cause the breakup of the uk as he has family in England and we're 'good neighbours' . None of that would change though. It's what I want - a neighbour not a master of Scotland's destiny. #brexit #Scotland #indyref2
So the Irish won't build hard border, the UK won't, the EU won't, but they are all colluding in a lie that it's such an impossible problem that the biggest vote in British history must be ignored? #Brexit 
One of the very few commentaries on #Brexit that makes any kind of sense.  Because it's not really about Brexit. Thank you ⁦@chakrabortty⁩
Ireland succumbed to a second referendum because its politicians have no backbone. They’re used to taking orders and doffing their cap on the world stage. This #Brexit border nonsense has given them a rare chance to feel important, and they’re milking it.
This recent YouGov poll shows remain now now with an 18% lead.#Brexit is not the will of the people.It’s the will of Putin. 
One of the many things to admire in the group of #SNP MPs, is that they conduct themselves more respectfully in an institution they wish to leave, than many of the ardent defenders of the Union. Same goes for their impeccable role in the Brexit debate.#indyref2 #Brexit

Do the people of Scotland feel we are “Better Together” #brexit
Unbelievable! Hard liner Brexiteer @NadineDorries States this...“The future of the country and of our relationship with Europe is at stake. This deal gives us no voice, no votes, no MEPs, no commissioner.”What on earth does she think #Brexit is then?

You've heard of Norwegian #Brexit , Canadian Brexit but all along it was Russian Brexit. #PeoplesVote
Britain weakening Europe at this time is a shameful disgrace. Will we never learn from history? #FBPE #Theresa_May #Brexit #StopBrexit
The fact "alignment" has become a dirty word in many UK political circles is a terrible reflection of how #Brexit has become all about wordplay - we no longer debate ideas on their merits i.e. where it might make sense, we just reject it outright b/c it has the word EU next to it
The Tory #Brexit proposals do not respect the referendum result and will not get through Parliament. The UK economy is too weak to cope with the shock of leaving with no deal, so that too is not an option.Only #Labour’s Brexit proposals respect the result & minimise the risk.
Sadly, voting @UKLabour now means voting for people who don’t like democracy. Labour #Brexit supporters are now politically homeless. There wasn’t an option on the ballot paper that said “Leave only with a deal,” was there? This man does not respect voters or democracy.  
You may find this map useful for the next time a Brexiter tells you that Ireland would starve without Britain. Ireland's food surplus wd feed 30Mn people and it mostly does that in Britain.#Brexit

The petition in favour of No Deal #Brexit has exploded in popularity, & polls have shown leaving the EU with no deal to be more popular than Remain & May’s deal. This is yet another example of anti-Brexit MPs seeking to frustrate the will of the people. 
Of course Anna Soubry is being protested against. Politicians who try to overthrow democracy will make people angry.The right to protest is essential. The right to let politicians know what you think of them is a key plank of democratic life. #Brexit 
Imagine the imperialist colonialist nuclear armed UK being brought to its knees by a few £50 drone enthusiasts! Remember #Brexit?
Putin commenting on UK democracy is entirely preposterous. He doesn’t permit democratic elections in his own country; he undermines them in other countries. Maybe he just doesn’t want the hassle of having to organize interference in a second #Brexit referendum. @Andrew_Adonis

What a ridiculous statement. How does some idiot with a drone relate to a 'Multi-Deal' #Brexit I recall being stuck in massive queues and hours of delays a number of times at a number of mainland EU airports. 
Looking at the responses on a widely retweeted tweet on #Brexit really exposes you to the astonishing level of misinformation there is in the UK about the EU.This has been a catastrophic failure by the British education system, the British media, and the British politicians.

Our so-called elected politicians are removing UKGov's ability to adequately prepare for a WTO #Brexit.This is an act of self-harm & these MPs should be disciplined, not supported.Eventually these anti-UK efforts must be seen for what they ARE.#Treason.

Who did this?!?!?  #Gatwick #Drone #Brexit 
Hearing @andrew_adonis talking about Parliament coming back early to deal with #Brexit legislation in House of Lords. Must admit what he says is totally right. Firms leaving, still no resolution with 99 days to go and the clock counting down!
The reason the ERG no deal propaganda machine is so successful is because each of their simplistic nostrums and slogans require thousand word technical refutations that their supporters will never read, much less understand. #Brexit
Vladimir Putin has told Theresa May to deliver #Brexit and not to have a 2nd referendum, we are now waiting for Gavin Williamson to tell him to shut up and go away #StopBrexit
“#Brexit threatens massive consequences for the German economy. More than 750,000 jobs in Germany depend on exports to Great Britain" - Dieter Kempf, President of the German Industry Federation Mrs May, that's called leverage. Use it.#ManagedNoDeal
The day after boasting about blowing £4 billion on no deal #Brexit contingency plans the Government slips out, on the last day of term, £85 million cuts to local public health funding which is spent on vital preventative work.

France reciprocates Britain’s guarantee to citizens’ rights after a no-deal #brexit. A welcome and sensible move from our friends, partners, and allies.

A #PeoplesVote is imperative. Read why the latest polls show a shift with the majority rejecting this #Brexit deal: 
Latest super-size UK Brexit poll shows: 1) Commanding lead for staying in EU 2) Leave voters have lost faith in Brexit making life better 3) Labour would suffer badly for facilitating Brexit. In Scotland 71% want to remain in EU! #YouGov #Brexit

So Vladimir Putin has finally spoken out on his support for #Brexit urging Theresa May not to hold a 2nd referendum, it makes me laugh people still think he had nothing to do with Vote Leave in the 1st referendum, #StopBrexit

Watch today's top U.S. and world headlines:  #SyriaWithdrawal #Brexit #BankingWhileBlack
#Brexit Owen Jones & Kevin Maguire worst 2 journalist in . Both backed Labour lost, Hillary Clinton lost, Stay in EU lost. Unbelievable both out defending Jeremy Corbyn today. Saying he didn’t call Theresa May a stupid woman. Only ones in  think he didn’t say it. Shut up  
It just goes to show that the British people have changed their view of #Brexit since June 2016. It would be truly democratic to respect that change of heart by holding a referendum on the Withdrawal Agreement versus Remain 
Mass immigration has proven disastrous for the UK. Our NHS is at breaking point, crime rates have soared, British culture had been eradicated, & everyone is too scared to talk about it in fear of being labelled racist. Help refugees at their point of origin! #brexit
There ye go folks ^ a pharmacist, staff and several customers in a local Boots chemist, all decrying that "#IndyRef is coming" - @NicolaSturgeon @theSNP there's yer proof folk are engaged in discussing a lifeboat away from #Brexit

1. One recurrent feature of modern media is that it is only ever capable of dealing with one story at a time and according to its own priorities and values. The big story, had we a remotely adult media, should have been the Commission's no deal contingency plans.  #Brexit thread.
A must read for those interested in expert views from legal, economic & political commentators on the pros & cons of the options facing U.K. Govt & parliament on #Brexit. Hint - it’s not #deal or #NoDeal we could revoke #Art50 & stay #PeoplesVote

#brexit update: Thank you Private Eye - no one knew what leaving the EU meant in 2016. 
Presenter of @BBCRadio4 #WorldAtOne describing Putin's support of #Brexit as "unexpected". Seriously, wtf is going on?#PeoplesVote
He's correct. Our media are embarrassing at a time of national crisis regarding #Brexit.
This should unite Ugandans more than divide us - must protect our dignity from those who seek to continue influencing narrative, identity of our politics, people. No to #NeoColonialism Let UK Parliament focus on #Brexit #LeaveUsAlone #Uganda
Vladimir Putin congratulates Theresa May for carrying out #Brexit  a key Russian foreign policy success 
At last. It was being laughed at in meetings (has been for a while). Last week saw a senior civil servent go through that pain and it was embarrassing for all there. #Brexit @RHANews How long before we get acknowledgement that we will not be ready by 29 March. @HMRCgovuk
I won’t apologise for the way I spoke to @annasoubrymp, she deserved everything she got, after all this is a woman that’s openly trying to STOP #Brexit. I didn’t hear the left kick off like this when @Jacob_Rees_Mogg was abused in front of his children. Our voices will be heard!
FYI, I'm leaving the post of @iealondon Chief Economist to spend more time with family and take on some new professional challenges. But I will continue to support the great work of the #IEA as an independent free-market economist, and will have plenty more to say on #Brexit...

It’s 99 days until #Brexit & MPs are taking Parliamentary leave for 17 days. This is a disgrace. We’re in the midst of a national crisis, which could result in a recession that will cost lives & livelihoods. This should be seen as a national emergency & leave should be cancelled
Important milestone reached today with the agreement between #UK and the #EEA/EFTA States, including #Iceland, on issues related to #Brexit. Rights of our citizens who want to live in each other‘s countries are now fully protected.

The single market is critical for jobs. Really?#Brexit 
I’ve heard #Brexiteer friends say they would be happy to accept a no deal #Brexit and suffer a period of hardship & difficult economic circumstances.But lives will be lost because economic hardship increases suicide rates, & there’s also a risk of NHS staff & medicine shortages
I remember when the argument against a #PeoplesVote to ratify the govt's position on #Brexit was that it would weaken the PM's negotiating position.Well guess what, the negotiation is over.We should have a #PeoplesVoteNow
Putin makes clear his instructions to #Brexit politicians. There must be no second referendum. Brexit would grant a huge victory for Putin in his hybrid war against the EU & Western democracy. Theresa May's government is working in the interests of Britain's enemy. #PeoplesVote
I suspect #Putin means "fulfil the will of my people".... After all, RT & Russian intelligence services worked damned hard for their #Brexit - it would be so unfair to take it away from them now. 
Live footage of the Gatwick #drones pilot, who's hoping to keep #Brexit out of the headlines for at least one day. 
Brexit is 99 days away. #brexit
BREAKING: Remainers beginning to admit they want to Remain. #brexit 
#brexit Noticing the increase in tweets from folk claiming to be Remain voters but have since changed their minds. Checking their time lines, quite clearly, most never supported Remain. Just another ruse.
BREAKING: #Brexit SHOCK - EU countries most 'EXPOSED' to Brexit fallout - 'there are some problems!'.EU faces £13 Billion in tariffs if WTO, Germany bearing £5 Billion of that. They'll beg for a FTA if UK just walk away.
Vladimir Putin has spoken. The British people must not be allowed a #PeopleVote!(His mafia state didn't invest all that time and money promoting #Brexit just to see it wasted.) 
MPs going on holiday for 17 days whilst the #Brexit clock runs down is a national disgrace. Imagine if all the Police, Firemen, Paramedics, Midwives, Doctors and Nurses pi××ed off for 17 days.Shame on all of you that think this is reasonable behaviour. 
Another upside of #brexit for the @The3Million. I think a lot of EU citizens will be horrified that they have no automatic right to be in the UK when they are married to Brits. I imagine their spouses will be too. Welcome to the #priceonlove
I would like to thank all the @CommonsEUexit committee clerks and assistants for your hard work in 2018. In 2019 we are leaving the EU and it is vitally important that we continue to hold the Government to account and ensure #Brexit is delivered 
Says the woman who hid reports showing EU migration was beneficial. This nauseating, lying PM is gleefully robbing millions of freedom & liberty in the name of hate & xenophobia whipped up by her chums in the tax-dodging #Brexit billionaire press. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

We’re just short of the EU being blamed for #Brexit 
Have a well earned break Nadine. Don’t forget to collect as many of those Christmas cracker jokes as you can over the festive period to use as more of your ‘no deal #Brexit’ facts
As we are rightly outraged about the treatment of @Anna_Soubry a timely reminder of my piece in yesterday’s @Telegraph.Legitimate #brexit debate being hijacked by extremists  
,@LaylaMoran writes for @timesredbox to argue MPs should not get Christmas off in the middle of this #Brexit crisis #PeoplesVote #ExitFromBrexit #FinalSay
We're told leaving the EU will cost jobs – so did joining in the 1970s create any? Actually no; here's Labour's Tony Benn, then Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, explaining how it turned a trade surplus with the bloc into a deficit and destroyed 500,000 jobs. #Brexit 
Brilliant and concise piece by @GKBhambra! "What we are currently witnessing with #Brexit is what the end of empire looks like. When the history of empire is elided and repressed – instead of being reckoned with – there is no real way forward." 
Remember how people were told in 2016 that #Brexit would help tackle the #HousingCrisis?Here's the Royal Institute of British Architects, @RIBA, saying the new immigration rules would be "a disaster for the architecture sector".We need to rethink this.
Deeply disturbing to see @HackneyAbbott peddling the same argument as the fascists. It's not about fairness, it's about appeasing xenophobes, it's a bogus justification for robbing millions of people of rights, without doing anything to improve rights for others. #Brexit #FBPE
The idea the EU immigration is harmful to this country is a myth and a lie. EU migrants have higher rates of employment and far better education levels than natives, and benefit the government budget. Benefits tourism is a lie. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #Brexit 
Hey UK folks, if you want to know what the dangers of #Brexit are I suggest you start listening to Irish radio. I listen to both UK & Irish radio & the excellent commentary & insights are all your own experts but speaking on Irish radio. I'm shocked by the difference tbh.
It's an appalling indictment of the UK that someone as light-bendingly dense as Andrea Leadsom has any role in the affairs of state. #Brexit 
***BREAKING***@AmberRuddHR has become the first Cabinet minister to publicly acknowledge the case for a #PeoplesVote, saying that if Parliament fails to reach a consensus, they may need the people to break the deadlock over #Brexit.Let's #EndTheChaos!
Study for Munich Chamber of Commerce @IHK_MUC says no deal #Brexit would cost Bavarian economy €1.4bn a year and that #Brexit weakens the EU internationally. 
⁦@andrealeadsom⁩ knows it’s a lie that it would take months & months or a year to get legislation through to have a #PeoplesVote . It has been expertly estimated that it could be done in 26 weeks and the EU have indicated it will suspend A50 #brexit 
Andrea Leadsom and Amber Rudd suggest rival #Brexit 'Plan Bs' 
"European flag carriers Iberia and Aer Lingus will no longer be permitted to fly within Spain and Ireland, their member states’ territories, or to any other EU airport if the UK leaves the EU without an agreement in less than 100 days"#Brexit
Andrew has taken some time off accusing the BBC of being pro Brexit(!?!) to hammer civil servants, including some of his ex employees, for carrying out government instructions.On the plus side, his lashing out shows he knows he’s losing the argument. Toxic individual.#brexit

Not financial, not immigration but this, this is why I voted to leave. I currently have no say in electing this man. And I have no way of influencing his policies.  Not what I'd call democracy. #brexit #remain
Where is Varadkar’s bullet proof backstop???????Fucking joke. Total chaos.The notion of Micheal Martin supporting FG in national interest  is utterly ridiculous with a no deal #Brexit looming in 99 days.FFFG gov won’t last long after March 29th. Disaster. #pknt #todaysor
I wonder if anyone’s opinion has ever been swayed by a thug goading them and repeatedly calling them a ‘traitor’. I’d be interested to know. #brexit 
The more you losers push for a second #Brexit referendum, the more permanent will be the division in our society. You will not steal this from us. Like it or not, we will leave the #EU, and we will never forget what you people tried to do to us.
Let’s try again! (If you saw the first two tweets this morning you will know why! My excuse? I’m tired having flown in from Singapore!) So, the most popular vote yesterday was a referendum on the PM’s deal. So how would you vote now? #Brexit
Most important question not asked by @bbcnickrobinson in interview with Andrea Leadsom this am on @BBCr4today - "What happens to the Good Friday Agreement (international treaty) under No Deal"? Yet again, the BBC bungles #Brexit.

.@andrealeadsom first class yesterday now talks irresponsible twaddle on #Brexit @BBCr4today Breaking collective responsibility she’s now advocating a mythical “managed no deal” with 99 days to go. Businesses & people are in despair at the lack of realism, direction & leadership
Hmmm, Andrea Leadsom's family income is offshore, avoiding tax. She is a big advocate of #Brexit. It is in Leadsom's financial interest to avoid the EU's crackdown on tax evasion. @bbc5live #r4today
Like many I’ve been critical of @BBCr4today approach to its #Brexit coverage but this morning it’s good to hear Nick Robinson calling Andrea Leadsome out for yesterday’s pantomime, the #Tories utter hypocrisy & their “displacement activity” over #Brexit
Something significant happened yesterday.Theresa May revealed that none of us matter any more. Everything but #Brexit is irrelevant.I’ve never felt so at risk in my own country. In fact, it’s the first time. They don’t care if we die. They just want it.#tories#TheresaMay
UK Gov been warned about threat Drones are to passenger Aircraft & UK Gov claimed it was ready clearly #GatwickAirport shows they're not. I wonder if there's anything else they're supposed to be preparing for but might not be ready for like #Brexit .#r4today #Gatwick
The question that I tried to put to @JuliaHB1 @talkRADIO but she didn’t appear able to hear was - would she rather have more thousands of more police on our streets to deal with crime - or give a BILLION to the Home Office for a no-deal #Brexit ? Because that’s what is happening.
What the bloody hell will it take to stop #Brexit? Answers on a postcard 
A 2nd referendum would be incredibly divisive. If Leave won again it would be pointless. If Remain won it would lead to a 3rd referendum. It solves absolutely nothing. The PM and the Tory manifesto ruled it out so no Tory MP should support it. #brexit
The sense of decay in the mother of parliaments is palpable. A speaker who spits his partiality, a #Labour leader who shows his contempt for women, a PM who cowers when faced with a treacherous #EU and many MPs authorised by us, but plotting to betray the country over #Brexit 
99 days.Squeaky bum time for Dr Death Campbell & his merry band of losersvote deludatrons.Sitting up in bed at night, doubts creeping over them in the dark. Harder to rise each day, fight just ebbing away.These guys will make the run-in to #Brexit hilarious, mark my words 
Forbes have ranked the UK number one in the world for the second year in a row in their global business rankings. Despite #Brexit indeed. Whilst some Remoaners try constantly to do down the UK, in reality the future is bright. 
 Have a watch of this little collection of voices I’ve gathered today - the tangible impact of continued uncertainty over #Brexit with just 99 days to go...The  &  politicians often claim #CitizensRights is sorted. It is not. More:  @SkyNews
I'm not rich. Don't have many skills as such. I'm just a human being born in UK with a Polish partner and an elderly Mum who relies on me. #Brexit is putting me & loved ones under severe pressure & could tear us apart. For what? So Tory millionaires can make even more money?
No deal Brexit will leave thousands of Brits in the EU with EU and non EU spouses - with no way out and possibly no where to live together as a family.How is this taking back control?How is this no problem?#brexit #NoDealBrexit #NoDealNoProblem
One of worst parts of #Brexit debate is constant use of WW2 analogies by leavers. My father, who saw action in France & Italy, was passionate European precisely because of his war experience, would be appalled by dangerous looking-glass logic of people his generation protected.

If we’re going to leave the EU and honour the democratic vote we’re better off leaving with a deal. If May gets concessions on backstop what is wrong with May’s deal? Put ERG, FPBE, SNP agitators to one side, moderate politicians from all sides should back this ##brexit deal
The only thing @UKLabour are clear on is their ineptitude on #Brexit. @AngelaRayner is just exemplifying how Labour's fudge it & hope policy is weak and unworthy of the "official opposition"
“We are certainly sailing into uncharted waters, but I believe that @theresa_may can navigate through the storm,” says Poland's Prime Minister @MorawieckiM in an interview with @Telegraph, where he discusses #Brexit and  relations. 
“I’m sick and tired of hearing that business leaders are worried about #Brexit. Britain is supposed to be a democracy, all votes are meant to be equal. For business leaders to have a greater say on Brexit than the rest of us is just wrong.” 
Brexit: pockets of unreality - as we get closer to the prize, our political class experiences collective hallucinations - but they cannot withstand the onslaught of reality. Soon the bubble has to pop. #Brexit 
As the UK continues to embarrass itself in front of the world, its parliament calls people back to debate whether or not someone called someone else "stupid". Great to see MPs are making good use of the 99 days ahead. #Brexit
"Salary is a poor proxy for Skill Level". Well said @normanlamb#Brexit #tech
It's now only 99 days until #Brexit! Looking forward to leaving the EU on WTO terms on 29th March 2019 and the freedom and prosperity it will bring to the UK.

Let me put this simply for you. Your Brexit loving followers might wish to be made aware of this too when they claim we should just revert to WTO:Head of the #WTO says "Trade deals are like football leagues. #Brexit relegates #UK to Division 4" Clear now?

For heavens sake, sensible people don’t care. They’re more worried by what May is doing to blackmail the country into either a bad or a worse #Brexit. Stupid? I’d say. 
"We unite on the trivial" says William Sitwell on #newsnight on supporting England in World Cup. Not one person investigates the 'we' in this. That not all of us are football fans. Not all of us live in England. That other alternatives are available. Basic & matters on #Brexit.

I agree, as a Nursing mentor many of my students are from abroad and would be classed as unskilled workforce but their enthusiasm and commitment to our NHS and the care they give is outstanding.  #Brexit is a flippin disaster.
This is how we want Scotland to sound on the world stage. It’s as far removed from #Brexit Britain as it’s possible to imagine. 
Thanks to @MadeleinaKay, @Femi_Sorry and a lot more heroes public opinion has completely shifted against #Brexit.By the way, Brexit is a crime.We will #StopBrexit. It won't happen at all. Better get used to that idea.
I hope #ScottishBorders farmers who voted for #Brexit realise this and are realising now the only way to be able to guarantee their livelihoods for the future and the next generation is to vote for #ScottishIndependence and a way back into the EU.#inIndyweTrust
Migration to the UK mostly comes from outside the EU. The UK could have controlled it for decades. It didn't because it needs immigration to keep the wheels of industry turning.#Brexit is just an excuse for the xenophobes and racists in the Tory party to be nasty.
It would be nice to see just one #Brexit protest off 100+ people that doesn't feature #Brexiters doing Nazi salutes.
I see this trending for a while now. Theresa May is not a #stupidwoman at all. She has used her xenophobia really well to architect the whole #HostileEnvironment and to put ending the reciprocal Freedom of Movement as the Number 1 item on the #Brexit agenda.
No such thing as Mrs May’s #Brexit dealWithdrawal Agreement is merely legal contract to pay £39bn with Irish back-stop for good measure!UK gets:Transition phase with no veto rights & accepts all fresh #EU law even when it threatens the national interest
It seems the mainstream media are getting worse by the day, with their distortions of #Brexit, the distractions they provide for the Tories and the attacks on Labour. So, a good time to share again the Thread book I did on the #BrokenMedia. (NB there are threads within threads.)
Absolutely ghastly thuggery. #Brexit seems to have unleashed a dark undercurrent of menace and intolerance. Solidarity with @Anna_Soubry No MP should have to put up with this.

The calls for a second referendum originate from a solidly pro-Remain group that wants to win by having a rigged question:  #Brexit
Right, now we've established that Corbyn didn't call May a #stupidwoman, can we discuss the main point of the day: the utter tonking he gave her over her shambolic #Brexit plans.  Because, let's face it: the mainstream media aren't going to.
Good luck @andywightman @AlynSmith @C_Stihler @davidmartinmep @Ross_Greer @JolyonMaugham & our fantastic legal team. Sorry I’m still stuck in the #Westminster madhouse but will be with you in spirit #Brexit #ScottishCase #Art50 #PeoplesVote

This storm in a tea cup has really highlighted the dishonesty of the Conservatives.Using a moment and manipulating it to deflect from their absolute failure of Governance over #Brexit.That is the real shame of today.
The abuse outlined here by @KayBurley is utterly reprehensible. But it is beyond the pale to try and blame that on the national desire to be governed from Westminster rather than Brussels. Yet another indication of her evidently biased journalism. #Brexit
Such a biased report from @NickMartinSKY on #brexit just now @SkyNews scripted around the premise that #LeaveEU is a bad thing

.@Telegraph cartoon#Brexit #stupidwoman #ItsAWonderfulLife #ChristmasMovieBattleRoyale
Is Theresa May a #StupidWoman? Please RT for wider demographic #Labour #Corbyn #Tory #Brexit
How exactly does one say with a straight face that it’s undemocratic to hold a referendum to overturn #Brexit when Brexit itself was effectively precisely that: a referendum to overturn a prior one (the 1975 OVERWHELMING approval of EC membership)?! The cheek boggles the mind.
#Brexit is driven by "nasty English nationalists".I wish everyone in England could see the difference between that type of nationalism and the desire to create a better, outward-looking, modern independent Scotland.
Theresa May Personally pledges to reduce immigration by making Britain a country no one would ever want to come to. Under the slogan of A COUNTRY TO ESCAPE FROM  #Brexit 
VIDEO - #YellowVests #Brexit supporters outside #Parliament this afternoon."What do we want? BrexitWhen do we want it? NOW!"#BrexitBetrayal #BrexitShambles#skynews #PMQs #BrexitNow #BrexitMeansBrexit
Lots of work ongoing by @scotfooddrink & partners to stress how damaging a no deal #Brexit would be for farming, food & drink and the wider Scottish economy. A huge cost even in planning for it. Businesses & workers are facing the most disastrous political decision of a lifetime.
Today the British government sets out their plan to devalue the British citizenship with ending #FreeMovement. You have 3 month to convince your friends, your family, your neighbours and your colleagues that #Brexit will not pay out the dividend they where told it would. #U2EU
Troops on standby to police the public, stockpiling of food, and now the government needs planes to fly in medicines and emergency supplies.We're increasingly acting like a nation at war. Who on earth voted for that in 2016?#EndTheChaos of #Brexit!
1,332,953 three day emergency food packages issued by charity foodbanks last year in the UK.The government can't even feed its own people, but it can find billions to squander on a #Brexit nobody wants.Get your sodding priorities right @theresa_may
This is quite a heartbreaking admission. The reality is many of us hadn't thought nearly so deeply about the implications of #Brexit in 2016 as we have by now, and many have changed their minds. If this caller to @LBC can change his mind, why can't we all?
#TheresaMay falsely claims we need #Brexit to control #Immigration She doesn’t mention that:-most migration to UK is from OUTSIDE the EU, entirely under UK rules-EU free movement comes with conditions(finding a job or being self sufficient)which theGovt never applied #bbcnews
No deal is now the only option. We will not have a 2nd referendum. We will not revoke Art. 50. We will not pass May’s rotten deal. We can do this!!! #Brexit #NoDealNoProblem
My three tests for whether or not it's legitimate to have a second referendum. If you missed my full speech from yesterday's #Brexit debate you can watch it here -  
The EU does not care about how Ireland is affected by Brexit. History shows it has  little interest in the material  well being of individual members.  But it does greatly fear a thriving UK  post Brexit. #Irexit #Brexit
The government expect a no-deal #Brexit can potentially result in homelessness, poverty and suicide. They’re planning for that. But blue passports. So, yay. 
If more people had the courage and clarity of @NicolaSturgeon on the issue of immigration, the country would not be in this utter #Brexit shambles to start with. Whatever my politics, whatever caveats, whatever subjects I disagree with her on, this is what leadership looks like. 
A DWP leaked report suggests the Government is planning a strategy to combat potential rising homelessness, poverty and suicide in the event of a no-deal #Brexit – this is far removed from what people thought they were voting for @SamCoatesTimes
The EU referendum had only two options. I voted for #Brexit and would do so again. In the absence of a good deal I still expect parliament to honour the result of the 2016 #PeoplesVote and implement the one remaining option of a #WTOBrexit. Leaving means NOT remaining in any way.
Above the A58(M) in #Leeds for this evening’s rush hour. Amidst the chaos of #Brexit we say loud & clear “Let’s Remain”. Getting plenty of noisy support! 
This is what I constantly have to explain to people who voted for #Brexit.I am NOT asking you to change your mind. I am asking you to ACCEPT that your vote has direct consequences on the lives and families of other people who couldn't vote. 
A heated #Brexit debate between British PM Theresa May and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn took an ugly turn... He claims he said "stupid people." What do you see? 
In #Leeds now! Greeting rush hour commuters with a timely message of “#Brexit isn’t working - Let’s Remain!” 
WATCH: British business leader makes it clear that #Brexit has meant he has had to close his business.A #PeoplesVote is the #OnlyWayForward: 
Theresa May IS a stupid woman. Jeremy Corbyn IS a stupid man. ANYONE who thinks #Brexit is a good idea is a stupid twat. Sue me #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #Remain
'What we are currently witnessing with Brexit is what the end of empire looks like. When the history of empire is elided and repressed – instead of being reckoned with – there is no real way forward.' @GKBhambraon reckoning with #Brexit.#twitterstorians
Could a second referendum break the #Brexit deadlock? @sarahobolt analyses the possibility of a second referendum on Brexit, what the question on the ballot could be and how voters might respond to it - 
Have made use of @digiminster’s fancy new online EDM signing system to support @IanBlackfordMP in his motion of no confidence in the UK Government.  #NoConfidence #Brexit #BrexitShambles
Watch & make up your own mind as to what @jeremycorbyn said. You may conclude he’s both sexist & a liar. What an appalling state British politics is in. #Brexit is the biggest crisis in generations, ppl need leadership & a way through the mess. Both main parties are failing them 
Do you suddenly feel that everyone around you has accepted #brexit? Social media is again awash with bots & sockpuppets. These are fake accounts, designed to troll to make you think that lots of people agree with something, eg #brexit. #stopbrexit #FBPE #FinalSayForAll
The ultimate #Brexit paradox is that we very probably need a no deal Brexit in order to have a political purge of the sort of politician that advocates a no deal Brexit.
I live in Northern Ireland and there's no threat to peace here, it seems people like you Anna are always threatening our peace with this outrageous claim. You Anna are public servant, and in a democracy you do what the public require you to do. #Brexit #LeaveEU
Virtually no Tory MPs and no relevant ministers present in Parliament for @Keir_Starmer emergency debate on the BILLIONS they are flushing down the toilet for the no deal #Brexit they say they don’t want. Shambles. Time for @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay
Nicola Sturgeon about to walk out of 10 Downing Street and address the nation, according to Sky News. About time! #leader #brexit
Parliament is currently debating an emergency motion on the Government blowing £4 billion activating no deal #Brexit contingency plans & forcing businesses to spend £billions more. Tory benches almost empty. Looks like they’ve all gone off on Christmas holidays. #brexitshambles
The #Tories (remember that they are the party of Government) packed out the green benches earlier to make a pointless fuss about a lip-read aside. Now that we are discussing a No Deal #Brexit there are about a dozen of them in the chamber #priorities
Tough new restrictions on EU workers in the immigration White Paper will hit the economy and we’ll all lose out. May must be honest on benefits of migration.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
-Foodbank use up -Homelessness Doubled -NHS in Crisis -Hospitals Closed -Crime rocketing & Police Budgets Cut -UK foreign policy questioned over Yemen conflict-Debt Doubled-#Brexit in shamblesHowever, today's #Tory agenda is #stupidwoman vs #StupidPeople
To scare MPs or to force the UK into what the transatlantic libertarians funded by the Kochs, Mercer & others have always wanted - a tax haven economy, in which government is so crippled it has to abandon the welfare state and its power to tax & regulate the super-rich.#Brexit 
No Laura. It means that I could well be an ileagal immigrant in Germany in 4 months time.I have now given up on Britain. Am applying for German passport & will give up UK citizenship thanks to brexit & #brexit enablers such as yourself.
Home Secretary Sajid Javid tells MPs his post-#Brexit immigration plan will lower migration "to more sustainable levels", after Theresa May repeats commitment to 'tens of thousands' target More: 
We now have 2 main parties whose #brexit concept rests on idea UK must end freedom of movement.The only difference is that the Tories are making a virtue of their racism while labour are pretending they’re pure so their anti immigration policy is benign.What a time to be alive.
The application for an emergency debate on a no-deal #Brexit has been approved by the Speaker. As over 40 MPs have expressed their support for this debate, it will begin in around 15 minutes.
I'm going to keep repeating this - #Brexit is a CHOICE, it's NOT inevitable- economy crash - AVOIDABLE- food/med shortages - AVOIDABLE- flights grounded - AVOIDABLE- NHS staff shortages - AVOIDABLE- job losses - AVOIDABLE- business relocations - AVOIDABLE#PeoplesVote
.@Keir_Starmer is making an application for an emergency debate on a no-deal #Brexit. He has three minutes to make his case for this debate to the Speaker.
Jeremy Corbyn's real message for Edinburgh@ScottishLabour #Brexit 
Revealed: Arron Banks Brexit campaign's 'secret' meetings with Cambridge Analytica - cracking scoop by @PeterKGeoghegan and @JennaCorderoy #Brexit 
I am watching in absolute disgust. There are children living in abject poverty, people dying on hospital waiting lists, a growing number of people who won't have a roof over their heads this Christmas, and then there's #Brexit.Yet our politicians choose to debate this instead!
Me on @RTUKnews One good thing that planning for WTO has done is beefed up border force officers, although many of us think this should have been done years ago. #Brexit 
James says that after eliminating, one by one, the "sack of promises" which she inherited from the Brexit movement, there is only one promise left which the Prime Minister can keep.@MrJamesOB | #Brexit
Ok so there's 100days and 7 hours to go on the #Brexit timebomb fuse. Instead of spending billions of taxpayers money and telling businesses to prepare for No Deal explosion, how about checking that the people are ok with what Parliament is doing?
Too late. #Brexit 
Has the campaigning style of  #FBPE accounts made you more or less likely to vote remain in any future referendum? #NoConfidence #Brexit #GTTO
For f**k's sake.#NoDealBrexit will bring army in streets, rise in suicide, shortage of food and medicine,..But the HoC and media are focused on : Did Jeremy call Theresa a stupid woman off the mic?#Brexit is a stupid thing, done by a stupid gov, led by a stupid woman. Move on.
When everything is going well for your, your village people will suddenly start calling you. Don’t listen to them o. That’s what happened to Britain with #BREXIT. They are now talking of 3,500 soldiers on the streets and chaos at airports and borders. House prices have crashed.
#BrexitGate never fails to deliver. #Brexit is being forced through on the strength of a criminally corrupted vote and a government cover-up of crimes and Russian interference. The 2016 referendum wasn't democratic. It is a crime scene. #PeoplesVote
Latest #stupidwoman fiasco really is peak Britain. Country falling apart with lies, cheating and corruption in plain sight, & Westminster goes into complete melt down over what the leader of the opposition *may have said?! #Brexit 
 QUESTION ON FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT.Why are the Tories so desperate to rip away the advantages we have had for a quarter of a century?I want no part in this disastrous approach to migration, future generations deserve better.Scotland needs its own migration policy.#Brexit 
I’m told HMG now readying a mass consumer campaign to get people ready for no deal #Brexit - full blown consumer website and campaign ready for mid January 
The announcement on immigration goes to the heart of #Brexit and why May is determined the UK leaves the EU no matter what the damage. She just hates foreigners, all she cares about is keeping them out of the UK. A hateful woman leading a party with many xenophobes in it.
FM @nicolasturgeon arrives for #Brexit talks with ⁦@Theresa_may⁩ and calls on ⁦@jeremycorbyn⁩ to apologise if he called PM a “stupid woman”
Wouldn't it have been glorious if the Government, from the word go had actively made preparation for a no deal #Brexit.  I mean serious credible preparations, and told the EU to bugger off we're no interested. By now they would be pleading with us for a deal...A sensible deal.
In Downing St @nicolasturgeon says if @jeremycorbyn called @theresa_may a “stupid woman” he should apologise and then everyone should get back to worrying about #Brexit
On the streets of Cornish Towns the message couldn't be clearer. They don't trust the government, #Brexit is going badly and they want a #PeoplesVote.So why are their MPs not listening?@scottmann4NC @sheryllmurray @stevedouble @DerekThomasUK @SNewtonUK #BCRE @Cornwall4EU
Um, #Brexit is an unmitigated economic catastrophe for Britain, and an sort of Alberta version would be catastrophically larger than that. Jack Mintz isn't right about much.  But then, neither are you.#ableg #cdnpoli #yql
The UK has safeguarded EU citizens' rights even in the even of leaving on #WTO terms.What has the #EU done? Nothing. No guarantees. No binding advice to member states.   Which side are treating people like bargaining chips again? #Brexit
There’s not enough think tank & policy work going on in Scotland so the work @SCER_eu are doing on our relationship with Europe is particularly important, regardless of your politics. Please consider donating #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #brexit #independence
Clearly then Tories not telling truth when they say Scottish business on board with their disastrous #immigration plans this is strong stuff from @CBI_Scotland #Brexit 
"Justice for women and children" on the back of this woman's EDL "Gilet Jaune" in Durham. #Brexit is the greatest injustice this country has ever seen. Deprived regions like the NE and women & children will suffer the most from negative impacts. #stopBrexit @Women_4_Europe
Tories are not offended by: HomophobiaIslamophobiaViktor OrbanRough sleepingAusterity related deaths But, Tories *are* offended by: An opaque statement, accurately referring to their own incompetence. #NoConfidence#Brexit #GTTO #PMQs
Climbing towards half a million views. @omid9 with THE funniest take on #Brexit ever.RT. RT. RT.
Whilst the #Tories distract from their #Brexit car crash, feigning shock that Jeremy Corbyn *might* have called Theresa May a ‘stupid woman’, where’s their outrage re the whip being restored to two of their sex pest MP’s so that they could vote for May?  
When Santa drives by, sees the #BollockstoBrexitBus and stops for a photo... Well of course @itvnews want to interview him saying #Brexit is a "HO! HO! HO! HOPELESS MESS" 
Govt highlight Suffragette centenary in having taken offence at alleged sexism ie as an "orchestrated riot" (Margaret Beckett MP) falls short of its own record where #StatePension of millions of #50sWomen has been swiftly twice deferred, by stealth, for up to6yrs#Brexit anyone? 
"Absolute katastrophe"Juncker (In German) on the UK leaving with a no-deal. That's why the EU has contingency plans. 100 days to #Brexit 
So, to recapWe are on the #Brexit cliff edgeWe have 1,000s of homelessSchools are opening #foodbanks Poverty is on the riseWe have foreign & corrupt interference in our democracy Our economy is flatliningFascism is on the riseAnd the news is running withAn INSULT 
The @Conservatives looking for any excuse to take the pressure off #brexit at #PMQs its pathetic. They think remark from Corbyn (not fact he said it ) was worse than racist comment towards @IanBlackfordMP  go back to Skye ?
Actually it does, we lose ALL of our trade deals, every single one, on the 29th March 2019 at exactly 11pm - wiped out, all gone. Then what? Rush to sell ourselves short getting substandard deals just so we can survive? #Brexit
BMA repeats its call for second #Brexit referendum and warns that all parts of the health service will be adversely affected by Brexit @abi_rimmer reports  @TheBMA
The brilliant @TommySheppard tells Labour that they're letting down the citizens of the UK, and Scotland will not "go down with the ship"#indyref2 #brexit #DissolveTheUnion
#brexit is turning us into a nation of desperate lip readers.
Is it just me? Or does anyone else get the feeling that the establishment would actually, genuinely prefer a war to a clean #Brexit? 
What's wrong with everyone.We already have an #Immigration based on skills, not country of origin.I didn't get my job by just turning up and shouting "I AM FRENCH, GIMME THE JOB".I had 2 stages interviews, tests, 5 months wait, security clearance, and a suitable CV. #Brexit
Britain to prioritise high-skilled workers in post-#Brexit immigration plans 
Perspective:Calling a stupid man stupid is not sexist.Calling a stupid woman stupid is not sexist.Pursuing #Brexit is stupid. Supporting #Brexit is stupid.Implementing immigration laws that reduce sub 30K migrants to the detriment of the NHS is stupid.Some perspective?
Ok, so here's the plan: when Parliament goes home for Christmas recess, a bunch of us will hotdesk in the House of Commons and fix their #Brexit mess for them.l'll bring the mulled wine. Who's on sprout detail?#PeoplesSprout
PRESS RELEASE from @britishineurope:EU no deal contingency plans: 'a rough landing' for 1.2mn British nationals in Europe.#NoDealBrexit #Brexit
And with me tonight @Anna_Soubry former business minister under David Cameron, now a back bencher campaigning against  almost any form of #Brexit 
After so many debates with Jacob Rees-Mogg & friends, it was refreshing to talk #Brexit with someone who wants to end the UK's grotesque inequalities.@GloriaDePiero & I both want to reunite the country - but I believe #PeoplesVote is the way to do that.
With 100 days to #Brexit, the need for an upgrade to Rosslare is even more obvious and urgent. Will the Government undertake to ensure that Rosslare is enhanced not diminished as a strategic asset in the context of Brexit? 
Home Secretary @sajidjavid today set out plans for a new skills-based immigration system which marks the end of free movement. Find out more:  #Brexit 
100 days till #brexit and this is what is currently happening in Westminster...#stupidwomangate
As I told MPs yesterday, the #Brexit deal we will present to the House in the new year is a good deal. It is the only deal. To reject this deal makes no deal far more likely. 
Has anyone just tried simply turning the UK off and on again ?? #Brexit 
MSM hasn’t wanted to focus on this, but the CEO of the UK Major Ports Group doesn’t believe that there would be a logjam at our ports and that we have all the capacity we need to “get on with it” post #Brexit. I wonder whether I should believe him over Project Hysteria...  
Two of my favourite MPs ⁦@GloriaDePiero⁩ and ⁦@CarolineLucas⁩ doing a much better job of debating #Brexit than the debacle going on in the Commons chamber 
Sad but no surprise that @LenMcCluskey chooses to back #Brexit.Brexit in any form will see people lose their jobs (including @unitetheunion members) and hit hardest those who have least.The good news is that a big majority of union members and #Labour voters want to #Remain
£6.2 billion even before we've left? That's about £230 for every household in the UK. Just think what else could have been done with this money, for hospitals, schools... And the real expense & economic damage hasn't even started yet. Stop this #Brexit madness now.#PeoplesVote
Parliament now appears more concerned with lip-reading Jeremy Corbyn than calling our shambolic government to account for its mis-handling of #Brexit. It is incredible and totally depressing.
1) The crux of why Labour is hamstrung on #BrexitIt *is* an outrage that May is saying "take my deal or take chaos", it's blackmailBut the only alternatives are a #PeoplesVote or #RevokeA50 If Labour won't call for either they are just shouting ineffectively into the wind
Watching parliament at lunch and thinking what a repulsive, rude, reckless, offensive sight MPs make.Theresa May is acting like a lunatic, now. Literally - like someone who has lost all reason.Corbyn is a fist-waving ditherer.Can’t believe our lives depend on them.#brexit
This is great news EU Commission states No deal scenario #Brexit would create “major disruption” but no cliff edge. Instead Eurocrats set out & willing to establish a smooth glide path to a new relationship under WTO. Project Fear Remainers wrong again.  
We stand up to fascists. We can't let them hijack our country. Stopping #Brexit is the most patriotic thing we can do. 
Captain Britain's Stance on #Brexit Revealed 
"Are you so frightened of defeat that she will deny the Parliament another vote?" SNP's Ian Blackford accuses PM of "running scared" of an MPs' vote on her #Brexit deal #PMQs updates: 
Good morning all from Dublin! We’ve been talking to @SenatorMarkDaly today in Leinster House, and asked him a number of the questions that you’ve posed to us. Stay tuned for the podcasts on these topics over coming weeks! #Think32 #UnitedIreland #Brexit #CBlive #RTEpt

SNP's @IanBlackfordMP accuses govt of 'failing businesses' and for a new referendum @theresa_may says Parliament has failed to come to a decision on #brexit (fact check: the deal wasnt put to parliament)
Watching @HouseofCommons at its obnoxious worst today at #PMQs I am more convinced than ever that this #crisis of British democracy will & must lead to #Scottish #independence. I take very seriously my duty to be part of delivering this #Brexit #indyref2
My article for @SwarajyaMag on #Brexit and the lessons that Indian Legislators can learn from their experience. 
Theresa May to Jeremy Corbyn: "He can talk all he likes about a meaningful vote, all he gives us is a meaningless position”PM on Labour leader's accusation she has "plunged this country into a national crisis" over #Brexit#PMQs updates: 
Great answer from Theresa May. Labour is forcing the Government to spend billions of pounds on no-deal planning by NOT supporting her deal in the House of Commons. #Brexit #PMQs
Both main parties cling to the utter delusion they can reunite the UK by either passing May's pig awful compromise or backing Corbyn's Fantasy #Lexit BS..We are IRREVOCABLY DIVIDED for a generation.The choice is simple#Brexit = Wreck our Future or#Remain = Save our Future
It’s back to the same old nonsense from the PM today - trying to claim it’s no deal vs her “deal”. This is a blatant and dangerous lie. It’s time for a @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay to end this #Brexit chaos. #PMQs
100 days to go to #Brexit   Reasons for dread:  -Troops being readied  -Drugs being stockpiled  -Small businesses bewildered  -Big business says we're horrified  -NHS staff shortages loom   Reasons for hope:
A big Labour announcement coming up at 1pm on the New Statesman website. #brexit
British Black and Asian people are entirely confused by #Brexit Speaking personally, as a black man, I no longer feel British. The land of my birth, has rejected and oppressed me to the point that I'm considered a stranger in my own country #ImmigrationWhitePaper #Windrush
Whatever happens, #Brexit is politically unsustainable. It doesn't have enough support. It will die one way or another, it's just a question of when and how much damage is done in the interim.
Brexit is 100 days away. #brexit
European Commission starts implementing "no deal" #Brexit Contingency Action Plan. The BBC's @adamfleming says it covers 14 areas including financial services, air transport and customs
Calling @BritishInEurope - it’s 100 days till #brexit. A while ago I asked u to send me  with your thoughts on it all. (below). Can u send me NEW  - how u feeling now? Are u clear where u stand if #nodeal? Have u applied for residence permits?
Be under no illusion, Britain - @theresa_may is ramping up the No Deal terror campaign to force us into accepting her terrible deal. Remember her own words: No Deal is better than a Bad Deal. #Brexit
The @EU_Commission has adopted a series of “no-deal” #Brexit measures today. Link to Communication here 
In a democracy, people have the right to change their mind. You can watch my full speech from yesterday's #Brexit debate here - 
Today I will be meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May to reiterate her moral obligation to prevent the UK crashing out of the EU, which would have seismic repercussions for the whole of the Welsh economy and threaten jobs and businesses throughout Wales #Brexit

We have started implementing our #Brexit “no deal” Contingency Action Plan.It includes 14 specific, temporary measures in a limited number of areas such as financial services, air transport customs and climate to avoid major disruption for the EU27 → 
Frankly - it's nauseating watching Tory *rebels* hawk their consciences around the TV studios.They have as much intention of voting against May's #Brexit deal - as they have of sliding down Mt.Everest with a rose behind their ear !#ToryBrexitshambles

Peak support for May's deal is 17%.Peak support for No deal is 27%.Yet, this Prime Minister is running down the clock in a bid to ensure these are the only 2 options left. She treats Parliament, our people, & democracy with complete contempt. Time to go.#Brexit #GTTO

Many thanks to #eu2018at, which is drawing to a close: we worked very well together with @sebastiankurz @Gernot_Bluemel and their teamsDuring the AT presidency we finalised the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement w/ the UK as well as the Political Declaration on the future relationship
Update on 2018. Mainly due to @carolecadwalla we know behind the looming economic disaster of #Brexit1. A massive hacking operation by Steve Bannon’s Cambridge Analytica2. Working via AIQ with Vote Leave, guilty of illegal overspends3. And with Leave EU, funded outside the UK

Since CJEU ruling dictates some form of democratic/ legal legitimacy to withdrawing a50, timeline now means GE route to stopping #Brexit has pretty much closed. 
This is relevant for #Brexit which Wigmore described as a ‘Petri dish’ for Trump. Though @facebook won’t release the data, the fact the Russian Troll Farm was using Breitbart and the Daily Mail shows you how easily, along with Cambridge Analytica, they could target UK voters.

Pt 3 - Labour must choose, does it want to implement its manifesto, or does it want to stay in the EU/customs union/single market? Dishonest to pretend it can do both. #Brexit 
We're facing the most serious political crisis in years, one that could have disastrous outcomes, time in running out and our Parliament breaks for two weeks of cracker pulling and eating Christmas pudding. It's beyond parody. Just how seriously is Parliament taking #Brexit?
Can anyone name a single other country negotiating with another whose MPs publicly and repeatedly say, by implication, 'we must take ANY deal they offer'? Just one will do. #Brexit

You can have poor people and you can have #Brexit, you can have both.Personally I would like to see the money budgeted for Brexit to go towards homelessness, eradicating poverty, eliminating the need for foodbanks.How about you?
OK leavers we all agree @theresa_may #Brexit deal is a crock of shit so why  do you trust the incompetents  who negotiated this deal  to do a good job of renegotiating 100s of international treaties and 50 odd trade agreements
Keep signing. It is currently outstripping the People's Vote and Stop Brexit petitions and we need to keep it that way. #Brexit #LeaveMeansLeave #LeaveEU
No way Gvt should force House of Commons on 2 week recess tomorrow - we have no decisions on #Brexit, yet just 100 days to go. Parliament should stay longer, or come back to work like everyone else in first week of January. #KickingTheCan and indecision is no longer an option.

#Brexit Project Fear all over again we had it in 2016 before REFERENDUM. With George Osborne & Barack Obama, back of the queue trade deal with  Didn’t work won’t work now. Shut up  same bloody bores out everyday TV & Radio. 17.4 million voted leave just get on with it FFS. 
What would be your ideal #Brexit scenario?**Pease retweet after voting**#Conservative #Labour #UKIP #LibDem #SDP #WithdrawalAgreement
In the last 100 years when has the #UK not been #sovereign? When has it been unable to pass laws? When has it not had #control of its #borders? When has it not had control of how the #government spends the #taxes it raises?#Brexit is a solution looking for a mythical problem.
A Citizens’ Assembly doesn’t bypass the need for political leadership. It just requires a different type. This ⁦@TimJHughes⁩ blog on breaking the #Brexit deadlock is worth a read 
#brexit would not be one off event that would be damaging on its own. It's just the start. It is a structural change to society which will be vastly detrimental to all of us. Any Leaver that thinks they will benefit is sadly & terribly wrong, and has been criminally misled. #FBPE
Many #Leave voters tell me that this is not what they were promised, nor what they voted for, as government sends #Brexit warning letters to 140,000 firms and puts 3,500 troops on standby : 
Our members tell us that any form of #Brexit could have a wide-ranging and damaging impact on the NHS. With only 100 days to go, we believe the public should have a final, informed say on any Brexit deal. Read more about our concerns:

IT'S RICH FOR @SkyNews to complain what a mess #Brexit is in, when SKY itself has been a major contributor in trying to destroy #Brexit.  UNBELIEVABLE CHEEK from Sky, @AdamBoultonsky, @KayBurley don't even bother to hide their bias. @borisjohnson #borisjohnson @Jacob_Rees_Mogg
Parliament's holiday should be cancelled. They screw over the country, ruin Christmas for thousands of families and then fuck off to their mansions for expensive wine and gifts. Enough. Get your asses back in the chamber and try behaving like adults! #brexit #PeoplesVote
Agree. Compare and contrast with Robert Mercer, the #Brexit-backing hedge-fund billionaire who believes "human beings have no inherent value other than how much money they make" and is the proud owner of the world's largest collection of machine guns.

Neatly sums up #Brexit! 
That this news has barely been mentioned by the media really does speak volumes about how warped and dishonest the #Brexit debate is 
This is so awful - and it’s not unusual (my local greengrocer will tell you a similar story). #Brexit is destroying the small local businesses that are the backbone of communities and nobody - politicians or media - is talking about it.

FSB, along with @CBItweets, @britishchambers, @The_IoD and @EEF_Insights, the UK’s five leading business groups today unite and call on politicians to prevent a disorderly no deal #Brexit on 29th March: 
So much for the idea that #Brexit will save money which could be redeployed in the NHS! So far it has led to higher public spending and lower tax receipts due to weaker economic growth. 
If u feel bad watching TV #Brexit news, try watching it with your Polish girlfriend: all these politicos saying how poverty, rationing, Martial Law is a price worth paying if we can stop foreigners coming here.
It's very simple @theresa_may you are bluffing with no deal #Brexit if you go ahead with it you will be choosing to kill some of your own citizens and impoverish many many more

Who remembers Britain's green & pleasant land? Not me! I grew up in 70s, London, it was a shithole. There's a myth going about that #Brexit is about "Little Englanders" dreaming of the 1950s, playing cricket and eating crumpets. It's about have their voice back and being heard.

This notion you are far-right voting for #Brexit is ridiculous. 17.4million are not far-right. Same goes around Europe where people are voting in high numbers for populist parties. The indigenous people are sick of not having a voice. Politicians need to deal with the real issues
Dear PM @theresa_may, as the Fmrw Commonwealth Youth Ambassador for Trinidad & Tobago I can surely say that the Youth and Young leaders of the Commonwealth stand ready to support the UK in any post #Brexit deal. No deal is not the end as you have the Commonwealth behind you!

This is how you do it: article on the efforts by the German government on making sure @BritsinGermany are secure after #Brexit, even in the case of #NoDealBrexit. What a shame that the UK is taking such a chaotic approach. Let's #StopBrexit.

It's now 100 days until #Brexit.The Remainiac meltdown is already beginning, but it will get much worse.It's no longer sanity, it can't be addressed with anger. Laugh at them & move on. 
I may be daft, call me stupid. What kind of idiot would support another country telling another to accept deprivation, loss of economic progress, no choice, for a flag? I'm sorry but that is insane on so many levels of intelligence, it is insane. #Brexit
Are you so insecure in your deity worship of Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn that you cannot permit any form of challenge or scrutiny of ‘him’? Best you block me then because until he changes his position on #Brexit I have no intention of backing down. Clearly he & you don’t want my vote

So yet another reason for a NODEAL #BRexit ? To get rid of @Anna_Soubry :( LOL.

Dear Nadine,You're an MP.You could meet with any number of top economists at our top universities.They'd be delighted to help you understand the scale of the risks involved.PS - there is more than one car involved in a #brexit crash !
I live in one of the world’s richest countries. A country that, right now, is stock-piling medicines and putting thousands of troops on stand-by. In peacetime. All because of a xenophobic minority, their millionaire ringleaders and their damned stupid #BrexitI am sick of it.
Funny.. when a Leaver tweeted "traitor" at someone seeking to undermine #Brexit, @acgrayling said: "this is the depth to which the sickness that is Brexit is sinking us: unbelievable!", and he equated it with Kim Jong-un. Yet here he is, manifesting that same depth of sickness..
The nation should have been told in 2016 that military support would be needed to implement #brexit. No one voted for this. How can this be legal? @fairvoteuk @UKEUchallenge @Lawyers4EU @EU_Justice @ElectoralCommUK @NCA_UK @endthechaosuk @JasonJHunter @JolyonMaugham @JMPSimor

I hold quite strong views on #Brexit (maybe you noticed).It's important to realise though, the win may only come from the centre of the field.A good goto moderate is @willquince. Made a great speech today on the #WithdrawalAgreement & the dreaded #Backstop.
Did you read even ONE #brexit impact statement?This isn't a game of monopoly, where you find a 'get out of jail' card.Our economy = 45 years of growth and progression within the EU.And you think there's a fast lane ... on the beach ... at the base of the cliff !#StopBrexit pic.twitter.com/LIISVnM0Lj

Despite the lurid headlines about “political meltdown”, this will come to be seen as a calm few weeks in British politics compared to what is coming. A momentous political struggle is taking place.Can we break the #Brexit deadlock 
The #Tory government is spending £4,000,000,000 pounds on "contingency" measures in case of a hard #Brexit Just think of the number of schools and nurses that could have benefited from that money instead. Money from a magic money tree. #BrexitShambles ,#NoDealBrexit
Now EIGHT hours into the powercut here in deepest Kent. No heat, no food, no hot water and a fridge that smells like Southend. And two kids losing the plot. I’m now wondering if this is a surreptitious Government Black Op in preparation for #Brexit?

#Brexit What a heartbreaking, terrible mess.Our country is being driven to the brink of ruin because a bunch of greedy, merciless press barons (among others) don't want to pay their fair share of taxes.
Chanel 4  at it again this time with Anna Soubry MP anti #Brexit same old negativity it's always slanted in one direction  as ever doom and gloom!
What a completely negligent waste of taxpayers’ money. All to try to blackmail Parliament into voting for her dangerous #Brexit deal 
I need to say something because I'm starting to see the altright Leave campaign trying to sow something into the psyche of our society. And that is this. No, the people are not to blame. #brexit is a crime perpetrated against the country, & the people. We're better than this.
Final stop of the day... The #Scottish parliament! #BollockstoBrexitBus #Edinburgh Westminster manufactured this mess, let the British people of England, Wales, Scotland and N.Ireland take back control and have a #FinalSay on the #Brexit deal! 
Beautiful.  Thank you for sharing that.  I think many of us are seriously thinking of moving to Scotland if #brexit goes ahead.Your speech today was a breath of air & what was needed to be said - if only the SNP were the official opposition. #FinalSayForAll

It's a rum old day when the UK rally behind Jeremy Hunt as a #Brexit champion.
An end of year message on #Brexit I believe the New Year offers the hope that we can put this disastrous chapter in our country’s history behind us by giving control back to the people. #PeoplesVote#StopBrexitSaveBritain 
Downing Street has confirmed that the govt will now implement their plans for No Deal #Brexit “in full”. Great news.It is having a clear effect as well - the EU’s Guy Verhofstadt lashed out against such an outcome. No Deal means no £39bn for Brussels. 
This is good news. It would also be helpful if the government could now reassure us that it will have the country ready for a managed No Deal #Brexit, and stop scaremongering. 
Since day one, the Scottish Nationalists' focus has been figuring out how to utilise #Brexit to achieve their sole aim: Independence. Any policy area, be it the economy, health, or education, is utilised in this way. Scotland sees through them. 
No, Brexit is not to blame for job losses at Jaguar Land Rover. The company has deep-rooted problems. Blaming #Brexit is just an easy way for management to shirk full responsibility, writes @Robspiked
This is what #Brexit has come to... mass purchasing of fridges and troops on standby. Leaver or remainer, it wasn’t supposed to be like this, surely. 
Shocking news from @Irish_Ferries. They plan to abandon Rosslare Europort and the shortest sea route to France just as #Brexit kicks in. Inexplicable! Demands a response from a Government. @campaignforleo @Shane_RossTD
You, me and other moderate One Nation Tories. Country must come before party allegiance #NationalInterest #duty #Brexit 
I don’t agree with @NickBoles on everything - but I hope substantial numbers of other colleagues follow his lead on this. No deal is absurd, dangerous and is costing us billions in preparations. #Brexit 
All UK citizens to be sent information on how to prepare for 'no-deal' #Brexit, as govt dramatically ramps up contingency planning 
Dear friends,Just to let you know I will not be taking my fairy lights down after Christmas. Instead they will spell out the message "I fucking told you so" as part of my preparations for a no-deal #brexit Then I will be sealing myself in the house with 300 tins of soup.

This is the stance, not of a democratic government, but of a mafia gang threatening to push the British people off the no-deal cliff if its demands are not met. We are now being treated as hostages.  #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
Day by day the serious threat of a catastrophic no deal #brexit is ramping up. May is ratcheting up the pressure on MPs to get her deal through in January. She is recklessly and needlessly running down the clock.  MPs must wake up and stop her. NOW

The fact that the Gov would rather the entire country rioted over food and med shortages, than a few right-wing nutters caused a ruckus over cancelling #Brexit, shows how little they care - this is about ideology, hate and greed, nothing else. #StopBrexitSaveBritain #PeoplesVote
Theresa May continues to stagger towards a dangerous hard #Brexit or No Deal to appease her Tory party, putting party before country. We need a #PeoplesVote to stop this embarrassing, reckless #BrexitShambles. @WalesForEurope @FFSake_ @peoplesvote_uk
#Brexit: Cabinet 'ramps up' no-deal planning 
"Go back to Skye"SNP's Ian Blackford is heckled as he opens an emergency debate on #BrexitUpdates: 
The Scottish #Brexit Minister seems to think that a leave vote in Peterhead is somehow less valid than a leave vote in Portsmouth - this was a UK-wide decision. If he doesn't want a #NoDeal outcome then why is his party unanimously engineering one?
Is it possible for a backbencher to table a motion of #NoConfidence in Her Majesty’s Opposition given the mess they have made in tabling a motion of no confidence in the government? #Labour #Brexit @AngusMacNeilSNP
How many Greeks, Spanish or Italians are poorer because of politicians? How many have had their opportunities removed by EU policy? How many lives have been made more uncertain by economic union? How many have been driven to suicide because of monetary union? #Brexit is liberty. 
3,500 troops have been put on standby as part of emergency no-deal #Brexit contingency plans.This is not scaremongering, this is fact. It is irresponsible of the PM to let it get this far, running down the clock towards a reckless crash out of the EU. 
Sadly, this is emblematic of the arrogance and contempt with which Scottish views are treated with. Not just on #Brexit, but Rape Clause, foreign intervention, minimum wage, nuclear weapons. This is the attitude of the party which makes decisions which impact Scotland's people. 
Those medicine fridges are making news but anyone who works with govt knows how much civil service time has been wasted on stockpiling, how financial uncertainty has delayed crucial plans for NHS & social care, how vital health policies have been squeezed out. #Brexit
Ian Blackford tells the Commons, 'I came here to serve Scotland, my people, my country, and it devastates me to see the will of my people disregarded by this UK government'#Brexit
Watching the emergency debate in Parliament I make the following observationsSNP see Labour as their opposition & have no intention of holding the Tory gov’t to account.The SNP do not respect any result of any referendum that doesn’t give them the result they demand!#Brexit
Tory backbencher Vicky Forde taking her lead from the U.K. Govt frontbench by grossly misrepresenting @theSNP #MEPs position on #Brexit. 3rd time in a week I’ve had to raise a point of order correcting misleading statements made to the House by Tories
Still waiting for @theresa_may to return to the chamber and correct her misleading remarks about the @scotgov EU #ContinuityBill the Scottish Parliament DID have the powers to pass the legislation until the UK Gov power grab. #Brexit 
#NoDealBrexit petition now at over 217,000 - beating the biggest Remainer petition by over 15,000.Bearing in mind most Brexiteers aren’t among the compulsive activist classes - that’s amazing.The real Peoples’ Will is clearly for a clean WTO #Brexit.
3,500 service personnel are ready "to support any government department on any contingencies they may need" in case of a no-deal #Brexit, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson tells MPs
Ian Blackford - The leader of the opposition has become the midwife for #brexit & he's letting the government off the hook... he has to bring forward a no confidence motion... so it will allow his party to move onto the issue of a #PeoplesVote.#FinalSay #RevokeA50

Whatever the short-term bumpiness of #Brexit, in the long-term we are better off out of the increasingly dysfunctional and unequal EU 
Should have said we’ll be stockpiling fridges to hold drugs and putting 3500 troops on standby ready for a self-inflicted No-Deal #Brexit

Clear answer from @IanBlackfordMP to @Anna_Soubry confirming @theSNP consider the #Norwayplus ship has sailed. Scotland voted to #remain & @theSNP MPs want a 2nd #EU referendum with #remain on ballot paper #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Ian Blackford calls Jeremy Corbyn the "Midwife of Brexit". Hes right you know. #Brexit

Couldn’t believe what I heard from Nicholas Soames shouting “go back to Isle of Skye” as @IanBlackfordMP stood up to start Emergency #brexit debate. Shameful, contemptuous behaviour. Ian clearly getting under skin of the Tories & they are reduced to abusing him & shouting down
As @theSNP #Westminster leader @IanBlackfordMP the only MP to obtain an urgent #BrexitChaos debate today stands up to speak silly old fool Nicholas Soames shouts “Go back to Skye” #respectagenda #everydayracism #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #indyref2
"go back to the Isle of Skye" shouts a tory at Ian Blackford before he even says a word on the Emergency debate.  That's the childish level from Scottish tories and disgusting attitude.#Brexit

Planning for no-deal "needs to be much more of a priority for businesses", says #Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, as ministers agree to send letters to 140,000 companies urging them to step up preparationMore:

When you live in Europe for 15 yrs, as I have, you learn that nobody likes the English. The French and Germans are thrilled these idiots are euthanizing themselves. The U.K., not adopting the Euro for example, is a drag. After they’re gone, EZ will do better. #Brexit
So #FBPE Here's your #Tory 'Champions' Anna Soubry will back a No Deal, Ken Clarke will back May's deal and as for Grieves remember the last #Brexit vote he voted against his OWN amendment, there are no #Tory rebels #NoConfidence
This call from @vincecable clearly has merit. As long as May's Government continues to fail to provide any leadership over #Brexit and instead bounce from crisis to crisis, the country is being damaged. This ongoing damage needs to be brought to a halt by revoking A50. 
Before tomorrow's #Brexit deal/no deal update from the European Commission, why not read their document from November which laid it all out. 
Britain thinks France and Germany will take pity on them and change the deal... I’ve lived in both France and Britain and was amazed at how much the French and Brits hate each other. The French want Brits to die. #Brexit is their chance. I don’t think @theresa_may gets it.
No deal is the #Brexit which votes in the referendum where cast in favor of. It's implementation is still in high demand. 
May is flying in the face of Parliament with her #Brexit deal.Our elected representatives !!How MUCH is this calamitous #Brexit costing us ?Whilst people sleep cold & hungry on the streets & others struggle to make ends meet !Where DOES she find the money to fund her hubris ?
US companies are lining up £100 million investment in the West Midlands despite #Brexit. Companies working with @RollsRoyce and @HS2ltd are just a few expanding in the West Midlands - @GGI_GA#USInvestment #GGI #International
Our #Brexit future seems to be to throw whatever money is required, to support a #Brexit that the polls suggest the majority of voters do not want, to vindicate a myopic policy promise made based on fraud, lies & hubris. Sod everything else. WAKE UP @jeremycorbyn. #PeoplesVote
The language around #Brexit - even from self proclaimed moderates - is becoming increasingly depressing and inflammatory.
A responsible government would not be wasting  £4.2bn planning to inflict massive harm and suffering on the British people so that a tiny minority can profit from crisis speculation, diaster capitalism and a #Brexit tax haven. That is crime not government. #PeoplesVote #FBPE
#Brexit is losing support - especially among Labour Leavers.@PeterKellner1 summarises the three important messages in the latest #PeoplesVote polls
 The Gov't is spending £2bn extra on no-deal preparations.  Giving the choice to the people is more democratic than forcing them out on a no-deal scenario that nobody voted for.  WATCH: @PeterGrantMP urges the gov't to take no-deal #Brexit off the table. 
Karie Murpy...a posh boy?This car crash of a No Deal #Brexit is in the hands of MaySTOP blaming CorbynI voted RemainA 2nd Ref is no good for meI want a #GeneralElectionNow#ForTheMany
Today I raised very serious concerns about @policescotland's access to Europol and Eurojust after #Brexit. It's vital this security co-operation doesn't end. Time for Theresa May to remove her reckless threat of a No Deal Brexit. 
I'd say that Tories in Scotland seem to be the worst losers ...For last 60 years, Scotland has consistently said NO to Tories in:19591964196619701974 (twice)1979198319871992199720012005201020152017And at HOLYROOD in:19992003200720112016and to #Brexit 
Jon Snow has now deleted his attack on #Brexit 
Let‘s try a simple question so @theresa_may can understand: Will the EU agree to change any substantial aspects of the #Brexit (Withdrawal) Agreement like the Irish backstop? Please RT for large sample
.@DefraGovUK is being given an additional £400 million (20% of their annual £2.2 billion budget) to spend on IT systems in preparation for a #NoDeal Brexit. With 3 months to #Brexit day, what are the chances that the IT systems will be on-budget or ready on time?

It is amazing to me that in the #Brexit disaster neither major party is expressing the will of at least half the country to #Remain #givethepeopleachoice# lifeisnotabloodylobstertrap
EU officials are among the highest paid bureaucrats in the world. They are largely insulated from the huge costs of the red tape they impose on consumers, taxpayers and small businesses.  #Brexit
This is getting beyond satire. Sky picks to talk about #Brexit two ex-insiders: One Tory and one “Labour”. The “Labour” one is a former Tony Blair adviser. And  guess what? He disagrees with Jeremy Corbyn and Labour’s position!#BrokenMedia
We're told "the world is laughing at us" for walking away from the endless growth and overflowing riches the EU supposedly provides for members, but did you know Germany's economy is shrinking and business confidence falling? Why no TV reports?  #Brexit 
While Labour's attempts to play politics failed, SNP MPs will be holding the UK government to account in our emergency debate on Theresa May's failing #Brexit deal. 
Leave wouldn't have won the referendum if the Leave option hadn't been a vague catch all phrase capable of attracting support from people with bitterly conflicting views on #Brexit.  There is not and never has been a majority for any real form of Brexit. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

Scottish Conservative MP say plan for no-deal Brexit should have started after referendum vote.  More to the point is that the position of default should be to Remain in EU & not No Deal which is hugely damaging to a Scotland& rest UK #brexit @theSNP

From today's @FT #Brexit #secondreferendum #PeoplesVote #turkeys #Xmas
Those, like Jeremy Hunt, who glorify a no–deal #Brexit are totally irresponsible. It is not the job of politicians to make the people they lead poorer, remove opportunities, rights & make lives more uncertain. There is no such thing as a "managed no deal". 
UK is now the world’s largest stockpilers of fridges in order to ensure Britain doesn’t run out of medicine post #brexit...it’s what every last racist Barnsley pensioner wanted when they voted leave.& now we must stick with it forever.Otherwise they’ll blame educated people. 
I am now absolutely convinced that the U.K. will leave the EU with no deal and that was the plan all along. There will not be a “people’s” vote, there won’t be an extension of article 50,?there is no plan B, plan A is a delaying mechanism. U.K. OK?? Better Together? #Brexit
We need to take these anti-Brexit scare stories with a huge dose of scepticism. Blaming #Brexit ‘uncertainties’ has become an all-too-convenient way for businesses to cover up their mistakes, writes @Robspiked

I simply do not understand the mentality of those who say "I'm a big fan of Corbyn, I just don't like his stance on #Brexit His stance on Brexit *defines* him. Not only the pro Brexit prejudice but the dishonesty, the overriding of members, the weaknessIt's what he is
Leavers who say "we voted to leave the EU, end of" don't care whether it's a Norway+ #Brexit or a no-deal, or whether there's a small economic impact or a brutal recession. They don't care about the UK & its people. Patriots care about their country. They can't be bothered.#FBPE
How much responsibility do you think the mainstream media have for the #Brexit mess we’re in now?(Please retweet to increase the size of this poll)
I smell a rat here. They managed to get 117 MPs to no confidence May. And now this. What is their game now? #Brexit 
SIR – I suggest that those MPs now demanding a second referendum resign their seats and stand in a by-election, allowing the people to decide whether they wish to retain them as their representatives in Parliament or not.A true people’s vote.#Brexit #EU

I have put in an FOI request to see the government's #NoDealBrexit preparations & what it would mean for the UK. We must know the truth - the public and parliament cannot be kept in the dark. The Govt should publish in 20 days. #Brexit 
It’s Tuesday.Outrageous and scandalous that @theresa_may is blocking progress towards sorting out this #Brexit mess. How can she allow the uncertainty to fester? The #OnlyWayForward is a #PeoplesVote.If people still want to leave, so be it. But essential to ask.

I've been saying this for years, Theresa May is a danger to the people of this nation, she knows the disaster that's heading our way but will not listen, she doesn't care, its all about power, she's our worst nightmare, any decent person would rule out no deal #Brexit, not her.
Sam Hooper @SamHooper singles out a Politico hack for "indulging every tedious trope ever to have emerged from the Remainer hive mind." The Remainer press should simply not get away with the damage they are doing by smearing the UK's image. #csm #Brexit 
The mark of a good government is to maintain order and stability + avoid anarchy and chaos. So a “no deal” #Brexit must be avoided at all costs. If Article 50 needs to be extended or withdrawn, so be it.
If any proof was needed that the system of checks and balances in #politics in Britain is broken, dismantled by Blair and his hideous New Labour cult, then the current mess over #Brexit says it all, with the media no longer acting as honest broker and the EU calling the shots.

We really are living in scary times, a no deal #Brexit is being ramped up by right wing rags like @TheSun, May is threatening this disastrous scenario if Parliament doesn't accept her #BrexitDeal, its obvious Murdoch is behind this, in hoc with the Barclay Brothers, #StopBrexit
..so, now giving MPs a vote on the PMs #Brexit deal is considered to be “playing silly political games”. Dare I suggest that leaving it as late as possible is not in the national interest, is pure self-servative & anti-democratic manipulation by Tory govt & they are #frit?
Just three months to go until #Brexit day, and nothing is nailed down. Today the cabinet could conclude that ‘no deal’ must become the official working assumption. That’s as shocking as it is frightening, especially for citizens & businesses. 
So @DominicRaab - I thought I'd test out your hypothesis on my friend who voted for Brexit.His response?'Utter f**king tosh'.You're welcome.#Brexit #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
When the history of catastrophic no-deal #Brexit is written it's not the incompetent May or witless Corbyn who will get the blame. It's the supposedly 'sensible' majority of Conservative and Labour backbenchers who did nothing to stop them.

My constituents certainly did know what they were voting for when they voted for #Brexit. I’m glad the PM ruled out a second referendum as she has done consistently.

Greetings from Belfast, now a modern, developing city with many magnificent older buildings and one of the world’s best museums - Titanic. Stability and conflict resolution thanks to the GFA, now under threat from #Brexit 
A no-deal would be a brutal crime against the British people committed in the interests of a venal elite lusting after disaster capitalist profits, a fire sale of state assets & a #Brexit tax haven as the UK is forced to slash taxes to retain businesses. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
It’s actually a clever thing to do. Makes Tories look ridiculous, because those who had no confidence in her the other day, will now vote for her. It’s actually comical. It also keeps an unbelievably weak PM in power. Tories hamstrung and left owning #Brexit
Further to Nigel Dodds’ statement, a DUP source tells me they will support the PM in any vote of confidence because they “need to give her the space to get the changes she has promised us.” #Brexit

A ‘responsible government’, Mr. Hammond, would have put the breaks in #Brexit, halted #A50 and commenced a full and forensic investigation once it became FACT that #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw

For the avoidance of doubt, trusted EU contact says there are no #Brexit talks going on at the moment. Back-channel or otherwise. There are no new "assurances" in the pipes. Mrs May can try and wear down EU resolve over Christmas, but she shouldn't bet on it.

Thanks to Labour pressure May has had to announce a date for a Brexit debate and vote. The mainstream media narrative that Labour are doing nothing is typical BS. This Government really are the most shambolic in modern history.#Brexit 
*Breaking:* Jeremy Corbyn has just tabled a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May citing her reckless disregard for parliament by delaying the #brexit until January.
Jeremy Corbyn has tabled a motion of no confidence in the PM for her abject failure to enable a parliamentary vote on her #Brexit deal for a further month.
They are the product of EVERY MP and newspaper who played the #Brexit racist card, Faisal. See also Nigel Farage/Arron Banks, @LeaveEUOfficial & @LeaveMnsLeave . NOTHING to do with @SODEMAction _ we get even more abuse, believe me. #stopbrexit #peoplesvote

Why should Americans care about #Brexit? As I told @CNN, our closest ally is immersed in domestic challenges so unable to work effectively with us on foreign challenges. No deal would hurt US economic interests and Northern Ireland.
John Major knew UK public would probably reject Maastricht, so he transferred powers to Brussels without giving public a say.Blair/Brown knew Brits would reject Lisbon Treaty, so they also ignored the voters.By bypassing the people, the seeds of #Brexit had been laid. 
What tactics @PaulJSweeney is this?  Threatening and doing are two different things entirely & Scotland wontt forgive Labour for sitting on its thumbs Over #brexit. PM left off the hook for at least more than three weeks!  @theSNP are clearly the real opposition #brexitshambles
 Does ⁦@PaulJSweeney⁩ have no shame or does he think our heads zip up the back? #brexit #meaningfulvote
We've had our People's Vote in Lincolnshire and the people voted to Leave. If we get legally binding guarantees that the UK can exit the backstop unilaterally, then we should keep calm, carry on, and secure the #Brexit that 17,410,742 people voted for. 
It was Monday all day today.And the whole situation is just so damn depressing. Anybody in their right mind knows that #Brexit is madness, yet we are being told we have to deliver on the result of a soiled referendum. It’s all just unbelievable.Simple solution:#RevokeA50
 Knowing that she can’t get her #Brexit deal through Parliament, Theresa May now wants to silence debate. That is unacceptable, it's now time to call time on this Tory government. 
An excellent opposition party we have, one that is exercising great skill as it engineers the fall of May & the Tories, and engineers a #GeneralElection. What would be handy 'right about now' is for those who claim to want to avoid May's #Brexit or #NoDeal to get behind #Corbyn.

Dreadful statement from the PM following her meaningless negotiations with EU27 last week. Brought back nothing apart from a sense that we are heading for a no deal #Brexit. What does the UK do in these circumstances - sends its Parliament on holiday for two weeks - unacceptable!
I actually thought he was about to do it. I really did. Corbyn's whole speech was geared up to call it, and then he didn't.  Totally shat it. What an anti-climax that was.  #PatHisShants #Brexit
Chris Green MP - "Gavin Barwell is on record after the referendum decision, calling it a racist, divisive decision in a tweet."Barwell is the problem in heart of No 10 Downing Street. I don’t know what he is doing behind the scene, but he is driving a 2nd referendum," #Brexit 
This was probably the worst session May has had in the Chamber. She is notorious for giving non-answers, but I have never actually seen her give the SAME non-answer again and again for over an hour. #Brexit
How DARE @SkyNews treat an MP so shabbily. Unprofessional & cheap.@DavidTCDavies is one of the few speaking truthfully on behalf of 17.4m UK voters & he was ganged up on, drowned out by LIES & finger-wagging hostility.Won't stop #Brexit like this, Sky, you merely entrench us. 
By delaying a vote on her #Brexit deal May is acting in the very opposite of the national interest - forcing public services & businesses to waste millions on no deal contingency plans. 
May is coming under intense pressure to bring the inevitable defeat of her horrendous #Brexit deal forward to this week - she's even getting criticism from the handful of MPs who were willing to vote for it! She & her government are a disgrace & an international embarrassment.
Voters will not understand why MPs are going on holiday for two weeks without holding a key vote on the #Brexit deal, Conservative Nicky Morgan tells Theresa May Updates: 
Given May’s latest reckless postponement of a vote on her #Brexit deal, incurring £billions of costs as no deal contingency plans are activated, how much longer can @CBItweets & other business organisations put up with this? #peoplesvote
Wonder if anyone else thinks our MP's should simply cancel their Christmas break and spend the time sorting out this #Brexit mess. To take 2-3 weeks holiday in these desperate times is a national disgrace. Bah. Humbug!!!
The PM is now making an appalling #Brexit statement. She has no support for her dead-duck deal. After 45 minutes, not one MP has backed her. Where are the Tory grandees telling her, her time is up and that it's time to go?
The prime minister is "not listening and not allowing debate" - Conservative MP Justine Greening challenges Theresa May on #Brexit voteLatest reaction: 
.@YvetteCooperMP "If she [@theresa_may] carries on like this she is the one who will take us over a no-deal cliff edge" #Brexit
In her statement to the House of Commons, the Prime Minister announced that the Government intends to hold the #MeaningfulVote in the week commencing 14 January 2018. #Brexit 
Former Tory minister @JustineGreening goes much further than @jeremycorbyn in insisting the meaningful vote should be this week - and accuses the PM of stifling debate #Brexit
.@NigelDoddsDUP wants the PM to set out precisely what she is asking for from the EU to allay his backstop concerns. The prime minister repeats what she has said to him before. We are in a death loop. #Brexit

#Brexit = Bloodless anarchy and insurrection. Brexiteers (read: the poor) want to destroy HMG as payback for decades (if not hundreds of yrs) of humiliating marginalization. The economy will collapse, but the poor don’t care. HMG abandoned them long ago.
For a huge constitional change won by lies, cheating, crime and foreign interference to be pushed through against the clear will of the majority would be a grotesque abuse of democracy and little short of bloodless coup.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit

According to @SkyNews, Jeremy Corbyn has said that if the PM does not announce a fixed date for the #Brexit vote, he will table a no confidence motion in the Prime Minister today. This differs from a parliamentary vote of no confidence in the government, it is specific to the PM.

Non-entity Tim Martin, owner of Wetherspoons, on the BBC AGAIN???   WTF does he get so much exposure on the BBC??  His personal views are simply irrelevant. He speaks with absolutely no authority on the issues related to #Brexit#PoliticsLive
In years to come children will read about #Brexit in their history books and ask their teachers: "Why did parliament not stop that mad woman from wrecking the country?"And: "why was the result of a corrupt referendum ever allowed to stand unchallenged?"
It's obvious to everyone that #Brexit has failed dismally. No-one is happy and every option on the table looks as though it will damage the country, cause job losses and negatively affect our families for years to come. Time to abort and get on with life as full part of the #EU
With #Brexit in chaos, the United Kingdom faces three main choices: no-deal Brexit, a referendum or a last-minute deal. Here are the possible scenarios: 
Delivering more Corbynometers to @jeremycorbyn’s final surgery of 2018. Unfortunately we only met his case workers but by now we’re certain he knows his constituents and party faithful around the UK are looking to him to back a #FinalSay #PeoplesVote on the Tory #Brexit disaster 
MPs who are plotting for a 2nd EU referendum seem to have forgotten they work for the British people & they represent us. If MPs won't respect the vote why should we respect the legitimacy of Parliament? Parliament owes its sovereignty to the British people, implement #Brexit
Say we indulged the frothing lemmings who want a faux #PeoplesVote.Q: What compromise do THEY intend for 17.4m Leavers?A: None whatsoever.Q: Why then are we bending over backwards to compromise?A: Because we're idiots, led by the nose by lying media.102 days until #Brexit.

"Wages up 38%" is a positive headline, but read this report on pay increases for workers after the #Brexit vote caused a (modest) fall in EU immigration and you'll see bosses consider it a catastrophe. The EU  benefits #VestedInterests, not "the many".

“If you want certainty you have got death and taxes… I do think it is slightly pathetic to say: Give me certainty” Tim Martin #Brexit #politicslive 
May's outright refusal for a #PeoplesVoteNow is a very clear indication that she lied when she said she supported remaining in the EU. She's just another far right xenophobe scared stiff that her precious #Brexit will be stolen from her at the final hurdle.

Still Not a sight of a NO Confidence vote from #Labour OppositionStill Not a sight of a motion requiring a vote this week.#Corbyn  is May's  little #Brexit helper. 
It's one thing for a former Prime Minister to express their view – but it's quite another to actively undermine your own country during crunch negotiations by advising and supporting the other side:  #Brexit
Imagine it's Christmas Eve and the company that supplies your power suffers a major outage. Instead of fixing the problem they all just say sod it and break up for Christmas leaving you in limbo until the New Year.That's what the government plans to do over the #Brexit impasse.

The usual lies about the Good Friday Agreement on @SkyNews.Suggesting No Deal #Brexit breaks the GFA, but craftily disguise it under the "spirit' of the deal, rather than point to anything actually BROKEN.A procession of propaganda poodles, peddling the lies for the man.

The lies never stop.Car sales have dropped due to the diesel engine fiasco & a drop in demand in US/China.We can blame EVERYTHING on #Brexit, or we can tell the bloody truth, like adults.
The fact that so many politicians and journalists have different interpretations of 'what people voted for' with #Brexit surely shows that there was no consensus on... what people voted for.Should probably make sure with a #PeoplesVote again, shouldn't we.
Wouldn't it be a interesting if, before claiming on TV they know what the people wants re #brexit , all journalists, MPs, Lords & Knights have to state if they've actually ventured outside London recently and if so where?
Consider where Labour would be now if they had said 2 years ago "we support the result but cannot agree to A50 without a meaningful plan"A50 would still have gone through, but Labour would now be the other side of 2 years of saying "we said this #Brexit shambles would happen"

A second referendum would break faith with Britons, May to warn MPs.No @theresa_may it is the greedy and arrogant political elite trying to deny the people the right to vote on facts rather than lies & fantasies who are breaking faith with Britons.#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
I see the Prime Minister thinks a #PeoplesVote would do “irreparable damage”to politics.   Utterly lacking self awareness as ever - does she not see the “irreparable damage” she is doing  to our prospects, prosperity, fellow #EU citizens and reputation in the world?  #Brexit
Another #Remain myth busted! There is NO requirement for an EU member to have a minimum wage. Indeed 6 member states have no minimum wage at all: Denmark, Italy, Cyprus, Austria, Finland and Sweden.The UK government created and supports the minimum wage NOT the #EU#Brexit

I suspect this is a big strategic error by the PM. It elevates 2nd referendum to the status of 'chief alternative' to her Deal. And the argument that it would be divisive will be considerably weaker should her Deal be vetoed by a Parliament unable to agree on what to do. #Brexit 
Theresa May has handed in her homework. It may be good or it may be total crap. But she wants an A from you, no matter how good or bad it is. If she doesn't get an A, she says, she'll burn the whole school down. Sound reasonable to you? #Brexit

“Let us not break faith with the British people” @theresa_may will say today. Well, Mrs May: you already have. Because your one job is to look out for, and work for, what’s best for them. Your #Brexit deal is not best for them. 
1. Remain keep telling us we should have a second referendum now because "we know more than we did in 2016" To a point that's true. We know a lot more about the deal on the table, and a lot more about what no deal really looks like.  (#Brexit thread)

The @UKLabour party on #Brexit reminds me of Cornish wreckers in past centuries, waiting for the good ship Britannia to break up on the rocks so they can salvage what’s left. That is not a mature political policy, guys. Instead you should back a #PeoplesVote and #StopBtexit.

#PeoplesVote is a con.1) Pink Gin Soubry says it's TM's deal or no deal.2) Chuka says it's In or Out.3) Caroline Lucas suggested 3 options, to split Leave vote.4) UK Media just push the title, no options, they just want to frustrate #Brexit.Charlatans, each & every one.
So #brexit is proceeding like a task on The Apprentice. What we need now is not a new referendum which could bring us back to this same point but a complete reboot: a government with the courage to say this isn’t working, revoke Article 50 and apologise for wasting our time.
#Brexit will make us worse off. The Tories and Labour are actively pursuing an agenda that will make our lives harder.I will never, ever forgive them.#PeoplesVote

My winning Leave vote in 2016 was not cast so that the UK could do a deal which keeps an 'entwined economy' with the EU. It was to create a UK which is independent and free of the EU via a full clean exit.#Brexit 
#Brexit has uncovered an #EU enemy within at the heart of #Parliament.Despicable arrogant Hardline #Remainers who want to subvert democracy and sabotage #Brexit.If they do, they will unleash hell. 
Obvious now that these remainer MPs will find a way to stop a no-deal default #Brexit when May’s deal is rejected — & are going to push a SECOND REFERENDUM on this country with remain as an option. The ONLY option they want. Traitors to democracy & ! #Marr #BBCSP #Ridge @LBC

JC wants JC-#Brexit. If he can't have that he'll accept Tory-#Brexit and try to 'convert' it later. Either way that's #Brexit. Corbyn is pro-#Brexit. (Most in LAB aren't but Corbyn is ignoring that). Remainers mustn't fall for this.

Brexiters yell "you didn't like the result in 2016" at us. What is wrong with believing 52% to have been mistaken? Democracy is not dictatorship of the majority. That a majority believe something does not make it true. Opposition is at the heart of democracy.#PeoplesVote #Brexit

Another thing we've learnt from #Brexit is how astonishingly dishonest many of our MPs are. Not a little bit dishonest, but bloody great huge bare faced lies.

It has been 5 months since @JustineGreening's prophetic article predicting that parliament would end up gridlocked on #Brexit and that the only way to break this would be by giving the people a #finalsay. When will our government admit that all other options are futile?
Theresa May is playing the cynical game of ignoring the tens of thousands of activists and millions of supporters of a #PeoplesVote and trying to blame it on Blair & a few other politicians. It is Theresa May who is subverting democracy with her deceit. #Brexit #StopBrexit

Proof that EU nationals are a bargaining chip in #brexit. Taking away people‘s right to vote for the parliament of the country they live in is plain wrong. Scotland will decide who gets a vote in #indy2 . #DissolveTheUKUnion
It is time that Labour members bypass #JeremyCorbyn and join a cross party drive for a #peoplesvote or we sleepwalk into a disastrous no deal #Brexit. #StopBrexit
I keep seeing #Brexit positioned as a "right wing" matter (e.g. last week's protest march in London in support of full exit from the EU). This is wrong on two counts: there have always been many on the left opposed to EEC/EU; and "right wing" is used (meaninglessly) as an insult.
What can New Zealand teach us about #Brexit? 
Daily reminder:The managed no deal the #Brexit Desperatti are now referring to is the very same crash out disastrous no deal that everyone agrees would be devastating to everyone and everything we hold dear.
In 2½ years, #Brexit -ers have moved from "we'll have our cake and eat it" to "poverty will be good for us"; from "easiest deal in human history" to "let's have no deal". How can you trust them? You can't.

Theresa May has angrily condemned calls for a second Brexit referendum from former Prime Minister Tony Blair. #Brexit 
Theresa May was right. Yes, I just said that. Tony #Blair intriguing in #Brussels in the middle of #Brexit negotiations there, seeking to subvert British democracy was “an insult to the office he once held and the people he once led”. I would go further. It was an act of Treason
Is it just me or does there seem to be a lot less Union supporters around on social media? and I'm not taking about the troll accounts with 10 followers. Is it possible I've blocked them all or they've blocked me  or have we passed peak Yoon? #Brexit #DissolveTheUnion
Britain, I share your #Brexit pain. So, Alastair and I, have used "best endeavours" to increase it, by going to Brussels to undermine the #BrexitDeal Sadly,you voted for Brexit because, you were mislead/northern/nostalgic/racist/senile/stupid. You don't know your place but we do.
Theresa May is being urged to give her MPs free rein to vote for a second referendum, with a new group of ministers poised to back another public ballot on #Brexit. #PeoplesVote

Dear M @JunckerEU,As a private citizen of the UK (just like Tony Blair), I would like to make an appointment to discuss #Brexit. I understand that, unlike Mr Blair, I haven't started any wars, or made millions from despotic regimes. But surely, those cannot be the criteria?

This is a significant comment from the European correspondent of @TheEconomist on Scotland, #Brexit & independence. Time for Scotland to start thinking internationally. 
The cabinet is deeply split by up to 3 factions over #Brexit - It will be surprising if there is not a move to force #May to resign - she has completely abrogated her 2017 election manifesto and her brexit deal has totally failed - an honourable person would resign forthwith
Whatever Britain's political sovereignty aspirations, its economic future is tied to Europe, says @charles_ries. The U.K.'s most important trading partners are the other 27 members of the European Union.  #Brexit

#Brexit in a nutshell 
The 2016 referendum excluded three of the most affected groups: 16-17 year olds, Brits abroad for 15+ years and EU27 nationals while giving Commonwealth citizens the vote. An injustice that gave #Leave the victory. #Brexit is built on the abuse of democracy, #PeoplesVote #FBPE
Brexit promised to unite the country; to rally the people behind a patriotic vision of the future. Actually, what it has done is divide the nation, stoke the flames of hatred, bigotry & selfishness, and as a result, we are weaker. We must stop #Brexit as to avoid appeasement.
Do you think Parliament should get a vote on May’s #Brexit deal before Xmas. Pls RT
Rubbish Her driving force is to avoid #Brexit at all costs! @AmberRuddHR and her brother @RolandRudd are both #EU MAGGOTS working for the EU against #BRITAIN! We must stop her ongoing campaign to stop #BREXIT within the @cabinetofficeuk! @theresa_may must sack #AmberRudd! @DCBMEP

There exist many MPs who campaigned for Remain,who have not accepted the will of the British people,who wish to use their privileged positions to thwart #Brexit We will not allow them to succeed otherwise what hope is there for any semblance of democratic norms @AmberRuddHR
Rudd visited Bilderberg with Osborne. No press is allowed in & nothing is disclosed. Conspiracy theorists think global leaders r chosen or recommended here in secret. Meanwhile Rudd is everywhere & her brother advocates Remoan & second Referendum to stay in EU. #Brexit 
A #Brexit solution? How about party leaders give all MPs a free vote on the Withdrawal Bill, accept all amendments, so that EU governments will then know beyond a shadow of nebulosity what is the wish of parliament. You could call it putting the national interest first.
"The only way of breaking this gridlock is working cross party" - Labour's @BenPBradshaw says he welcomes @AmberRuddHR's comments that the parties should try to "forge a consensus".Follow the latest on the #Brexit fallout:

Amber Rudd is suggesting we need to "try something different".Yes, great idea.Let's try delivering #Brexit, nobody has tried to do that yet.
If we leave the EU and THEN have a referendum to rejoin it is not undemocratic. If you have a 2nd referendum BEFORE the 1st one has been then you are just forcing people to vote again because you don't like the answer they gave you first time out. THAT IS undemocratic #brexit 
Economist Gerard Lyons - "Here is the opportunity in the future. We trade under WTO terms, we go to tariffs which are a tax on imports and can be cut to zero."We need to keep the lies and the fears in context against the longer term opportunities." #Brexit 
I would prefer leaving with a good deal but if said good deal is not available then leaving on WTO terms is nothing to fear. #brexit 
Dear Diary,It's so odd to think that all the Brexiteers - who seemed to be normal, and thinking about work, home, kids, parents, friends, holidays, hobbies and entertainment - were actually sitting there thinking: "Oh, no. Europe's really oppressing me again, today."#Brexit

There can only be one viable solution to Brexit, a managed withdrawal to a world trade Brexit (WTO) with a paid for time limited transition phase that would respect the referendum, democracy and the two parties concerned, the UK and EU and a change of our leadership.#Brexit
It seems like Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar is panicking because he knows a WTO Brexit would be bad for the Republic of Ireland. It is his childish grandstanding over the Irish border that has prevented any deal being signed so he shouldn't complain. #brexit

Some of us have been talking and campaigning on that basis for a long time @NickBoles - not about unity governments or anything of the sort - but out of common concern for the futures of country and our constituents. It’s time for a @peoplesvote_uk to end the #Brexit chaos.
It's worth watching the Blair speech today. He employs every single slippery disingenuous argument the legacy remain camp have. When coming from his lips it's easy to see how transparent it all is. These people are not democrats.#Brexit
For May a #PeoplesVote is the safest option. Voters can be held responsible for whatever happens next. The Brextremists would fume & rage, but it would be very hard for them to coherently oppose an exercise in democracy. Has May the flexibility to see this?#Brexit #StopBrexit

Theresa May's said she would get meaningful changes to her #Brexit deal - she failed. May comes back to the UK with a deal that cannot pass Parliament, will do economic harm to Scotland & brings 'No Deal' even closer. Here are four important takeaways.

Theresa May’s botched #Brexit deal failed for many reasons this week, a key one being the backstop. That’s what angered a lot of her MPs and her DUP parters. So she made the whole point of her trips to Europe to fix this issue. Listen to this DUP MP to see how successful was she:

Great pic by the @EUCouncilPres:  @markrutte intervenes in the "robust" discussion @theresa_may had with @JunckerEU today, as she described it. Apparently she complained about Juncker's remarks yesterday when he called her demands on the backstop "nebulous" #EUCO #Brexit 
#Backstop needed if no trade agreement by end of 2020.We voted to #LEAVE over 2 yrs ago.Most people will be amazed to know that trade talks have not even begun.#Brexit has been handled appallingly, in a deliberate attempt to string it out & eventually stop it.It won't work.

Another #Brexit #thread1/ Here's the thing about the Theresa May — Jean-Claude Juncker spat over whether May was vague or not at the #EUCO summit table about her Brexit demands. It’s a sideshow because the undeniable reality is that Westminster-at-large is vague.
Many Brexiters think we can go to "WTO Rules" and we'll be fine. In this video, I explain, in no uncertain terms, why "WTO Rules" would be as far from "fine" as you can get.#WTO #WTF#3Blokes#Brexit
Dozens of yellow vest protestors swarmed major bridges across London today, chanting: "What do we want? #Brexit. When do we want it? NOW." 
David Icke - "The arrogant political class, on the right, in the middle and on the left, was shocked because the great unwashed had spoken. "But they have worked ever since to undermine #Brexit. Theresa May’s proposal hands all the aces to the EU." 
#ICYMI: #TheresaMay & #EmmanuelMacron. Crisis at Christmas!  #Brexit #YellowVests
People are getting fed up with this ridiculous blame game. Our country is turning into a laughing stock as our entire #Brexit so called negotiations descend into farce. It’s time we faced up to reality the only way to sort out the mess is a @peoplesvote_uk

This is a much watch. STOP feeling sorry for Theresa May. She isn’t listening. She is a bull in a china shop, wrecking our country in pursuit of her #Brexit obsession, that is clearly bordering now on madness. #remain in the answer. The question is how best to get there
In all the debate about #Brexit for some reason I find this quite moving.Michael Heseltine and Ken Clarke are at a stage in their political lives where they've nothing to gain from feeding people myths. They have seen govts come and go. They speak with clarity and wisdom. 
"We're not ready for No Deal #Brexit."Tough we gave you almost 3 years. What were you doing, building the bloody factories?The failure to prepare is on the unprepared.UK patience, like our money, is not limitless.

WOW! As if supporting #fracking wasn't enough, now Claire Perry, Min. for Clean Growth and Energy, is siding with the #climatechange-denying, #fossilfuel-loving President of the United States! Is this due to #Brexit or is it because the US is the largest fracker on the planet?

“Remainer fearmongering about a No Deal #Brexit is such a low and cynical form of politics. They’re using terror to try to make us change our minds. But it won’t work because we’ve made our decision: we want to leave the EU and regain our sovereignty.”Brendan O’Neill on Sky 
We've got two options. We either rely on discredited political dinosaurs like Tony Blair, whose neoliberal policies are largely responsible for #Brexit, or we trust Jeremy Corbyn, who has consistently been on the right side of history and is playing Theresa May like a fiddle.
Why not? The EU are threatening that they're stepping up #NoDeal preparations as we speak. @LabourLeave are right – we need a full public inquiry into whether the Government and/or Civil Service deliberately blocked contingency planning in order to make a real #Brexit impossible.

Corbyn is the only leader of a major political party who isn't completely ignoring one side of the #Brexit divide. The Tories have abandoned Remainers. The Lib Dems, SNP and Greens have abandoned Leavers. It's easy to disregard 17.4m voters when your job isn't to win a GE.
“If we have another vote then British service men & women will have died for nothing”.You know what, maybe the unpleasant brutal truth is that our country is just too stupid for any sort of rational thinking. Perhaps we need a no deal #brexit. We certainly deserve it. 
Every day Labour front benchers make CLEAR Labour's #brexit position.Every day journos and FBPE idiots say "...but we don't know what Labour's position is"Here's daily clarification no 926 
The biggest #Brexit fig you haven't heard of: £45 trillion. This is the value of a bunch of financial contracts - called derivatives. These are at risk because the EU hasn't confirmed they will be recognised after March 2019. UK has. What's a derivative contract? Well...1/thread

Dear Diary,I often think of the morning after the #referendum. I sat open-mouthed as Nigel Farage and other Leave leaders admitted on TV that the NHS statement wasn’t true.I honestly believed there would be arrests all day and that would be the end of #brexit. Such innocence.
Very important meeting with PM @theresa_may, to discuss the ongoing #Brexit negotiations. I look forward to working together with the UK during Romania's Presidency of the Council of the European Union. 
WATCH: Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there'll be no renegotiation of the #Brexit deal, reiterating the position of EU leaders who rebuffed Theresa May in her attempts to make the deal more acceptable to MPs 
Just remember folks, the people who wanted you to vote for #Brexit are all much better off than you, they think £70K isn't a lot of money, they think a low skilled worker gets less than £50K and that you losing your job is just one of those things that happens. They are OK Jack.

Here is my @politicshome article on why women, whose voices have been drowned out in the #Brexit debare, must now demand a #PeoplesVote.
We could step out of this swamp at any time if only we had a prime minister, but Tory MPs have ensured that we don’t. Theresa May is determined to sabotage #Brexit. It’s as if she has been hypnotised. So this week they guaranteed her another year in which to do even more damage.
9) ultimately we are in this #Brexit mess for one reason. Politicians lied to the public, for years.We still in this mess because Labour Front Bench, Tory FB & the ERG *continue* to lie to people, on every aspect of Brexit
It is so important that lies are called out. We are in the #Brexit end game and we have to be working with the truth. The impact this is having on real lives is not a game and the likes of John Redwood have a duty to speak the truth. He knows what he is doing and why. 
On Confidence & Supply & the implications of #Brexit for Ireland "It's the right thing to do for the country" @MichealMartinTD @rtepolitics @RTE_PrimeTime Watch back in full here: 
What lies behind May’s recent repeated assertion that she wants to get #Brexit ‘over the line’?Sounds pretty desperate to me.And a huge blunder. If she gets away with it, the gory dirty details behind this farce will continue to emerge for years.#RevokeA50
LIVE: Tony Blair addresses #Brexit and his views on the best way forward for UK & Europe 
If the UK is incapable of working out what it wants & then negotiating an exit deal with the EU (which has been & still is relatively well disposed to us) how is it going to fare out there after #Brexit, dealing directly with nations that have everything to gain from shafting us?

Britain’s best cartoonist delivers once again #Matt #Brexit 
The difficulties of the UK government pale beside the colossal, self-inflicted problems of the Brussels federal empire. The EU is in deep trouble, broken by major splits and economic paralysis:  #Brexit
"It is leaving that needs to be delivered upon & that means being out of the Customs Union, the Single Market, the European Court and not paying them large amounts of money. All things Theresa May used to promise, that's what she needs to deliver upon!"#Brexit 
This from a minister who wants Britain to #Brexit and therefore take the country out of the EU deal he’s celebrating 
Who does Leo Varadkar think he is? Not content with interfering in internal affairs of Northern Ireland, he's now interfering with our Mother Parliament. It's high time this Brussels pawn was put back in his little box. Best start raising taxes Leo, we're Leaving soon! #Brexit
Under 'no deal', Irish beef farmers, French beef and dairy, and Bavarian dairy farmers would lose market share almost instantly. For the UK, lower food prices could well be the unexpected bonus of the rejection of the present Withdrawal Agreement.  #Brexit

People think #Brexit has been pointless. It hasn’t. It’s served it’s exact purpose: to distract from the shameful effects of austerity on the poorest in this country whilst stoking the fires of division that help shore up the political charlatans who will do nothing to redress it

Following last night's #EUCO, Brussels is now preparing for no-deal #Brexit. The Commission will publish detailed plans for no deal next week, and the EU27 are drafting national legislationThe mood here is this: unless there is a 2nd referendum, we are careening toward no deal. 
#brexit Warmonger multimillionaire Tony Blair doing the rounds again. Trying to stop Brexit the IDIOT. Wants another Referendum, we had one 2016, 17.4 million voted leave EU. Another yesterday’s man interfering with Brexit. Shut up  No one believes anything you say. 
A must watch: May's #Brexit car crash at the EU detailed by Sky's Dominic Waghorn, This and other reports make clear this latest failure by May is down to her indecisiveness and weak leadership. She said she only had one job, a Brexit deal, she failed. How can she carry on as PM? 
Will EU citizens have the right to stay in the UK after #Brexit? Will they need to apply for a residence permit to rent a flat, apply for a job or open a bank account? What's settled status? Read our Q&A on #EUcitizensRights in 23 EU languages here 
"What we won't be doing is renegotiating the withdrawal agreement" - Irish PM Leo Varadkar says the Irish backstop needs to be part of the deal to "protect the peace and keep the border open". Follow the latest on the #Brexit fallout here : 
This was so predictable that it's blatantly obvious that the Tory no confidence vote was deliberately mistimed & premature. 2nd referendum now inevitable. #Brexit betrayal.

Take #NoDeal off the table; it is costing BILLIONS in preparations that are pointless and will only exacerbate tensions with EU27, who will not move now. Then faced with the reality of her deal or #PeoplesVote, bring deal to HoC & see how much #Brexiters really want #Brexit.

As @theresa_may returns from Brussels empty handed, has the realisation finally dawned that the only deep and special partnership the EU will ever sanction is remaining? What’s on offer isn’t deep and special - lawyers say it’s abusive. Leavers voted for #Brexit - deal or no deal
With @HMcEntee meeting @antoniocostapm at the start of the second day of @EUCouncil. Portugal has been very good ally to Ireland in Europe and on #Brexit 
We want a close partnership with Great Britain in which each partner can develop freely in the future too. However, the integrity of the internal market and the Good Friday Agreement must be upheld - Chancellor #Merkel after the #Brexit deliberations at the #EUCO last night.
EU leaders scrap plans to help Theresa May pass #Brexit deal after disastrous meeting after PM arrived without any proposals.Repeatedly ask what she wanted, May had no answers.
Many now say they should have listened to me over the #IraqWar Well listen to me now. Annuling the result of the #Brexit referendum would create social & political chaos in this country on a scale not seen for centuries. And not in a good way. If #Labour goes #Jones it’s over
This is the end of the road.There can be no fantasy renegotiation of the #Brexit deal - not by @theresa_may, not by @jeremycorbyn and not by anyone else.A #PeoplesVote is now our only option. Parliament must get on and deliver it.

What a surprise, the EU confirm that there will be "no further #Brexit deal negotiation" *and* May hasn't even received the assurances she's after. Her deal will be rejected - then there is nowhere else to turn for the Tories. We edge closer to the #Labour govt millions need.
OMG so much bile directed at #TonyBlair on #r4today on twitter this morning.Yes, he made a mistake, but compared to the current crowd, he's positively statesmanlike and has the rare gift of making complex issues easier to understand. Major & Benn had it too.  #Brexit
I’m surprised, because it’s the longest suicide note in history. If #Corbyn follows this latest peripatetic #Brexit turn from #OwenJones #Labour and #Corbynism are dead ducks ending in the same glass case in the Natural History Museum as Theresa #May @jeremycorbyn @SeumasMilne

Europhile politicians integrated Britain into the EU by stealth. Voters were deceived time and again, and British sovereignty was traded away without our consent. Is it any wonder we voted Leave?, writes Joel Rodrigues. #Brexit 
#Brexit fundamentally is not interests of the the #British public, the #UKs youth and will place the economy in a strait jacket for the next 20 years. Needs to be voted down at the earliest opportunity so the #UK can get back to business! @BrexitBin @BestForBritain #peoplesvote

"The sheer absurdity of Mrs May" - How she continues to be humiliated over a small #Brexit issue which could have been solved two years ago : 
"We expect the UK to provide clarity on intentions and next steps after #Brexit. We are ready for clarifications but no renegotiation is possible. We are also very happy with deals on #rescEU and landmark #EUJapan agreement". @JunckerEU following #EUCO
One of the tiny but telling hints of the British journalism mindset regarding EU: when asked if I am available for an interview, it’s always framed in UK time (@Monocle24 the exception). It’s as if Brussels doesn’t have its own time zone; always about them. #Brexit
I'm not a big #Brexit guy -my sister @Carolblynch is the expert- but I feel sympathy for @Theresa_May. She inherited a mess, is doing her job by dealing with it while all the men flounce off & resign, & her party critics keep attacking her but never offer their own solutions.
A Hard #Brexit would 'go a long way to bankrupt' Great Britain, says second referendum supporter Sir Richard Branson. The multi-billionaire says the PM should 'do what is right,' and tell the British public that 'we will be much worse off,' if we leave Europe. 
"Theresa May told to get stuffed by #EU leaders as she pleads for better #Brexit deal from Brussels" 
#Brexit Here's the reason Jeremy Corbyn has been very quiet on Labour's Brexit plans. He wouldn't do any better 
MAY IS FINISHEDShe humiliated and embarrassed herself at the EU. Both her and her botched #Brexit deal are bust. Expect:- Tory pressure on her to resign- More resignations and the start of leadership campaigns to replace her- A Labour No Confidence vote if the DUP support it 
Actually May humiliates us by staying in the room for such treatment. The negotiation is over. The outcome is not acceptable. Walk away and pay them nothing. Focus on the preparations that a competent government would long since have completed. #Brexit
#Brexit Old  dinosaur   Vince Cable meeting people in Brussels. Telling them  we all changed our mind want People’s Vote, and stay in EU. When are the people coming in white coats, to take the Old Duffer away. Can everyone stop pissing themselves laughing at Vince Cable.  pic.twitter.com/XNF2OXf1ts
The UK is in big trouble. Parliament is unfit for purpose. #Brexit is running around like a head with the chicken cut off. Our Money, Laws and Borders are applying for Irish passports. Revoke A50. Do it now! Who am I talking to? Oh, the lights are on but there's nobody home...

For those who did not believe yet, a huge #Brexit issue is its mismanagement. @theresa_may succeeded in deleting summit conclusions favorable to UK. @GeorgeWParker @alexebarker  via @FT
The best and most succinct summary I've seen of #EUCO #Brexit:"This is a group of powerful people who have lost patience with being treated like idiots." 
What is your opinion on #Brexit?
Look @theresa_may why don’t you just do a twitter poll on #Brexit and leave it at that.  - If ‘STAY IN THE EU’ does not get more than 50% then, we leave with the most voted for, leave option. Just RT this prime minister and you can forget about. @Number10press @lbc @mrjamesob
Tell you what..we're not France, nor Italy, nor GreeceCons & Labour Far Right, Further Left are mistaken in thinking they've won the agenda.In the UK #Brexit's awakened the Centre..I'm not talking LDs etc. beyond party there's now an #Remain army waiting to pay you both back.
The fascists aren't the ones who voted for #Brexit The fascists are those who, having LOST the referendum, want to stamp all over the democratic result along with those who voted for it, and keep having a #PeoplesVote until they get the result they want. #bbcqt
That told David Davis!#bbcqt audience member is right. Some MPs (esp. ERG) are behaving like children in a playground. It wasn't voters who got it wrong, but politicians, who thought they could get away with lying to us. Time for a grown-up reconsideration of #Brexit on facts.
Here’s a suggestion for #Brexit:1.Admit EU Ref was illegitimate due to illegal activity, jail Banks/Farage & co.  2. Stop current process            3. GE   GTTO 4. Another Ref with sensible choices, conducted legally (if majority still want it or needed for anti-austerity)
Theresa May's sense of British entitlement is crippling. If UK feels a need to be a great nation, stop hiding in the #Brexit closet, stop expecting EU to solve your problems, re-engage with EU, and be a European leader. Churchill wept 
If you think of all the myths, legends, monkey gods, virgin mothers, magic and superstition that humans have believed in since forever, is it any surprise that a massive targeted digital-age disinformation campaign engendered enough belief to deliver #Brexit?
Very disappointed that @UKLabour Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner, is opposed to a #PeoplesVote. Seems that she is more concerned with sucking up to pro #Brexit @jeremycorbyn than doing the will of the majority of pro #EU Labour members and supporters @bbcquestiontime
"And here you need to say openly that that need to happen in the United Kingdom now.“ Danish Prime Minister @larsloekke said at his exit doorstep after the #Brexit discussion Thursday evening that the European Council 4/4 #euco

.@ChrissieHynde, @AnnieLennox,  more artists come out against #Brexit 
If @NickyMorgan01 genuinely wants to know how parliament can find consensus then it’s quite simple really. Every MP should respect the votes of their constituents in the 2016 referendum instead of pretending that they know better. How about that? #Brexit #BBCQT
How is a GE going to resolve the issue of #Brexit?It can't!The only route to the resolution of this hellish impasse is a #PeoplesVote.And that means a referendum on the current state by the current electorate.Everything has changed in 28 months.#bbcqt
David Davis is of course wrong. He tried to claim there hasn’t been an economic impact from the #Brexit referendum. The Office for Budget Responsibly quoted figures which suggest the UK economy has lost £40-£50bn from lost growth since the referendum #bbcqt
DK PM Rasmussen slams May on his departure from #euco, says UK should have gotten a national compromise between political parties before negotiating with the EU to ensure a deal could go through, "like we did in 1992." #brexit

If a second vote on #Brexit is s #PeoplesVote who the hell voted the first time?
Confidence vote leaves us in #Brexit deadlock. But opens path for @theresa_may to move to a plan B if/when her deal hits the buffers in Jan. Big question: will she then have the bottle to lead us away from no deal to either second referendum or (less good) Norway?
TV station @AlJazeera did a feature on #brexit today and at the very start they had footage of protests outside parliament. Great to see that they caught #remainernow @Snoozette1 there with her sign making it clear that there is "no more 17.4m" as she is one of many #RemainerNow

193 out of 632 GB constituencies have changed from Leave to Remain between 2016 and Nov 2018, with swings up to 14%. All constituencies now back a #FinalSay. Implementing #Brexit looks like it will be soundly UNdemocratic in 2019.
One day, hopefully soon, Remainers will pick up on the fact that it was the Chinese import shock & UK unpreparedness which hit jobs and wages, not migration from the EU27. As it is we are missing a really important story.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #Brexit.

BOMBSHELL! Sir Bill Cash says  the Withdrawal Agreement is illegal.  Therefore May's Agreement is illegal and will not pass through Parl.  He asked May for explanation but no reply.    @borisjohnson #borisjohnson #boris johnson   #Brexit

The 117 Tory MP's who voted #NoConfidence in May must now form a party within a party - in no way should they quit the party - fight on all fronts until we rid ourselves of this woman who is shaming our country - thwart her at every turn until she is forced to resign#Brexit
Raab says Theresa May must quit as PM heads to Brussels in bid to save Brexit deal - latest updates  This is just the beginning - #May must be forced out - she lies and deceives the electorate every time she speaks pretending to be delivering #brexit
This tweet has had several 1000 interactionsBut the fact is no-one has been able to name a single thing Corbyn has *personally* done to help stop or even soften the effects of #brexitAgreement is an empty chair for the last 2 years would have been more useful#PeoplesVote
1. May’s real plea to the EU: save me from a #PeoplesVoteWhat a shameful piece of work she is.She's fought to exclude Parl from this now invalidated #Brexit.It took a citizen to let Parl in & more to determine that we can #Revoke A50 & negate No Deal.
WATCH: Lord Heseltine makes it clear that the only way to break this parliamentary impasse is to give the people a decision through a #PeoplesVote.Demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal:

@NickyMorgan01 & @DavidDavisMP may disagree about #Brexit, but they voted  13 & 7X for Bedroom tax51 & 30X to cut benefits So they both want disabled & vulnerable people to be a whole lot poorer!#GTTO@gaurangmorjaria @GeesQueen1 @georgegalloway @GoodbyeWaves @GracieSamuels
So there is absolutely No Doubt that there has been a Power Grab.  The Scottish Parliament did have the powers when the bill was passed. But Westminster subsequently ‘grabbed’ them so now they don’t.  So no one can argue there is No power grab #PowerGrab #Brexit
The PM and the Government will not allow debates next week on #Brexit or the withdrawal deal.This is a scandal.They are trying to run down the clock and blackmail Parliament into backing the deal by leaving it to the last minute.A #PeoplesVote is needed now more than ever.

Back when he thought it might suit him, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg supported a second referendum on #Brexit. He didn't seem to like being reminded of this by @thatginamiller on @bbc5live today, though.Would be an awful shame if someone retweeted it...#EndTheChaos
Bundestag votes to stand behind #Brexit deal, with backstop as is:"It was right to make the preservation of peace on the island of Ireland & the protection of @BelfastAgmt a common and inalienable core concern of all Member States at an early stage."
This can't be said loudly or often enough at the moment:"Most people in Northern Ireland support the backstop"@StephenFarryMLA @SorchaEastwood writing on @UKandEU#Brexit #WithdrawalAgreement
My take for @POLITICOMag on Theresa May's win and how things may play out from here #Brexit 
Rolls Royce is transferring some of its operations from Derby to Germany, yet another bonus of Brexit, I'm sure all the hard right no deal #Brexit supporters will be happy, after all this is what they voted for, the total collapse of our manufacturing sector #StopBrexit
Retrospectively passing laws that specifically discriminate against Scottish parliamentary decisions and the 5 million minority of Scots in the UK is a very dark road to go down.Very dark indeed. UK discrimination against Scotland must stop.#brexit#indyref2
It is unforgivable of the Government to condemn Britain & our economy to weeks' more uncertainty by refusing to put May's #Brexit deal to the country before Christmas. They should at the very least table a motion next week to rule out no deal. #brexitshambles #PeoplesVote
Theresa May survives no confidence vote, vows to ‘deliver #Brexit & better future’

Another reason why #Conservative members & voters are leaving the party. Cancelled my membership this morning. How can you have a Chancellor who believes that Leave MPs are “Extremists “? They are actually representing the 17.4m that voted Leave. #Brexit
If Mrs May has shred of self-respect she'd resign now.Third of her MPs don’t want her & rest support her on sufferance in hope she'll be gone by April.She said would stay on as leader “as long as you want me”.Well, that time is over!We want a leader to inspire us.#Brexit #EU

Not telling the truth are you  But then you’re a Tory #Brexit
Just to be clear - @theresa_may wasn’t left with #brexit, it wasn’t foisted upon her, she didn’t get dumped with the mess to sort out. She fought for the leadership, she chose to do this. She then chose to draw red lines, to undermine parliament, to be hostile to the EU. Choices
Tory MP @IoWBobSeely  on @BBCNews claiming Tory Remainer MPs are "Thomas Moores putting their consciences above the will of the people." So Bob, if you believe #Brexit is the will of the people, why are you so opposed to testing that in a #PeoplesVote?#StopBrexit
The British government are in chaos over Brexit. Ireland will not be collateral damage for the Tory civil war. The backstop must be protected. #Brexit

Yesterday evening when I logged on to Twitter, the top of my feed was dominated by tweets from Remainer cabinet ministers setting out why they support Theresa May. I don't follow any of these people and have never retweeted them. Strange. #Brexit
Rolls Royce is iconic. It is central to Britain being seen worldwide as a powerhouse of the very best in engineering and we're losing it because somehow #Brexit will improve our sense of national identity. We must put a stop to this utter madness. #PeoplesVote

An important thread from a Professor of Law who has read the @UKSupremeCourt #ContinuityBill judgment. Big takeaway is that Lord Advocate was right in his legal advice about the bill & the Presiding Officer was wrong #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
It was considered that the Welsh case for a Continuity Act was stronger.The @WelshGovernment scrapped its own Continuity Act recently following the inter-governmental agreement with the UK Government on devolved powers after #Brexit 
There’s nothing so glamorous as a prodigal son/daughter returned. Britain should recommit to EU and take lead in reshaping it when new Eur parliament and new Commission elected after May 2019. Golden opportunity. Our best chance. #brexit
#brexit : what is most likely?
I wonder how @KenMacintoshMSP feels this morning. Scottish Government entirely vindicated in the courts yet again. #brexit 
There are lots of TV shows about rogue traders. But #Brexit is the biggest of all rogue trader scams. The entire nation has been sold a product that doesn't work, and the rogue traders are telling us there is no refund.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
As #EUCO considers #brexit  I explain to European friends how chances of a 2nd referendum are going up & ask them to put long-term European interest in keeping UK in EU before short-term desire just to get the bloody thing done … 
End the Parliamentary Parlour Games & let the Prime Minister @theresa_may @10DowningStreet get on with thrashing out a #Brexit deal that will pass through the Commons #PMQS
The point is @edgarsrinkevics can speak about UK delusions knowing he is part of a consensus position of 27 states with a population of close to 450 million. The reality of post- #Brexit Britain is that an isolated country will be internationally weaker than one with partners.
Dear @jeremycorbyn, have you ever thought that making a strong case to remain & spend all of our #Brexit resources helping the EU create new trade deals & getting more Labour MEPs to shape the direction of the EU on immigration & other Brexiter concerns might get you more votes?
Got another #Brexit Plan...We swap the House of Commons for the House of Lords...the latter become the legislative Chamber & the Former, now disfunctional can STFU#RevokeA50 #StopBrexit#Remain in Control in the EU Just a thought..it's about as democratic as May's approach

If there is a General Election, I personally will not vote for any party which wants #Brexit in any way. The EU is the greatest peace process in world history. I will not be complicit in the moral crime which threatens that peace.

Now we have agreed to ban "Will of the People" in our #Brexit discussions, can we also outlaw the use of 1940?  UK may be retreating from the European continent but we are not at war.  Clinching argument: there is no Churchill in sight (sorry, @BorisJohnson ) #BrexitBarometer
WEAKENED.  @theresa_May flees to Brussels today to grovel for help!  WHY WOULD THEY,  she has brought this all on herself by her huge dishonesty.  Lied to UK, lied to Cabinet...  Only  @bprisjohnson can save us. #borisjohnson #Brexit
According to the Chancellor @PhilipHammondUK, wanting to know who makes your laws and ensuring the Establishment is accountable to the electorate makes you an 'extremist'. Any other extremists out there? #Brexit

Very disappointing to see that a couple of hardcore loyalist May backing MPs have decided to live in a Westminster echo chamber, & unfollow because of me being outspoken on #Brexit.  I thought we were about freedomI'm still a Tory & will express my views! #StandUp4Brexit
I wake up this morning with the certain knowledge that Britain is run by  political pygmies who KNOW @theresa_may ‘s Deal betrays #Brexit  and the electorate yet are too cowardly to kick her out

Wow this piece by @KuperSimon on #Brexit as a Tory cargo cult is just fantastic - unsettling 
Here's the state of play as we know it this morning #Brexit 
I did note vote for the UK to make a deal with the EU. I voted for Britain to Leave the European Union, Single Market, Customs Unions.Both Leave & Remain repeatedly said that's what would happen. So why isn't @theresa_may & co fighting for the #Brexit we voted for? #NoDeal

Rolls-Royce to shift work from Derby to Germany over #Brexit fears - Mirror Online 
A lot of historical Brexit analogies but I still believe the story of Franz sums it up. One cold February day he climbed up the Eiffel tower full of self belief - and jumped. #Brexit 
It’s not that 117 Tory MPs won’t vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. It’s that 117 won’t vote for *any* Withdrawal Agreement. The Withdrawal Agreement *is* #Brexit in reality. Faced with that reality, they’ll still pursue their own fantasy. Therein lies the whole problem.
UK establishment & EU have done everything to frustrate the #Brexit vote. PM has surrendered everything that she said originally she wouldn't surrender.USA & Oz trade on WTO terms with EU & it works fine.So could UK.UK needs to be prepared to walk away.
"The stupidity and the hypocrisy in the EU at the moment is that they are sticking to this because it suits Ireland to play games over Britush politics" At last. A politician (Ian Duncan Smith) has the guts to sum up the #Brexit Backstop issue @SkyNews
Lots of talk in parliament about the "National Interest".I'll clarify this for them.The "National Interest" is remaining in the EU. #FBPE #peoplesvote #Brexit

Alistair, You were elected on a manifesto that promised to deliver #Brexit. Instead PM is binding us ever closer to the EU with no exit door.Why do you find this acceptable? The Tory MPs  who are trying to deliver the #Brexit the 17.4m voted for are heroes, not ants.

A #Brexit reminder to PM and all MPs, not only Conservatives.  THIS is what we're talking about : 
After being duped by the lies of #Brexit riches, I came to my senses; want the govt. to either #RevokeA50 and stop this madness or call a #peoplesvote to see there are millions like me who have changed their minds. The will of people has changed. Why don't you listen @theresa_may
17.4 million of the silent majority, after 40 years, finally had the opportunity to speak about the EU in June 2016.  We said "LEAVE" we meant "LEAVE" and will accept nothing less than "LEAVE".  The Chequers/WA fiasco only hardens attitudes around the country for a proper #Brexit
The Prime Minister now needs to ramp up government's preparedness for there being no signed treaty by 29th March so that businesses are ready. Then we have a decent negotiating position to get a deal which commands support of the House and actually IS #Brexit.
This week we visit Copenhagen to see how Danish Parliamentarians are facing up to #Brexit. The Scandinavian kingdom was once suggested as a candidate to follow Britain out the exit door; instead we find very little enthusiasm for a ‘Dexit’.  on RT /

#Brexit .. Brexiteers seeking to diminish @theresa_may 63-37%  confidence vote and are still calling on the PM to resign. How then can the same people claim the referendum vote 52-48% was a decisive victory reflecting the will of the British people?
LibDems & SNP are predominantly Remainers.Labour's controlling Momentum crowd favour thwarting #Brexit.Tories are purging their party of Brexiteers.Where do these utter clown MPs think 17.4m votes are going, next time they face the UK electorate?#MoreBrainsInACreamEgg
You get the feeling that the TV journalists deliberately exclude anyone who might actually understand #Brexit for fear of being accused of interviewing people who are not real people. Educated, thoughtful or informed people are not real people.

I know we should be reaching out to Leavers but I just need to make an observationEvery leave supporter is similar-"just leave"-"just get on with it"-"just sort it out"I'm sorry, but if you haven't worked out by now that #Brexit is complicated then you are a bit of an idiot
Why have a confidence vote BEFORE #TheresaMay had to announce she'd got NO concessions from #Brussels ? The whole thing was so badly timed that it's obvious that several of the last minute letters calling for the vote were put-up jobs. #Brexit won't happen
That May says she'll go after "delivering #Brexit" is very telling - it means she doesn't care about what armageddon #Brexit wreaks upon the UK - she'll be off (like Cameron? Expensive shed?) spending their personal wealth & writing a book etc., which means she can be reckless. 
Conservative backing for MayMasks problems that won't go away;Finessing the backstopWill not make the flak stop -She lives to die some other day.#Brexit#1922Committee#TheresaMay
Honest and sincere question to my many @UKLabour friends who are pro EU. How do you feel now it is clear there is no long game and the stated aim of your party leadership is to stop the possibility of No #Brexit?
Your MPs were allowed a vote of confidence on your leadership. But we are not allowed a vote of confidence on #Brexit. One rule for the elite, one for us plebs.
Nothing solved by a Tory festival of chaos and a Labour party with an absentee leader#Brexit looms and parliament is paralysed -  #peoplesvote is only remedy
I bet your going to be overwhelmed with new members now @GerardBattenMEP, I joined about 2 months ago, I have never been a member of a political party before but can see that we must support @UKIP to keep #Brexit alive!!
MP on @skynews “every evening we leave Parliament we are literally stepping over people sleeping rough... there’re so many more important things for us to be debating that #Brexit” #SHARE #Homeless @shareshopsuk
So, @theresa_may wins the confidence vote. She stays on, until she can bring back a #Brexit deal that she deems good enough to pass through Parliament. Does anyone else feel as though she’s wasting everyone’s time? Time to admit the deal is finished, put it back to the people!

Over half of backbench MPs voted against PM.Why?Because she says she is delivering #Brexit, when she is doing the opposite.PM is tying us even tighter to EU with no exit doorThat is NOT what 17.4m voted forA PM who tries to overturn biggest democratic vote ever, is finished.
British PM Theresa May survived a challenge to her leadership, but the win does little to improve her chances of getting her #Brexit deal through Parliament. Here's what could happen 
How amazing would it have been if after the referendum the EU had said “we are sad to see you leave, but we respect your decision”.But no, they were never going to let the 2nd largest cash cow leave their corrupt clutches.We have now seen how greedy they are.#Brexit 
#newsnight 1) hard deal #brexit supporters, they're lying to you, againThere's still a hard core of no deal Brexit supporters on Twitter who repeat "leave means leave", "WTO rules" and, most importantly, "just walk away"The problem is, Mogg and Co aren't offering that
Only 200 out of 650 MPs support May to deliver the exact opposite of what she campaigned for. Just what madness is this? #brexit is a scam. 
"It was huge opportunity missed... it's deadlock"Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen says big questions remain about #Brexit as Theresa May survives a #ConfidenceVoteLatest: 
BREAKING: #Brexit blow - Raab, Davis and Foster launch ALTERNATIVE PLAN without May’s ‘POISON PILLS’.Not just the backstop, the backstop is a red herring, look more closely at the WHOLE deal.I.e. - ECJ jurisdiction over UK law & Sovereignty #WTF
The PM is safe for now but only on condition she stands down after #Brexit. It is clearer than ever that she doesn’t have the confidence of enough MPs to pass her #WithdrawalAgreement
Perfect getaway from #Brexit: supper with lovely Syrian refugees, the Arnaouts, & friends #CommunitySponsorship
This evening's vote offers some stability in all the political uncertainty caused by #Brexit in the UK. Now let's agree on the withdrawal agreement. It is a fair deal. A better deal will not be possible. @theresa_may
Tying a rope around Europe & signing away our Armed Forces #Banks, #Sovereignty  while  accepting whatever Rules #EuropeanUnion make up Then signing #Marrakesh #UNMigrationpact behind our Backs ...Isn't taking back Control R.I.P #Conservatives#Brexit#ConfidenceVote
What a waste of a day...pointless, pathetic and completely self indulgent. Now this is out of their system (some at least), MPs need to get back to solving the #Brexit crisis for the sake of future generations. They’re the important people! 
The risk of #Brexit is imminent, but it is not inevitable.Let's lead. Let's call a vote of no confidence in this government and back a #PeoplesVote
Full statement in response to #confidencevote A failed coupThe final desperate throw of the dice of the BrextremistsA vote of no confidence in a failed #Brexit project.Time for a #PeoplesVote and for Jeremy Corbyn to get behind it.
“If nothing else works, a total pig-headed unwillingness to look facts in the face, will see us through!”#Blackadder #Brexit 
We all have to stand together and show the people will not accept a half measure #brexit that does not do justice to what the referendum promised and then pay £39 billion+ for the privilege.
So, #Remain @Conservatives MP's support #RemainerMay @theresa_may to do a remain deal to remain in the #EU. Its time for the 117 (and more) to quit the Tories and join @UKIP, back Leader @GerardBattenMEP on #supplyandconfidence deal with @10DowningStreet to deliver #UKIP #Brexit
"It's exactly like the #Brexit vote in 2016... we've got to respect the vote"Conservative Party Chairman Brandon Lewis urges MPs to get behind Theresa May after PM wins #ConfidenceVoteLatest: 
While the #Brexit deal is far from certain, one thing is clear: even in the Tory party, there is no majority for no deal or hard Brexit. Time for cross party cooperation (like in the EU) to end the uncertainty at both sides of the Channel.
I just heard Richard Burgon MP @SkyNewsPolitics say that Labour wanted to stop the half baked botched #BrexitDeal & 'Stop the possibility of NO #BREXIT'? It's what he said..did he mean a No Deal #Brexit? If not he has just lost several million #Remain votes for the Labour Party
The definition of “acting in the national Interest” is not backing a lame duck Prime Minister #Brexit #May ?
If only @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and the #erg had believed hard enough, a glorious future would have beckoned. Never mind the naysayers and their “facts”, faith would have carried the day. After all, Britain doesn’t need people who can count past 48. #brexit #brexitchaos #brexitshambles
UK Prime Minister Theresa May says she will "get on with the job of delivering #Brexit" after surviving a #ConfidenceVote by members of her Conservative party

Rees-Mogg’s new catch phrase to criticise those who defeated him is ‘payroll’Lest we forget who’s payroll he is is on. The ERG.Disaster Capitalists.Trying to dodge their taxes.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg #NoConfidenceVote #Brexit
@theresa_may  says she’s listened to the  people who voted against her and in the next breath says the Withdrawal Agreement delivers a #Brexit people voted for. No it doesn’t . And she needs to change the bloody record.
No matter what you think of her, Theresa May has extraordinary stamina and determination. On the go for 25 hours. Amazing. #Brexit
Who now represents the 52% who voted leave? Not this PM, not this Government. #Brexit #MayMustGo
Bye bye conservative party.. cheerio ta ta! Join @UKIP and put pressure on the spineless career politicians and globalist appeasers!  #brexit #TheresaMay
LIVE: UK PM Theresa May gives a statement after winning confidence ballot by 200 votes to 117, surviving an attempt to oust her amid #Brexit chaos. 
24hrs later and we are still no clearer on what #Brexit looks look. We do know that no deal that is proposed will get through Parliament. Time for a #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain we say.
Keep fighting Owen. Had this been a vote of all Tories, not just MPs, she would have lost overwhelmingly. I cannot see many of us campaigning for another Remainer PM on doorsteps on cold January days. We need a real #Brexit and she has never even asked the EU for one.
Bad result for PM .  As she cannot secure any legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement.she cannot - with that scale of resistance - get her #Brexit deal through .  Opposition parties have a major opportunity to secure a #PeoplesVote if they work together.
"she should go to the Queen & resign" says @Jacob_Rees_Mogg She’s ninety fucking two Jacob, she’s not gonna want visitors at 9.15 #ConfidenceVote #brexit #torries pic.twitter.com/lCibm3H1nh
The Tories have snookered themselves. And in the process managed to shove the cue up their arses while handcuffing themselves to a drain. The only way out of it is a second referendum. #Brexit
Theresa May pulling up to the #NoConfidenceVote like #Brexit 
C'est la vie.#Brexit has come at a cost, but we soldier on. 
BREAKING: Theresa May wins confidence vote in the Commons.  She cannot be challenged again for a year.  The Tories clearly have no real intention of delivering #Brexit, and they should pay for this treachery with their seats. 
If UK intelligence wants a fair #Brexit referendum vote they HAVE TO let the public know what Russia did. I am the ONLY reporter who has said Putin made the referendum not “free and fair”. I can’t do it on my own. @gchq.
#ConfidenceVoteSo Rees Mogg and crew got 36% of the vote and is stating that the PM should resign.Funny that. 48% voted to remain but he states that we should have no voice.#FBPE #peoplesvote #Brexit

Do you think the @Conservatives can survive after voting to keep #TheresaMay in power? Is a @UKLabour party win/coalition now on course? Cast your vote and Retweet... #brexit #Conservatives #labour #libdem #ToriesAreToast #ConfidenceVote
Tory Party fundamentally split over #Brexit: exclude ministers and others on the payroll vote and majority of backbenchers voted against #TeresaMay! Now's the time for #JeremyCorbyn and the unions to step up a serious campaign against this weak govt for an early general election
Right. Can we now just get on with the job of #brexit instead of all this ridiculous in house nonsense. Let the woman do her job... which is to serve us as a country & get us a deal hopefully for the greater good of us all. #TheresaMay
Jeremy, you seem to have no clue as to how the membership regards May's leadership & her appalling performance regarding #Brexit.Expect more opposition from members.
Cue an awful lot of people who think winning 52% of a vote gives a total mandate to implement the most extreme interpretation of the "win" as possible complaining that winning 63% of a vote actually means no mandate and requires immediate resignations.#brexit
The little detour in the #brexit saga of the Tory #Leadershiphallenge changes  nothing:- there’s still no majority for her #BrexitDeal - no-one wants no-deal- the EU won’t offer her another dealSo draw the logical consequences...
I'm not being funny but if 175 of my work mates didn't like me and the 200 that did only liked me because I pay them. I'd quit my job #brexit #TheresaMay
117 Tory MP's have no confidence in their own Prime Minister. This is even more of a dent in her shattered  authority and adds to the #Brexit chaos. She has to go. We need @UKLabour gov.
1) We now have a situation where the Prime Minister cannot get her Brexit deal through Parliament: not last week and at not time before 29 March. There is nothing to negotiate that will make any difference. So what is the govt. going to do now? #ConservativeParty #Brexit
Fucking idiots. #brexit #maymustgo pic.twitter.com/GXJIHEl4t6
Delighted with the result tonight, the PM has the confidence of her party, we can go forward and find a solution that will deliver #Brexit in the national interest.
With 117MPs feeling strongly enough to vote for May's removal & the @duponline against May's deal, it is unlikely she can even muster as many as 200 votes in Parliament, now or in a month.We now have no alternative but a #NoDeal for those who want #Brexit#LeadershipChallenge
#BREAKINGU.K. Prime Minister Theresa May survives vote of no confidence but is still in deep political trouble: 200 have confidence117 do NOT have confidence 83 vote margin This vote weakens the political case for proceeding with #Brexit.
Now is surely the time for Labour to call a no-confidence vote. #Brexit #PrimeMinister
Heseltine on the money: #Brexit is Britain standing down, stepping away, from power. 
Und nachher guckt Theresa May noch"Die another day"#brexit #NoConfidenceVote
117 Con MP's vote against May 200 Con MP's vote for May in no confidence vote , she's a PM in name only she will lose every vote in Westminster on her shambles of #brexit deal , dead man walking
Theresa May survives the crisis of her leadership, wins 200 out of 317 votes in confidence ballot. That is to say, a majority of 83. Is the road to #Brexit any clear? Hell no!
I like to think Theresa May is running around Westminster right now singing I Have Confidence from The Sound of Music.#Brexit #TheresaMay
Theresa May has survived as leader but nearly one in three of her own MPs voted against her. And none of this changes the #Brexit impasse.
Can't wait to see all the Labour MPs jumping on the Prime Minister for winning a no confidence vote and demanding she stand down. Let's remind them of this! #NoConfidence #NoConfidenceVote #Brexit #BrexitVote
So now we know more than a third of the Parliamentary Tory party don’t have confidence in @theresa_may Hardly a resounding victory. In normal times she’d be toast. Time for parl opposition to unite & get her & her useless Govt our #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Tory MPs got a chance to vote on whether they have confidence in Theresa May. A majority did (though not nearly enough to get her miserable deal through Parliament).Now can the rest of us have a chance to say whether we have confidence in #Brexit?#PeoplesVote
Watching Jacob Rees-Mogg try and wiggle out of the fact that he lost by far more than 4% shows how he would have handled losing the referendum. #Brexit #TheresaMay #badLosers
A solid and welcome result for the Prime Minister. The Government can now focus on getting on with the job of getting the best #Brexit deal possible. The country is growing tired of the Brexit process + want us to move on to focus on other important matters that we face.
Oh dear. 200 stupid or Remainiac Tories out there. 117 side with #Brexit voters 17.4Mn. Lots of ppl gave their votes to Tories as they claimed they would leave CU/SM/ECJ. May's BRino doesn't do that. 117 brave MP's r #StandingUp4Brexit shambolic @Conservatives keep her in. Sigh
So much interest in my new found cave ,it’s got no WiFi or mobile signal a real #Brexit retreat for £100 a night  
So the Brexiteers can’t organise #Brexit or a leadership coup #TheresaMay #ukpol
Theresa May has won the no confidence vote. The result was 200 / 117.Theresa May's position is significantly weakened with her authority dramatically reduced. Calls are now being made for her to resign immediately.#politics #Brexit
Over 100 of her own MPs have no confidence in her. Can she survive? Surely time to go. Let’s end this #Brexit chaos and go for @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay #NoConfidenceVote

200 in favour vs 117 against. So, @theresa_may hangs on to power for the sole purpose of ensuring that her name is forever associated with making the #UK poorer, less significant on the world stage and limiting the prospects of its citizens. #Brexit
I actually feel for her, she is and always has been the brexit scapegoat, no matter who is in charge we are well and truly stuffed, this country is a laughing stock politically #brexit #NoConfidence #teresamay #government and all they do is laugh WTF
And there you have it Theresa May wins her confidence vote by 200 votes to 117. #Brexit No further confidence vote can now take place for at least 12 months.

This is so very sad, but so very understandable. The UK has become an undesirable and unpredictable place to do business for global firms thanks to #Brexit

"#EU officials warn that even if the Conservatives topple British prime minister Theresa May, the #Brexit deal on offer would remain the same. At summit, EU-27 leaders are only expected to give a statement on the backstop, no legal assurances."
Open questionIf Corbyn had been replaced by an empty chair for the past 2 years would it have made *any* difference in fighting a damaging #Brexit?What concrete contribution has he personally made in 24 months?
Can everyone else see the massive glaring irony that Tory MPs are getting a 2nd vote on TM's party leadership?#Brexit #Peoplesvote #Toryleadership #ConfidenceVote
20 min until the result...317 MPsIf >75 vote to no confidence her - May is If >100 - If >125 -  (big beasts might force her out still)If >158 - My guess - 120-130 vote to no confidence her, just under 200 back her#Brexit #TheresaMay

@BBCNews #ConfidenceVote #Brexit @BBCSimonMcCoyQuote of the day.
The Westminster circus over #Brexit is detached from brute reality of austerity. 14 million people in poverty, 4 million children, 1.5 million destitute. This is real crisis. Resisting normalisation of poverty, homelessness and immiseration is where the real struggle resides.

Dear United Kingdom, Thank you for keeping the United States from looking like the world's most self-destructive state! We appreciate being #2. - The USA#BREXIT #TheresaMay
Britain really is going to struggle to run a whole country without the EU guiding them through even the basics. More and more this seems like the kids being allowed to run the house by their parents. They have not got a clue. Poor divils. #Brexit
So if May doesn’t go by MP’s not voting her out they’re supporting staying within the EU’s clutches - this is not #BrexitThey’re not delivering the result of the referendum or the manifesto upon which they were elected#ConfidenceVote
The #Brexit / Tufton Street "spin room" is in full effect. This is why we should know who is being put on air and who is funding them.
You caused this mess! #Brexit is the result of your failure to tell the ERG to sod off. It's pathetic. Brexit has & will damage the UK. We're already sovereign, can control our borders, & do trade with both Europe & the RoW. 2.5 years wasted on this Tory nonsense. 
My German Jewish grandparents were stripped of their citizenship, transported out of Berlin in a cattle truck and gassed at Auschwitz.This is how #Brexit has re-ignited Nazi ideology.Thank you @mogg_jacob @theresa_may & @conservatives Here are *your* people.#iameuropean

If MPs think the last GE was a disaster with @theresa_may as leader, how do they think the next GE will turn out if Conservative MPs assist @theresa_may in betraying #Brexit and the UK electorate?
If more than 2/3 of Tory MPs tonight vote in favour of keeping @theresa_may on as PM - that’s over 200 - she will have won more comfortably than feared BUT without changes to Irish backstop the DUP will not vote for her current deal. So the #brexit vote will still fail.
The UK is literally falling apart due to entitled Tory dingbats and #Brexit Partisan America drowning in a Trumpian @GOP crime swamp and red ink. Australia is rudderless with a riven, incompetent @LiberalAus fighting amongst themselves. The common denominator? Vote.
Getting a 1000% increase on a zero salary is a very fast rate of increase too. How stupid do you need to be to become an MP? Is there special course you need to attend? People are much worse off than 2008, national debt has nearly trebled & now you are pushing a damaging #Brexit

The contrast between the house of commons debates and then the debates in the Bundestag is astonishing. I think this chit chatty school bullying of the house of commons is one of the reasons why #brexit happened in the first place. Politics that depend on being snarky and witty
Extending FG+FF Confidence +Supply deal into 2020 is right decision for the Country + will allow Govt to plan comprehensively through 2019 for #Brexit +other Govt priorities. Both parties have acted in the national interest at an important time when political certainty is needed!

Michael Heseltine pointing out very articulately the seriousness of the situation facing the UK  #Brexit Those elected MPs need to face reality - and get on with the job they’re paid and elected to do. Any thinking they’ll be heading home for the Christmas recess? Think again!!
Being PM is tough by any measure. Being PM of the UK seems to be tough beyond measure. #Brexit

Theresa May tells MP’s “I’m just here to do the bidding of a cabal of elites, once I’ve signed up to BRino & given away Britain to eternal subjugation, I won’t stand in Gen Election. I’m going to leg it job done & you’ll get Corbyn, good luck with that!”  #Brexit
Clement Attlee's comment to Harold Laski in the post-war Labour government comes to mind: “A period of silence from you would now be welcome”.#Brexit #TheresaMay
What a dreadful and utterly divided Government. Surely it is high time for the Conservatives to make way for a new Government. @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour @ReadingLabour #Brexit
Andrew Bridgen MP - "Effectively, the Prime Minister’s been drowning politically and Angela Merkel’s throwing buckets of water at her."It’s not a good position to be in. I don’t think Theresa May can lead us forward now." #Brexit 
David Davis' greatest hits:-1st calling point of the UK's negotiator immediately after #Brexit will not be Brussels, but Berlin, to strike a deal (Nope!)-There'll be no downside to #Brexit (Lie)-EMA/EBA won't leave (Lie)Found those excruciatingly detailed impact reports yet? 
Nadine Dorries MP - "What I would say is that, if Theresa May survives, I think she will only just survive."And I think that will be even worse because I think she will be even more mortally wounded than she is now." #Brexit 
This is me walking into a No Confidence vote I wasn't prepared for x#NoConfidenceVote #Brexit 
Bernard Jenkin MP - "Theresa May no longer commands the respect of the House of Common and that’s the lynchpin of our constitution."The Government cannot Govern unless it has the confidence of the House of Commons." #Brexit 
Labour stands for millions of jobs. The Tories are arguing over one job. That’s the difference between us #BrexitMy article today in the @MetroUK
Get your @Conservatives membership cards ready folks, we're all about to be politically homeless tonight.#Brexit will only be delivered by the fall of this government.So fall it must. 
Incredible, Chris Grayling says if May wins it will allow her to go back to Europe AGAIN to try and renegotiate. She was there YESTERDAY FFS. They've said NOThese Tories are not only cruel & archaic - they've f**king thick as well. #NoConfidence #Brexit
The board review is in for Theresa and things aren't looking promising#Brexit 
Theresa May must put her #Brexit deal before the Commons as soon as Parliamentary time allows, not delay until January 21st! She may survive her own party's vote of no confidence, but Parliament must be able to express its lack of confidence in her deal! 
Stalemate – In 70 years of racing at @SilverstoneUK , @Brands_Hatch and #Aintree, there have been as many wins by European drivers at the #BritishGP as there has been by British drivers (26-26). #Brexit @F1 #WednesdayWisdom @LewisHamilton #Formula1
Theresa May is no Margaret Thatcher. Her weak-kneed #Brexit withdrawal deal with the EU is nothing less than a humiliating surrender to Brussels.Tonight the Prime Minister faces a vote of no confidence in her leadership within the Conservative Party. 
I'm predicting the Opinion pieces congratulating Fianna Fáil on its fair-minded self-sacrifice in putting the country first to begin on Friday. Probably beginning with articles from former FF'ers who won't mention that they're former FF'ers.  #Brexit

Alas Steven, none of these MPs seem to understand that if May wins there are huge numbers of voters who will not forgive.  Long-term repercussions.Distinctive #Brexit research and news: 
I am told some wavering @conservatives MPs are demanding a timescale for  @theresa_may to go not a vague promise of after #brexit Some want a pledge of no early election and repair of the relationship with the DUP
Extraordinary leadership from @MichealMartinTD in extending government's lifetime. His party won't be happy but it's the right thing to do. Who would have predicted a completely unstable minority government would be made more stable by something like #Brexit?
UK PM Theresa May could be toppled if #NoConfidence vote against her wins a simple majority. Here's all the latest updates:  #Brexit 
You still just don’t get it do you. It’s not the support of your association chairman that you need. It’s the support of we the people and she doesn’t not have our support and neither will you come next election. #Brexit #Brexitbetrayal #MayMustGo

Common misconception is that we just want to go back to how things were - we don't. We recognise the howl of protest #Brexit represents, and it needs to be addressed. But stumbling out of the #EU will only make it worse. See how we square the circle here

UK PM May facing 'no confidence' vote over #Brexit deal 
Perhaps the Green party could commit to annual by-elections for all their MPs going forward, just to check voters still want them. No? Thought not. #LosersVote #brexit
I stand with @theresa_may madam. She is fighting for people’s mandate. But as usual opposition & judiciary against her If you vote for @INCIndia I am guarantee you we shall be facing #brexit like situation with influx of peaceful community. Make your choice
Doesn't backing #Brexit feel great?  If only we had a Prime Minister who felt the same way - just imagine what we could achieve as a country.  Tory MPs must vote her out today. @johnredwood @BorisJohnson @OwenPaterson
Scotland’s First Minister @NicolaSturgeon on Theresa May  #brexit 
LISTEN: @SNewtonUK, MP for Truro & Falmouth, told Laurence Reed of BBC Radio Cornwall that most of her constituents want Theresa May to "just get on with #Brexit".Tom Scott of #Cornwall for Europe called into the show to point out how untrue this is.
Whether she wins or loses it will still be an extreme Tory Party pursing an extremely damaging policy called #Brexit#May #confidencevote #toryleadership
Extremists = those who want the public's vote carried out. "Democrats" = those who want them to vote again until they get the right answer. Welcome to Britain 2018. #Brexit 
Poll Tax, miner's strike, black Wednesday, whenever there's huge division/chaos/abuse of power/rage/inequality/now #Brexit, its under the tories (the financial crisis was caused by bankers, not Labour) the tories cause destruction/hate, yet still ppl vote for them #GTTO #PMQS
What #Brexit shows the world is that Brits are spoiled brats. They had the best deal in Europe, but their greed is too great. The EU should just pull the plug on these crybabies and be done with them.
#Brexit: Parliament's Conference of Presidents indicated that the withdrawal agreement is  fair and balanced and the only deal possible. It is therefore not  open to renegotiation 
The @Europarl_EN issues new #Brexit position. In view of the latest developments in the UK, we recall that renegotiating the backstop is not possible, we want a close as possible future relationship, and that we intensify our no-deal planning. 
#NoConfidenceVoteSo some Tories have changed their minds about May and are having a vote. Funny that. So it's okay for them to instigate a vote to see if everyone agrees but it's not ok for the electorate to do the same.Hypocrites#FBPE #peoplesvote #brexit

A reasoned, measured, factual statement from @Feorlean such a contrast to the chaos at Westminster. @theSNP has been consistent for two years now on our position on #Brexit

"Totally and absolutely unacceptable". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised May's decision to delay the House vote on the #Brexit deal as she prepares for the no-confidence vote this evening.

Banksy's #Brexit mural shows a man removing one star in the EU flag with a hammer.Lawmakers in British Prime Minister @theresa_may's Conservative Party triggered a confidence vote in her leadership, plunging the country's planned divorce from the EU into deeper uncertainty.
Sad to see a great country listening to this sort of delusional nonsense #Brexit 
There is no direct line from the referendum result or the triggering of Article 50 to where we are now. We have arrived at this moment because of choices made by this Prime Minister and her government's mishandling of the #Brexit negotiations. My question at #PMQs today >>>
.@jeremycorbyn: "The Prime Minister and her government have already been found to be in contempt of Parliament. Her behavior today is just contemptuous of this Parliament…The Prime Minister's appalling behavior needs to be held to account…"  #PMQs #Brexit 
Sarah Wollaston - The #ERG are going to get a "kicking tonight." I think we should remain in the EU on the terms we have... the PM should take her deal direct to the people & ask... is this the #brexit you voted for or would you rather remain. @sarahwollaston #peoplesvote #PMQs
Tory MPs core problem with May: She hasn’t kept the vague, fluffy promises she made about #BrexitMay’s solution: Offer a vague, fluffy promise about not running at the next General ElectionNot sure who are the bigger mugs, her or the MPs and journos who fall for this? 
She talks it, but can she walk it? She was not for Brexit but has to deal with it now. Many countries across the pond are waking up to the creeping plague of liberalism but is it too late? She’s no @realDonaldTrump that’s for sure!#Brexit #MAGA

Dear BBC and #WATO, stop leaving unchallenged Brexit MPs claim that "the country voted to leave". It did not. #Brexit had a 2% majority of the vote, which had a 73% turnout. If everyone had voted, Remain would probably have won.

Thanks for meeting us today @ZacGoldsmith with @JulyThe8th @sahbazomer for the @OFOCBrexit @FFSake_ #parliamenttakeover really interesting to meet with you and talk about #brexit 
This won‘t last long, but, speaking from a continental perspective, the one good thing about the escalating Tory civil war is that they now blame each other, instead of the EU, for everything that is going wrong with #Brexit . Feels nice not to be main target of disdain for once.
I have received over 1,100 emails, letters, calls and cards regarding #Brexit in the last few weeks alone. Below an update to give my #Reigate constituents a clear overview of my position on this fraught and difficult issue for our country.
A “managed No Deal.” What an amazingly, shamelessly misleading euphemisation. Synonyms include: “a choreographed car crash,” “a controlled nose dive,” “a supervised wreckage.” #Brexit
I will be backing @theresa_may this evening. She has a tough job and should be given the opportunity to get her #Brexit deal over the line.
No comment#Brexit #May #Merkel #Macron #GiletsJeunes #Europe #EU
#Brexit. I can’t listen to British PM Theresa May without imagining her dancing like a wounded chicken.

3/ I tried to give him a copy of my #24reasonstoremain booklet and showed him the page on EU fisheries. He refused and told me to "shove it up my arse". Facts are not going to work on these people. The #Brexit debate is won by emotion, propaganda and rhetoric.

Tory plotters know that any replacement PM would face the exact same parliamentary arithmetic and exact same deadlock over #Brexit.  A #PeoplesVote is the only way to change that.  What exactly is she afraid of?  My question to the Prime Minister at #PMQs
Here is the genuine Norway Option. Norway has one of the smallest gaps between the rich & poor in the world according to the @wef. That is the real #NorwayPlus which the UK is travelling in the opposite direction of irrespective of #Brexit.

Today’s chaos will do little to reassure patients and staff about the enormous risks posed to the NHS by #Brexit. We believe leaving the EU will have a hugely damaging impact on our health service.

Seems Cornwall - which voted 56.5% Leave in 2016, on a 77% turnout - has changed its mind on #Brexit. Remain now 16 points ahead of Leave, in a new poll out today, with a clear majority in favour of a #PeoplesVote.People change their minds.#EndTheChaos
Mini “what’s the hell’s going on with #Brexit” thread below for anybody confused (basically everybody who isn’t British and most people who are) 
Chancellor Angela Merkel: “We have no intention of changing the #Brexit agreement...That is the common position of the member states.”
Amidst all the #Brexit noise, remember the people of the UK are our friends, our relatives, our business partners, our customers, our investors, our students. Brexit is a self-inflicted wound. We should think about how we can now help. Right now that might just be by shutting up.
#Brexit latest: The Titanic is sinking and the crew are trying to get rid of the captain in order to renegotiate with an iceberg.

PM says Labour want to ignore the #EURef and stay in the EU.So what is the PM's policy?To ignore the #EURef and stay in the EU.There is no difference between the two main parties on #BrexitThey both want  to ignore the #EURef and stay in the EU.The 17.4m are being cheated.
"Her  behaviour today is contemptuous of this parliament" - Jeremy Corbyn hits out at at Theresa May's "appalling  behaviour" over the meaningful vote on the #Brexit deal.Follow the latest on #PMQs here: 
Finally: a fresh vote would be needed to stop #Brexit because the UK under @theresa_may have already passed a law invoking Article 50 of the treaty by which they joined the EU. Under a law already in effect the UK leaves on March 19th automatically. Legislation needed to stop it.
Theresa May says Jeremy Corbyn "couldn't care less what I bring back from Brussels... all he wants to do is create chaos", as Labour leader asks what changes she has secured to her #Brexit deal Follow #PMQs live: 
You might have missed it because of #Brexit, but it's all hitting squeaky bum time in Katowice as well. Polish Presidency has taken over the talks for the final 3 days, NGOs are warning of major concerns over the details of the rulebook #COP24 1/2
Jeremy Corbyn is on fire today. He looks assured, statesman-like and frankly fed up of Theresa May's bullshit. She's a power hungry narcissist holding the country to ransom. #PMQs #NoConfidence #Brexit
And there is in fact no likelihood that any fresh vote even if Corbyn were to call it would overturn Article 50. The EU can either cave on the Irish Border with a “technical solution” or they can go whistle for two years of UK money that they need desperately.#Brexit anyway.

Here's what happened the last time a Conservative prime minister faced a vote of no confidence, in 1990... Latest updates: #NoConfidence | #newsnight | #LeadershipChallenge | #Brexit 
If the Conservative party can think again... so can the people. Stop pissing away the futures of millions of young people, give the decision back to the people in a #PeoplesVote  and let us decide whether we still want #Brexit.
Still by far the best summary of what's currently happening in the UK: #Brexit as a cheese submarine... 
So even if UK PM @theresa_may won’t get her deal through, the UK will still #Brexit as the Leader of the Opposition, a Russian asset, Jeremy Corbyn, will not allow his own party to oppose #Brexit with the fresh vote that would be needed to stop it.

The left across the West have the nerve to claim that every election they lose is the result of 'Russian meddling'. This is not just perverse, this is treason when one side in the election accuses the other of illegitimacy. Such actions should be punished by law. #Brexit #Trump
The Brexiters are hopelessly divided. There was never a majority for any form of #Brexit. We are paying the price for a hand-waving Leave option in the referendum that could attract support from people with wildly conflicting ideas about #Brexit. Only #Remain has a majority.

Why are we having a vote of no confidence in TM? Why are we blocking her "progress"? Because we think she's totally messed up on #Brexit. We are calling time on this mess and want a Brexiteer to implement it with vision and clarity #politicslive
This is now a NATIONAL EMERGENCY!In a National Emergency the Country needs a Government of NATIONAL UNITYTheresa you can no longer command respect..your Govt is the 1st in history to be IN CONTEMPT.#Brexit is proven conclusively 2B against the NATIONAL INTEREST.#REVOKEA50
It’s time to pull together, stop the gaming, and put the country first. Our best days lie ahead, and we need to deliver #Brexit. The PM @theresa_may is working incredibly hard to resolve concerns regarding the backstop arrangement, now is not the time for change.
"Theresa has been feeding this monster (ERG), that's now turned on her.. Only way out of this mess, is a People’s Vote. #Brexit #PeoplesVote

Dominic Raab, the man who had no clue about the importance of the port of Dover to trade with Europe, is favourite to win the Tory leadership and steer the country towards #Brexit. The UK is just trolling us all now, isn't it... #NoConfidence
You are a joke. What you did as health secretary to the NHS was inconceivable. What your party is still looking to do the NHS & the country at large is incomprehensible. Both the PM & your party in leading this country need to go before it gets even worse #Brexit #BrexitVote
Instead of going LALALALALA with #BREXIT fingers in your ears...look at some nice images of our beautiful land instead...much more fulfilling. This was the pre-sunrise sky of Stirling Castle on Monday @stirlingcastle @DestinationStir @VisitScotland #Scotland
Today young people will be in Parliament meeting their MPs and telling them why they need a #PeoplesVote. It's clear the only way out of this deadlock is to give the public control of the #Brexit deal. @FFSake_ @OFOCBrexit
If the #UK government is aiming for #GBP parity with the #USD they are doing a pretty good job! #TheresaMay #brexit #noconfidence
Any prediction as to what will happen tonight is based on Tory MPsTELLINGTHETRUTHin their public statements.After so much bluster in this #Brexit process so far, is that actually really likely?It’s a secret ballot...
And this, as most people who voted to leave have worked out, was always part of the plan not to. National interest my arse, these two have zero interest in the national interest and neither does the current Prime Minister #Brexit 
Mrs May's #Brexit deal threatens the rights for working people 
The Tories are having ANOTHER leadership vote because they no longer respect the result of the last one, 2 years ago. The facts and circumstances have changed. Some feel they’ve been lied to.Remind you of anything else? #Brexit #NoConfidence
LIVE: Tory MPs trigger vote of no confidence in PM Theresa May. Xinhua speaks to experts in London about #Brexit 
If Scotland had voted to leave the UK by 52% to 48%, I doubt Nicola Sturgeon would have supported a second referendum, no matter how chaotic Independence negotiations were going. Yet here she is expecting Jeremy Corbyn to do precisely that over #Brexit. 
Owen Paterson’s letter of No ConfidenceDear Sir Graham,I write to inform you I no longer have confidence in PM.Mrs May's “deal” is so bad...A betrayal of clear manifesto promises.Broken promises typify 2 years of poor Govt decision-making.#Brexit #EU
If Theresa May survives the no confidence vote tonight she will stay on for another year without any hassle. I suspect the conspirators who brought her to power will see to it that she survives. Bad for #Brexit but do they care? Of course not. They want to bury it at any cost.

They've had months to prepare for this as numerous letters had already been submitted to 1922 chairman. But of course they've had decades to prepare for #Brexit and still couldn't come up with a plan. Brewery a in up-piss a organise couldn't.
The only sensible leader for the Tories is Ken Clarke no future career to look after and the ability to stand on I'll call a referendum. #brexit. #toryleadership
#TheresaMay by #LIES, #DECEPTION, #FEAR, #THREATS and #FALSEHOODS has mislead the British people, Her Party, Her #MPs and the 17,410,742 who voted for #BREXIT in order to stay in POWER, that is the only thing Theresa May cares about... POWER! #MayMustGoNow #toryleadership #Tory
It's quite amazing how many politicians are using #Brexit for their own political gain. #NoConfidence
91% of residents on Saturday told us Mr Greg Clark is not representing them on #Brexit. If I was #TunbridgeWells' MP, I would respect their 2016 vote and vote for a #Peoplesvote.
‘Theresa May is effectively a prime minister who’s drowning and Angela Merkel is throwing buckets of water over her,’ @ABridgenThe Tory backbench MP says the confidence vote is the ‘last chance to save #Brexit’.
Look away now! 50-year-old stunner Grant Shapps embraces his mussy grey hair and flaunts the most wanted cheekbones in Westminster as he comments on the #Leadershipchallenge #Brexit 
To describe this confidence vote as a 'distraction' forgets that this is central to the direction of Government and a #Brexit that delivers on the result of the referendum. Our leaving on 29th March is reliant on strength of leadership, and that is why colleagues have concerns!
Time to stand up, Tory MPs, & do what is right.No way you can continue to support a leader who has destroyed voter confidence in such a way.If you do, you are ending Torydom for a generation.Give us our #Brexit, we voted for it & we want it. TM is no path to that.#MayMustGo
Those peddling project catastrophe on #WTO terms have to be challenged. This option is the only one that will strengthen our hand, provide certainty for business and allow us to use every opportunity of a clean #Brexit. 
‘Ultimately this place is broken, our politics is broken, I’m sorry to your viewers about that, it’s a disgrace what is going on,’ says @ChukaUmunnaThe Labour MP says there should be a second public vote to determine what happens with #Brexit. 
The brutal truth is that for more than two year #TheresaMay has worked to undermine the Brexit that 17.4m voted for. I am reminded of the these words today... #MayMustGoNow #Brexit 
Those saying that we can change course on #Brexit without changing the PM have not listened to anything she's said in recent weeks. She says there is no alternative, so how can she be tasked with seeking a different route? If you don't back the deal, sadly you can't back the PM.
In October I asked you this question:'If Chuka Umunna wasn't an MP/Centrist think tank promoter, what kind of work do you think he would be most suited to?'Now you get to vote for the winner from this shortlist RT please #NoConfidence#Brexit
Shocking that @CrispinBlunt pretended on @BBCNews  that No Deal presents no difficultiesHas he spoken to a single business that imports or exports from the EU that agrees with him?Btw, Sussex Uni. predicts 1,800 job losses in his constituency in the event of No Deal #Brexit
We called for @theresa_may to resign because its clear her vision for #Brexit is unworkable. It takes time for letters to progressively build up for a #LeadershipchallengeNow that has occurred, we urge all conservative MPs to vote to change leadership.
.@BBCGaryR is it true that you allowed Barry Gardiner on air this morning to lie that the #SNP were prepared to implement the #Brexit referendum result but had reneged?Tell me this is not true. Tell me that you challenged him on this point. Unbelievable but so typical of BBC.
The world may be on the brink of environmental disaster, the EU in chaos because of #brexit, wars continue to ravage & then there's Trump, but at least we still have Santa.His appearance at Christmas is one of the rare certainties in an upside down world.He gets my vote#sparkle
A basic rule of trade negotiations is that the larger economy holds the stronger hand. So a #Brexit UK would probably be able to negotiate better deals with small economies, but less favourable deals than the EU can with large economies. And it's the big economies which count.
She won't be smiling in 20 years time when someone pulls up this tweet as she tries to negotiate a #brexit deal for the 20th time @theresa_may
Over the past few months, I've learnt first-hand how much damage #Brexit is going to do to our country. It has shaken me to the very core of my being.If you think that everything is going to be okay, it's time to ask yourself a simple question: ARE YOU SURE?#3Blokes In A Pub
RT if you'd rather be watching CBeebies!#Brexit 
It would take a hard heart to not have some sympathy for #TheresaMay today. That woman, bloody difficult or not, has been tasked with the impossible. Whatever your politics, whatever your view on #Brexit remember this is an individual, a person. #BeKind
Chuka Umunna on Sky News effectively just admitted what we all knew, he's calling for Corbyn to lodge the vote of no confidence so it fails & "we can move onto a People's Vote"He's so immensely transparent & unlikeable. #Brexit

If the British were serious about #Brexit they should have hired Mugabe to manage it. He exited Commonwealth on TV and the whole country had to figure out what that meant after the fact.
To be honest, the most incredible thing I've seen Theresa May do as PM is stand there today and call the Tory party "moderate, pragmatic & mainstream" with a straight face. #Brexit #VoteMayDown
 #BrexitChaos: British PM @theresa_may says #noconfidence vote could delay the #Brexit process. @France24's correspondent in London @BenedictePaviot explains 
So the future of our country is now to be stitched up by a handful of Tory MPs?  This is not what democracy looks like. It’s time to let the people of Britain have a say with a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit

It was representation in the British Parliament, that was given as the reason for Scotland entering the Act of Union in 1707.  Our voice, was diminished with EVEL.  Now, it has been silenced by avoidance of voting at all. What's the point? #Brexit #TheresaMay #Indyref2
"We've hit an iceberg and are sinking.""Quick, change the captain!"#brexit #voteofnoconfidence
The reasoning behind the triggering of the no-confidence vote in Theresa May‘s leadership is very obvious. Johnson, Rees-Mogg and the other Tory ERG members are determined to wreck the country by causing so much chaos that a no deal, hard #Brexit happens by default.
Why the fuss? Just another day wasted in #Westminster by a Divisive, Delusional, Destructive #ERG run Party. You can’t deliver a #Brexit based on Deceit. But you can use it to divert attention from real issues like #NHS #SocialCare #Education #Poverty #EmergencyServices - #Remain
Meeting with @MichelBarnier ahead of tomorrow’s discussion of #Brexit. #EUCO
It’s good that you accept the EU are not renegotiating. Has @jeremycorbyn grasped that too or he is still on about a “jobs first” version of #Brexit which does not exist? What a mess. #BrexitShambles
Triggering this vote of No Confidence is a mistake. Because if @theresa_may wins it we’re stuck with her for another year and she will be able to force this traitorous Withdrawal Agreement on us. #brexit
British Politicians: "We chose May as our leader, but we don't feel that it was the right decision, anymore. We want to change our mind."Also British Politicians: "We have maaaade our decision. #Brexit means brexit, regardless of the consequences."#NoConfidence
A new leader won't help #Brexit. Right now UK is standing alone in the rain, holding papers nobody at the EU will sign. After May leaves, UK still stands alone in the same place. Holding the same unsigned papers. Only now we are on fire. And screaming. Good times. #NoConfidence
I’m sick with nervousness about what is happening in Westminster today. If this Prime Minister cared about the national interest she would step down and give the country  and her party a chance to recover from the mess she’s created. #brexit
In 2016, Brexiteers dared to dream. We won the Referendum. Today, we win the opportunity for a Leave Leader.6pm - May loses vote of No Confidence.New leader in place on ‘No Deal’ platform 29 March 2019 - No Deal Brexit Come on #Bojo#Brexit

The hypocrisy of the @Conservatives in triggering a vote of no confidence in @theresa_may is outrageous.Why should they get to vote again on their leader while they deny the public the right to vote again on #Brexit?Surely they knew what they were voting for the first time?

We should learn the fate of British PM Theresa May’s by 9pm tonight. She will address MP’s at 5pm. Voting takes place 6-8pm. Outcome within the hour #Brexit
So now the future of our country is in the hands of 315 Tory MPs.But whatever happens tonight, Parliament will remain deadlocked over #Brexit.Only the public can deliver clarity on our future now. We need a #PeoplesVote more urgently than ever.
How is a #peoplesvote a "betrayal of democracy" when #Brexit only just got home on the back of a pack of lies and now looking at the practical implications of it for the UK it's clear that it's a disaster?#BrexitShambles
The PM has my 100% support as leader of @Conservatives She is a tenacious public servant doing her best to deliver #Brexit in very difficult circumstances - let’s help her get on with it! #TheresaMay

“The border affects everything you think about and everything you do.” Based on research with communities in the central Irish borderland region, in our latest #AccordCR @hayward_katy explores the potential impact of #Brexit on a still-fragile peace.

Even now @theresa_may  is insisting the Withdrawal Agreement will help Britain take back its laws, its borders and deliver the #Brexit people voted for. It’s precisely because it doesnt that this vote of No Confidence has been triggered.
Any PM with an ounce of honour & credibility would realise the country needs new leadership. If May truly believed in her newly coded "national interest" sound bite - she'd make way. Not only for a new PM but a new government. #Brexit #VoteMayDown
The English voting public are calling the vote of no confidence and potential leadership spill against their sitting Prime Minister “extraordinary”...In Australia we call it “a Wednesday”...#Auspol #Brexit
History will not be kind to those who prioritise political advantage over people’s livelihoods. Businesses need politicians, regardless of party or views on #Brexit, to understand that their high-stakes gambles have real-world consequences of the highest order.
Just for the record, there was never even the slightest chance #brexit wouldn't turn out to be sheer chaos.
It’s the people who can cancel #brexit not parliament! But waiting for #Corbyn to back @peoplesvote_uk is like waiting for Godot.

All eyes are on #Brexit this morning but the number of people sleeping rough on the streets of Dublin this morning is a national shame and scandal for the Irish government. How those in government can pass them by again and again and do so little is beyond understanding.
Whatever happens with the #NoConfidence vote tonight, one thing is certain; our national interest will continue to come 2nd to  Tory party interests. #Brexit always was & always will be a consequence of their self indulgent internal fight
The important thing to understand is the #Brexit referendum & the following chaos was a result of a big internal battle between different factions of the ruling right-wing Tory party (imagine the Republicans, but if they spoke like Benedict Cumberbatch). 
Me: So what's this leadership challenge about?A Tory: Well, we're no longer sure we want May to lead us.Me: But you chose her to do that.A Tory: Yes, but things have changed so we're having another look at it.Me: Cool. So you know #Brexit, right?A Tory: 
My #NewProfilePic reflects my mood after six years of this. Also, buy my book, ‘Understanding Brexit: A Concise Introduction.’ Concise = 75k words. Whether anyone can fully understand #Brexit is a moot point. I doubt many of our leaders do.

Amazing to see her come out & claim she 'believes in our country'. That's an oxymoron. #NoConfidence if she's voted back the UK will vote out #ToryParty make no mistake. UK wants TM gone & #Brexit delivered. She's making a case when there's none. She's brought us to the precipice
The 17,400,048 letters of No Confidence are in! We want a Brexiteer in charge of #Brexit. Nothing more, nothing less!Taxi for @theresa_may please!
And the idea that any #Brexit is in the national interest has been totally demolished by reality of attempting to leave 
Theresa May: "Lads if ye kick me out, the opposition will control the #Brexit stuff, and they might delay or even STOP it! You don't want that, right??"The Brits: 
She’s really not going down without a flight, country before self seems to be Ms May’s mantra - the Conservative party and their insistence on self destruction is quite the spectacle #Brexit #TheresaMay
PM is still saying she is delivering #BrexitThe opposite is the case.She is tying us ever closer to the EU dictators.She plans to keep us under the control of the EU in perpetuity, with no exit door.She wants to split off N. Ireland from the rest of the UK.#MayMustGoToday
Despite the noises for May's support from some Tory MPs no MP is going to want her to lead them into the next GE. Her #Brexit deal = no DUP support = no majority in parliament = a likely GE. I expect many of the voices of support will actually be voting against her.
Let’s be clear Mrs May, we do not want you to get on with #Brexit. The Country that works for everyone is the one that stays in the #EU. Withdraw #Article50

So, Mrs May dithers for years, and then today she suddenly decides that this no confidence vote must take place within 12 hours?  Tells you all you need to know.  She must go.Distinctive #Brexit research & news: 
Am I the only person that thinks we need to cut Theresa May some slack? The British public were stupid enough to vote leave, and she stepped up to the impossible. I don’t think anyone would have been able to negotiate a decent deal! #brexit #theresamay
Labour want a general election. Should they win, their priority will be to renegotiate a #Brexit deal. Only if that fails will they then consider the #PeoplesVote.How many Remainers will vote for Labour on that basis? I certainly won't.
I know this sounds counter-intuitive but only 48 MPs will certainly vote against @theresa_may tonight so she may win the motion of no confidence far more easily than we’re all speculating - leaving her stronger.  #Leadershipchallenge #Brexit
I remember those signs. I lived with them as a child. As a little boy I knew they meant me. Thus begins societal abuse. Deny it they might but during the referendum I recognised it from Farage, Boris Johnson & their co-liars. Sad, pathetic but no surprise.#brexit #leave #remain
The tories held a leadership vote 2 years ago. If they no longer respect the result because facts and circumstances have changed, it's only right they should be allowed another vote. If only I could think of another situation in which that might apply.... #Brexit #NoConfidence
Having some "exit" problems, May?#Brexit #TheresaMay #UK #NoConfidence
It really is time the PM went. I suspect she'll do her utmost to cling on but her authority is shot her #BrexitDeal dead.There's no point in a Labour #Lexit Govt either.Time for a Govt of National Unity which decided that there's no future in #Brexit.#RevokeA50 #StopBrexitNow
What a complete shambles, while the PM is hawking her botched #Brexit deal around the EU begging for further concessions her own MPs launch a leadership challenge. This is not strong&stable or in the national interest it's all about the Tory party hanging on to power at any cost! 
Leadsom and her #Brexit pals have shown they’re happy to trash everything this country holds dear to get their way. MPs who speak their minds are called traitors. Judges doing their job are labelled ‘enemies of the people’. Now the Speaker. It’s disgraceful.
Good moaning. So, there is going to be a teary laddershop challenge this evening.Will we have a new Pram Monster by this time tomorrow?#Brexit
There's lots of talk about 'in the national interest' in Tory ranksIf there's no #Brexit Deal by the 21st Jan19 we crash out of the EUHow exactly is a Tory leadership challenge, with only just over a month before we drop out of the EU, in the national interest?#PeoplesVote

This #Brexit is a shambles. All kicked off on a pack of lies #Referendum. Now spineless politicians trying to position themselves so they aren’t tainted in this debacle. Individuals and opposition playing politics rather than helping to sort this mess out. Happy Wednesday 
Irish ministers, MEPs & Fine Gael TDs/Seantors have been told to cancel all media engagements this morning due to events in London. The message: "No tweets, no doorsteps, no interviews, no comment - stay out of UK political party leadership issues." #New #Brexit
Sorted. A Tory leadership challenge is just what was needed to settle this #Brexit business. Everyone will be so pleased that these difficult times are now over. Mince pie, anyone?Seriously - you couldn’t make this up. UK Govt has proven it can’t sort this mess. #PeoplesVoteNow
Glad you enjoyed it. The final chapter on economic prospect of United Ireland is looking more and more relevant given what happening now with #Brexit 
In summary, after months of trying to bash a square peg through a round hole the Tories have decided the answer is to choose a different hammer. Meanwhile Labour continues to insist that its square peg would definitely fit into the round hole if it could only have a go. #Brexit
So, let me just get this straight: the Conservatives voted for Theresa May as leader two years ago, but now they’ve changed their minds and want another vote?Where have I heard that before?#Brexit #NoConfidenceVote #PeoplesVote
Few reasons why the pound is holding up despite a no confidence vote in Mrs May being called:1. Largely priced in2. Not clear PM will lose (Cabinet support)3. Even if PM's ousted - next Tory leader, general election etc. has ambiguous implications for #Brexit outcome & $GBP

Theresa May is about to face a no-confidence vote from within her own party. If 48 Conservative MPs say they no longer support her, the Tories could oust her for a new leader.  #Brexit
France is watching you my British friends. Get rid of Mrs May and put a proper Brexiter as PM. Show us the way out of this prison. We will soon follow you ! #Brexit #Frexit
The Tory MPs had a leadership contest in 2016. As the facts emerged,  they have changed their minds and they want another contest.  The public had a referedum on #Brexit in 2016, As the facts emerged, they have changed their minds and they want a #PeoplesVote
This. But with everything now on fire. #Leadershipchallenge #Brexit 
Wouldn't it be funny if Theresa May defeated the #ERG in this #NoConfidence vote later and then immediately called a #PeoplesVote just to piss them off. Go on Treesa.#BrexitVote #Brexit
Imagine .... imagine a world in which government worked as hard on climate chage as they work on #brexit and internal party politics? The current omnishambles will give future generations cause to hate our pathetic and small minded politicians. @ExtinctionR
Letter of the week @FT #succinct #Brexit 
Speaker John Bercow is at the forefront of this week's shenanigans in the HOC, and has been accused of an anti-#Brexit bias. What do you think? Was he right to describe the government's delay of the pivotal #WithdrawalAgreement vote as "discourteous"?
For goodness sake! Barry Gardiner has just been allowed to say unchallenged on #bbcgms that @theSNP promised to implement the #EU referendum result & have reneged. This is totally & utterly untrue @BBCGaryR please rectify. Thank you #Brexit

#brexit Today’s Politicians 3 Parties 3 MUPPETS. We need strong politicians to get good Brexit. We’re got Theresa Maybe, Jeremy Corbyn, and dinosaur  Sir Vince Cable. One word everyone in  saying now HELP.  
As #Parliament and #Brexit reneges on its responsibility for our UK economy, we are quietly getting on with investing in the 4th Industrial Revolution #4IR and #MadeSmarter. Hoping someone is listening, so that we can give this Revolution a better chance than we gave the 3rd.
I am in the @timesredbox on behalf of @Remain_Labour this morning.Now is the time for #Labour leadership on #Brexit. Now is the time for Jeremy Corbyn to move a vote of no confidence in this government and back a #PeoplesVote
Good lord......it’s only Wednesday #Brexit.
Politicians are elected by the people and Brexit was the result in the referendum that the majority of people voted for.It’s time to stop all this bullshit and get us out.Arguing over ways to keep us in is an insult to democracy.The people have already decided. #brexit 
But apparently we mustn't call out the xenophobia that has been unleashed by #Brexit because that's unfair on the decent working people who voted leave and simply have legitimate concerns about French people making their lives worse. 
Time for the Brexiteers to have a go. Move over, Theresa. John Ismael plays fantasy politics and puts together his dream team. Could his dreams come true? #csm #brexit #TheresaMay

When Margaret Thatcher said “This Lady is not for turning”, she maybe have been prescient on Theresa May on #Brexit .... When History is written, it will be kinder to Theresa May for doing her best to uphold a Referendum Result that split the Kingdom. UK must BREXIT for its good.
If you just revoked Article 50 and stopped Brexit in its tracks what would happen with the millions of people thinking that voting doesn't work? What do they do next if you show them that peaceful protest by the ballot box is impossible? I'd rather not find out. #brexit

If the #brexit campaign had included a shred of reality the country would never have voted for it. The Leave Campaign knew that, so they lied and cheated. 
It must be quite confusing for everyone who believed the EU was a dictatorship that imposed its decisions on the UK but now Parliament won’t back #brexit because it leaves the UK applying EU law without a say. Schrödinger’s brexit?

Theresa May's deal is the biggest transfer of sovereignty from a nation state to Brussels in the history of the European Union. I think it is extremely patronising to suggest leave voters didn't know what they were voting for #Brexit
Whatever the outcome of #Brexit, a debt of gratitude is owed to the likes of @GuitarMoog, @IanDunt and many others who have tirelessly and with great patience refuted the seemingly endless stream of lies and distortions propagated by Brexiteers.
Just remember when #Brexiter & #Lexiter charlatans state that they think a #PeoplesVote is divisive & warn it might lead to No #Brexit..what they're really saying is that they know there is now a majority of the Ppl who want to #StopBrexit & #Remain in the EU.Think on that.

Whatever happens to #Brexit it now seems obvious that most editors of newspapers and top TV execs in charge of #news have to be forced out. That sort of treachery cannot be forgiven. To play into the hands of the EU like that is obscene. Media owners needs to be ousted as well.
US Ambassador to the EU calls Brussels "utterly obstructionist". Accusing the EU of deliberately stalling trade negotiations, he said that his joke today is “if I ask someone at the EU what time it is, the answer is ‘no’.”Sounds about right. #Brexit

In a telephone call tonight, Sinn Fein leader @MaryLouMcDonald told @theresa_may that a referendum on Irish unity must be held in the event of a no deal #Brexit.
The head of the #WTO has already said what #Brexit will do to the UK but nobody seems interested in reporting it, "Trade deals are like football leagues. #Brexit relegates #UK to Division 4"
Many in Labour are annoyed that other parties are pushing for a Vote of No Confidence for their own priorities (getting to a #PeoplesVote to save the country) rather than Labour's priority (a GE on a #Brexit manifesto) They see no issue in this position

In which case, SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens are tactically inept. If all opposition parties opt for a #PeoplesVote before May's deal is even voted on, the Tories will become the only major party that supports #Brexit, giving them a total monopoly on Leave voters in a GE.

UK: FT reports, when 52% of voters decided to leave the EU in 2016, the topic "Common Market/EU/Euro/Brexit/Europe" was barely named as important issue. Immigration was important. This has been reversed over the course of the Brexit negotiation (Ipsos Mori polls). #Brexit

#Brexit has done all kinds of damage already, for examples: These old ideas and prejudices, once well out of sight, are now back in the light of day. Hopefully they won't poison what should be an excellent future relationship between neighbouring states based on parity of esteem. 
The whole narrative of  being scared of no deal #Brexit after all this time without anyone budging on  side just illustrates why we need the backstop in any scenario: because  politics do take place in a space-reality distortion of awe inspiring dimensions

#Brexit is a dumpsterfire of legitimate grievances; also of hatred; of fear; of English nationalism; of rage; of a way of "hitting back". Denying it  increases the anger and fear and despair of many people.Allowing it helps to destroy what they have left & what they may have.

Astounding how many Brexiters persist with “they need us more than we need them”, in the context of disorderly #Brexit; the fantasy that the stakes are higher for a trading bloc losing a member than for a member losing its entire trade, regulatory and support framework overnight.

John Redwood MP: Let's "Cash in" with a Managed Exit without signing the Withdrawal Agreement.Applying World Trade WTO rules is not “crashing out” but "Cashing in" as we will keep the money EU wanted to extract via the Withdrawal Agreement.#Brexit #EU
Theresa #May postpones vote on #Brexit deal. Our cartoonist's take. 
To all Conservative MPs:The only way to change the #Brexit policy is to change the prime minister. It is Theresa May’s duty now to resign but as she will not you must demand she steps down. At risk are Democracy, Government and the Conservative Party. #ChuckMay
One of the risks of May going  back to Brussels is to negotiate what the British told her to do #Brexit. If not, we tell them it’s a no deal and WTO. 
So after Theresa May's failure to hold a vote regarding her #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement... what do you want to happen now? @brexitblog_info @RedHotSquirrel @VeteransBritain @Stop_The_EU @CraigWhitington @TrevorCoultMC Vote and RT for wider sample
@jk_rowling @JuliaHB1 AwkwardWhen will she apologise??#brexit 
Is there anything more empty than asking the public about #Brexit?“We should get on with it”“Get on with what?”“Get on with Brexit”“How?”“By leaving”“On what terms?”“Just leaving. Taking back sovereignty”“What do you mean?”“Sovereignty”“So what happens next?”“We leave”
#Brexit will hit the pockets of hardworking people up and down the country.MPs have the power to give them the opportunity to escape this mess with a #PeoplesVote, including the option to remain.
The British people will never forgive you for signing away our sovereignty and nation state. #Brexit means nothing now. The flood gates are now opened for the third world. Shame on you and your cretinous government. #Marrakesh
2. #Lexit/#Brexit Removes an entire raft of Rights you have as EU cits under the protection of the ECJ..this is being done w/o Consent & Parl has already voted not to transfer them into UK law. Labour can't protect you if we leave if they're not in power!
My piece for @serenbangor on why Jeremy Corbyn must now support a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit or risk disenfranchising future generations of their European freedoms. #Bangor #PlaidCymru 
Finding a tweak in the backstop, which is unlikely, won’t stop this from being the worst negotiated deal in the history of modern British politics. #Backstop #BrexitChaos #JC4PMNow #BBCNolan #Brexit #brexitvote #EUReferendum
#Brexit has become a mess. A vote delayed. Mrs May returning to Brussels. My two messages: we'll never let down Ireland; it’s out of the question to renegotiate the backstop & if you are looking for a closer future relationship to avoid the backstop, this will be no problem w/ us
Corbyn's 100% wrong. #Brexit's the greatest existential & constitnl crisis the UK's faced in peacetime.It can't be resolved in a multi issue GE unless Labour stood to #RevokeA50. He clings to a non-existent #Lexit fantasy. There's no time. #StopBrexit
Stupid, dishonest and careless people say voters knew what they were voting for in 2016. Well there are 4 competing versions of Brexit struggling for dominance, even now. No-one could know what they were voting for in 2016. #StopBrexit #Brexit #RevokeA50
I’m on @vicderbyshire from 10am this morning putting @theSNP view on #Brexit & the current constitutional chaos #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #indyref2
This year has been dominated by two policy issues: #Brexit and the #NHS. But while we continue to disagree on Brexit, the NHS is agreed to be in crisis seemingly forevermore. What a joy it is, to be taxed more for the privilege of enduring failure.
So May scared of losing a vote And Corbyn scared of losing a vote Both want #Brexit why?
#Brexit  .. Unionists have consistently blocked ‘parity of esteem’ (a sense of ‘Irishness’) for nationalists. Unionists now view the ‘backstop’ as an erosion of their sense of Britishness, their ‘parity of esteem’
How dare you even give this credibility.The leader of the house treated parliament with contempt yesterday and MPs from all sides and with all points of view on #brexit were absolutely furious.  Do.  Your.  Job.  @andrealeadsom "andrea leadsom"
BREAKING:@JunckerEU tells @Europarl_EN "withdrawal agreement will not be re-opened.” He said the backstop “necessary for the entire coherence of the agreement and it is necessary for Ireland. Ireland will never be left alone.” #Brexit 
Thread:Time for honesty re #Brexit, the border and tradeSo if we crash out without a deal and trade under WTO, what next?- some folk, regularly on media, say we simply won't enforce border checks or any controls.- fair enough, WTO even said its UK govt prerogative.
A plan for a Scottish-based stock exchange, focusing on social and environmental companies, has secured a partnership agreement with a major European stock market operator.#indyref2 #brexit #DissolveTheUnion
" STOP #BREXIT " PETITIONhas REALLY TAKEN OFF AGAIN IN THE LAST 24 HOURSand has NOW PASSED 62,000 SIGNATURES!!!WE NEED TO KEEP THIS GOING!Please SIGN & REPEATEDLY ReTWEET as many people do not sign petitions on THEIR first sighting!
Junker is being applauded in the European Parliament right now saying "This is the deal.  This is the only deal"So. Current predictions.1.  May either sweet talks or railroads Parliament.2.  We slide into a hard #Brexit 3.  A50 revoked.4. @UKParliament goes #PeoplesVote
Read about how we are providing certainty to engineering professionals from both Ireland & the UK to continue to support trade, the development of critical infrastructure & economic development regardless of the outcome of #Brexit. 
Is it possible that Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn would rather pick up the pieces of a post Tory #Brexit than do the right thing and stop the pretence that he has to deliver what he interprets what the people (25% of the population) voted for?
Junker tells European Parliament that re-opening the withdrawal agreement “will not happen”. Looks like May will return empty handed again  #Brexit
BREAKING: #Brexit - May in Europe to BEG Juncker and Merkel for EU concessions to salvage deal.Two and a half years of bumbling incompetence and now you're begging. Way to go @theresa_may You've made the UK a laughing stock.
BREAKING EU Junker "No room for renegotiation, but there is room for clarification."Because we were too stupid to understand it?What part of #Brexit means Brexit does he need clarifying?#GBP
Am in Berlin today at the same time as Theresa May to discuss the Brexit mess with the German media. Will stress that Scotland voted by 62% to remain in Europe and that there is no majority for her deal or a hard Brexit. #Brexit #Schottland #Europa 
One observation about the current #Brexit mess comes across time and again for those like me who are watching Westminster from the outside: too many people in there are  openly enjoying it. Bad look.
Contrary to what #TheresaMay said in Parliament that a #PeoplesVote would split the country even more and where does it end, I think we'd all accept the result of a final 'informed' vote and breathe a sigh of relief #Brexit
A 2nd referendum right now has a 50% chance of reversing #Brexit but a 100% chance of keeping this horrendous Tory gov in powerThat is unpalatable for the millions who desperately need a #Labour gov. The Tories are dangling by a thread - Labour's 1st duty is to finish them off
Green leader @SkaKeller: We should make it very clear that the British people would always be welcomed back if they changed their minds on #brexit 
.@ManfredWeber: The Political chaos in London shows one thing: leaving the European Union means taking a high risk. Let's rather reform the EU, change it where necessary, but not destroy it. #Brexit

.⁦@JunckerEU⁩ has just spoken in the European Parliament here in Strasbourg. Pretty clear on #Brexit and ⁦@theresa_may⁩’s mini tour of Europe - ⁦@SkyNews⁩
#Brexit “No re-negotiations, but clarifications”is the near-universal reaction in the European Parliament this morning 
.@ManfredWeber: There will be no renegotiation of the #Brexit agreement. We will not play this game, and on this matter it is very clear that We All Are Irish  . #backstop
Hiring in the City has dropped by almost 40% thanks to #Brexit uncertainty, recruiter says  via @FinancialNews
I will meet @theresa_may this evening in Brussels. I remain convinced that the #Brexit deal we have is the best - and only - deal possible. There is no room for renegotiation, but further clarifications are possible.
I do not feel sorry for @theresa_may I feel nothing but utter contempt for this racist, narcissistic, selfish nasty shitbag. She shit put she’s found herself in, is all of her own making. No democracy, no transparency. Fuck #Brexit
My article in this morning’s ⁦@Independent_ie⁩. Very much looking forward to chairing this @iiea event later this morning on all things #brexit #PeoplesVote #backstop
Andrea Leadsom going full Trump on #r4Today. Describing actions of opposition parties in holding Gov to account & making them stick to their promise of a vote on the deal as “fake politics”. Also dangling prospect of ditching the Speaker because his “views on #brexit well known”!
Demand for NHS staff rises as EU applicants 'drop off a cliff'. Significant staff shortages means #Brexit is bad for your health as ⁦@TheBMA⁩ and ⁦@RCPLondon⁩ now say. Politicians should take their doctors advice....
.@JunckerEU #EPlenary #Brexit “I will see @theresa_may tonight. The deal we have achieved is the best deal possible, it is the only deal possible. No room for renegotiation but there is room for further clarification and interpretation without opening the withdrawal agreement.”
All smiles. Will there be anything more than breakfast on the table? #Brexit 
If you listening to the BBC’s #r4today don’t expect to hear a Labour front bencher talking about Labour’s #Brexit policy. Do expect a Blairite though! 
#Brexit bedlam: How did it come to this?
An admirable commitment to balance shining through on BBC Breakfast this morning. Worried about #Brexit uncertainty were the British Chambers of Commerce, CBI and Food and Drink Federation. BUT they found a fishmonger called David who was ok about it. So let’s not worry unduly.
We cannot table a motion of no confidence now because the time isn't right. After all, if we bring down the Conservatives, we may inadvertently stop Brexit. Remember Jeremy Corbyn is playing the long game on Brexit, so cannot intervene until it's too late. #Brexit
If @theresa_may loses - govt can be replaced, if not - Labour can back another #Brexit referendum to which they are currently “biggest barrier and stumbling block” says @NicolaSturgeon
EU WTO tarrifs only average 2.3% so FTA saves hastle and EU benefit more. Either the thicko's in Parliament don't understand or they have another agenda? #brexit either way they are wronging the people 
“We need to get Labour off the fence that they are determinedly sitting on right now” - Labour appears to be the biggest stumbling block to another EU vote as it stands @NicolaSturgeon #brexit #r4Today
‘The will of the people is being betrayed.’In a heated debate, former UKIP leader @Nigel_Farage says the #Brexit vote is not being abided by. 
What advice - if any - did May get about how little  could give her on the backstop before postponing the vote?Strikes me that anyone understanding the  would have advised her she’d not get anything substantive.#brexit #brexitvote
“I want to see a confidence motion which brings this sorry excuse for a government down” - @NicolaSturgeon #Brexit #r4Today
One of my local MPs has stood up against his party leadership and against #Brexit.One is at the forefront of the #PeoplesVote campaign.And one picked up the mace in parliament yesterday and tried to nick it.I'm glad I live where I do.#BrightonAndHove
I can recommend a grassroots organisation that are working hard to show how #Brexit will hurt ordinary people - visit and follow @FinalSayForAll for more information

Brexit Facts4EU's simple guide to: "#Brexit, WTO, Trade, & the Irish Border Solution."  Read it here: 
Exactly this. The Leavers were never happy because by winning, it meant they couldn’t be angry any more, and that’s all they ever wanted, a legitimate reason to voice their inner anger. Realistically, most people in the U.K. just want #Brexit to go away.
 “Now you want to renegotiate your own proposal?! It’s relatively difficult for us in our not very well developed intellectual thinking to understand that.” Brutal sarcasm, from @ElmarBrok_MEP #brexit 
The problem for May is, the longer this charade lasts, the more evident the need for a fail-safe backstop becomes. #brexit
Jonathan Lis - The people weren't psychic in 2016... now we know what #brexit looks like, let's ask the people if this is what they had in mind.. if more people vote to remain than leave, then it's not breaking the will of the people to remain.#peoplesvote @jonlis1
#Brexit EXCLUSIVE: Former Minister says "The PM was given the solution by us months ago. Her top officials are determined to keep us in the Customs Union."  Read it here: 
Ran for office on a manifesto to leave the EU, Single Market and Customs Union. By her own words she is either a fool or a liar.  If she had any decency she would resign today #Brexit #Cambridgeshire #Cambridge
Cameron: Yes, I screwed the country by calling the #Brexit referendum. No, I don’t care. Another Eton sociopath. 
#Brexit through the gift shop. @theage @smh
Irish politicians had been warned not to raise the prospect of a United Ireland during #Brexit for fear of spooking the DUP. Now the Prime Minister has done just that. Bizarre.  
'No PM better than bad PM'? UK MPs fuming after May's #Brexit vote delay
So you could spend all week following the minute details of #Brexit twists and turns . Or you could remember what has been true since 2016: it’s messy, no one knows what is going on and every conceivable outcome is as unlikely as the other. The end. Christmas movie, anyone?

#Brexit is lame
If #Brexit is overturned, how can we ever trust politicians again? Brexit means #takingbackcontrol of our Money, Laws & Borders, which as clearly promised in both main party’s manifestos - requires leaving the #CustomsUnion, #SingleMarket & #ECJ overrule!

Theresa May delays #Brexit deal vote but #EU warns no renegotiation 
If Remainers lost a 2nd referendum, they would want a 3rd. If they lost a 3rd they would want a 4th, and so on. It isn’t about a ‘people’s vote’ it is about voting until the ‘people’ produce the result the liberal elite & establishment want. That’s tyranny. #Brexit
Lloyd, writing as one of your constituents, the country needs a route out of this #Brexit debacle, and that means accepting that there is no good #Brexit. The country needs a #PeoplesVote or Parliament to instruct the government to revoke Article 50.
Stewart Lee: “Not everyone that voted to leave Europe wanted to see Britain immediately descend into an unaccountable single-party state... I only wanted bendy bananas & now there's this chaotic inferno of hate!" #Brexit #PeoplesVote
For 24 months; EU’s been preparing for a UK crash-out while UK debates #Brexit without any discussion, or preparation whatsoever for a crash-out. At this stage, the EU has mitigated most of the risk of a crash-out; while the UK has no contingency plan whatsoever.

If I was Anna Soubry, and thank Jehovah I'm not, I would worry about her own monstrosity of a party. The reason she's angry at Jeremy Corbyn is because he's played a blinder over #Brexit. He's allowed the Tories to own this clusterfuck. It's not his job to help Anna Soubry.
Bang on the table if you have to. #Brexit 
Dear Jeremy She will do what the Rothschilds tell her.The Zionist banking cabal has a powerful stranglehold over UK gov policies. Theresa May would rather pursue Israel's interests in Middle East than a #Brexit deal.Deep State fears Brexit because it weakens the NATO 
Listening to Labour frontbencher @RichardBurgon on #newsnight debate with @Anna_Soubry on #Brexit. Hard to imagine but is Labour's position on Brexit even more useless & undeliverable than Theresa May & the Tories? And this is causing irreversible damage to politics & democracy.

By kicking the #Brexit can down the road again, has Theresa May merely postponed an inevitable political crisis in Britain? 
So do you reckon if we pull the plug & then put it back in again, this feckin’ #Brexit thing will actually work then?? 
This is official. Having a foot in Paris, the other in London is not good for your health. #Brexit meets @GiletsJaunes
PM: 'Does This house want to deliver #Brexit?'SNP benches reply 'No'.
By the looks of things the plan to derail #Brexit was born the moment the result of the #EUReferendum was announced. The plan was simple: confuse and frighten people and force another referendum that would be in favour of staying in the EU. The whole of the media played along.
Just in case some of you have lost sight of the truth of #Brexit, I offer this little "aide memoire". 
What should be the collective noun for Brexit politicians?- A delusion of Brexiters?- A derangement of Brexiters?- A debacle of Brexiters?- An insanity of Brexiters?Suggestions welcome.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #RevokeA50

The delay to the #Brexit vote is pointless.The EU is not going to change its stance so long as the UK’s position remains unchanged.MPs will dig their heals in rather than vote for a bad deal.May needs to confront reality or step aside. The national interest demands it.
With recent #Brexit developments & the delayed #meaningfulvote, my advice to businesses is to keep preparing for both scenarios. Read our full response to today's events here:  #TimeToAct #Brexit 
“People are angry because they know that the story of work hard, and get the reward, is bullshit. It’s about what school you went to, who you know, and the wealth you have access to”.  Wise words from my local tailor. #Brexit #Trump #Italy #France #Europe
Colleague (an ex-cop) at my girlfriend's work said (last week) that we should hurry up & #Brexit so we can stop bailing out the Eurozone, claiming "We've already bailed out Greece & Italy 4 times..."
So the government wants to appeal to the Courts to have the UK deprived of the sovereign right to revoke Article 50. Insanity! We need a #SharpExit from #Brexit lunacy. #RevokeA50.
Best #brexit thread ever.  
Having been denied the opportunity to speak on the "meaningful vote" on #Brexit, tonight I reminded the Leader of the House of her duty to reflect the deep anger felt across parliament, directly to Cabinet.

For those that don't understand the anger towards Mrs May's deal, understand this: leave voters put their trust in the Tories to deliver Brexit which, as clearly stated in the 2017 manifesto, meant us leaving the single market and customs union, and ending ECJ supremacy. #Brexit 
“The problem is that Britons were told lies,” Danish Finance Minister @Kristian_Jensen told Danish Television tonight in a special #Brexit broadcast. Danish government rule out any change to Withdraval Agreement #Brexit
Your Brexit loving friends & family might wish to be made aware of this simple explanation when they claim we should just drop out of the EU:Head of the #WTO says "Trade deals are like football leagues. #Brexit relegates #UK to Division 4" #peoplesvote
Nor should he. He made a bold promise to give the public a vote on something on which they had been denied a vote for decades. He had the minerals to keep his promise. He is right to have no regrets #brexit #BrexitVote
It is vital that the UK moves forward with a #Brexit that guarantees British sovereignty and self-determination, as a nation liberated from the shackles of the EU and free to shape its own destiny as a world power. 
I don't know how our MPs down there. It's torture, chaotic Gov demanding respect whilst treating everyone with utter contempt. Powerful contributions today from @joannaccherry @HannahB4LiviMP @alisonthewliss canny wait for the day when you are all up the road for good #Brexit

So our Prime Minister tells you that Parliament would heavily reject the deal specifically because of the back stop. And you react like this?! Do you even want a deal?! No one wants the backstop so come on @eucopresident just scrap it#brexit #BrexitVote #BrexitDeal
A no-deal would be the act of a criminal gang pushing the British people off the economic cliff so they can get themselves a #Brexit tax haven.
When 'The Thick of It' plots start to merge into real life... #BrexitVote #Brexit 
 What do they make of @theresa_may’s #brexit struggles and the vote delay on this side of the channel? They are a little bemused it seems. Here’s @ph_lamberts, @ElmarBrok_MEP & @piris_jc
Astonishing - Cab Secs as far as I can see have fled the scene of the crime, PM has apparently left the country! Front bench only populated w junior ministers, whips or PPSs - shameful ducking of responsibility for this appalling mess #Brexit #bùrach
Why is everybody ignoring the fact that Parliament has already legislated for No Deal when they voted through A50? Leaving without a deal will require new legislation with a majority in the House overturning A50. Unlikely. Game on. #Brexit
British people: “We would like to leave the EU because it impinges on our sovereignty and independence.”British PM: “I will implement your wishes to the extent to which the EU will allow me.” #Brexit#Democracy
Theresa May's horrendous & divisive actions ironically now see her "just about managing" - the very  group she promised to help. Let's be sure to offer her the same amount of help she subsequently offered them. #VoteMayDown #Brexit
The PM has spent the month saying "This is the best deal available", "There will be no more negotiations", The EU are saying the same, if she goes back to seek more she is proving that she is a cold liar and is unfit to govern. If she tries to ask for more she must go #Brexit
In response to my Qs re #ScottishCase #Brexit Secretary wrongly claimed Commission took same position on #Art50 revocation as UK Govt at #CJEU. This is not true. See judgment below. He’s refused to correct the record. Govt now routinely misleading the House
With all this talk about #Article50 it’s worth noting that all @Plaid_Cymru MPs voted against triggering it in the first place whilst nearly all Welsh Lab and Tory MPs backed the vote which started #Brexit process.
As we know very well in Ireland, any 'assurances' from the EU are completely worthless. They gave us 'guarantees' on neutrality and tax sovereignty to pass Lisbon 2.   In time, they proved meaningless.      #Irexit #Brexit

In case anyone is confused about DUP's attitude to Good Friday Agreement. #Brexit 
Leo Varadkar & Donald Tusk spoke by phone today. They discussed this week's European Council meeting & the current #Brexit situation. They agreed the Withdrawal Agreement is the best option & could not be renegotiated, & that preparations for a ‘no deal’ outcome should intensify

I think for Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn to table a vote of no confidence in Mrs May @theresa_may and potentially trigger a General Election, he has to be sure of winning. I think he knows he can't win unless he drops his beloved #Brexit. Drop Brexit Jeremy and sweep to victory.
Well, looks like Lord Buckethead  was correct all along. #Brexit really is a shit show . Don’t blame the EU, Ireland or even the Tories. Blame all those idiots that decided to blame immigrants/refugees/EU for their shitty lives & the country’s problems.

Let me be clear, @theresa_may is i believe the worst PM we've ever had, let me be even clearer, as Home Secretary she presided over go home migrant vans, #Windrush as PM she's excited about ending FoM, threatening a no deal #Brexit, i couldn't be any clearer #BrexitVote #GTTO

Vote down #Brexit! 
WATCH: The Prime Minister intends to return to Brussels and attempt further negotiations. This is a fool’s errand. The only way this shambles can be solved is through a People’s Vote.  #PeoplesVote #Brexit

#Brexit All my long life I’ve been delighted to admit I’m a #Scot until @theSNP took over Today, disgraceful comments by so called Scottish Nationalist representatives on our behalf left me stunned & furious. They don’t contribute anything to Westminster. Why are they there?
Absolutely. In fact to TRULY ascertain "the will of the British people" we need at least TWO more referendums. Two out of three to REALLY be sure...Or maybe 3 out of 5?..6 out of 10?Or - so there is absolutely NO doubt, why not shoot for 99 more referendums for 51/100! #Brexit 
This is a point that we need to get across to Leavers who think that #brexit enhances sovereignty. Let's be clear, it does the opposite.  It's just the way it is if you hand control of the country to a bunch of boardrooms & bankers. Which is what the Leave campaign want. #FBPE
It is amazing just how many members of our #Remain #Parliament begin a  statement with the words "I respect the result of the #referendum" before  proceeding to regurgitate a view which completely disrespects the result of the referendum! Disgraceful Political Maggots! #BREXIT 
So far the Prime Minister has refused to let the following have a vote on whether they agree with the #brexit deal:1. The cabinet2. Parliament3. The electorateA deal that radically changes Britain forever passed by just one vote - Theresa May’s.
Theresa May falsely says she is trying "to get the best #Brexit deal for the UK".In other news:-War is PeaceFreedom is SlaveryIgnorance is StrengthTraitor #MayMustGo - she deliberately sold us all out, right from the start.#BrexitVote#BrexitShambles#BrexitChaos
Today's newspapers ALL featured the same photo of the PM looking sad under an umbrella. Here's what she was thinking according to @meacentral pundits ... #Brexit 
Insights from 2015 #Grexit to #Brexit: Things much get worse before they get better. You must stare into the abyss until minds can concentrate 1/
I've just published a *spectacularly* gloomy essay on #Brexit in @ForeignPolicy... It's out of control, and it's not going away:  …
All aboard the #TFHell #GravyTrain⁦@MayorofLondon⁩ ⁦⁦@SadiqKhan⁩ Announced today that he don’t know when cross rail will be finished and he don’t know how much the final cost will be ...Oh he’s doing a good job of trying to derail #Brexit though #LondonIsOpen
Been following the #Brexit meltdown today. Those in Government who dare to say that the public sector need to reform and evolve to become relevant need to take a long hard look in the mirror!
If YOU could not secure a better #BREXIT deal from the EU OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS what makes YOU think you will geta better deal by Jan 29 @theresa_may ??? YOU are waisting very valueable time. Call for a NEW REFERENDUM immediately, let the people decide!
Not to bring politics into sport but rather bring a little humour into the #Brexit bollocks, it has to be said that if this cabinet of #TheresaMay were a rugby team even we'd fancy our chances against them !!!
Dear @Conservatives if you don't sort yourselves out ,ditch May or fail to deliver a proper #Brexit then the next GE will make 1997 look tame ..... You're welcome

The countdown has begun. Follow @BREXITINVIDEO to mark the final 100  days before #Brexit as #TheresaMay battles to save her deal and her job.  #BrexitIn - launching December 19.
Abject failure of either Govt or opposition to face the reality, that no further re-negotiation is possible. This is #Brexit warts & all, there is no consent for it without a #PeoplesVote
BREAKING: EU will not renegotiate #Brexit divorce deal, including backstop - EU's Tusk 
Why the UK military hasn't expressed its views on #Brexit deal? Why the silence? Why everything left to the bloody civilians who can't agree on anything? What kind of nuclear power the UK is? 
Dear Donald,In the time honoured tradition of respectful debate I always try to make my points courteously. For you I make an exception.F**k off. #Brexit 
#Corbyn the coward and #Brexit apologist refuses to put a No confidence motion.What the hell is the point of #labour ?
Labour Leadership appear not to be tabling a no confidence vote...to Lexiters it is not a problem to let things slip & give the Govt more rope.What they should do is force a vote on the #Brexit WA as planned. This would sink May & force a Rethink in good time. Cynical gameplay.
“May says she is going into the negotiations. All options are on the table, she says.” Except that she is not going into a negotiation because they’ve finished. And you do need two parties to negotiate. Only options are the WA/PD, no deal or no #Brexit. 
The chamber erupts in laughter as UK Prime Minister Theresa May postpones key #Brexit vote  via @ReutersTV
Theresa May cancelled the #BrexitVote because she knew she would lose - she knows her deal is not the will of Parliament.She denies us a #PeoplesVote for the same reason.Yet she persists in saying #Brexit is the will of the people.That is not true, Prime Minister.It's a lie.
My colleague and friend @NicDakinMP just compared Theresa May's #Brexit deal to the parrot in the dead parrot sketch. Her deal is no more, has ceased to be, bereft of life, it rests in peace, and this is an ex-deal. #BrexitDeal #BrexitChaos She needs to face reality.
The great irony of all this #Brexit chaos? It’s all about the Irish backstop. Which a clear majority in Northern Ireland are in favour of.
Goodness, I had started to forget the sheer exuberance, joy and vibrancy of his writing.  Even if you disagree with his pro EU message, his analysis of how the negotiations would go hits the bullseye #Brexit 
I have decided to call #EUCO on #Brexit (Art. 50) on Thursday. We will not renegotiate the deal, including the backstop, but we are ready to discuss how to facilitate UK ratification. As time is running out, we will also discuss our preparedness for a no-deal scenario.
"Teeheehee," as villain in the melodrama would chuckle.#Parliament voted on an exit date-that's all. #TheresaMay can play this out all the way to March.She resigns day after #Brexit date. Gets a seat in  Lords because she made way for another Tory  And that's how it rolls. 
Dear Mr Farage @Nigel_Farage your opinion is as welcome as walking in to a wet eggy fart in a confession box. As somebody who HAS donned khaki & DID pick up a rifle I can tell you in all sincerity you can believe in Britain or you can believe in #Brexit, you can't believe in both 
So, apparently, we’re not having a vote today about not having a vote tomorrow....#Brexit
Finally #Brexit is starting to look like #Grexit and the Greek summer of 2015. It took the Brits 2.5 years of "keeping calm and carrying on" but we are getting there ... I just hope I won't see a second bank-run in less that 4 years
May says a #PeoplesVote would be divisive. FFS the country is hardly united behind #Brexit. Latest polls give 56% for #Remaining.But what chance is there when #Corbyn bottled tabling no confidence motion.#Brexit broke Britain
Just a reminder that while Theresa May's humiliating #Brexit shambles understandably dominates the headlines today, another one of her outrageous scandals is still festering away out of sight #Windrush #HostileEnvironment
RT and Vote in my #BrexitVote There are four #brexit choices for Theresa May:1) #BacktheBrexitDeal - the best we can get but it's so bad we can't even have a #MeaningfulVote2) #Leave with #NoDealBrexit - disaster for generations3) Revoke #article50 and #Remain4) #PeoplesVote
#Brexit has demonstrated that UK Democracy needs radical reform.It would be helpful to achieve that if people did not vote for Labour or Tory in next GE.We need to break the hold of tribal politics.
May is behaving like a Dictator!Her aim is to delay and delay and then say its my Deal or nothing.#Brexit #BrexitVote

A magisterial explanation of the historical context of #Brexit. 
As Theresa May calls off the #Brexit vote, many believe a second referendum is becoming more likely. Do you support a second referendum?
At this point, the best thing Theresa May can do is Revoke Article 50, drive to Dundee in her bare feet and stock up on Toblerone. #brexit
With all the debate about #Brexit today I’m guessing that Sadiq Khan hopes that this news isn’t noticed. I want to make sure it is. 
"We joined the common market initially, trading and I want to maintain the sovereignty of our country. We didn’t sign up for the federal state of Europe."This country has been through too much to just give our sovereignty away, that is the main reason I voted leave." #Brexit 
Tory MP James "not so" Cleverly seems to suggest that May going back to the EU & "banging on the table" could solve the Irish Border problem. He needs to careful, with that kind of delusion he might make himself next week's #Brexit minister.

Neato Trick! "Facing Defeat, Theresa May Seeks Delay on #Brexit Vote in Parliament" 
The Prime Ministerial strategy of fail, fail and fail again won’t end well #brexit
The British Government is deluding itself if it thinks Irish interests can be cast aside. Today's announcement from Theresa May to delay the vote is the latest chapter in the #Brexit shambles saga.The protections for Ireland must & will be defended at every turn @davidcullinane
Perfidious Albion. No longer a fair way to describe the UK, but...Seeing its parliament in full-on confused, paranoid, uninformed, Europhobic, foreigner-distrusting, reality-denying, Ireland-ignoring, fog-in-Channel-Continent-cut-off self-harming mode is nearly as scary. #Brexit
Sky News confirming that No.10 has said the move to delay the #Brexit vote WON’T be put to a Commons vote. This must be what living in an absolute monarchy was like.(NB for the slow kids: we’re a democracy with a Parliament!)

Enough.I cannot bear this any more.May offers nothing. Has no date for a vote. No idea how to get a deal.She's simply, hopelessly, buying time while the Article 50 clock is ticking.119 days to go to 29.3.2019.#Brexit
Theresa May cannot keep ignoring the fact that, with greater information, the British people are changing their minds on #Brexit. We would heartily support a second referendum that included the option to Remain full members of the EU. #PeoplesVote
Ok @WilliamShatner reacting to the PM saying she’ll boldly go to Brussels is definitely my best #Brexit moment OF ALL TIME. @SirPatStew say something to @MichelBarnier!
So the unopenable deal is now being reopened with the hope of changing an unchangeable provision and so the uncancellable vote has been cancelled. How can we believe a word the Prime Minister says? #shambles #brexit
Also learned today. May wishes to go back to EU to get further/stronger/new "reassurances" re the backstop.Those aren't binding.The deal is already written. There will be no renegotiation.May's move is a delay to allow time for more spin.Nothing more.#Brexit
So to recap ..The best deal for Britain - one that can't be renegotiated Has to go back and be renegotiated That means it wasn't the best deal Double fibs it is then #Brexit

Hang on, @theresa_may, what about the right of #UKinEU and #EUinUK to carry on living OUR lives in the same way? Any #Brexit strips us of at least some of our rights. And many of us didn't even get a vote on our fate. It's absolutely criminal.
56% of people in the north voted to remain in the EU. The DUP’s reckless #Brexit agenda is disastrous for the island of Ireland. They don’t speak for a majority of citizens in the north on Brexit. #HumanRightsDay #NoToBrexit

Events at Westminster have businesses across the UK looking on with utter dismay. It’s hard to convey the depth of frustration in our businesses & communities, where the political impasse over #Brexit has real-world consequences. @britishchambers view:
As the #Brexit vote gets delayed, betting market expectation that the UK will leave EU by 29/03/2019 falls to an all-time low of 37% 
The argument that some people voted for the first time when they voted for #Brexit...... is the weirdest argument for preventing people from voting again. 
This is very much not democracy #Brexit - parliament is broken. @theresa_may is a fraud #Brexit is a shambles the government is an utter wreak and is going to take the #UK with it

"Deeply discourteous" for government to halt the #Brexit debate - Commons Speaker John Bercow reacts to delay of vote#BrexitVote reaction & analysis:

Unprecedented scenes in the house aa the speaker says he "strongly suggests" the government do not unilaterally cancel the vote, & challenges them to "rise to the occasion" by allowing MPs a say. This is uncharted territory. #Brexit

May going begging to EUPity she & her Ministers likened our Union to  Soviet system & a recent MP urged HMG to use the threat of food shortages to pressure our Irish colleagues.I hope the Union on behalf of the values we share, politely tell Mrs May to Foxtrot Oscar#brexit
The #Brexit referendum was an Advisory referendum.  With what we now know 2 years layer, and after today's canned #BrexitVote, the Government needs fresh advice from the very people it is supposed to serve#peoplesvote
Theresa May: “Meanwhile the risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit increases.” Take a moment to absorb that. This is the Prime Minister saying she is no longer in control of her policy. #HoC #Brexit
May's Plan B emerges:-Ist aim: stay in power-2nd: Delay and delay-3rd: Ignore what EU says-4th: Try to force decision between her #Brexit deal and No-Deal
It is noticeable by its absence that PM has failed to give a date for a new vote. Dragging this out to the last moment would be shameful tactics to save herself rather than the country. #brexit

May says looking for additional reassurances on backstop from EU leaders. Their response will be: reassurances, yes. Fundamental renegotiation, no #Brexit
PM getting the tone of this all wrong. She's still defending her "deal" and suggesting opposition is all about the "backstop". She's wrong, she's in trouble because #BREXIT is rubbish.

Just seconds into May's speech & the commons erupts into laughter as the Prime Minister says she has "listened to what's been said." They are right to laugh. All she's listened to, as ever, is the voice inside her head telling her to cling to power at any cost. #Brexit

Even allowing for my incontestable biases, I would have thought we've reached the #Brexit point where Leavers who are not maniacal would want to revoke A50, sit down, hammer out an actual plan and try again

Arriving back at Westminster and the news is that the PM has listened to concerns expressed over the #WAdeal and is heading to Brussels. It’s clear that she is acting in the national interest and standing up for Britain. The @Conservatives are the only party now backing #Brexit.
Meanwhile, yet another poll on #Brexit confirms the country as a whole has swung to Remain, which now has a 12-point lead over Leave.Why are we treating the will of the people as something static, when it so clearly changes as new facts come to light?

UK PM @theresa_may appears to have postponed a vote on #Brexit in Parliament she was about to lose. Her job was to deliver #Brexit. So now? Anything is possible - she resigns, a 2nd referendum, a Gen. Election, delay Brexit. One thing is constant- this is a self inflicted mess.
Sir Alan Duncan (unluckily for him the minister on #PoliticsLive as vote delayed) says “You’ve got to beat every bush and see what flies out of it.” Not sure if that’s now official Government #Brexit policy..
Get your yellow vest ready...#brexit #brexitbetrayal
EU inflexibility on the backstop (a political device for a non existent problem) is proof that their aim is to get #Brexit reversed. ECJ ruling on Article 50 is part of the same picture. Who has persuaded them that Remain will win a second vote?
EU source on @theresa_may pulling #brexit vote. “She’ll get ‘optics’ but little of substance” at the EU leaders’ summit “And then what? We’re back where we were”. To be honest, I reckon that might be optimistic. Not sure how much patience left on EU side.

Pulling the ‘deal’ vote would just delay the inevitable. Brussels will not grant any further significant concessions. ‘Norway+’ is a non-starter for many reasons. Actual choice before Parliament is btwn a #PeoplesVote or a ‘No Deal’ #Brexit. Let’s get on with making that decision
In the end Brexit could only work if there was consensus, at least amongst Leave supporters if no one else.  But instead #Brexit leaders are caught between May's deal, no deal, Canada+++ & Norway+This is the issue, not May, Brexit leaders cannot speak with a single voice
The last enduring myth of #Brexit is that "Remainer" May betrayed leaversLast night's #C4Brexit debate showed that up for what it is:3 offers from 3 *clear* brexiters - all incompatible, each hated by the othersThere is no deal anyone can agree on, that's what killed Brexit

.@Mina_Andreeva on #Brexit today @EU_Commission : #ECJ: “We take note of today’s judgment. As far as we’re concerned, the #UK is leaving the #EU on 29/03/19. #MeaningfulVote: “We will not renegotiate. As @JunckerEU said, this deal is the best - and only - deal possible.”
JUST IN: Theresa May is said to pull the vote on her #Brexit deal 
The much despised and hated #ECJ has reaffirmed our national sovereignty and said we can #RevokeA50 unilaterally. No wonder the Brexeratti hate them, personally I thank the court for their decision and for blowing the #Brexit argument into orbit. 
James O'Brien asked this Brexiteer when he would realise reality and the answer was VERY revealing.@mrjamesob | #Brexit
I’ve often disagreed with Margaret Beckett over the years, but on #Brexit, she’s spot on: “Instead of denying the public a people’s vote on the mess she has helped create, she should now recognise the only way forward is to have more democracy, not less” 
Mayday Mayday! Here is the UK vessel 'Strong and Stable' stuck between a Brexit rock and a hard place and taking on water fast. Crew taking to the lifeboats and captain considering abandoning ship. #Brexit

The brilliant Andy Serkis portrays the insane reality of brexit.#indyref2 #brexit #DissolveTheUnion
To argue that people didn’t understand what they were voting for, or that their opinions might have changed, is to undermine the whole legal and moral foundation of democratic government. Any election result could be contested on the same basis:  #Brexit
Cancel #Brexit. Keep our rebate. Keep our MEPs. Keep our opt-outs.THIS is the best deal on the table.If we press on with Brexit, after 10 years demographics dictate that we'll be back in the EU... but saddled with a worse deal than the one we've got.
Angus RobertsonAfter defeating the UK government in the Scottish courts, UK Supreme Court and European Court of Justice the flagship @BBCr4today programme fails to interview ANY of the Scottish parliamentarians who brought the case. Absolutely shocking. No excuse. #Brexit
Is this the same Alan Duncan who dismissed the #Brexit vote as the working class having a "tantrum" about immigration...? 
ECJ says UK can unilaterally revoke Art 50 so Farage says "collusion to stop Brexit continues"If ECJ had said the opposite, Farage would have said "see, evil EU dictatorship that Britain cannot leave"If you want a case study of confirmation bias, this is it. #Brexit 
May's crunch #Brexit vote: Win, lose or delay? 
TOMORROW is BIG vote day! PEOPLE of GLOBAL BRITAIN, put your TRUST in #Brexit LIONS @BorisJohnson and @Jacob_Rees_Mogg!  They want No Deal LIBERATION from EU so NEW TRADING FRIENDS can RIDE your nation like a PHALLUS! #DingDong #HardBrexit  
  This morning, our @LancasterUni @LancsUniLaw Senior Lecturer @AngusMacCulloch spoke to @trtworld about the European Court of Justice's ruling on #Brexit and #Article50. You can watch it here: 
No matter how you voted can ‘The will of the people’ be ignored by asking what ‘the will of the people’ is?Stick you opinion here  #PeoplesVote #Brexit
The UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50, says ECJ. So Parliament can vote to revoke Article 50, the PM can send a letter to Brussels, and that would be an end to the chaos of #Brexit. As simple as that. Then we could actually start to address Britain's real problems.#C4Brexit
"It was a silly question in first place. Cameron asked us to sort out his problem with Tory Party, then scarpered!" #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Andy Serkis is forever a genius #Brexit 
Remember, its ok to have an argument when you are passionate about a subject, just take a step back when it gets heated and make a call to the person.You will be surprissed how much you both have in common. Dont let #Brexit poison your head or heart,its out of our control
#Brexit is now a parlour game detached from the reality of life in Tory austerity Britain. The inference that Brussels rather than Tory central office is the root cause of mass poverty, homelessness and despair in the UK must be rejected. The left must focus on class not flags.
Many thanks go to:-Andy WightmanRoss GreerAlyn SmithDavid MartinCatherine StihlerJoanna CherryFor showing the way on Article 50 #Brexit
Well done to the cross-party alliance of Scottish parliamentarians who defended democracy & secured the ruling that the UK can unilaterally reverse #Article50 & stop #Brexit. Many thanks to @andywightman @alynsmith @joannacherry @DavidmartinMEP @C_stihler_MEP @ross_greer
The UK can unilaterally revoke article 50, says ECJ. The government has tried to keep this truth from us. Here is Liz Truss lying that A50 was irrevocable. How can we have democracy when the government lies about the most important legal fact about #Brexit?#C4Brexit #PeoplesVote
Commenting on my way into FAC in Brussels this morning - “The deal that is there between the #UK and the #EU is not going to change. I hope people will see it for what it is, which is a fair, balanced document" #Brexit 
UK can unilaterally revoke article 50, says ECJ. This is the news the government didn't want us to hear, the court case which the government tried to block. This is the truth which the government tried to cover up with lies. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #c4Brexit
#European Court of Justice rules #Britain free to revoke #Brexit unilaterally 
Thanks to Speedy Gonzales @sylviademars we have @commonslibrary analysis of the CJEU judgement on revoking Article 50 for you already: #Brexit 
3) EU v much wants to avoid a no-deal scenario but EU leaders unlikely to provide even written clarifications on controversial #Brexit issues like the backstop to help the PM unless they get a pretty cast iron guarantee that will get the deal through Parliament in a second vote
2) EU leaders will invite Theresa May to tell them what’s going on in the U.K, what her next steps will be and what she hopes for from them at their scheduled EU summit on Weds and Thursday this week #Brexit
Continued enthusiasm for #Brexit could be interpreted as a revolt against topography. The flat parts of Britain are arrayed against the hilly ones. 
1) EU watching to see if their #Brexit deal negotiated with the PM is defeated in parliament tomorrow and if so, by how much
The key point for me in the whole #Brexit debate is that the Government made a pledge on the Referendum ballot paper to inplement what voters decided. Whatever we think of #Brexit, it’s important that the pledge is upheld. The Government is morally obliged to take us out of #EU
Labour leadership options for response to UK being able to revoke A50:a) "Crushing defeat for government, they spent thousands of our money on 5 QCs to stop MPs knowing about this vital safety net for #Brexit. May's my deal or no deal in tatters" b) "nah, no biggie really" 
BREAKING: UK GDP slows for the  4th quarter after monthly growth just 0.1% as businesses await tomorrow’s Brexit vote #brexit #brexitvote
Currency traders glued to desks as UK Parliament’s #Brexit vote late Tue will come during thin liquidity heading into mkt's witching hour. ‘Don’t plan to be anywhere else but here,’ CEO tells staff. Money managers canceling evening plans to stay at office. 
Now we know #Brexit can be stopped if the British people want - today’s European Court ruling confirms its a sovereign issue for the UK; we have the unilateral right to revoke Article 50 notification; and the UK would stay in EU with existing privileges 
Dear Labour there's nothing to gain by pandering to the disillusioned masses who voted emotionally..They won't thank you when you can't deliver your fantasy #Lexit. It's #Brexit & it Removes Rights w/o Consent & leave us WORSE OFF.Sometimes you've just gotta sayYou Were Wrong.
Theresa May's plan at tomorrow's vote is pure rope-a-dope. Like Mohammed Ali against George Foreman in the '74 Rumble in the Jungle she is hoping to bounce off the ropes and win EU concessions after taking some hits in the Commons.The risk is she might get knocked out. #Brexit
Tomorrow we’re holding a rally in Parliament Square to put pressure on the Government to give the people a #FinalSay on #Brexit.Join us!  #PeoplesVote
6) The EU gave Ireland a veto over the #Brexit deal (the conditions of the UKs exit) right from the start. Other EU countries won’t suddenly turn their backs on Dublin now. Apart from anything else it would make a public mockery of their club and its “unity” over Brexit
Spotted this morning on @SkyNews sunrise with @skysarahjane  #brexit #attenboroughforpm
Now that everyone has witnessed the total mess that the UK has put itself in with the #Brexit vote, it’s time for another referendum. #Remain
This is the 1st win for #Scotland in the #Brexit process. It won’t be the last. It shows what can be done when politicians from different parties work together in the national interest. Huge plaudits to my @scotgp & Labour co-petitioners #ScottishCase #Art50
2) All EU leaders watching tomorrow’s vote. Of course they want to avoid a no deal #Brexit BUT they feel the deal - so painfully negotiated between EU and UK - is too fresh to re-open. Clarifications, yes but fundamental renegotiations, no.
Again, at such a key moment in UK and at such high political levels, evidence of deep misunderstanding of EU: The PM is under pressure in some quarters to delay #Brexit vote to allow her first to “improve” deal in Brussels BUT EU is determined not to budge at this stage
It was put it to voters just 2 years ago, Brian. They voted to Leave and were told ‘The Government will implement what you decide’. Not ‘If Leave wins we’ll have another referendum in 2019 to see if you’ ve changed your mind’. #Brexit #Democracy
31% of Lab supporters and 27% of Lib Dem supporters voted for #Brexit.Are they right wing?

Today #ECJ judgment is also a very impressive demonstration of active  citizenship, here in the framework of #Brexit . Essential component of #democracy , especially in our times.
This van crashed in the high street in Penge last week &, for some reason, has been left half on the road & pavement.Now someone is having satirical fun with it #Brexit 
When the Tories get rid of May, can Labour get rid of Corbyn too, please? Their complicity and duplicity over #Brexit means that, only once they're both gone, can our politics move forward and our divisions begin to heal.#PeoplesVote
A big moment: The EU Court of justice has ruled that the UK can unilaterally revoke #Brexit and stay in EU without needing any further negotiations.We now have a simple way out of this #BrexitChaos. Time to let the people decide with a #PeoplesVote
At great personal risk, @JolyonMaugham has held the Government to account over #Brexit, which begs the question: what is the point of @jeremycorbyn?#PeoplesVote

Today's @thetimes cartoon #Brexit 
European Commission determined U.K. could NOT unilaterally revoke Article 50European Court of Justice decisions take 2-5 years+ECJ took less than two weeks and a 30 second hearing in an empty court to decide we can unilaterally revoke Article 50Prepare yourselves. #Brexit
Anyway, I'm not interested in anything to do with #Brexit!This morning I transferred £500 to help a veteran cover their rent over Christmas, and I bought another veteran a new sofa and chairs as theirs was destroyed in a fire! 
Majority in Northern Ireland think united Ireland more likely after #Brexit 
Best news possible on the Article 50 case. The European Court of Justice  has found the UK can unilaterally cancel #Brexit  and will stay in the EU on exactly the same terms.Excellent x-party campaign with @ChrisLeslieMP and Joanna Cherry.Full steam ahead for a #PeoplesVote !
Lord Kerr, the original author of Article 50, told @GlasgowCC #Brexit summit this in October. Now confirmed by the ECJ. Another excuse gone. UK gov could extend timetable now then revoke if a #PeoplesVote chooses Remain. A logical route to averting disaster.
ECJ ruled this morning that the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50. This means we don’t need the approval from the other EU member states to stop the #Brexit process.Read more here
#InformedConsent @peoplesvote_uk and the right for young voters who will bear the biggest #Brexit  burden to have their say over their future @OFOCBrexit
Here's the full decision from the European Court of Justice confirming Article 50 can be revoked and we could stay in the EU.  Well done to the Scottish parliamentarians who fought for this clarity. #Article50 #brexit 
Two particularly interesting points in today's #ECJ ruling: Article 50 can be revoked as long as no exit deal agreed. So even more reason for Remainers to vote against @theresa_may tomorrow. Also, if UK revoked, they'd go back to previous #EU membership terms. #Brexit 
Whoa. #brexit #mondaymorning #mondaymotivation
 No you didn't imagine that carrot!@ChrisMasonBBC has some interesting props to explain the current political situation: #Brexit #MondayMorning #MondayMotivation

The petitioners are available to @BBCr4today & others to correct this misinformation should they wish to have us on the programme as opposed to a parade of Tories on one side of the argument #Brexit #scottishcase #PeoplesVote
Hello Britain, your friends in Europe have just made it easier than ever  for your to change your mind and stop wreaking economic and social havoc on your people. #brexit
Over 16 million people voted Remain 2 1/2 yrs ago @michaelgove @BBCr4today & the number has grown. Ignore them at your peril. We want @peoplesvote_uk on your #Brexit deal w Remain on ballot paper. Now we know the detail ppl have a right to #FinalSay & right to change their mind
So a court rules that we can cancel #Brexit and remain on our current terms. It’s heartbreaking to see that the deal that is best for the U.K. - just staying put with extraordinary opt outs - seems politically impossible.
Michael Gove on @BBCr4today talking nonsense about #Scottish case it was not a #PeoplesVote Initiative. The case was inspired by @JolyonMaugham & raised by Scottish parliamentarians to ensure people particularly MPs knew all the #Brexit options.
Now, British Parliament, do what you (usually) do so well. Act decisively in the interest of the nation. #Brexit 
A crucial EU Court ruling:  if it wants to, Britain can revoke #Brexit and stay in EU without needing further negotiations. No threat to its rebate, opt-outs or other special provisions A simple way out of the #BrexitChaos is available....
2) ECJ has ruled that if U.K. changes its mind about #Brexit before the official leaving date of 29 March 2019 then the U.K. would stay in EU under current conditions - ie with rebate, opt-outs from Euro currency etc
Victory for the Scottish parliamentarians who brought Brexit case to European Court of Justice. UK can end damaging Brexit process and remain on current terms. #Brexit 
A huge victory for #Scottish parliamentarians & #Scottish courts. #Art50 can be unilaterally revoked. Thanks frm me @AlynSmith @andywightman @Ross_Greer @C_Stihler_MEP @davidmartinmep @JolyonMaugham to all who supported us #Brexit #ScottishCase #PeoplesVote
Great news - Britain *can* withdraw the #Article50 notice unilaterally the European Court confirms. Time for May to see sense, do so, & put her rotten #Brexit “deal” to the public in a #peoplesvote
Brilliant news - reinforcing Parliament’s ability to take back control of the #Brexit process 
This is good news.It means when May says “there’s no alternative to my deal except No Deal”, the response can be: no, Art 50 can be revoked and the UK could stay. #article50 #brexit 
#BreakingNews: The European Court of Justice rules the UK can unilaterally revoke #Article50 to leave the European Union to halt #brexit. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
#ECJ: UK is free to unilaterally revoke the notification of its intention to withdraw from the EU – Case C-621/18 Wightman #Brexit 
EU believes it has nothing to gain by reacting to political chaos in U.K. The #Brexit vote will be watched carefully in all EU capitals. No sign of any intention to renegotiate at this stage. My thoughts (in case missed last week.. They still hold!):  
Heathrow will pay the £65 fee for all of it’s employees seeking settled status due to #Brexit to help provide some certainty.“It is crucial for us to have diverse, happy and valued colleagues”#PeoplesVote#The5Million#FinalSayForAll
I have to say that I am now far more convinced that #Brexit is the correct path for Britain and I'm fully prepared to vote for a #NoDeal if I'm asked to vote again. 
With the possibility of a #NoDealBrexit looming and the government building extra “refrigeration capacity” to help stockpile drugs,I’m very concerned of reports stating MPs and pharmacists will be given the power to overrule GP prescriptions, they do not know my patients. #Brexit
Let's face it. There's a fairly large underbelly of racism and xenophobia in England. Without it #brexit could never have happened. #r4today
I think many of us have been aware of this for a long time.  #brexit is a right wing initiative to support the installing of a Far Right regime. #FBPE
#brexit is the greatest betrayal against the country in history. Never have so many been betrayed by so few.  It is an horrific act of treachery by a cabal of conspirators for their own interest & not the national interest. The #BrexitCoup must be put down. #BrexitBetrayal #FBPE
Delay or defeat: the official line is the vote is going ahead tomorrow, but I understand conversations are going on between the PM and the Commission/EU leaders to get some movement on the backstop. Will they throw her a lifeline? #Brexit
Who cursed Britain with these dreadful "leaders"? May, Corbyn, Cable, Batten, Sturgeon.... where did we go so wrong? Lord North, you are forgiven for losing America - Theresa May is attempting to lose Britain. #csm #brexit 
The Govt have fought tooth and nail to prevent the British people from knowing whether Article 50 can be cancelled and #Brexit stopped.This morning, at 8am, the European Court will make it clear whether this is the case.And whether we can #exitfrombrexit after a #PeoplesVote
At 8am this morning #CJEU will issue final judgment in #Scottish case on whether #Art50 notice can be revoked #Brexit #PeoplesVote

That EU unified armed forces that Macron, Merkel, Tusk, Verhofstadt, Juncker et al have been demanding? It’s already here in its embryonic form. Imagine what an unelected, unremovable, unaccountable EU politburo could do with all the armies of Europe under its control? #Brexit

When is psyops not psyops? When it's a Tory Government spending £2m of UK taxpayers' money to fund a smear campaign against the leader of Her Majesty's Opposition. Putin didn't cause #Brexit, Carole. 40yrs of neoliberalism and 8yrs of austerity did. This is McCarthyite nonsense. 
Thank you Mr Gardiner @BarryGardiner for removing all doubt in my mind concerning lending my vote to @UKLabour. You spoke on #C4Brexit for Labour and made it clear it is unequivocally a party for #Brexit which will make us all poorer. You will not get my vote.

I do hope you realise, people, that they are playing out a farce with that #BrexitDeal to convince everyone that there are splits and disagreements between them and that a fierce battle is raging in Westminster. Everything has been already decided and #Brexit will be buried.
By definition , and it is concerning this needs to be explained to a Labour MP , any and every type of #Brexit is economically and socially worse than what we have now & therefore can only make Britain poorer.  It cannot, in any circumstances at all , deliver a “better future”

Let's just be clear, Gardiner on #C4brexit did everything he could to keep fantasy consequence free #Brexit aliveWhy aren't we on 70% Remain? Because Labour are lying to people with "my brexit unicorns are shinier"

Wrong! I voted leave because the EU is a 1950s solution to 21st century problems. It is a highly protectionist Little Europeans Club and I wanted the UK to be free to become a more outward and global nation. My vote had nothing whatsoever to do with living standards #Brexit 
Remoaners are the most smug, self centred, sneering, materialistic snobs I've ever encountered online. #brexit
I'm increasingly of the view that remainers are delusional. It's not the EU they value. They evidence shows they don't even care. What they want is to hang on to their systemic entitlements and privileges, refusing to admit the status quo is living on borrowed time. #Brexit
Gisela Stuart - "What is interesting is that the public is not supporting a second referendum."Polling clearly shows only 39% of the voters would want their MPs to vote for a second referendum and something like 44% don’t." #Brexit 
People that want #brexit. Have you considered that.... • Our human rights won’t be protected • Violence in Northern Ireland could restart • No European Court to balance power of government• THOUSANDS of jobs will be lost• Future of UK in jeopardy Still a good idea?

Watch this video I took today at the Brexit Betrayal March where these far-right Nazis were singing.....oh wait a minute #rulebritannia#BrexitBetrayalMarch#Brexit#BrexitBetrayal
This is incitement to hatred and violence and needs to be stopped or prosecuted frankly. We are a parliamentary democracy not ruled by the mob that Nigel seeks to inflame. There is no ‘betrayal’ there is simply continued democratic process. Bring on peaceful challenge #Brexit 
Quick #Brexit summary:3,000 Leavers marched in London today. The so-called 52%, the majority, cobbled together 3K. Meanwhile, the 48%, the remoaning minority (apparently), managed 700,000. I’m not sure about you, but I think it’s clear what the country wants. #PeoplesVote
What has been the COST of Cameron's EURef folly ?Apart of course from the £millions that #Brexit has already incurred.*Country divided*Ridiculed internationally*Govt in chaos*Sterling weakenedIn the meantime :The CARNAGE of Tory *austerity* continues unabated !
This video was taken an hour before the 12:30 march set off. The media will make out it was attended by bald, tattooed, uneducated racists who didn't know what they voted for. Today's march and speeches showed otherwise#Brexit #BrexitBetrayalMarch #BrexitBetrayal

If you’re wondering what the upside-down V flags were at the #BrexitBetrayalMarch they’re from right-wing group, Generation Identity. An undercover Al Jazeera investigation found GI members in France carried out racist attacks & made Nazi salutes.  #Brexit

Can we stop calling @theresa_may's con a #BrexitDeal?It's not #Brexit, in any shape.It's a flavour of Remain, worse than initial Remaining ever was.We need to call it as it is, TM's #RemainPlusDeal.

While it would be incorrect to say that a vote for #brexit was racist (just like every vote for Trump wasn’t a racist vote), it would be equally wrong & naive to argue tribalism wasn’t the central variable 
Opinion: Being against the #EU does not make you "right wing".1: You can be for open borders and free trade, and still reject a central EU government.2: Not nationalism vs the EU. True #Europhiles want a EU state, making them nationalists.How do you feel?#Brexit #Frexit

The Brextremists don't just want to avoid new EU laws on tax avoidance. They want a desperate UK, deprived of its role as a gateway to Europe, to be forced to slash taxes, regulations and workplace rights in order to attract & retain business. They want a #Brexit tax haven.#FBPE
Meanwhile, in the U.K., May and her band of merry globalists try to suffocate #BRExit with the backstop deal. If it gets defeated Tuesday as it should, things are really going to heat up.

All sorts of poorly thought out signs at the #BrexitBetrayalMarch, but this one is the best example of #brexit mentality. "I Am Not a European". You literally are, mate. You can be against the EU, but you still are on the same continent as Europe. 
Unlike the Greens, Labour can't afford to dismiss out-of-hand the views of 17.4 million people who voted for #Brexit. Labour MPs represent over a hundred constituencies that voted Leave. The Greens' only MP represents one constituency that voted to Remain. #Marr

#C4Brexit discussion is one made up of FOUR English MPs.This is not good enough. Where are the Scottish, Welsh & Northern Irish representatives? If you want to have an English only #Brexit why not name it that or even more have an #EnglishBrexit?
In 2014 some NO voters genuinely thought that the UK would have Scotland’s best interests at heart. The #Brexit process has opened some eyes as Scotland is treated with dis-respect and downright contempt. They now know the UK uses the “family of nations” line when it suits them.

If anyone's playing Politics with #Brexit it's May, not Corbyn. She wants this to fail, handing the Captaincy to Corbyn as the Tories are manning the lifeboats, leaving him and Labour at the helm as the ship goes down, and next year the media will lay all the blame on him #Marr

Rumours are that May pull or delay.  Tuesday’s vote on her botched #Brexit deal. If she does it will be the biggest most humiliating u-turn by a PM ever. I can’t wait to see how the BBC spin it as a victory for May.

I can’t see the point of the Norway option. OK it is  less economically harmful than other versions of #Brexit. But it impairs our sovereignty, surrenders control, and is obviously a worse outcome for UK than staying in the EU.

Abt 1000 demonstrators. Some 65,000 turned out last week for the climate demo.  RT @ian56789: #GiletsJaunes attempt to storm the anti democracy EU Parliament in #Brussels We've got #Brexit & #Frexit - is this the beginning of Belgium Exit? #8Decembre
Peter Hargreaves @PkhPeter is right. It’s time for a new political party and real #Brexit politicians should take him up on his offer. The electorate will support it. The current parties are out of tune with the people. They don’t want #Brexit. #BrexitBetrayal #BrexitDebate
Didn't this arsehole say that #Brexit would be the "easiest" thing to negotiate? Reminder: the whole time he was in the job - TWO YEARS - he spent a grand total of just 4 HOURS personally negotiating with Barnier.
All four elected politicians English MPs. No Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland voices. Would be great if #BBC just understood #Brexit as an #EnglishBrexit & got on with discussing that.
Trio of donors, who shelled out £5million between them for the #Leave campaign, say #Remaining would be a better option than May's #Brexit. My heart bleeds for them. They believed the lies and backed the wrong side. 
#FakeNews Trump had a bad day. France burns as Macron hides. Theresa May has no confidence with English people on #Brexit deal. Merkel has ruined Germany. Tell me again about a bad day. 
Check the flag out on this armoured Veichle which is in #France to scare and threaten protesters. This is how it starts believe me. #GiletsJaunes #YellowVests #MacronMustGo #Brexit

Matthew Goodwin - "I’m surprised at the response of Remainers over the last two years. Because there just seems to be a lack of self-reflection on what went wrong in 2016.“What’s the new narrative? What’s the new conversation? What’s the new offer?" #Brexit 
Economic analyst Chris Clarke - "I absolutely disagree that a no deal is bad for the UK. For me, it’s the greatest economic opportunity this country has had in 100 years.""We go to WTO rules, we’re gonna get tariffs put on us but we run a trade deficit with Europe." #Brexit 
According to @johnharris1969, Labour has no position on #Brexit. Apart from the one they've had for the last 2yrs: respect the referendum result, vote against a bad deal, offer to negotiate a better deal or, as a last resort, go back to the public. Fuck me, it's not complicated. 
#YellowVests are on the Belgian streets. Art-loi station closed until recently and chaos all around. The demand is clear: working class wants to be heard #Brexit #GiletsJaunes

Cameron called a referendum he didn't want, to solve a problem the public didn't have, solely to heal a divide in his party, that he couldn't manage.#Brexit, a solution desperately seeking a problem.
#UnitedKingdom | The leader of the British Labour Party, #JeremyCorbyn claimed poverty and inequality are some of the reasons for the results of the #Brexit referendum. 
Despite really trying to get people with a mix of views (genuinely) to fill in the Brexitometer, one thing was clear; people have lost faith in this government’s version of #Brexit. A half-baked mess of a deal.A #PeoplesVote is the only realistic and democratic solution.
So much ill informed comment + emotive language in Westminster about the “Backstop”+ #BREXIT - this is an insurance mechanism, nothing more, designed by UK+EU together to protect #GFA +hard won peaceful relations on Island of IRE. Listen to majority in NI.

You respect a referendum won by lies, cheating, PROVEN overspending and foreign interference? You are supporting #brexit, a RIGHT WING ideology that will affect the poorest in society most. Shame on @UKLabour, the UK’s  many problems are NOT caused by the EU. #stopbrexit
Excellent turn out of volunteers for our action day for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit. We demand MPs reject Theresa May's dodgy #BrexitDeal!
.@CambuslangSNP held an excellent street stall this morning, the #Brexitometer proved very popular, lots of people happy to make their opinions known, including Scott. Thanks to everyone that engaged. We also handed out lots of @theSNP membership cards #ActiveSNP #Brexit 
Spot on Ms Rowling @jk_rowling! There is no other #Brexit on offer or available other than the one that everyone voted for but nobody wants. Ms Rowling clearly understands politics more than Corbyn @jeremycorbyn understands fantasy.
Our ministers have been answering the nation's questions about what the #Brexit deal means for them. Watch @KwasiKwarteng answer a question from Giovanni.#BackTheBrexitDeal
5) Imagine were we would be now if Labour had simply been saying for 2 years"We respect the referendum but let's be in no doubt, we might do a better job of damage limitation but no #Brexit will ever leave us better off, they are all degrees of making us poorer"
4) this comment from Thornberry captures it well - having spent 2 years saying "#Brexit would be absolutely fine if Labour were in charge" she's now expressing surprise that some parts of the public believed herThere was *no* Leadership voice telling the truth on Brexit 
Dear @Jochurchill4 you wrote to me saying most people in Bury St Edmunds want you to 'get on with #Brexit. Our Brexitometer suggests otherwise #PeoplesVote
3) #Brexit represents the greatest failure of leadership in the @UKLabour movement in living memoryHaving accused the old era of "triangulation" the leadership have fretted over Northern seats & colluded in the Brexit lie rather than serving their voters
This is quite right, and has deprived U.K. audiences of the chance to hear from people who know what they’re talking about instead of pro- #Brexit fantasists. 
We’re all set up by the Odeon Holloway Road right now! Come and vote on our Corbynometer and write a postcard to your MP if you’re #NotBuyingIt and want a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal! 
It's time to start wake up from the deep sleep the #EU have put us all. #Frexit after #Brexit would mean the end of #German leadership over EU's state members. National Sovereignty is the key for a country to flourish. The exact oposite of what #Globalists dream. #GiletsJeunes
Good to meet up with #Brexitometer crew braving the showers and asking the views of the public on #Brexit in #Anglesey and a #PeoplesVote
#Brexit Fact check for those that think the UK was ruled by the EU. There are 28 member states, yet the UK had 17% of the total voting power when it came to agreeing or rejecting changes, rules etc. Inside it was a rule maker. Outside it's a rule taker. #Leavers you cocked up.
If there is a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit I am tempted to start a campaign in the EU to have other Europeans sent handwritten letters to our British friends on why they should stay in! After all, our personal ties may be five times more relevant than all factual debates..

This is the face of somebody who is twisted with hatred of anybody who has a different view on #Brexit to his own. He is the reason any attempt to thwart Brexit will fail. Bigotry in its purest but most unpalatable form 
Yesterday @FrancesOGrady wrote to every MP about Mrs May’s #Brexit deal. This is a bad deal for working people: bad for jobs and bad for rights. Trade unions can’t support it – and MPs shouldn't either. 
Gove is saying May's deal will allow "flexibility across whole swathes of the economy."  But the threat of a race to the bottom on employment rights creates problems with the EU in the negotiations. That's why Labour could get a better deal. Talking #Brexit on #Alloutpolitics
This clip from ITV News shows just what a farce the PR campaign by ministers to sell May’s botched #Brexit deal was. Limited media access and in this case the meeting was kept secret from the local Tory MP who wasn’t even invited. 
"Are some in Parliament misreading mood of the country?"Ans. Yes, actual mood outside Parliament, rest of the population think the #BrexitDeal is  not in the best interest of the country, its #Brexit in name only, hope MPs #VoteDownTheDeal#StandUp4Brexit#DitchTheDeal

"It is an exercise in damage limitation" says @TheTimes in leader backing May's deal. That - from a pro-Remain paper - has always been the mentality to #Brexit of our Remain PM and Treasury. They never believed in long-term opportunities Leaving offered

The #brexit illusions have insulted our collective intelligence for long enough. There needs to be a vote. Then choices. Boot out @theresa_may sure. Then who? And for what?She’s useless, to be sure. But how ironic that the queen of unicorns get shot for not finding any! /3
#Brexit is one big factual error.
The #brexit debate has always been an exercise in denial and wishful thinking. Now cabinet urges May to delay vote to “plead” (FT) with Brussels. Delusion. Do Brexiteers hate this deal? Or actually just hate the choices Brexit presents? In the real world. 1/

Can someone from the #FBPE brigade explain to me how Jeremy Corbyn is enabling #Brexit when he's literally ordered Labour MPs to vote against Theresa May's deal? And could you also explain how Corbyn can prevent #Brexit when the Tories have a working majority in parliament?
There’s probably only one issue more emotive to all of Ireland  than the border and that’s the famine, impressive that Priti Patel managed to shoehorn it in to #Brexit.
.@AmberRuddHR demonstrates everything that’s wrong with the May regime. Brexiteers don’t trust May, so she reappoints the sister of #Losersvote Supremo. Then said sister says let’s join #EUSSR halfway house rather than have a clean #Brexit

I reckon thousands of people will have changed their minds about #Brexit following Alastair Campbell's appearance on tonight's #Newsnight. All of them from Remain to Leave.
That spat on #Newsnight should be repeated over & over. Alastair embodies points by @jennirsl & @GoodwinMJ re utter failure to listen re what drives #Brexit Should also help maj of reasonable Remain voters realise who wins/what's at risk if contempt for democratic vote continues
Theresa May does not give a shit about our borders, our sovereignty, or the safety and security of this land and it's people. She has not just betrayed us once by denying us #Brexit but twice with #UNMigrationPact she is an #EnemyOfThePeople 
For completeness, no mention of Corbyn’s #Brexit speech on ITV. So at crucial time on Brexit, the Leader of the Opposition makes a major speech on it and the peak bulletins on BBC1 (6pm and 10pm) and ITV (6:30pm and 10:30pm) DO NOT MENTION IT.#BrokenMedia

"David Lidington ...   tipped as a stand-in PM if Mrs May resigns next week"Seriously? I mean SERIOUSLY? Have the Tories learnt nothing from the last 2 years? There MUST be a genuine #Brexit Leaver as PM, even as a stand-in. No ifs nor buts. Period.
Leading economist speaks out against Theresa May’s #Brexit deal, warning that it would lead to 'substantial disadvantages' for Northern Ireland - 
What do I mean by the “disappearing of Labour’s #Brexit policy”? This Corbyn makes a major speech on Brexit, only Sky cover it. Not a word on the BBC. And then idiots will say “..but he never talks about Brexit”  
Sickening to see both #Brexit backers and the hard left attacking @EmmanuelMacron today.His petrol price rises were intended to help tackle climate change.But populists care more about attacking liberal ideas than saving the planet.

Jeremy Corbyn has reached out to the DUP and said that Labour is "ready to step in and negotiate seriously" to find an alternative Brexit deal with the EU.The depths Corbyn @jeremycorbyn will sink to get his #Brexit, the DUP! 
Losing Freedom of Movement is a 'win' if you're a racist, a xenophobe or an absolute f***ing idiot. For anyone else, it's jobs and opportunities lost. It makes life more difficult and expensive and does nothing to solve the real problems of the the UK. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
The idea that ramming through #Brexit will appease racists and xenophobes is so totally wrong. It will bolster and embolden them.
Amber Rudd becomes first cabinet minister to break the taboo of discussing a Plan B to May's deal, telling @thetimes that a Norway-style #Brexit, which would keep UK tied to large parts of EU law, "seems plausible"

One positive aspect of #Brexit is that it has allowed everyone to see the inhumanity, xenophobia and immorality hiding behind the civilised facades of many hard Brexiters. Priti Patel is just one (rather pathetic) example.

For the love of...as I said before, for those championing Norway-style option, the lack of control that this brings leaving the UK subject to European rules that it couldn’t influence would be “highly undesirable” & isn’t a ‘remain’ option, it’s bad & they don’t want us #brexit 
In under 100 second you get more solid information than we've got from Theresa May over the last 2 years.#brexit
So my thoughts on reasons for the #BrexitDeal Fail.The Far Right are trying to move from May to No May to a #Brexiter & #BrexitThe Left are trying to move fom May to No May to Corbyn to #Lexit Can we not just join up & go fromMay to No May to No #Brexit?#RevokeA50 anyone?
EU commissioner for agriculture Phil Hogan has criticised a Tory MP’s threat to use possible post-#Brexit food shortages in Ireland as leverage to secure a better deal, saying it would lead to ‘the starvation of the British people’ - @IrishTimes
"I think you would mess it all up for us, the way you have messed it all up for yourselves." I really don’t blame anyone for thinking/saying this - especially after the shameful way certain people have gone about our #Brexit “negotiations”
This is just devastating. We are absolutely shafting our country for no reason. #Brexit is bonkers. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
The Charity Finance Group has concluded that the #Brexit deal will be much worse for charities than staying in the EU, so if MPs truly want the best for charities, they must vote to #ExitFromBrexit. @CFGtweets

Join thousands of volunteers all across the country tomorrow who will be campaigning in their local community for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal.Find your local event below:
This demand will almost certainly fail, in which case Corbyn will be able to say, look, we tried to get a better deal but our hands are tied, so reluctantly we'll have to hand the decision back to the people. That's the only way Labour won't be blamed for scuppering #Brexit. 3/3
If the #FBPE brigade genuinely want a second referendum, and not just an excuse to slag off Corbyn, they need to accept that when May's deal is voted down next week, Corbyn will have to demand a GE based on a mandate of negotiating a better #Brexit deal. 2/3
If @jeremycorbyn bowed to pressure from the gruesome twosome of Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair to call for a so-called #PeoplesVote before even offering to negotiate an alternative to Theresa May's #Brexit deal, it would hand the Tories enough ammunition to win the next GE. 1/3
Regardless of #Brexit I can assure everyone that Kent's roads are routinely buggering gridlocked anyway. So let's at least be gridlocked in a glorious SOVEREIGN nation. #stuckintraffic

It's not Macron's regime that is trying to silence the people of #France, it's the EU and Berlin that have already suppressed protests in Greece, Spain, Portugal and are now defeating #Brexit in Britain. The Lisbon Treaty took away power from national governments and parliaments.
1. Jo Johnson asserts that the UK in the EEA would become a rule taker and have to take up the role of a lobbyist camped outside in Brussels. Like his brother, he has shown an impressive capacity to lie. (#Brexit thread)
89,000 police + armoured cars deployed to the streets of #France this weekend. People of Europe are waking up, they realise their culture, their identity, their towns and cities are deliberately being destroyed by social engineering. It's a fight that will effect us all #Brexit

Something seriously wrong has happened to us ethnic minorities in England, when a British politician of Indian origin threatens to inflict the British imperialist policies that destroyed, decimated & impoverished her country of origin on contemporary Ireland. #Brexit #PritiPatel
When “threatening food supply” to a Country, who’s population (under British rule) was decimated by a famine, becomes a legitimate political strategy you have to wonder about the Tory Party  #PritiPatel #Brexit

The country that steamrolled across the world, taking riches and lives that weren't theirs, now feels... *checks notes* BULLIED by the EU. After the country inflicted this disaster WILLINGLY upon itself.B-U-L-L-I-E-D.The absolute state of this madness. #Brexit #BrexitDebate
I feel that the Irish government and the Irish people have been extraordinarily patient in relation to #Brexit - especially given the continual disregard for history and basic facts. But today, it does feel that a limit has been reached. What a hostile, domineering attitude.
Fucking WHAT???"EXCLUSIVE: Ministers will have the power to overrule doctors’ prescriptions in case medicines run out after #Brexit. Urgent government consultation launched on Tuesday."
Brexiteers have a talent for turning even fairly moderate Irish people with sympathies for Britain into flaming Fenians. This is a hilarious threat that can only backfire #brexit

Government releases 'No Deal' #Brexit contingency plans which say disruption at UK ports could take 6 months to resolve. Sorry but, 'we voted to leave' sounds ever more dumber as the nanoseconds tick off on the atomic clock at  National Physical Laboratory towards 29 Mar 19
It's happened again...@MrJamesOB | #Brexit
Details of Brit Govt briefing on crashout #Brexit are confidential but I can say impacts on jobs, investment, electricity prices & supply, medicine provision, & trade are frightening. DUP must explain why most vulnerable here must suffer to suit their reckless & narrow agenda. 
“No Deal should have been on the table from the outset. It is an outrage that the government has not prepared for it. Instead, it has negotiated a sell-out deal which betrays democracy.”Former Syriza MP @C_Lapavitsas on #Brexit
Some food banks are now requesting food that doesn't need cooking as some people coming in dont have electricity or gas. While I understand the importance of #Brexit , there are people 4 whom i will make little difference unless we get rid of the pernicious #Tory govt .
Her ignorance of both past and present is #Brexit in a nutshell. Weapons grade ignorance. 
Priti Patel is saying in the event of a no deal #Brexit, we must force food shortages on Ireland to make the EU drop the backstop, please someone tell me, have i read this right? This is what we're up against, the extremists will starve people to wreck our economy, #StopBrexit
No-deal #Brexit: Disruption at Dover 'could last six months' 
Every time a small group of hard Brexiteers are confronted with the reality of the #Brexit they advocate their reaction is to vilify Ireland in the minds of the British public. Our sin: standing up for the peace achieved between two great neighboring countries!  
Priti Patel MP...... Threatening to starve Ireland to get #Brexit.....That's where we're at now folks.There is now only 1 serious viable option.Ireland unification and Scottish independence.Leave little England to their precious brexit.
Hmmm looks like someone missed their stop in 1847 and ended up in 2018 #brexit 
I don't think I've seen #Remainers threatening riots if we don't get what we want all the time. Don't think thug tactics is the way forward for this great country. #Brexit
Message to my #F1 followers who tire of my #Brexit-related tweets: see below. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay #StopBrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Tanaiste Simon Coveney's spokesperson has described Conservative MP Priti Patel's claims Ireland should face food shortages unless backstop is removed as "ridiculous", while Sinn Fein Mary Lou McDonald has said she may buy Ms Patel a history book on the famine. #iestaff #brexit
I've got to the stage I couldn't give a nats Shit about #Brexit . I care about the homeless,the hungry and vulnerable that have and are still suffering under this excuse of a government. You can shove Brexit talk where the Sun dont shine#GTTO
Whatever happens to #Brexit in the next weeks the Remainers have lost. The revolutionary forces unleashed by the Brexit Referendum are unstoppable.#BrexitChaos #FridayFeelingDelingpole: No Matter What They Do, the Remainers Will Lose Brexit
Someone on @mrjamesob voted leave because of the closure of public toilets!#Brexit #Brexshit
My view is that the Leave vote will increase because over the past two years people have woken up to the fact that (a) our political class are trying to thwart democracy and (b) the #EU have shown their true colours throughout the negotiations #Brexit

Christian Adams on #Brexit #TheresaMay – political cartoon gallery in London 
The whole #Brexit process has been blurred, botched and bungled from the very start. Never has so much diplomatic and political capital been expended for such little result. I cannot vote for a deal that has only created division,, discord and will make our country poorer. (1/2) 
Don't know why anyone is surprised at Priti Patel wondering aloud about starting a siege on Ireland to force us to acquiesce. The Tories have zero qualms about starving their own people to death whilst claiming massive expenses to make comfortable homes for their ducks. #Brexit
We had a man here once called Charles Trevalyan. He had lots of thoughts about the Irish and food. Perhaps someone should have a word with Priti Patel about how not to insult friends #brexit #conservatives #ireland

Superb presentation on the impact of #brexit on #Glasgow and #Scotland from @Strath_FAI Director Graeme Roy at #SOCE2018 . Notes that there 80k jobs linked to EU direct demand in Sco of which 3k are in fishing. Important counsel: ‘hear through the noise that some interests make’.
Explaining to Sec of State @Jeremy_Hunt that he is wrong. It is not about rerunning referendum from two years ago; it’s about giving the decision back to the people so they can ask themselves, “Is this really what we want, now that the evidence is clear?” #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Ian Blackford - Every form of #brexit is going to make the UK poorer... with the information we now have it would be far better to stay in the #EU... MPs that vote for May's deal know they will be voting to make people redundant.#PeoplesVote #FinalSay #bbcqt #politicslive

Sat in High Court. The grounds of @UKEUchallenge are going to ensure some revealing facts emerge about this #brexit. The notification of withdrawal act 2017 merely gave the PM permission to notify a decision which hasn’t been made according to our constitutional requirements. 
The PC bent of the Mail's new editor is shown not just by its support for May's #Brexit betrayal but also the fact that the moderators are blocking all comments that mention 'immigration' on this report on #Irish homelessness

Local #Stirling businesses, including the Broch Cafe, McQueen Gin and the Golden Lion Hotel have spoken out about their concerns ahead of next week's #Brexit deal vote.Read what they have to say here: 
Our lively #brexit debate on Monday @BBCTwo & @BBCNews had politicians representing four of the main Brexit positions, with an audience of 75 people from across the UK (do watch back on iplayer). Looking forward to @Channel4 ‘s version  
The Government has issued a travel warning for Germany & France, France has seen 3 weeks of rioting, Italian banks are on the brink of collapse, 40% of young people in Spain & Greece are unemployed.Remind me how being in the EU is good for security, the economy & jobs? #Brexit 
Our ministers have been answering the nation's questions about what the #Brexit deal means for them.  Watch Secretary of State @SteveBarclay answer a question from Steve Hyde at @RNIB. #BackTheBrexitDeal
Security co-operation with the EU -- from Europol to the European Arrest Warrant -- helps to put criminals behind bars and keep our communities safe.#Brexit would throw all that away.#ExitFromBrexit
Quite apart from the ignorance of shameful history and the economic illiteracy, the moral bankruptcy & sheer nastiness displayed here just takes my breath away Threatening Ireland’s food supplies - a new low point in this whole sorry #Brexit bùrach 
On #customs formalities and documentation under various #Brexit scenarios. Procedures and documentation required for customs clearance can be confusing. Particularly, the difference between a single market and a customs union seems to be unclear. /1
I understand why some support a Norway #Brexit. They are sincere in wanting the best for Britain & a way through. But Norway is not a meaningful reply to the two drivers of the Brexit vote: reform of free movement; & restoration of sovereignty. It is a seed for further division

THE UK SHOULD NEVER REJOIN THE EURemainers don't understand that the EU has changed since we voted to leave. Its economy is crumbling, it's building an army, upping taxes on the UK, seizing power from its members and aiming for rapid unification to save itself.#Brexit10 of

#Brexit will make our trading relationship with our closest neighbours on a par with the trading relationship between Bangladesh and Canada... #EconomicSuicide
Let's be clear on #Brexit - Norway+ will not work - as per the #PeoplesVote report with @jonlis1  - it has exceptional flaws and turns the UK into a rule taker. The only real alternative is a #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk
So some in the UK want to threaten to starve Ireland (again).  Can you imagine German MPs threatening Jews with gas chambers unless they get what they want? That's how morally bankrupt #Brexit has become. Sickening.
Think Brexit supporters didn’t know what they were voting for? How dare you, says Nick Ferrari @NickFerrariLBC | #Brexit 
“Everybody on this panel except for me comes from a remain point of view in the referendum… and therefore they don’t understand why people care about this and they don’t see what the real issue at stake is.”  #Croydon #Brexit #BrexitBetrayal #BBCBias

Ireland already produces more food than we need. Still this remark is just more evidentlce of the toxicity of #Brexit.
The same “disappearing” of Labour’s #Brexit policy continues on #R4Today.  NHS minister Matt Hancock on to defend May’s position. Who do they have on for Labour? Kinnock junior to explain the Kinnock position. No discussion of Corbyn’s latest article.
You know that bloke who been appointed regional sales manager..and really shouldn’t have...?Yes, we are really ruled by such idiots.#brexit Britain is like an awkwardly unfunny sitcom in an implausible 4th season.

Couldn't agree more with this observation on #Brexit & NI/North. Partly due to failure of Westminster media. In a bubble. Big disappointment. Echoes its coverage of Scottish Indy Ref. 
Leavers shouted "Believe in Britain!", but when it comes to a #PeoplesVote they are terrified of what Britain will do. They don't believe in Britain at all. It was all hot air and empty bluster. They don't believe in Britain and they don't believe in democracy!#Brexit

Amidst of all the #Brexit nonsense we overlook the possibility of a Spain++ deal. Stay in customs union, full freedom of movement, no border between Northern Ireland and GB. Nobody needs to get repatriated and 142 international companies won't leave UK. Also known as Remain.
Neither Dover or the Channel Tunnel have started to build any additional customs or immigration facilities, let alone recruit and train new customs and immigration officers. Port of Dover Police also need more officers.#brexit #PeoplesVote #VoteDownTheDeal
Stopping #Brexit is possible. It is legally and practically possible, and recent events render it slightly more likely, writes academic.

UK is facing a political meltdown & an unprecedented constitutional crisis over #Brexit incompetence & self-serving, arrogant actions. Gov is at odds with parliament, MPs & EU at odds with the voters & everyone is disgusted at Theresa May's #brexitbetrayl deal  #WTOBrexit Now!
It's not about leave or remain - it's about fighting for a bright future for Lincoln and the UK outside of the EU. Instead of squabbling with her own party & the DUP, the Prime Minister should step aside & let Labour negotiate a #Brexit which protects jobs, the economy & rights

D'you know what? By asking at #PMQs about poverty as highlighted by the #UNVisit2018 & @Alston_UNSR's report, when everyone was expecting more #Brexit Qs, Jeremy Corbyn has drawn much needed attention to this crucial issue. All publicity is good publicity!
Timely reminder that the likes of Mogg, Johnson & Redwood really don't give a shit about the hopes & aspirations of the 17.4M 'people', only how they can keep you onside until they get their #Brexit windfall. Then they will drop you with the contempt with which they hold you. 
Many in Parliament are trampling over us. The #Brexit #WithdrawalAgreement is a sham. People chose to take back control from the EU and entrust it, in full, to Parliament thereafter. Parliament, sadly, seeks to seize any remaining control from us and hand it all over to the EU.
Absolutely extraordinary that @theresa_may is probably a week away from losing her job over #Brexit and @campbellclaret is more concerned about attacking @jeremycorbyn for daring speak up for the poor and disabled at #PMQs.
#Brexit fears put UK service sector at risk 
#Brexit deal under fire: legal advice stiffens opposition 
Reports are that the EU will allow the U.K. to extend the deadline of Article 50.Of course they will,they want more money of us.Don’t believe this nonsense that we have to accept this Withdrawal Agreement as they wont change it.They are not in that stronge a position.#brexit

The lack of women, especially grassroots women and women of colour, in debates and public discourse on #Brexit has been appalling. Apart from Gina Miller which other woken of colour have been regularly featured on broadcasters or given op eds in press?
** Fact Check **There's nothing 'meaningful' in deliberately and deceitfully overturning #Brexit
Arron Banks firm, not registered in the UK,  has 'no address' - Another proof that these Tories and  far-right multimillionaires, calling themselves working class heroes during #Brexit are above the law.  #PeoplesVote #boycottgoskippy #payyourtax #goskippy
Fact: Leave's anti-EU lies were massiveFact: stolen private data was used to find & profile votersFact: high-tech microtargeting was used to deliver liesFact: lies were spread shamelessly and left unchallenged on the BBCFact: any #Brexit now will be undemocratic#StopBrexit
More trouble for Theresa May as the possibility of the #Brexit result being declared void and illegal by the High Court before Christmas looks increasingly likely. 
A thought to sleep on. To obtain a majority in our Parliament requires 326 votes. Put another way it would take 0.0005% of our population to overturn #Brexit which was voted for by more than 17.4million
I'm not hearing anyone in the #Newsnight studio expressing concern for people and their fate in this #Brexit chaos.What about peace in Ireland (N & S)?The backstop is there to preserve that peace.The ERG & DUP are thoroughly selfish & very unpleasant.
Yes. It's 'interesting' how "the will of the people" matters when we talk about #Brexit but doesn't matter at all when the government force schools away from their local communities and into the hands of Academy chains.
With @BethRigby shaking off any #Brexit blues at the first party of the season.We’ll see you from NOON  tomorrow @SkyNews
Quite extraordinary to learn tonight that Number Ten has called in Privy Counsellors for an emergency briefing on #Brexit but only Tory ones. Sums up this Government’s arrogant failure to reach across Parliament on this crisis & suspect Her Maj will not be best pleased.
Of course Arron Banks’ firm has 'no address'. Who expected otherwise?Source of finance of #leave campaign as transparent as May’s #Brexit deal is in interests of UK.Case for #PeoplesVote #FinalSay an #ExitFromBrexit & #Remain is becoming unchallengeable.
David Cameron promised to give the public a vote on our membership of the EU and delivered it. No other leading  politician had the courage to do that for decades. So, other than doing exactly what he promised us, what exactly has he to feel guilty about @SkyNewsPolitics? #Brexit

'If and when #Brexit does happen, just one of the four “equal partners” of the United Kingdom will be solely responsible, with the other three strongly opposed but being dragged along anyway by the only one whose opinion actually matters.'
So Corbyn, despite being leader of the opposition, didn’t even mention the most pressing topic of the day? Less than 24 hours after the PM lost 3 crucial votes on it? No wonder we’re in this #Brexit mess  
Dear @Jacob_Rees_Mogg On Channel 4 news, you just stated that @theresa_may made a grave mistake in not telling people from the EU straight after the vote that they were both entitled and welcome to stay after #Brexit. A little at odds with this headline.

Very dangerous strategy by May. If she succeeds in selling the #Brexit withdrawal agreement on the basis of essentially misleading UK MPs rather than explain the trade-offs, this will poison UK-EU relations and decrease trust in the UK even further.

The UK Govt’s legal advice make it explicitly clear; NI will have full access to Single Market & Customs Union indefinitely under international law which will put Scotland at a competitive disadvantage as it’s dragged out of the EU against its will #BrexitLegalAdvice #brexit # 
It is clear the EU won't propose or accept any agreement which doesn't include an Irish backstop. It is clear that there can never be a majority in Parliament for this deal. And it is a fantasy to pretend some other #Brexit which doesn’t include the backstop could be negotiated.
The last #PMQs before the most critical set of Brexit votes ever and the publication of legal advice which confirms NI could be split from the UK and not a word from @jeremycorbyn about #Brexit Talk about missing an open goal.
A reminder for folks asking why didn't Corbyn go on #Brexit at #PMQs: The Commons debated Brexit all yesterday, Corbyn spoke on it for 40 minutes straight and the Commons will debate it until Tuesday. In the meantime the country continues to burn, he's right to point that out.
Ian Blackford (SNP) has just directly, unequivocally & correctly accused the PM of deliberately lying over her Hotel California non-exit #Brexit.He was ordered to amend his phrasing by the Speaker, but EVERYONE got the message.#PMQsUK #Slavery#BrexitChaos
Once again, it is left to the @theSNP to ask questions about #Brexit at #PMQs after Corbyn ignores it entirely.  On today of all days. The UK deserves and needs better than this.
Whilst the issues raised by Jeremy Corbyn today are very important I can’t believe he has missed the gaping open goal of the triple whammy of Tory Govt defeats yesterday #PMQs #Brexit
UK Tory Govt on the ropes after three historic Commons defeats. #JeremyCorbyn chooses to lead on austerity in #PMQs which unites Labour. But to have not ONE QUESTION on #Brexit is a dereliction of political duty. Yet again #Corbyn has shown himself #TheresaMay's Brexit helper.

Theresa May hasn’t engaged Parliament in the #Brexit process – and as the saying goes – you reap what you sow. Parliament doesn’t trust what the Government says anymore because promises have been broken time and time again. #Beyond100days @BBCNews
Remainers falsely claim that #Brexit supposedly puts jobs and workers' rights in danger. Britain's membership in the EU wiped out millions of jobs, as it has a huge negative trade balance with it, and weakened workers' rights through free movement of labour and mass migration.
Some might argue that #FBPE is too toxic & turns people off. My response is bollocks, it is a # that has brought so many people together. Get some perspective, if you want toxic then look no further than #Brexit which has lead to a government being held in contempt of parliament.

Today's @YouGov poll suggests 11% of Leave voters now think that #Brexit is wrong, and only 3% of Remain voters that it is right  - a much bigger gap than previously. But what is still equally important is that 48% of 2016 non-voters say it is wrong and only 18%, right.
#TreasonMay & her agreement betrays #Brexit & Britain. It's a national humiliation. It gives the EU everything & the UK nothing. We don't take back control of our laws. We don't take back control of our money. We don't take back control of our borders. This is deliberate sabotage 
Don't miss the LIVE debate with @MichelBarnier on #Brexit and the impact on regions and cities in the EU at the #CoRplenary.Watch: 
Quick thought about yesterday...@OwenJones84 #brexit 
So @LiamFox just said that there is a “danger MPs will steal Brexit from the British people”. This rhetoric really has to stop. It’s factually incorrect as the majority of British people don’t support #Brexit. So this only serves to divide more and is profoundly irresponsible.
Shorter version: Hedge Fund Billionaire Mercer bankrolled both Cambridge Analytica and the Young Britons Foundation. Out of the latter came key figures in BOTH Leave campaigns - Matt Richardson and Matthew Elliott - who deployed Cambridge Analytica to win the #Brexit referendum 
At the end of clip:Longworth: “We never won any vote in Brussels in 40 years”Femi: “We won 97% of the time” (supported by UK independent fact checking charity)Longworth: “Not the ones we didn’t want”Eh!? “Britain. We lose every time, 3% of the time.”#Brexit #Anchorman
So, as chaos continues to rage in Westminster, the lies of 2016 are daily laid bare, and the fantasies come crashing down to earth - the public grows increasingly disillusioned with #Brexit as a whole.In a democracy, that means we get to change course.
We’ve seen it this evening, the political establishment hates #Brexit, the media establishment hates Brexit.. #NorthernIreland will be under a different regime, that’s a breach of the #ActofUnion1801, it is extraordinary that this has been allowed through

Sky News’ #Brexit item started at 10am, by 10:13am, the only non Sky voices we’ve heard are Gove, Mourdant, Green, Letwin and Harper. All Tory MPs.Looks like it’s not just the BBC who think we live in a one party state. 
8) EU leaders point to the (aspirational)political declaration on post Brexit EU-U.K. relations that’s on table now and say: these are just benchmarks. All possibilities from a Canada style deal (w implications for NIreland) to a Norway+ relationship are achievable after #Brexit
Britain was wrong to vote Leave - 49% (38% right to Leave) Support for Theresa May’s Brexit deal - 23% (46% opposed)#Brexit top issue facing the country - 66% (2nd: Health 32%)If May can't get her deal through Parliament, we need a #PeoplesVote.
"There's no way we can allow #Brexit to continue" says former international trade negotiator @JasonJHunter after @theresa_may's government is found in contempt of Parliament by not releasing the full legal advice on #Brexit. 
#Brexit supporters, you had everything on your side. You had the vote, born again Brexit MPs, the papers & the BBC. You should have crushed RemainBut you couldn't agree on what you actually wanted & bickered amongst yourselvesRemain is 1 voice, Leave is just a shouting match 
7) Many MPs are talking about the deal Theresa May negotiated with the EU as if that is it- a final trade deal and they don’t like it but the final trade deal (and future EU-U.K. security relations etc) will only BEGIN to be discussed after #Brexit

If you want the U.K. to #Remain in the EU & you’re inclined to vote Labour, read & weep.Out of touch with their members and voters, Corbyn & his cabal seem determined to be on the wrong side of history over #Brexit as dogma continues to triumph over rational actions. 
I think we can safely say there’s a clear trend on this graph!The number of people saying we were were wrong to decide to #Brexit now has a clear lead over those who still believe it was right.It’s time for a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay so we can #ExitFromBrexit and #Remain

The Quitters had their chance. They had government ministers, they had momentum, they had the power of the press firmly behind them - yet in 2 years they failed fundamentally to produce a coherent, practical #Brexit strategy. Now having blown it they blame "the establishment"
Epic address by the great man. Let's be clear #Brexit is part of a doctrine that cares nothing for the planet and want no impediments to maximizing profit, such as rules and regs that control emissions. They are merchants of instinction. They want want, ergo we must stop it.#FBPE

Hi Chloe, without splitting hairs the public has had 3 votes already on EU membership. 1975 after being misled, denied on Maastricht and Lisbon treaties, and later 2016 & 2017. Many forget 1975! I do admire your passion & fearless attitude defending #Brexit @LowTaxChloe

#R4Today This is going to get SO dirty if/when May’s deal fails. I’d rather have another election than a second referendum. The whole lot at Westminster need cleaning out. #Brexit won’t be happening with this lot. They’d only have Norway+ (in Customs Union with FoM = REMAIN)
For those championing a Norway-style arrangement, the lack of control that this brings leaving the ‘UK subject to European rules it could not influence would be “highly undesirable” for financial stability’ #brexit

There is a way out of this mess for Theresa May.If she were to call a #PeoplesVote she would either avoid having to deliver an impossible #Brexit or deliver a Brexit which would be the true will of the people.May would save her skin & possibly the country.#newsnight #r4Today

Bit by bit, trick by trick, lie by lie, smear by smear the #Brexit voter’s certain strong desire for a Britain independent of the EU is being stolen. Where is the leadership of this movement? Where is the call to arms for a fightback? Where is the march on Parliament?

(1/2) Which #Brexit deal did you vote for Julia? The answer is NONE as no concrete plan was even published nevermind put to any vote. This greatly helped to achieve the narrow #Leave win as lack of specifics meant Brexit could be sold as all things to all people. #Brexitshambles
What is going on with @BBCNewsnight? The biggest UK political crisis in years & a seismic constitutional crisis & they have started to play with stickies. Sign of a programme which has sadly lost its way. #newsnight #Brexit 
Just for a change from #Brexit and #ContemptOfParliament Here's a rather interesting graph about Tory Austerity.
.@mariacaulfield: "Not sure there is even democracy in this country anymore. The powerful elite seem to know best and openly mock the rest of us." A truly damning indictment, but nothing compared to what millions of people will say (and do) if Parliament doesn't deliver #Brexit.
No, Corbyn's a democrat, you numpty. It's easy for the SNP to oppose #Brexit given Scotland voted Remain. The UK as a whole voted Leave. Just as I wouldn't expect Nicola Sturgeon to ignore what Scotland voted for, you shouldn't expect Corbyn to ignore what the UK voted for. 
The tories are falling apart #ContemptofParliament UKIP is falling apart, #Brexit itself is falling apart, May and her party deserve all they get, for 8 years they've divided our country with dog whistling xenophobia/hatred, their end is nigh #PeoplesVote #Newsnight

Why is today important? Because #Brexit could only survive as long as people believed it was inevitableWe now know it isn't - and every MP knows that we know it, so if Brexit happens & fails what will they say when even ex Leavers demand "why the hell didn't you stop it?"

This vote took #Brexit from the people and handed it to a #Remain Parliament.

Borderers who voted for John Lamont - you got an MP who can’t even be bothered to attend this critical #Brexit debate, let alone speak up for our Remain voting constituency. There is no doubt @CalumRKerr would have not only been there, but would be fighting our corner! #John2Lose
I’m waiting to speak in the Brexit debate - could be any time up to 12.40am tomorrow before I get in. Fingers crossed it’s not that late. Some excellent speeches so far. Very few in support of the PM’s Deal #Brexit #PeoplesVote
.@ScotTories Please can you tell me where all your MP's are just now. Are they in the HofC getting involved? Are they speaking up in support of their constituents to stay in #EU - Does @Kirstene4Angus still have difficulty in understanding #Brexit or have they all gone fishing?
Vince Cable rises to his feet to tell any empty Commons why there should be a 2nd #Brexit referendum (because people have the right to change their mind). But why he’s resisting an #indyref2 (because people don’t have the right to change their mind.) Go figure. #BrexitDebate

Sorry, Julia, but #Brexiteers like yourself have absolutely no idea how to do #Brexit. You had 40 years to put a plan together, but it’s been an abject failure. There is no plan and there never was one. The people are now changing their minds & deserve a #PeoplesVote.#democracy

Dame Margaret Beckett.  Take a bow.  THIS is what we expect from those who represent us.     #brexit #peoplesvote
Staying in the EU is clearly preferable to exiting on basis Government’s #Brexit proposal. Labour should champion the right for the public to revoke the Article 50 notice & have the final say. That’s why I took this case to European Court alongside @joannaccherry @thomasbrake

Our @UKParliament is now empowered. We can amend the Government’s proposed course of action if Parliament rejects the #Brexit deal. We could stop a ‘No Deal’ #Brexit. This is why I resigned in June last year. Better late than never! 
What a day for #Brexit! All in all, we’re in a more powerful place now to do what’s right for the country.
I believe that secretly May wanted a #NoDealBrexit, she's now in #ContemptofParliament the Grieve motion has passed, Parliament is in control of #Brexit as it should be, #PeoplesVote is out of her hands, we can revolt Article 50, if she had any decency she'd resign tonight #GTTO
Cathy Newman C4 “you’re still happy you voted to Leave?”@mollygiles2015 “Absolutely because I see the decision about #Brexit is not just about what happens in the short term in the next 6mths or next year. This is about putting ourselves on a footing for the next 10-15-20yrs”

Everything that Tim Martin is saying is about a time before we haven't left the EU.#Brexit has not yet happened, Mr Martin!And the only reason we did not suffer disaster after the 2016 referendum was because the Bank of England took emergency action to prevent it.#C4News
While Corbyn tears May’s blindfold #Brexit deal apart, the reactions on the Tory front bench: May in denial does her usual laughing haddock impression. The ashen, defeated faces of the her ministers tell the real story. They know it’s a bad deal and Corbyn’s busted how bad it is. 
#Brexit is a mess made by politicians, not voters. Politicians need to clean up their mess and PRONTO.
Tory rebel Dominic Grieve tells Sky News 'parliament will get an opportunity to debate amendable motions' and that the vote "doesn't mean that No Deal is off the table... but a device that I believe was being used to manoeuvre us to No Deal has been stopped' #brexit
Oddly the #Brexit debacle may end up providing reassurance that our unwritten constitutional arrangements can, at times of crisis, provide the necessary check on Executive power.It may have also weakened party allegiances. This needs to happen before any significant realignment. 
Watching this commons debate and conscious that ‘respect’ is a very different word to ‘uphold’ when it comes to the #Brexit vote. We don’t want you to just respect the vote, we want you to enact it.
In historic first, UK government found in #ContemptOfParliament  #Brexit 
Just imagining what our country would look like now if we’d had a real opposition leader for the past two years. Thank you to all grassroots people who have kept #remain on the table in spite of two main parties supporting #Brexit. And no opposition party. Keep fighting x
There's just no way the Prime Minister can get her dangerous #Brexit deal through Parliament, no matter how many votes she holds.The only way forward now is a #PeoplesVote.
Oh...Jeremy you were on the verge of doing quite well against the Govt & then Chris @ChrisLeslieMP asked you to confirm if you felt that to #Remain in the EU was better than the PM's #Brexit deal...then you blew it again.WE NO LONGER HAVE TO RESPECT THE FLAWED REF based on lies

Hang on.. hang on.. under @Nigel_Farage, @UKIP *won* the 2015 Euro elections with 24 MEPs elected (for the first time ever beating both Labour and Conservatives [who came third]). This, arguably, brought us to the EU Referendum of 2016, and so to #Brexit. #Farage actually won.
PM...You've not negotiated a COMPROMISE...you've negotiated a bad version of a Blind #Brexit in which we'll have No Control & No Leverage.You were right..Brexit does mean Brexit...There never was a compromise..it has always been a #BrexitShambles OR #Remain. The Maj want Remain

"For the next stage of negotiations we will ensure a greater and more formal role for Parliament" - PM debates #Brexit withdrawal in CommonsLatest: 
These British women leaders, Margaret Thatcher, now Theresa May, are really fierce you must agree - like or dislike them. They don’t hide or run—they show up and fight the fight #Brexit

#Brexit vote: Can the government avoid defeat in the Commons? 
Three Commons defeats in a day leave a visibly rattled May floundering in the debate on her #Brexit deal. The shambolic chaos that she unleashed is devouring her. She's now a leader in name only. Her time is up.Hopefully, this is the beginning of the end for her Government too.
It's going to be a busy few weeks here at @UKParliament as MPs and Lords debate the #Brexit deal.Not sure who to follow or what to watch for the latest updates about the EU Withdrawal Agreement? Let us help with this thread  
"We need to deliver a #Brexit that respects the decision of the British people" - PM opens withdrawal debate in CommonsFollow latest developments: 
Agreed. If the Tories don’t deliver #Brexit there’s a huge opportunity for a new party. Huge. 
Join campaigners across the country at our National Action Day this Saturday in demanding a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Find your local event here: 
And so it starts - the slow drip-drip-drip of the media 'suggesting' we could withdraw #Article50 Began on @BBCNews at & now continues.. Is this a conspiracy to start to truly undermine #Brexit ? To brainwash us?We need to stand firm - we voted to #Leave and #LeaveMeansLeave
Grieve amendment passed 321-299. #Government no longer in control of #BrexitParliament now back in control. This gives hope to all who want to avoid #Brexitshambles
The PM just misled House - and claimed I have not read the political declaration on #Brexit - I have. It makes NO mention of the crucial SISII database that keeps us safe. The Home Secretary + her Chief of Staff have admitted that it does NOT GUARANTEE us access. #BrexitDebate
Norway #Brexit Model:free of ECJ but answer to Efta court with unaccountable foreign judges;Single Market access but not part of EU decision-making;Large annual payments to EU;Must accept EU 4 freedoms, including free of movement.No-Way to Norway #ManagedNoDeal 
Let’s suppose you were a Remainer who was entrusted with delivering #Brexit, but who really wanted to muck it up. You really couldn’t have done a better job than Theresa May, could you?
MPs approve amendment which aims to give Commons greater say should #Brexit deal be defeated in vote on 11 DecemberFollow latest developments: 
BREAKING: The UK Government! PM Theresa May loses three votes in a row as MPs decide her government is in contempt of parliament. Meanwhile, Scottish parliamentarians secure opinion from European Court of Justice that UK can ditch Brexit. #Brexit
And yet you are determined to ensure Parliamentary sovereignty is surrendered to unelected EU Commissioners in Brussels. #Brexit #ContemptOfParliament
Time for the Tories to sling their hook, the first time in British history a government has been held in contempt of Parliament and therefore democracy....EVER.#ContemptOfParliament #GTTO #Brexit
Theresa May suffers historic defeat.MPs voted by 311 to 293 to find UK gov in #ContemptOfParliament over its failure to release full legal advice on her Hotel California non-#Brexit BetrayalShe needs to RESIGNSkip to the 5 minute mark on video clip
I hope all the Tory MPs realise that the Membership is infuriated with a burning white phosphorus rage. Theresa May has tried to hide her lies and now has brought the House of Commons to the point that her government is declared in contempt. She's trying to stop #Brexit 
The chaos that is #brexit is what you get when at least 50% are being forced to do something against their will.The idiots that designed the ref should've understood the need for a super majority.  They didn't and here we are.What a total debacle. #FBPE #peoplesvote
The Tories are now in contempt of: Parliament The United Nations Human Rights The Environment What a shambles of a government...#ContemptOfParliament #Brexit #brexitlegaladvice
Government is paying the price for treating Parliament with contempt throughout the #brexit process....

"This House has now spoken and it's of huge constitutional & political significance" - Sir Keir Starmer responds after government found in contempt of Parliament #Brexit latest: 
The UK Government has just been voted in #ContemptOfParliament. Do you think the prime minister should resign her post, paving the way for leadership challenge or general election? #Brexit #BBCParliament @Channel4News
All of this will make a very, very  funny film one day. And a musical. #BREXIT
This is beyond a shambles.  A historical first and a shameful day for our government.  However you feel about #Brexit parliament should be sovereign.It is about time @AlokSharma_RDG put country before party and stood up for residents in #rdguk West
Whew! What a sixty minutes we’ve just had:- Government defeated TWICE and found in contempt of Parliament - BBC’s attempt to rig the #Brexit debate in favour of May failed and confirmed they’re busted.And the main Brexit debate hasn’t even started! Roll on next Tuesday.
The May administration has been found to be in #contemptofparliament, this is unprecedented, the May govt has tried and failed to hide the #Brexit legal advice, this govt of liars/cheats/spivs and snakeoil salesmen have been found out, their downfall is surely upon us #GTTO
The moment MPs vote to hold Theresa May's government in contempt of Parliament by 311 votes to 293#Brexit latest: 
BREAKING! Government found in contempt of parliament over #Brexit legal advice. 
Major Govt Defeat 311 vs 293...found in Contempt.Govt forced now to publish the full legal advice on the #Brexit WA.....Things are getting serious for the Govt...if they now try to duck the vote on the WA they will prove what cowards they are..#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
The government have never wanted transparency in the #Brexit process. I'm glad they have been forced in to it with this unprecedented vote. The wheels are coming off Brexit, and the is government is falling apart. I look forward to reading the legal advice.
BREAKING: UK Parliament votes that government is in contempt over #Brexit legal advice, orders it to publish advice immediately 
At the #ICT2018 conference with Prof. @johndav talking about #Brexit #Tech #Universities and why we need a #FinalSay  #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #StopBrexit
House of Commons votes 311 to 293 to approve the privilege motion, finding Ministers in contempt and ordering the immediate publication of the full legal advice on the #Brexit deal. 
Breaking: The government *have* been found in #ContemptOfParliament. Ayes 311 Noes 293. The Attorney General and ministers must now release the full #Brexit legal advice. Extent of disciplinary procedures against the AG not known yet. Potentially huge moment
I don't know whether May's government is in #ContemptOfParliament but parliament is sure in contempt of the nation when it comes to #Brexit  Such blatant and obvious resistance to accept the vote of the EU Referendum goes even further than contempt and smacks of treason .
Now can we have this on ITV? I suspect the real reason is that the ⁦@BBC⁩ couldn’t find enough actors to represent the public at the sorts of fees they pay on ⁦@BBCNewsnight⁩ #Brexit 
BBC news is saying that it has pulled out of any #Brexit debate between @theresa_may & @jeremycorbyn.This is incorrect.The BBC had talks with May for weeks and then asked Corbyn.He said no, as their process wasn't fair.
Brexit TV debate cancelled as the @Conservatives and @UKLabour cannot work out how to make it work!That is so #Brexit! 
The BBC has pulled out of holding a #Brexit debate between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn 
Britain can unilaterally cancel #Article50 and end the #Brexit divorce process, according to the legal advisor of the European Court of Justice
BBC confirm that their rigged debate on #Brexit will not go ahead as they “could not reach agreement on our proposal.” BBC News now busy spinning it. This is what happens when the BBC pick a side and try to rig a debate to suit that side.#BBCBias
When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of December 4, 2018 at 04:50PM, £1 buys 1.1198€. This means that food & medicine imports to the UK are more expensive. It doesn't have to be like this. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
#ContemptofParliament I keep hearing Tory MPs one after one  say we cannot release the legal advice, but don't worry there's nothing we are holding back. Then just release it. No problem.#Brexit
This is potentially massive. The line used by naysayers with regard the idea of a GE is that the "DUP would never allow a Corbyn govt" - well, here's the DUP seemingly showing that isn't impossible by any means. Bit by bit, it's getting closer. #Brexit #ContemptOfParliament
Parliament is finally taking back control from this chaotic government. The Attorney General put on a good show, but the House did not want TV drama. MPs expect the publication of the full legal #Brexit advice before the debates on the withdrawal deal begin.

#brexit is the obvious example of a fucktangular omnishambles
Farage raging once again against the rule of law and the democratic right of the British people to decide on their future.Farage is an enemy of democracy and a traitor, more loyal to Trump, Mercer and Putin than to the British people.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
The Remainer Establishment were never going to accept the #PeoplesVote to #LeaveMeansLeave. Brexit is being betrayed & the Establishment’s treason must be punished. The people must mobilise to demand & defend #Brexit. 
.@eastantrimmp Sammy Wilson says the government's decision to withhold its #Brexit legal advice "confirms in people's minds it has something to hide". 
.@JustineGreening and Ken Clarke are wrong. It is NOT “both front benches who have let the House down”. It is the nasty, lying, cheating, consciously corrupt @CONservatives who have. If it wasn’t for the Tories we wouldn’t be in this mess. #Brexit #ContemptOfParliament
In the coming days parliament will be asked to consider the Conservative Party's #Brexit deal. Unite is calling on your support to make sure MPs vote it down. Visit  and email your MP and tell them to #VoteItDown.
Jacob Rees Mogg warns the govt not to ignore 'humble addresses' (the device used to demand the legal advice) then annouces he will vote with the govt anyway. Funniest moment is when he said it isnt pantomime season and MPs chimed 'Oh Yes It Is' ...its a side splitter, #brexit...
Second referendum on Brexit would be dangerous, says Archbishop of York @JohnSentamu #Brexit 
Theresa May Caught In Massive Lie; Her #BREXIT Plan Leaves EU in Control. She Has No Guts To Really Leave EU. She Is Selling British Citizens Short #PatriotsAwakened
There’s a fundamental point here that many @CONservatives are missing: we wouldn’t be in this mess with @Keir_Starmer in charge. Bring on a @UKLabour Government! #Brexit #ContemptOfParliament
“UK nationals covered by the Withdrawal Agreement will continue to have broadly the same access to healthcare and pensions as they currently do.” In this open letter, British ambassador to Spain @SimonManleyFCO provides a #Brexit update for @BritsliveSpain
I recommend @BBCParliament channel over the rolling-news services. They are running the #Contempt debate, live, unmediated & uninterrupted. It is a remarkable education in law, parliamentary privilege, history, politics and not a little #Brexit. You can never learn too much.
Labour will need the DUP's support to bring down May's botched #Brexit deal. The media always trot out the line to DUP MPs "..but how can you work with Jeremy Corbyn?"Here DUP Deputy Leader Nigel Dodds puts that to bed.The end of May is on the cards. 
To be honest. Who needs words when you have the expression of the Attorney General himself to tell us how this is going for the government... #Brexit #TuesdayThoughts
Bill Cash/Christopher Chope/John Redwood/Nadine Dorries/Jacob Rees-Mogg/Liam Fox/Priti Patel/Michael Gove/Dominic Raab/Andrea Jenkyns/Owen Paterson/Theresa Villiers/Peter Bone/etc etc, if anybody really believes the above have the interest of the 99%at heart i pity you #Brexit
A referendum is when the nation replaces #parliament to vote directly on the issue that is of great importance. That vote is superior to parliament and if the latter tries to derail it like the British parliament is doing with #Brexit it should be disbanded and MPs prosecuted.
This is not democratic government. It is preparation for a criminal assault on the welfare of the British people by a ruthless gang seeking to slash the taxes, regulations and workers rights that eat into their profits. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
No wonder Andrea Leadsom looks stressed. The last time there was a motion of contempt in Parliament was in the 1880s, when they threw expelled/suspended MPs in Big Ben's clock tower. That could liven it all up a bit  #Brexit
 The Prime Minister is presenting a false choice of a disastrous deal or ‘no deal’ #Brexit chaos. There is another way. 
The Tories somehow want us to beleive that wanting to see these documents is both a "childish parlour game" *and* a "deeply important issue of national security," at the same time. I've heard better arguments on Jeremy Kyle. What on earth are they hiding. #Brexit
This is the perfect example of how the Tories manipulate fear to get their way. Every single line is designed to suggest the world will fall in if we are exposed to this document.Leadsom has invoked images of troop survival, peril & national security. It's ridiculous. #Brexit
RT OMG Look Who’s Talking about FAIRNESS & The Public Interest Re #AttorneyGeneral reasons for NOT Disclosing Legal Documents Re #Brexit@SkyNews @BBCNews @LBC @BBCr4today @bbc5live #Skypapers #Bbcpapers #Newsnight @itvnews #C4News
Argument from Leader of the House that a #ContemptOfParliament hasn’t been used since the 19th century is frankly nonsense. Procedures of the House are there to make Parliament sovereign. It’s what the #Brexit campaign wanted after all. Parliament is taking back control.
"Bringing the motion is not something I have done lightly" - @Keir_Starmer on contempt motion over government's #Brexit legal adviceLatest developments:

Listening to the motion about the Government being in contempt over not disclosing their #Brexit legal advice.1. This is all of the PM’s own doing by flip flopping & changing her mind all the time.2. What is there to hide?3. Confidence is shot#DitchTheDeal #StandUp4Brexit
Even the resolutely pro-#Brexit Transport Secretary now talking about a cut in Dover-Calais trade of 87%. The impact of this on jobs and our quality of life would be historically bad for this country - and we are teetering on a precipice we don't need to.

LIVE: MPs debate whether the government is in contempt of Parliament by not publishing full #Brexit legal advice. 
Angela Eagle, shut your face. #Brexit was won because people had 40+ years experience of EU to base their opinion, not swung by some stupid slogan on a bus as you claim. Crawl back into your hole Angela. #PoliticsLive
Alastair Campbell - There is a sense the country is changing its mind about #Brexit... only a few months ago people said a #PeoplesVote would be utterly impossible, I now think it's becoming probable.#FinalSay @campbellclaret
Don't be fooled by the farce played out in #parliament over #Brexit They are all in collusion with each other and want Britain to remain in the EU. That contempt of parliament vote and the useless debates are distractions. Since the Lisbon Treaty parliament has no sovereignty.
Exquisite end to William Hague column in @Telegraph today, after enumerating the reasons why #Brexiteers won't get the clean-break #Brexit some seek. (And why the Dec 11 vote, I think, will be closer than is thought. This penny surely has to drop). 
Public opinion in Wales has changed substantially. There is no mention at all of Wales in the #WithdrawalAgreement. People want to see more power locally but see power being drawn back to Westminster. @Plaid_Cymru will vote against this deal. #Brexit #alloutpolitics
If UK somehow stays in EU (or even if it doesn’t?) maybe the BBC could make sure its journalists don’t make basic factual errors when reporting it? #brexit 
2016: The world will be at our feet. Prices will come down because we will be able to make better deals.2018: If we're lucky, food prices will only be 6% higher. #Brexit
Even an "orderly" #Brexit will cause food prices to jump 6% says Bank of England Governor Mark Carney.This will hit the poorest hardest, because they spend the biggest part of their income on food. That includes *many* people in #Cornwall.#PeoplesVote

There's an opinion that if #Brexit is stopped, other members of the EU will use #Article50 as leverage. I'm not so sure that Article 50 will stay for long. #EU will find a way to terminate it, locking everyone up in the bloc.We should leave while we can.#BrexitChaos
Developments here in the #UK are critical and they affect all #EU countries.I had the chance to be briefed from the Minister of State at the Department for Exiting the #EU, @LordCallanan for the critical vote in parliament and we had a meaningful exchange of views for #Brexit. 
Politicians keep telling us the British people got it wrong, now they know better and have changed their minds.  Where do you currently stand on #Brexit ?

Back to revoking Article 50 basically delaying #indyref2 until later than 2021; how would I feel about that?If it means avoiding #Brexit and all of the horrors therein, I'd be content to wait before putting a renewed case for indy before Scottish voter - many would disagree tho

Big decision by the EU Court this morning on the balance of power between a member country (here Ireland deciding on admission criteria for Gardaí) and the EU.  Likely to be missed today in the #Brexit furore but very significant. #EU #CJEU #ECJ #Supremacy
When all the #Brexit chat is about parliamentary shenanigans it’s easy to forget that these decisions will have real-world impacts, including a potential #nodeal… here’s a quick look at where #nodeal planning currently stands:
EU court advisor says Britain can end #Brexit unilaterally 
UK can stop #Brexit unilaterally - #EU legal adviser's bombshell gives hope to Remainers 
Despite their rhetoric, ask yourself why the #EU and #ECJ are so willing to bend their own rules and protocols, to open up the A.50 process to abuse, all to keep the UK in its orbit.It's because they are terrified of what we might achieve outside 'the project'. #Brexit 
The Scottish dimension to #Brexit has always been fundamental. Having a Westminster MP involved in the Court of Session case will have been essential to its prospects of success on its journey to ECJ. Well done @joannaccherry! Looking forward to reading the final decision

In a statement that is very damaging to Theresa May, the European Court of Justice's advocate has confirmed legal opinion that the UKGov can immediately stop Brexit simply by revoking Article 50. #Brexit

A #Corbyn government would spark an exodus of talent & money from #UK more devastating for the country than #Brexit, says former UK trade minister in Gordon Brown's government Lord Digby Jones also he would leave if Corbyn took power  @anandMenon1
Latest news is that ECJ Advocate General says UK can revoke Article 50. Does that potentially mean a second referendum and the PM gone?#brexit #PeoplesVote
The latest on the ‘opinion’ of the European Court of Justice’s Advocate-General - a significant moment in the #Brexit debate as MPs weigh up their options. @SkyNews
This second series of #Brexit is really spoiling us, I must say. Thrills and spills all over the place. Can't wait for the season finale.
If #Brexit doesn't go ahead, what an absolute extortionate waste of parliamentary and public time and money. If #Brexit does go ahead, what an absolute extortionate waste of parliamentary and public time and money. #shitshow #Brexshit

#Brexit - Case C-621/18 Wightman - AG Campos Sánchez-Bordona: Article 50 TFEU notification of the intention to withdraw from the EU can be revoked unilaterally under certain conditions 
EU Advocate General says UK can revoke #Article50. HUGE step forward in #Brexit legal case brought by @andywightman@joannaccherry @C_Stihler_MEP @AlynSmith @davidmartinmep @JolyonMaugham & myself.  Final ECJ ruling likely later this month
Given a choice, what would you vote for right now? #brexit
This is so fundamental  #Article50  is ours (our elected representatives) to revoke & we can choose to remain. We are sure that MPs will be carefully thinking about interests of our country & we will hold them to account. With our huge thanks to @JolyonMaugham & team #Brexit 
The idea that Britain could not revoke #Article50 unilaterally was always from the same school of #Brexit fiction which said we could have 'a cake and eat it' deal. As reality bites, it's clearly not too late to change our minds! 
Brilliant work by @JolyonMaugham & the team. I suspect when dust settles on #Brexit the nation will realise debt of gratitude owed to them.Worth remembering May’s Govt has shamefully fought this case all the way, trying the deny that UK had power the revoke A50 & #Remain
Mervyn King says May's #Brexit plan is a betrayal 
Wow!!! ECJ Advocate General Opinion that the UK can UNILATERALLY #RevokeA50. Final Ruling awaitedUK Govt sought to thwart this.We can Stop #Brexit B4 29/03/19 & keep our current Best Poss Deal.Resp MPs must #StopBrexit!#Remain in Control in the EU 
So when will the BBC stop reporting #Brexit as inevitable, a done deal, as it constantly does?
Note this is not a judgment. But significant nevertheless! #Brexit #Article50
#Brexit causing exodus of EU doctors from UK. This wasn't the #Brexit that was promised. #PeoplesVote:
Our right to revoke #Brexit is worth fighting for - it’s Britain’s decision and a #PeoplesVote gives public chance to reverse the course we’re on. That’s why we took this case to the European Court. Today’s Advocate General view is important signal ahead of imminent Court ruling.
Whatever it is that #TheresaMay don’t want us to know in the #Brexit advice must be really bad, if senior #Tories are prepared to risk #ContemptOfParliament All Mps need to know exactly what it is they will be voting for on behalf of 65m people, not just 17m

Dear Mrs May @theresa_may. #Brexit means:Cheating & breaking the law.Obfuscation.Incompetence.Witholding vital information from parliament.Insulting the electorate.More obfuscation.More incompetence.More insults.I'm finding 'it' impossible to support. #SackTheBrexitDeal
#Brexit has given racists and xenophobes a legitimacy they would never have had. It has permitted hate filled bile to permeate as thought it was a acceptable. It has allowed politicians to lie with impunity. It is breaking the very fabric of UK society. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
No deal #Brexit means years and years of negotiating trade deals and literally hundreds of agreements  Mays brexit ties us into a customs union and leaves lots of areas undecided. Both mean years of nasty arguments & strife #PeoplesVote & remain we can all get on with our lives

What a blessing it was, our EU passport, free movement to live, work and settle anywhere in 28 member states. We Scots voted to keep the EU passport but the English will take it away from us. While the rest of the world moves forwards, the UK drags us backwards. #Brexit

Theresa May appears to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. This is a visual representation of conversations happening on Twitter. On the bottom of this graph are remainers, and on the top, leavers. #brexit 
To think that #Brexit was supposed to be about restoring the sovereignty of Parliament! Fact is it was never really sovereign. Not due to the EU but to the ease with which government can walk all over it.
The Speaker of the Commons is right to uphold the rights of Parliament. The government should publish its full legal advice.At every stage, #Brexit has been advanced by chicanery & lies, and this is proving the case with Theresa May's miserable version of it.#PeoplesVote

(1/2) Mr Speaker has informed the House of Commons that he believes there is an "arguable case" that a contempt of Parliament has been committed in relation to a failure to comply with a resolution of the House on the publication of #Brexit legal advice.

I am a co-signatory of this letter as @Plaid_Cymru #Brexit Spokesperson asking the Speaker of the Commons to launch proceedings of contempt against Govt. Govt has failed to publish the Attorney General's full and final legal advice on Brexit deal as was instructed by Parliament 
Extraordinary scenes in the house as the Attorney General claims he's simply "protecting the country" by not publishing the full #Brexit legal advice. He tells MPs to "grow up." Astonishing. I'd expect this country's top lawmaker to come up with a better cover story than that

The Attorney General is making a statement on the legal advice ref #Brexit, he's dodging every question on why they won't publish the advice in full, it's now obvious the May govt is one of liars/cheats/spivs and charlatans who are leading us to ruin, they have to go and go now.

Responding to NHS trusts warning about food shortages in a ‘no deal’ #Brexit“The idea that hospitals could be in a situation in which they can no longer guarantee food to vulnerable & ill people is diabolical & brought on only by the carelessness of Tories” says @thomasbrake
If, and it is a big IF, #Brexit was the will of the people, why are #Leavers running scared of a #PeoplesVote?Simple. They're scared their rabid xenophobia has been revealed, that the referendum was illegally procured and that the people won't be fooled again.
So Michael Gove is saying Parliament must force this Agreement on the country because the People dont want #Brexit any more! So he believes the country doesn't want to leave the EU now but Parliament shouldnt even check because he won't like their view

Michael Gove is on record stating he now backs Mays deal because while it is not 100% what he wanted he acknowledges #Brexit did not win 100% of the vote So in future Elections whatever party wins must share govt with the opposition as they also did not win 100% of the vote 
Sir Bernard Jenkin says why he thinks the government should publish the legal advice on #Brexit. And why there is likely to be an Iraq style inquiry into how the government has conducted these negotiations.

I think half the problem with #Brexit has been our national inexperience with backfiring referendums. We didn't know what to do, so we stuck we what thought we knew: respecting democracy. But failing to challenge an illegal funded campaign of lies is in fact doing the opposite.
#Brexit Two political parties so consumed with their own dogma that they are prepared to sacrifice the United Kingdom.Disgraceful dereliction of duty to the country.Most MP's are unfit to carry this office.#Brexit #peoplesvote #FBPE
It is reckless and wrong to foist this #Brexit deal on people. The price the country must pay is too high. If @theresa_may wants to proceed, she should get people’s #InformedConsent in a new vote. Voters will rightly not forgive our Party if she presses on without it #FinalSay
This is a seriously important book that sets out how we can radically improve the lives of people & communities shut out from prosperity - and the reality is that all this would be harder if #Brexit happens 
The problem we're having with this Mrs #May is that your deal ISN'T #Brexit on any shape or form.
I'd rather leave on WTO rules than your deal which will leave us tied to the EU. You should resign. I am horrified by what you have done. #Brexit

We all need to see the #Brexit legal advice.  All parties must press for contempt of Parliament proceedings if MPs are not shown the advice.Contemptible May is in contempt.
QUESTION: If we & some other #Brexit groups produced a 1-page flyer explaining May's disastrous deal simply, would you print it and put it in letterboxes in your area? That's what many readers are asking us for. (Pls RT this.)Brexit Facts4EU : 
So, the attorney-general's legal advice is leaked to Sunday Times, it says we'd be trapped indefinitely in customs union, May loses meaningful vote, #Brexit ref2 the result. @eucopresident doubtless busy rewriting questions already...
Britain would be trapped “indefinitely” in a customs union with Brussels if MPs back Theresa May’s #Brexit deal, according to leaked details of the attorney-general’s legal advice 
When the DUP met Geoffrey Cox he indicated he was “on their side” regarding the backstop & indicated it was constitutionally untenable & made clear his advice would reflect that. This meeting took place before May announced her deal. #Brexit
This article is not just the best thing I’ve read on #brexit - its quite simply the best article I’ve ever read on modern England.Staggeringly good from @fotoole here.One has the impression Fintan O’Toole knows the English better than themselves.
More very encouraging news.But we shouldn't just be preparing for a #PeoplesVote, our party should be actively campaigning for one.The sooner @UKLabour is campaigning for #Remain, the better our chances of staying in the EU.#Brexit is not inevitable.
Today on the @MarrShow I will be asking Mr Gove what makes him so wonderful and why #Brexit will be fabulous 
"The backstop would be indefinite if no other deal is reached AND that deal would have to be agreed by EU as well as UK". In the latest #Brexit twist, this appears to come as shocking news to large numbers of MPs. What on earth do they think backstops and deals actually are?
Is EU reconsidering its no-renegotiation stance now its hearing the defeat of Theresa May’s #Brexit withdrawal deal is « inevitable » in Parliament? My thoughts:  
When MPs worry that a #PeoplesVote would bring riotous hordes onto the streets, this was the turnout for Hatie Kopkins pro #Brexit march. I think a couple of playground assistants would be able to manage the fallout from cancelling #Brexit. 
Support for a @peoplesvote_uk is growing. Whatever the #Brexit terms people have a right to a #FinalSay & MPs who agree must make the case at every opportunity. Letters: 17 MPs call for a second Brexit referendum

You're very generous. Gove is not just wrong, he's lying, shamelessly trying to deceive the British people and joining the other #Brexit liars in undermining our democracy.We can have democracy or the liars. We cannot have both. Lock them up!#Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

In simple terms, #Brexit is about sacrificing NEEDS for WANTS - an act of colossal and unashamed SELFISHNESS which will see huge amounts of people needlessly suffer. It will never be forgiven, nor should it be. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #OptionToRemain
Is the new EU army part of the clever "Remain and Reform" plan? Anyone? Anyone at all? #brexit

Today I used technology (apps) to order and pay for a taxi, buy a paperless train ticket, check into a flight with a paperless boarding pass and order drinks to my table at a pub. Don't tell me we need a "hard border" in N Ireland. Let technology solve it #Brexit @Wetherspoon__UK
It is essential that the Government fully prepares now for a managed, No Deal, #Brexit trading under WTO rules to avoid a "disorderly" Brexit. If they don't & we have a "disorderly" exit, we will know who is responsible. 
Those irresponsible people calling for another referendum either have no idea what divisive damage it would do to our society or are in fact prepared to destroy our social cohesion in their attempts to overturn the previous result. #Brexit
That's the human cost of #Brexit: "I can't stop sobbing. My husband is terminally ill, and I've just found out I need to apply for my British citizenship when he's alive. They won't consider me married to a British husband if I become a widow. I'm so heartbroken." @InLimboBrexit
Just sat here tonight. Tired. Trying to stop #Brexit. Thinking what an utter toss pot David Cameron was. And what an utter toss pot Jeremy Corbyn is. I bet they send each other  cards.

Andrew, why the ant-Russian bigotry? This type of casual racism by you Brits is why you idiots voted to euthanize yourself with #Brexit.   
Your bigotry and xenophobic slurring of Russians is exactly the type of racist garbage that seduced  to vote for economic #Brexit suicide. Take responsibility for your actions, punk. 
Why are we still doing Brexit? It's like when you've decided to have drinks at your mates before going out but then realised the club's gunna be packed, someone will spill a drink on you & you'll wait 5 hours to get a taxi home. In the cold. So you stay in #Brexit #peoplesvote
“The government’s ‘#SettledStatus’ trial for #EUcitizens living in the UK is not going very well as it is going through some pretty basic problems.” @cliodiaspora explains in @PMPmagToday. #Brexit @the3million

I hope this makes the world understand about #Brexit a little more about one of the aspects that has made #UK leave...they’ve said so many times things that weren’t right and still what did these people do? covered their ears and kept on remaining the same. a wasted lesson
Ske News is reporting that one third of Theresa May's personally appointed trade envoys will not back her #Brexit deal because it represents "the worst of all possible worlds", saying her position as Prime Minister is now untenable.

 All I want for Xmas is MPs to ditch this rubbish deal  Great to see so many people turn up in #Birmingham calling for MPs to ditch the #Brexit deal @hopenothate @BestForBritain @Avaaz 
Thank you for all the support for Brexit today in Exeter. Brilliant to see so many of our lads and thank them for their service. #Brexit 
Unfortunately it is riddled with inaccuracies & tired nonsenses. Very disappointed to see the PM’s Chief of Staff recommending it especially as he argued with authority & respect against the #Leave #Brexit campaign @michaelgove led.
So thrilled to be out supporting the 1.7 million Great Brits from the South West who voted LEAVE. Dig deep for Brexit. Hold the line. Do not give up #Brexit 
So where are we going to go after #Brexit - #Asia? #BrexitBritainA masterpiece by @FoilArmsAndHog...

From this I believe that to Brexiters The EU isnt judged by what it does and doesn't do or  what is powers are or how it makes its decisions. It is called many things often contradictory but the common thread is the  EU is  whatever  they happen to hate & fear #Brexit
I've seen brexiters express alleged sympathy for Greece  not only ignoring the fact the Greeks want to stay in the EU but get furious at the idea we might financially help them #Brexit
I've seen brexiters who  whine their heads off about EU interference in nation States domestic affairs and complain just as loudly when it the EU didn't interfere in Catalonia #Brexit
If we can just tear our eyes off #Brexit & @realDonaldTrump for a moment, there is a new world being shaped out there
Yet another nail in the coffin for May’s botched #Brexit deal. The signs (her “campaign” around the country, wanting a debate) are that she will most likely call a snap general election after her plan get defeated. Not a cert, but more evidence for than against at the moment 
The UK has never had such a traitorous backstabbing 2 faced lying PM. May will go down in history as the PM who betrayed her own people & country. May colluded with the EU against UK democracy to overthrow the #Brexit vote. Parliament must vote down #Maysdeal & save UK democracy!
Broadcasters must use any TV debate to present the full, complex reality of #Brexit - & that means including a #PeoplesVote. Sign & share 
.@jeremycorbyn the vast majority of your constituents here in Archway #IslingtonNorth oppose #Brexit and the Govt’s bad #Brexit deal. Represent them - support a #FinalSay #PeoplesVote now! @hopenothate @BestForBritain @Avaaz @peoplesvote_uk
If the Tories are so confident, why don't they call an election now? It's because they know we will win and stop their disastrous Brexit. Then we can negotiate a jobs first Brexit. #GTTO #Brexit 
It's #Saturday! It's #FBPEParty Day! Every day, #Brexit fades a little more. Every day, we get another step closer to the #PeoplesVote.If you believe we are better off in the #EU, add #FBPE and join the ever-growing community fighting to #StopBrexitSaveBritain!

@SteveBarclay I would argue that the broadest and most ambitious Free Trade Agreement the world has seen *is* the EU Single Market. Discourse on #Brexit from individuals such as yourself now appears to be an incredibly pretentious attempt to pretend the UK can reinvent the wheel.

. @stephenfry what JRM advocated was a referendum to ask the people if they wanted to renegotiate our EU membership, then, if passed, putting a renegotiated deal to an in/out referendum. He did NOT advocate a 2nd in/out referendum. That is a fact and I think you know it#Brexit 
.@SamGyimah resigns over this #Brexit deal: "We will have give up our voice, our veto and also our vote." #PeoplesVote
And you all wonder why the #5million and mixed EU families are suspicious of the government and #brexit when it comes to protecting them.  Seriously get over this obsession with immigration.  It’s not the source of your unhappiness.
Is it just me ?Profoundly irritated at the barely suppressed excitement in the voices of some Journos as they put their own *spin* on the fog of speculation & gossip enveloping #BrexitAided & abetted by supernumerary Tory politicos - who hang around the HOC Central Lobby  !
Hey @UKLabour, if Stephen Fry, who is not a politician, can carry out this devastating analysis of #Brexit so engagingly, why can't you? Stop pandering to prejudice to get votes and remember where your mainstream support is. @jeremycorbyn @HackneyAbbott @johnmcdonnellMP #FBPE
Another #EU country starting to turn towards a "populist" "far right" party which campaigns against immigration & Islam. It's the inevitable result of 20 years of relentless liberalism which has ideologically embraced migration & Islam whilst ignoring ordinary citizens. #Brexit 
I was a Tory member & voted for #Brexit. I unquestioningly defended austerity policies as being necessary ("living within our means") & used the EU as a scapegoat too often to mention, both of which I now regret. People can change their views. I now support a #PeoplesVote.
PM at G20 “issued call to employers to invest in training home-grownworkers to fill  gaps left …as a result of the endof free movement “ & showed no knowledge of the Scottish economy at all. For the key sectors there just aren’t any replacement “home grown” workers #Brexit
All across the country today activists will be campaigning for a #PeoplesVote because they believe our country deserves better than this botched #Brexit deal.Find an event near you and get involved or just pop along to find out more.

I think more Scots were moving towards independence anyway because of broken promises and lies at #indyref and the democratic deficit. Now, as #Brexit disaster unfolds, even more are gonna vote Yes at #indyref2. Thanks to CNN for their fair coverage.
For those who ask Sinn Féin to abandon 100 years of abstentionism while celebrating #Votail100, to swear an oath to a queen, and betray the voters who turned their back to Westminster because it will stop #brexit, this . 
Sam Gyimah on May's #Brexit deal:"Britain will end up worse off, transformed from rule makers into rule takers. It is a democratic deficit and a loss of sovereignty the public will rightly never accept."
The behind-the-scenes high stakes battle over what they want you to read and know (and not know) about #brexit#manipulation #FakeNews
As the Tories are moving towards a plan B #NorwayPlus, a pointless-in-name-only #Brexit, our party must seize the moment by giving the British public the chance to be able to grasp the best deal on offer – and that will always be no Brexit at all! 
Just a quick reminder for @theresa_may. You called the 2017 General Election to get a bigger mandate for a Tory #Brexit. You got 42% of the vote. 58% voted against you. You don't have a mandate, it was not the will of the people for you to continue. #PeoplesVoteNow.
"Brexit was supposed to increase our strength and influence, yet here we are pulling out of a key project of great importance to our national security. To compound this disaster, we will have to pay out billions to replace the project."#Brexit
Proving that the old adage ‘if he’d brains he’d be dangerous’ doesn’t always hold #Brexit 
Any #Brexit TV debate without @CarolineLucas, @NicolaSturgeon and genuine Remainers like @Andrew_Adonis and @JoJohnsonUK would be a total sham and waste of time and I for one won’t be watching it.  We don’t need more media propaganda on why leaving EU is a good idea.
Amongst all the noise of the post referendum debate, May and the civil service have been quietly signing away control of our military to Brussels.Please ensure your MPs know about this. A county that can not defend itself ceases to be a sovereign nation.#brexit 
Just reading the words "settled status" makes me feel this country is going to fucking hell.  We must stop #brexit, get rid of this gov and get back on track, fast.  The country is Remain. #peoplesvote #StopBrexit Put down the #brexitcoup #Smashfacism #RebuildBritain
So this morning I woke up to this. Born and bred in London and being told to 'go back to the Republic' because he could tell from my name I'm Irish.  This is what countless EU citizens face daily.No I won't ' go back', I'm staying, we're not leaving.PS please report #Brexit 
The consequences of the rise of #populism are becoming plain to see. From #Thailand to #Brexit, from #Italy to the #USA, the divide between 'places that matter' and '#placesthatdontmatter' augurs further economic decline and social conflict. Vienna, 5/12.
Wait, what? Surely the first thing they teach new initiates at #Brexit Secretary classes, is that the broadest, most ambitious free trade agreement with the EU ever seen by the world is the one you clowns seem intent on leaving. #PeoplesVote

As the #MeaningfulVote approaches it is appropriate to recall that the father of economics Adam Smith, was born in these islands. U.K. has given the world so much, but our PM has contrived to diminish the nation on the world stage, but more critically to deliver a mock #Brexit

Big pat on the back for my local MP and his principled stand on this issue. All decision making models include a ‘review’ item. The public should be offered the opportunity to review the 2016 #brexit decision based on all the new evidence available. To not do so is irresponsible.
Astounding when you think JC is up against the worst Govt in years, pursuing a #Brexit that Removes Rights without Consent & will leave us Poorer.He's miscalculated badly in backing any form of this #BrexitShambles, ignoring EURef Illegalities & denying an option to #StopBrexit.
Brexit: countdown to disorder - could we have a "perfect storm" where a "no deal" scenario, triggering civil unrest, panics HMG into seeking EU re-entry? Isolated food riots rip into something far bigger and potentially far more disruptive...  #Brexit . 
Exclusion from Galileo follows as the result of the mindless #Brexit rupture in science, technology, university links. We won't get the #spectrum needed for our own as it's all taken by US, EU, China, Russia, India, Japan. None of them will release or negotiate spectrum with us.
God forbid! 41% of voters in this poll believe No Deal #Brexit means staying as we are.This level of ignorance is terrifying.This needs your urgent attention #r4today #Newsnight #bbcnewsten @BBCnews #c4news
This is true. Large numbers of banks are moving trading teams and others out to Paris or Frankfurt. No official announcements just a quiet drain on the City. This was never supposed to happen. Why are we self harming in such an obvious way? #Brexit

.@theresa_may We have been campaigning for 2 years to #FreeNazanin and unfortunately it seems @GOVUK is only interested in #Brexit. When will this government really communicate with #Iran to bring our girls home?
Europe is at a crossroad. They will either remain a semi-representative democracy or an authoritative dictatorship without freedom of speech nor freedom of the press.Question is, will the Brits allow themselves to continue down this path, or demand the #Brexit they voted for? 
If England was a person, it would be sectioned & heavily sedated.Clear signs of multiple personality disorder & paranoid delusions, complicated by a superiority complex & xenophobia with violent tendencies. A clear danger to both itself & others. Self harm is likely.#Brexit
@JoJohnsonUK and now @SamGyimah, two thoughtful, patriotic Ministers resigning from the wretched May Government over the insanity that is #Brexit. When will @BimAfolami wake up and put his country and his constituents first and support #Remain and the #PeoplesVote ?#Harpenden
Regardless of whether you are pro / anti #brexit this sort of decision is bizarre and dangerous to national security - clear evidence of hubris and not understanding implications. Time to #ExitFromBrexit
#Merkel saysOpen borders are good.Mass migration is good.All future Europeans must have a migration background (vision 2050).And if you want Tuscany, Kent, Provence, Limburg, Bavaria, Paris to cherish its roots... well, you are a nazi and you will be silenced.#EU#Brexit 
So much for taking back control of our money. #Brexit means we can no longer take part in EU Galileo GPS system, so we’ve got to build our own at a cost of £3 billion. Time to stop #Brexit now.
Theresa May on her own will destroy the UK, she is a foul liar who has perverted her office as the leader of the UK. Tories that back her are beyond contempt. Her deal is an outrage, if she is not removed from power we will never recover from this. #MayMustGo #Democracy #brexit

She is a stubborn technocrat...whereas Corbyn is a stubborn ideologue...the worst combination for our country facing #Brexit....
Just because are politicians are so inept and couldn't organize a piss up in a brewery doesn't mean we should give up on #Brexit We must see the truth. Our useless politicians have deliberately made a mess of it to try to make us give in and give up on #Britain - we won't!
Actually I'd love to see the PM debate @GerardBattenMEP on #Brexit & perhaps @COLRICHARDKEMP on why she has signed our Armed forces over to the EU armed forces, you know those that don't exist, that were not planned. It might be nice to see her explain that to the Queen

To visualize expanded post-#Brexit commerce and collaboration between the UK and the US, @ENCLAVEORD re-branded the 12 states of the #USMidwest — MidEnglandUSA™. It's difficult to imagine anything the #EU could sell the UK that would not be readily available in MidEnglandUSA™.
Yes, a crisp canter through the Manipulation & I like your reminder of who held the reins in VoteLeave, but need to add that defeating #Brexit, especially No Deal, is to prevent measurable catastrophe & deaths, not to banish unicorns & that convicted EU Ref crooks work in No. 10.

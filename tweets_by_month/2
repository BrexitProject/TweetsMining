BREAKING: Cameron predicts what Britain will look like if we vote for #Brexit. #ProjectFear #HowWillWeCope
(3/3)The failed EU immigration policy created the ‘Jungle’ camp at Calais. The idea that #Brexit would reduce border control is preposterous
French to release giant spiny lobsters to invade & occupy South-East Coast ports if we vote #Brexit, says Cameron 
PM should not make irresponsible argument about 'Jungle' in Calais moving to UK if #Brexit -not only fear mongering but stigmatises refugees
There's clearly only 1 way to settle the Tory row about Lady Thatcher's view on #Brexit, & that's to summon her ghost by means of necromancy

It is simply not credible to claim that EU cooperation on security issues would end in the event of #Brexit
Nobody knows what will happen post-#Brexit, they say. But here's a clue what's going to happen if we stay! 
There are millions of good, kind, decent people who support #Brexit. The more they're patronised by politicians, the more they feel affirmed
Let's just call the PM what he is. A liar. #Brexit #LeaveEU
To honour Cameron's migrant camp scaremongering, I propose we start referring to the Jungle in Calais as Camp David.#Brexit
Arrogant PM takes us for fools: the immigration crisis is caused by the EU. After #Brexit, & as an island nation, we'll control our borders.
Dave:"If we #brexit Migrant camp will move from Calais to Dover". How? hot air balloons? That was an old fear.#ukip
Cameron says #Brexit could lead to migrant camps in the South East. But the real risk is staying in the EU. A million in Germany; 75m Turks.

Will @BarackObama open up the US border to Mexico and South America? No? Thought not. I'm voting #Brexit 
#bbcnews Obama was replying to #brexit campaign's repeated claims that we could #LeaveEU and get a good deal with USA. He's right to do so.
After listening to Obama's arrogant threats - I have never been more certain that the UK should leave the EU #Brexit

Obama: #Brexit would leave UK 'back of trade queue'. But US's i/l trade admin says only 2: TTIP & TPP (now signed). 
Obama is in the #UK today lecturing the Brits. Simply said, it’s wrong for a #POTUS to inject himself into a debate like #Brexit.
If any Brits would like to celebrate with us when this limp-wrist leaves office, you're more than welcome!! #Brexit

#Obama is no friend to Britain.  He's not even a friend to America.  #Brexit
I bet all those Mexicans are really looking forward to that political union and open borders with the US that Obama clearly endorses #Brexit
US soldiers died for freedom in Europe. But @potus now betrays them siding with the antidemocratic imperialist EU. Shame on the USA #Brexit

Obama wants the UK to stay in Europe because he likes European weakness. Come on, Brits, stand up and be counted. #Brexit
Don't threaten the UK with being at the  #backofthequeue regarding US trade over #Brexit The British invented queuing we're used to it
Obama isn't worried about what happens to the UK if we leave the EU. We'll be just fine. He's worried about what happens to the EU. #Brexit
Pres Obama is entitled to give his opinion on #Brexit but he speaks for US interests not Britain's. That threat was the BIG giveaway.

US is terrified that an EU after #Brexit might be less a vassal state & lapdog than before, hence Obama's tour to instruct Brits how to vote
#PresidentObama kicks #Brexit even deeper to the kerb:"Crowded in Oval Office. Thought I should put #MLK in there#Churchill- on 2nd floor"

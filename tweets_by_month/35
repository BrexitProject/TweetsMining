#bbcqtSo, if the only argument still standing to justify #Brexit is that it is the will of the people, then shouldn’t we check that it still is the will of the people, now that all the Leave promises have been discredited?
How can Labour and the Tories work together on a #Brexit deal when the Tories want the opposite of what Labour want? We get this stupid comment every week, it always gets applause, and it's always utter twaddle. #bbcqt
"So the question is, why are we doing this"? .. Loud cheers as Layla Moran asks the question that most of Britain is asking. #bbcqt #Brexit 
#bbcqt So asking the people, instead of the politicians, to have the final say on the #Brexit deal, would apparently be undemocratic? How can the people betray the will of the people?
Our city and country now face a bad #Brexit deal or no deal - both would cause huge damage to London & the UK.People from every corner of our country are calling for the British people get the final say - with the option to stay in the EU.#BBCQT #PeoplesVote 
Why does watching #bbcqt get more painful every week? The #Brexit debate gets more and more fanciful. Scotland we are an educated and liberal country why are we continuing to hitch our star to a sinking ship? #indyref2
Is it too much to hope that #Newsnight will have #DickEmery on tonight to preach the Gospel of #Brexit? #VicarGate
A no-deal #Brexit deal would destroy the livelihoods of many fishermen in #Cornwall, because it would be a huge hit to their exports to the EU - their main export market.They were cynically played by Farage, who hardly ever bothered to the EU fisheries committee.#bbcqt
Oh I think @theresa_may realises.  She just doesn't care. The only thing she cares about is being able to continue as PM. Why else do you think she is so avidly selling her shoddy, damaging #Brexit deal? If it falls so (dragged out the door of No. 10 kicking & screaming) does she
I’m starting to think we need a no deal #brexit so that the cancer of English exceptionalism gets to run face first into the 21st C. with nowhere to hide and no one to blame for what follows. It’s a price we might have to pay so that future generations can be rid of it. #bbcqt
Amazing performance by @LaylaMoran on #bbcqt tonight. Such fire and passion - here is her very eloquently making the case against the #BrexitDeal and for giving the people the #FinalSay on #Brexit. Only an #ExitFromBrexit protects jobs and our economy!

1. Scots voted to remain in the wider democracy of UK. THEN, 2. the UK as a whole voted to LEAVE the EU. What don't you understand about how democracy works?Maybe the street next door voted remain, does that mean they remain and my street leaves? #Brexit NOW #WTO #GetOverIt
If, after listening to #Tory Nadim Zahawi and #Labour Rebecca Long-Bailey bickering, you are still willing to vote for either of these lost, empty parties, you're part of the problem destroying the UK. #Brexit #bbcqt
If this is the government’s ten second ‘elevator pitch’ for the #Brexit deal - could I respectfully suggest that  plain English might work better. What does that even mean? 
There is no bloody point having a public #Brexit debate unless we get a say in which approach to take.
#questiontime just proving no one has a clue about #Brexit. Labour give no alternatives unfortunately they are just playing politics with this rather than participating in finding a solution. Here here 
Brexit is only still a thing because so many of us are shit at maths. And history. And fucking thinking. #Brexit #questiontime

While the Prime Minister @theresa_may claims her vision of #Brexit is to protect the sacred union, it becomes ever more likely that it will bring about an independent and sovereign Scotland. I would be sorry to see that happen, but being half Scot, I completely understand why. 
After two years of unrelenting clownery in the White House and Westminster, it is fair to say that there is no place for nationalism in the 21th century. It is a fundamentally flawed and hopelessly outdated ideology. #brexit #Trump

Jacob Rees-Mogg - "Isn’t there a major flaw in the document we have before us, in that global trends have not been modelled, yet it’s thought 90% of future global economic growth will come from outside the EU?"And without thinking about that this #Brexit forecast is worthless." 
Personally, I'm looking forward to the #BrexitDebate. Not because I think it will make a blind bit of difference to the outcome of #Brexit, but because I want to see what would have happened if Theresa May hadn't bottled out of a debate with Jeremy Corbyn during the GE campaign.
The BBC is corrupt to it's very core.  And they wonder why we don't trust them with the #Brexit debate.

Anyone else finding it hypocritical for @duponline to accuse the Tory Govt of having "something to hide" by not publishing its legal advice on the #Brexit deal when it colluded with the same govt so it could hide publication of its analysis of the impact of #UniversalCredit

Two facts were confirmed this week. 1 No deal is not better than a bad deal. 2 All #Brexit deals will be bad. Despite very real problems, common sense now points to consulting the people again on Brexit before making an irrevocable choice between bad and worse options.

Fish, fish, bloody fish. I'm sick of hearing about fish. What about health workers, teachers, construction workers, lorry drivers and everyone else who will be negatively affected by this Tory #Brexit shambles - essentially all of us. Yet all we hear  is fish, fish, bloody fish.
*Breaking*: The BBC have announced that Theresa May has won the #Brexit debate against Jeremy Corbyn, due to take place at some point in the future. Laura Kuenssberg describes May's performance as "enigmatic & full of honour," adding, "didn't she do well?"

Deliberate misdirection from #Labour. #Brexit has nothing to do with any deal. A second referendum would mean the first one was meaningless, which means the second would be meaningless too (fair’s fair), and the third, fourth and fifth. Happy voting.
No deal will wreck the country. But when you look at our political class and the structural societal and economic problems they are evading by shoring up the status quo, one can only conclude that a wrecking action is overdue and very necessary. #Brexit

Trading under WTO rules is not a matter of ‘falling off a cliff’ into the abyss. It is, for much international trade, quite normal. The UK already conducts more than 55% of its export trade with non-EU members, primarily under WTO rules:  #Brexit

No deal definitely will be a disaster but I don't really give a toss. This system props up the perks and privelages of a ruling class which conspires against us - and democracy. Let them lose everything. #Brexit
"Nobody seems to have a clue what they're doing" says @theSNP's @glasgowcathcart who believes the possibility of a second vote on #Brexit seems more likely now than ever. 
Do you think the First Minister of Scotland, @NicolaSturgeon should participate on equal terms with @TheresaMay and @jeremycorbyn in TV debates about #Brexit? Please vote and RT. Thank you@BBC @STVNews @Channel4News @broadcastscot @SkyNews

Brexit: The Divorce #Brexit 
You can't be in Efta and the EU customs union. The EU will insist on the Common Commercial Policy as it has in the backstop - leaving us tied, unable to participate in Efta and with no veto when the EU signs away our trade defences. This isn't #Brexit. 
Nick Timothy says Leavers are leaderless and running out of time. Of course they are. #Brexit was always promoted by a squabbling rabble of political charlatans, spivs and liars hell-bent on blaming anyone and anything else for their failures.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
In an argument over the navy pre-WWI Churchill remembered “The Admiralty had demanded six ships; the economists offered four; and we finally compromised on eight".Rigid insistence upon 1 outcome can result in the opposite outcome - #Brexit 
So Kinnock is now ruling out full Efta participation and instead shackling us to the customs union - which will come with the common commercial policy. This is not #Brexit. I do not support this. 
Theresa May asked by Dr Sarah Wollaston if her promise of £394m a week NHS funding will still stand regardless of #Brexit outcome - PM fails to give direct answer, saying her focus is on getting her deal approved. MPs challenge the PM on #Brexit: 
Consent is indeed being manufactured, but not for May’s deal but for #Remain.With a combination of dangling carrots across the channel & predictions of doom should we refuse to eat them.#Brexit
The dominant emerging media narrative that many/most people voted #Brexit for reasons other than economic or knowing there might be an economic downside is utterly spurious. A 1.89% swing would reverse the mandate, so what “many” or even “most” thought is utterly irrelevant.
Listening to PM in Parl Liaison Cttee...appears to me her difficulty in moving off script when asked challenging questions is akin to meat being skewered in preparation for a BBQ...Time to reset #Brexit...#PeoplesVote for a #FinalSay & a #StopBrexit #Remain
CRINGE! @TomTugendhat jokingly asks @theresa_may whether the UK will be friends with benefits () with the EU post #Brexit.Don't think the PM got what he meant though!

Here's what Thursday with @Schofe and @RochelleHumes looks like - @imacelebrity with @ToffTalks, @Lisa_Snowdon's pick of the best jumpsuits, and @jeremycorbyn talks #Brexit!See you at 10:30  
When you look at economic impact assessments of #Brexit some of the negative impact comes through lower net migration from the EU. Less skills, less productivity growth, and lower standards of living for all. Worth thinking about when debating freedom of movement. #HappeningNow
No-deal #Brexit means "very serious disruption to essential supplies" for patients, says Conservative Dr Sarah Wollaston - "is that keeping you awake at night?"Theresa May: The way to ensure a "smooth and orderly" Brexit is to ratify my dealMore: 
Britain's immigration story continues to change amid #Brexit -Net migration from EU reaches lowest level since 2012-Net migration from outside EU reaches highest since 2004-Overall net migration still +273,000 
May’s deal would lead to much the same damage as no deal and @UKLabour MPs must vote it down for the good of their constituents and the country. "No deal" isn't on the table so vote down the deal then bring it back to the people. #PeoplesVote#Brexit
Juncker's unelected number 2 Selmayr is at it again. He now boasts: "The Power is with us" (EU.) Sadly, he is correct due to May's shameful #Brexit betrayal deal. It must be scrapped for the good of the nation. No Deal! #ForTheNation
Brits forced to return to UK b/c #Brexit has lost them their job/business or strangled their pension are to lose their citizenship too?No free #NHS on arrival? No benefits for 3+ months? Demonstrate all links to EU severed?#HostileEnvironment now extended to returnees.
What the #liaisoncommittee appearance by Theresa May really underlines is how comparatively little work has been done to prepare for #brexit. The size of the task is monumentally huge and the government is not really equipped to deal with it
Is #Brexit backstop like a "post-war prefab" asks Conservative MP Andrew Murrison - "sold as temporary, built to last, and likely to outlive us all?"Theresa May: "No... neither side thinks that the backstop is a good place to be in"More: 
Forget #Brexit for a minute, lets talk funerals. So alarming is the rise in costs that the competition watchdog is launching a full investigation. Cremations are 84% more expensive than 10 yrs ago. Are funeral firms taking advantage of the vulnerable & the recently bereaved? 
Yvette Cooper"Having known you 20 years, i don't believe you'd let us go to a no deal scenario, i don't think you're type of person"- No, she's just the type of person that forces 14 mil people into poverty & deports our citizens..#Brexit #GetTheToriesOut #GeneralElectionNow
Hi Guy, I'm surprised by this tweet as you usually keep a close eye on Britain.Good News! The wheels are falling off #Brexit. The "deal" is recognised as more a "letter of intent" & hasn't a chance in parliament. Turns out that "the will of the people" is to revoke #Article50
LIVE: @theresa_may appears before Commons Liason committee for #Brexit questioning 
Roberto Gualtieri speaking on behalf of the European Socialists in the European Parliament debate on #Brexit this morning:“If the UK changes its mind, our arms will remain open”
Theresa May is now seriously arguing freedom of movement will end for EU nationals but not British citizens, which is certainly imaginative #brexit #LiaisonCommittee
Imagine waiting over 40 years for a vote on EU membership and being denied a vote on numerous EU treaties. Imagine paying your taxes and working hard your whole life, only to be told your vote doesn't count anymore because you didn't vote the right way. #Brexit

The most honest and accurate version of #brexit I think I’ve ever heard. Thanks @JamesMelville for this beauty.
Prof Piet Eeckhout, Dean of UCL Laws, has acted as academic consultant in the #Brexit reversal court case. The case will see the European Court of Justice decide whether the UK can call off its withdrawal from the EU without permission from member states 
Just done another radio interview on  the #BrexitDeal and the mess it poses for @BritishInEurope Journalist: 'I need to edit this down to 2 minutes'.Me: 'I could just say it's a clusterfuck?'Journalist: 'Well, we ARE a youth radio station...'#Brexit #BrexitAgreement
Blah blah. The #EU denies the most basic right of citizens to decide who governs them and who makes the laws. That’s why the UK voted for #Brexit, and it’s why the EU is dying. 
#Brexit has nothing to do with any trade deal. It’s about who makes the laws we have to live by. This phoney trade argument is being used as a smokescreen to try and strip us permanently of our democratic rights. Just leave. Trade will sort itself out. It always does.
The @Europarl_EN's priority in the #Brexit process was to fight for citizens' rights. But before we give our consent, we expect the full reassurance of the UK Government regarding its implementation of the citizens' rights agreements reached.

The whole point of democracy......is that the public can dump politicians & their projects when they fail.#Brexit
.@FT editorial board endorses Parliament’s right to call for another public vote if Theresa May’s #Brexit deal is voted down and all alternatives to crashing out of the EU without a deal are exhausted. 
Our first #Brexit podcast :   Not perfect technically but at least it has some dry humour (stay with it and it'll reward you!) and it also contains important facts.   We're trying everything to get the message out to ordinary people.
Serious questions have to be asked about why we don't have these open & free #Brexit roadshows, loans & websites in NI which will be affected most. In fact in HMG tech notices in Brexit we were told to call the IRISH GOVT! Biz in South preparing for the worst and calmer for it.

#brexit  Can you stop putting MANBOY Owen Jones on TV & Radio all the time. The guardian halfwit. Don’t forget he backed Labour lost, Hillary Clinton lost, stay in EU lost. Never got prediction right ever. Owen Jones does for journalism what Big Daddy did for TRAMPOLINING. 
#MarkCarney is a class Act.  Refuses to rise to Humphrys’ bait on @BBCr4today .  Avoids the disgraceful personalization of debate by Mogg, keeps it calm, plays a straight bat.  But makes it clear that #Brexit is idiocy.  Time for a #peoplesvote to put grown ups back in charge
This what the traitorous Tory Gov are doing.They promised to deliver the #Brexit the 17.4m voted for but in reality we are not leaving at all.We are to be tied for ever more to the EU with no exit door and N. Ireland will be split off from the rest of the UK.#BrexitBetrayal
An award for cabinet resignations is quite something to begin with. But this? To some #Brexit seems to still be a joke. I wish all these people would have to walk in the shoes of someone #AlreadyNotFine They would not smirk like this after that. #SpecAwards

What other country would let the Governor of its central bank go on telly to makes remarks designed to weaken the Government’s negotiating position? Mark Carey has been consistently wrong on #Brexit, and this #ProjectFear madness must end now
It’s depressing listening to @BBCr4today consistently reinforcing the false Deal v No Deal dichotomy & thus supporting @theresa_may agenda. There is a third choice highlighted by proceedings in the #CJEU this week - staying in the #EU. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Will leaving the EU leave UK less secure? Ben Wallace: "no, we will get control of our borders, we will have more control over who comes to our country...there is a plus there" #Brexit
Economic forecasts from #BankofEngland and from the government itself both strike blow to #TheresaMay’s  #Brexit deal - yet many Tory MPs are in denial  (“I know better than all the professionals”) and want to go full steam ahead to disaster.  
In Glasgow, Scotland, people are fuming about #brexit. The most common words from our interviews- "ignored","independence" and words I shall not type on twitter ;). There's little support for Theresa May's deal and signs of a new problem on the horizon. 
This is top-notch @ScotNational. Banning legitimate media from press conferences should be called out, and the press should stick together to defend democracy.  #TheresaMay #brexit 
Efta is the best way to ditch our EU political baggage. The EU has been a ball and chain for British politics and it's time to lance the boil once and for all. #Brexit 
#Brexit is no longer the "Will of the People" (I've always shuddered whenever the Cons have used that Nazi phrase) - it never really was.63% of Brits don't want to #Brexit if it means taking a hit (see Sky Poll 28Nov18).EU is not a 'foreign power', since WE are part of it.

You know Theresa May has done something pretty shady when these two agree on something! | #Scotref #Indyref2 #Brexit #Scotland @ScotNational | Also @Skynews - The national is a pro-independence supporting newspaper, not just SNP!
Project stop brexit is now one step away from tuning the dial up to 10. The BBC and the rest are desperate to make that happen. 3 years of the biggest conspiracy to overturn democracy in a so called democratic nation. Our  media are part of this attack against democracy. #brexit
What a front page!  @ScotNational newspaper makes a statement over being excluded from @theresa_may #Brexit press event in #Scotland
It's interesting watching the different approaches of the SNP and the Tories.The SNP - despite a mandate for "separatism" - are trying to get a workable #Brexit for the whole UK.The Tories meanwhile are trying desperately to exclude Scotland from any deal.
Scotland was ignored during the #Brexit negotiations.Scotland was ignored during the House of Commons #Brexit debates.The Scottish Government's input was ignored by the UK government.And now the Scottish press don't even get to ask questions about "May's deal". 
Dear Brits, I was  right about #Brexit for 2 yrs. Now I’m begging you, if you want to survive this thing, you’ve got to buy #Bitcoin.
We have a Prime Minister that would be better suited making jam for the WI and a Leader of the Opposition who frankly should be exiled to his allotment.#Brexit #ClownCountry

Mark Carney should have been sent packing to Canada straight after the referendum in 2016. His role in absurd 'Project Fear' meant he was a totally unsuitable person to be in charge of the Bank of England during the #Brexit process. He undermined the bank's credibility 
Friendly reminder that Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, is also a member of the General Council of the European Central Bank, and that the General Council's meetings and documents are confidential (i.e. secret) unless they choose to disclose them. #Brexit

The reputation of economic forecasts has taken a bad blow today with both UK government and @bankofengland appearing to use forecasts to support political objectives. Let's debate #Brexit - which I strongly oppose - rationally without recourse to bogus forecasts.
Blistering & honest editorial from @Daily_Record today: an open letter to @theresa_may on her flying visit to Scotland. Absolutely right, yet again she didn’t come here to listen, she has never listened, she came here to sell her #Brexit. Well, we ain’t buying it Prime Minister. 
I am delighted that the @MayorofLondon fully acknowledges the contribution the Polish people made to the city’s prosperity. I hope that Mr @SadiqKhan will continue to make Poles so welcome in #London, even after #Brexit. #PL100 Part 1/2
Now that the Bank of England and the Treasury have stated that a full a proper #Brexit  which they call a no deal Brexit would be bad for the economy you can be rest assured it's the best solution for Britain. Simple really when you know  the government is working against you.
Exactly! The french students only noticed me and came over to ask about #Brexit because I was wearing a fluorescent #BollockstoBrexit t-shirt, holding a #BackBritainNotBrexit placard and singing about how we must demand a #FinalSay on the #BrexitDeal!

Iain Dale made a good point on LBC tonight. If Mark Carney is meant to be independent and not get involved with front line politics then why hasn't he outlined a best case scenario or a scenario where the EU collapses as well as his worst case scenario? #Brexit #NoDeal
Great to be on #PoliticsLive earlier discussing Norway Plus – the strong compromise which means we avoid May’s dreadful, disempowering #Brexit and a truly disastrous No Deal which destroys our economy. Here’s why we need #NorwayPlus, in 20 seconds. #EEA #EFTA
The @bankofengland analysis is very clear: their no deal #Brexit analysis “is underpinned by worst case assumptions” and “is therefore not a forecast for the economy in the event the U.K. leaves with no deal” (both p.46). It is instead a *stress test*.  Entirely different thing.
Can you imagine how May/the Racist UK press would have 'spun' this?'Thousands of illegal migrants flood into UK''We must stop all FOM, once and for all''Once we leave the EU, we will get control of our borders.'Do Not Buy Her #Brexit deal, nor succumb to #Projectfear

1/ A thread on #Brexit lies. It is absolutely necessary to distinguish between the occasional lie which merely serves to deceive & a climate of lies which undermines democracy. This effect may be accidental or it may be deliberate. I believe the latter.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

Just to be absolutely clear, in all #Brexit scenarios, there is no more money for the NHS. Not a penny. It was a lie pedalled by the far right and dishonest MPs.
Steve, tourism is clearly important to #Cornwall's economy, but this "movement" is just a lot of hot air. What we really need are sustainable jobs in manufacturing & other high-value sectors - which along with farming are precisely those that will be hardest hit by #Brexit.

We are right to worry about disorderly #Brexit @bankofengland has explained. But no one wants that to happen. Also worrying is the slow burn decline already happening - and that Brexit makes worse - to which the Tories are absolutely committed.

While Theresa May visits #Scotland trying to convince us #Brexit is going to be wonderful, the governer of the Bank of England is on the news saying #BrexitChaos could potentially cause the worst financial crisis in modern history.Just to put it into perspective.
Project Fear latest:Key sentence in the Bank of England report: "The scenarios are not forecasts". In other words they have made up some numbers that make No Deal sound like a disaster and then extrapolated them forwards.#Brexit
You know when you're a man and your driving your family somewhere and you're lost. Everyone knows that you're lost but nobody dares say it and you won't admit it. So you just keep driving until you'll randomly find where you're supposed to be or you've driven into the sea.#Brexit
Not having a second referendum explicitly privileges the past over the present - which is pretty much what #Brexit is all about.
Well, that's #Brexit for you. 
I swear to God I'm trying not to bang on about #Brexit but for FUCK'S SAKE, every time I come out of my writing room and look at the news some more dumbassery has been committed. THE WHOLE POINT OF DEMOCRACY IS THE FREEDOM TO CHANGE YOUR OPINION WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.
To be honest, the 'how much worse could this make things?' line of reasoning is what brought us #Brexit and turns out the answer is 'a lot worse.'

Sad to see @theresa_may ducking @vincecable ‘s challenge yesterday. What is the point of having a debate of two people on the same #Brexit side? The people deserve to hear all options, including that of a #PeoplesVote.
The Government is treating Parliament and the people with contempt.Its economic analysis does not model @theresa_may's #Brexit deal.After two years of falsehoods, fibs and fabrications, people deserve facts - and a say on the future with a #PeoplesVote.
Excellent article. Indeed there is every likelihood that the Withdrawal Agreement and its unlovely sibling the Political Declaration were drafted to make staying in or, if #Brexit, rejoining attractive. 
The Prime Minister misled Parliament at #PMQs.How can she possibly say govt analysis shows we'll be better off under her #Brexit deal?The analysis plainly shows we'll be worse off under any version of Brexit.She must urgently apologise and set the record straight. 
Very important to note that there is no analysis of #PMs non binding Political Declaration “deal”. That’s because it’s so vague it can’t be analysed! The best deal is the one we currently have with the EU. Whichever way they try to do it #Brexit will make my constituents poorer. 
I came into politics as a single mother who knew what it was like to take the brunt of years of cruel Tory austerity. That's why I will not vote for a #Brexit that makes my constituents, my family, my country poorer, & why I'm a proud #PeoplesVote campaigner
That's us all set for the imminent trade talks after #Brexit Day, then. We have nothing like the number of expert trade negotiators we were aiming for, and we were always aiming low. Does this inspire confidence in our economic future outside the EU? #No
The SNP's @joannaccherry tells @BBCNews the UK government's own analysis shows the economy will be worse off under Theresa May's Brexit plan. The cat is out of the bag - it would be a massive hit to the Scottish economy costing the equivalent of £1600 a person #Brexit

What an extraordinary sight: the Government forecasts a policy will make the country thoroughly worse off, no matter how it is implemented, but insists it will implement that policy regardless. Absurd.Let's #EndTheChaos of #Brexit with a #PeoplesVote!
We like the sound of this suggestion by Steve Richards: “In the paralysis that follows the defeat of May’s deal a brave and wise parliament would vote to revoke article 50 and stop #Brexit.”

UK gov’t #Brexit analysis seems to be based on very optimistic assumptions about our future trade relationship with the EU. That enables the gov’t to claim its approach delivers a better outcome than remaining in the EEA (Norway deal). That seems highly implausible to me.
The PM is in Scotland today to tell us we will all be poorer if we jump with her off the #Brexit cliff. But that we should all jump anyway. Scotland - we can and must do better than this Westminster shambles. #indyref2

 The Govt's own Chancellor (who didn't even turn up to #PMQs) and own economic analyses admit that any form of Brexit will make everyone poorer.  While @IanBlackfordMP raises the facts, @theresa_may shakes her head, lives in denial and pursues a blindfold #Brexit.

Ludicrous for Theresa May to claim we won't be worse off under her damaging Brexit deal - even her own Chancellor admits the whole country will be poorer. Scottish Government analysis shows Scotland will lose the equivalent of £1600 for every person in the country #PMQs #Brexit

For the love of fisheries law, hot off the press... this adapts as necessary the CFP to work in the UK from exit day. I advise starting either the explanatory memo. #fisheries #brexit The Common Fisheries Policy (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2018

I am one of a small number of MPs who support Brexit. There are many who want to stop #Brexit, bring down the government or change the PM for reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with Brexit. The reality is that the alternatives all lead to no Brexit. 
Things may have got a little out of hand in #Brussels (watch till the end)#PeoplesVote #NotBuyingIt #Brexit 
Remainers will continue to lie about the need for a customs union in the EEA because they want any deal to look so bad that we pivot to remain. They will lie to the last. They fear the EEA option which they know it's an equitble exit that works. #Brexit
1) I heard Corbyn describe no #brexit in Parliament as "a threat", even though it's what Labour membership wants.I've read him saying "we can't stop it"I saw him post "as we leave the EU..." the day after 750k marched for a #PeoplesVote

I'll be @SkyNews 10.30am to reprise #InviteTheGreens of 2015. There aren't 2 sides in #Brexit debate, & if were drawn that simply, they wouldn't be represented by Theresa May & Jeremy Corbyn. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FOM #ARealDebate 
"A no-deal exit will have a much higher cost impact on the economy than the deal the PM has negotiated" - Chancellor @PhilipHammondUK is due to set out the government's analysis of the economic impact of #Brexit.Follow the story live here: 
So whilst @theresa_may is criss-crossing the UK trying to convince us all that her #BREXIT agreement is great, she won’t even publish the legal advice? And she’s ignoring the will of @UKParliament? 
"Remaining in the EU would be a better outcome for the economy, but not by much" - Chancellor Philip Hammond says Theresa May's #Brexit deal "is very close" to the economic benefits of being in the EU
Hammond: the economy will continue to grow, but it will be a bit smaller than it would have been if we'd remained inside the European Union. But I recognise people will look at other benefits - independent trade policy, having control of our fishing waters #Brexit
Jamie Foster on Theresa May and her letter to the British People: "MPs are most unlikely to be persuaded to fall into line behind this Prime Minister's deal which they clearly despise." #csm #brexit @1jamiefoster
No one voted to be poorer - if Con MPs vote for PMs #Brexit deal they’ll be doing it for them. Govt set to publish yet more evidence that which ever way you cut it #Brexit will make us all poorer - well apart from the well heeled #Leave leaders
I'm pretty bored of writing about #Brexit so I did a longish and horrendously boring video blog about it - which you probably won't watch, and I don't really blame you either. zzzzzzzzz

Apparently Theresa may plans to spend £9 million on leaflets promoting her #brexit deal make it soft strong and very very long
1. It's too early to call it but there is a good chance May's #Brexit deal won't make it through parliament - which is a window of opportunity for an alternative approach. And, unsurprisingly, the EEA floats to the top again as the only game in town. (thread)
Top memo from Matthew Paris in the The Times today. Northern Ireland costs the U.K. taxpayer more than the EU. Net contribution of £9.3b v £8.6b. Population over a million less than Greater Manchester. Would the Rep of Ireland care to pick up that tab? #Brexit Just saying....

Do the treasury forecasts of the different #Brexit scenarios take into account any new trade deals? How do they know what agreements we will have in place over the next few years after a WTO Brexit? How can these be considered accurate when many others weren’t?#SkyPapers
Oh no! UK £150bn worse off if No Deal #Brexit. May I humbly advise the Government no-one is listening anymore. Timed out. 
My guess the Mail will lose a lot of readers by the end of 2018 for its disgraceful role in undermining #Brexit It's as if the whole nasty collective along with the owners have lost it and turned loony left. Telegraph should capitalise on it if it stop publishing liberal rubbish.
Errr, how does that work?It’s not as if she can go back to Brussels going “ohh Michel give me more, because my MPs are going to be nasty to me!” #Brexit 
Theresa May says her #Brexit deal is good because it will bring "certainty" to the UK. Well she's right there - we all agree that it will certainly be shit.

The #Brexit news May & Corbyn don’t want the UK public and UK MPs to hear. The EU Council & EU Commission have just confirmed they believe A50 is unilaterally revocable.Great work by @JolyonMaugham & team.Time for #PeoplesVote #FinalSay so we can #ExitFromBrexit & #Remain
God spare us from this nonsense - absolute garbage. Now, the question is this: does he know that he is wrong, does he care? Or is he knowingly, maliciously spreading untruths?  #Brexit 
The UK’s application to the World Trade Organisation (#WTO) makes progress. An Agreement in principle has been reached.Which is unlike Mrs May’s dire deal with its EU Political Declaration for #Brexit that has no mention of a Trade Agreement in principle. 
Theresa May loyalist Michael Fallon savages her 'doomed' #Brexit deal 
At every stage of miserable #Brexit road, Govt has tried to keep @UKParliament in the dark, ensuring that it knew less about the negotiations than @Europarl_EN & didn’t have proper impact assessments, and now trying to hide govt legal advice from it. Who’s taking back control?
There was no plan, no manifesto, no blueprint for #Brexit. There was no contract. Now we have the 585-page contract that wasn't available 2-weeks ago, let alone 2-years go. That's why we now need the #FinalSay. Share @Jon_Danzig’s commentary. Link:

Since Theresa May is going to Glasgow tomorrow to promote her #Brexit deal that's being imposed on Scotland, lets remember the reaction she got when she visited Edinburgh back in August...

Interesting @mike_pence factoid: I absolutely LOVED Pence in 2016, long before Trump picked him.Why?Because even as Indiana Governor, he was pushing for #Brexit.I thought it was amazing he’d even heard of Brexit. Looking back - Russian assets gonna Russian asset. 
It’s a cold and filthy night outside in London & while the govt is crippled by #Brexit people are sleeping on the streets tonight, in sodden sleeping bags on top of cardboard lying in ever growing puddles.It is shaming.
So we now have an executive that is not complying with the binding instructions of parliament. There's a name for that, its called a DICTATORSHIP.You may think this particular issue is unimportant but once the principal is setNo confidence vote could be ignored next.#Brexit 
The UK Govt refusing to publish the #brexit legal advice is tactically inept. It loses any remaining trust on Labour benches, making May winning the “meaningful vote” even less likely.What the hell can be in it that means they’re so worried to publish?

Of course they are trying to exclude @NicolaSturgeon but the British public deserve to hear all kinds of views about #Brexit. I think it’s also the knowledge that neither #May nor #Corbyn will look competent next to her.

#BrexitShambles means future generations will be denied the opportunities their parents have enjoyed. PM can’t say her deal is better than continued membership of the EU for the simple reason that it’s impossible to have a better deal than membership #Brexit

"May´s #Brexit deal is worst of all worlds and doomed to fail" Says May Loyalist Sir Michael Fallon#DitchTheDeal#StandUp4Brexit
*Heavy sigh*. If you don't want Freedom of Movement, you have to have this #Brexit deal or something like it. Or leave with nothing and take the consequences. Europhobe or Corbynite (basically the same these days), that's it. Sorry.
'It will make touring simply unviable for very many artists who need to earn a living' - @UK_Music writes to Theresa May, calling for the government to protect freedom of movement for touring bands #Brexit 
If May loses her #Brexit deal vote heavily what should she do?
The ONLY way to STOP these needless deaths is a Corbyn GovtAusterity is a political tool killing our poorest/ most vulnerableAs far as I am concerned a #Labour Govt is far far more important than issues around #Brexit - a Tory device to stop an internal civil war#NHS
FYI it’s VERY unusual for a senior lawyer to refuse to address the substantive question before the court. I’ve never seen it happen & conventional wisdom is that it’s very unwise. Rather fits with UK Govts political approach...#Art50 #CJEU #Brexit
It's like a general election campaign all over again. Leave Means Leave launches new poster. #Brexit 
The advocates of Norway Plus need to wise up fast. The country can’t afford to waste yet more time going down blind alleys. If the PM's plan is rejected, the only good option is to ask the public whether they still want #Brexit in a #PeoplesVote.
THE BROWN WIND OF CHANGE #EU #Nationalism #May #Brexit 
Leave campaigners used to say we'd strike trade deals all over the world as soon as we leave.Today, the Gov can't even say when we're going to get a trade deal with the US.Tell your MP to reject this miserable #Brexit deal & demand a #PeoplesVote: 
Tea time. Today's cartoon by Enrico Bertuccioli: #Brexit 
NEW: At European Court just now, lawyer for EU Council agrees that UK’s revocation of Article 50 notice “should not be excluded” by the Court. Important concession suggesting that, in view of EU27, we DO have right-to-revoke the #Brexit notice.

After a 'representative' Brexit debate on @BBCNewsnight which excluded representatives and perspectives from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, what are the chances we will see this repeated if it ever comes to a TV debate with the Prime Minister? #Brexit 
Andrew Crawford - DUP leader Arlene Foster's #RHI scandal-hit spad, who now advises the party on #Brexit - blocked civil servants from releasing documents exposing a minister embroiled in a bonfire controversy. @irish_news @politicsIN
Tired? Yes. Bored? No!There may be dark days ahead, but we can do this, don't give up. Make it clear politicians can no longer take your support for granted, they must earn it.Stay strong, stay united. There is no deal better than No #Brexit. 
In a moment, I will be on @bbc5live on #Gibraltar #Brexit #WithdrawalAgreement
The utterly shocking thing here is that the government has repeatedly tried to prevent the British people from knowing the single most important legal fact about #Brexit, namely whether it is unilaterally revocable. How is that compatible with democracy!#PeoplesVote #FBPE
Thoughtful, considered & logical from @normanlamb Representing a heavily #leave voting constituency he’s well placed to conclude May’s #Brexit deal won’t heal the nation.He’s voting against the deal & backing a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
I have written to @theresa_may challenging the Prime Minister of the UK  to a TV debate on her #Brexit deal. There is a need for democratic scrutiny and as @Plaid_Cymru leader I welcome the opportunity to debate the effect of the proposed exit from the EU on Wales and the UK.

Previously a May loyalist, Michael Fallon sticks the boot in on @Theresa_May's ludicrous non-#Brexit Hotel California "deal" where we have no legal right to ever leave the EU & which 100% sells UK out to blackmail & whims of corrupt Brussels bureaucrats
The very same people who were shocked and outraged at Obama’s “interference” in UK politics over #brexit......are welcoming Trump’s “interference” in UK politics over brexit.Another day in brexit stupidity land.

We’re hoping to establish the UK’s right to revoke the #Brexit Article 50 notification at the European Court this morning. If the British people want, on reflection, to stay in the EU then that should be their right #PeoplesVote
This fantastic response to Theresa May’s #Brexit letter is going viral 
Forget Trump, the Government’s campaign to sell #Brexit just received its biggest blow - 
Trump is clearly doing a favour for his far-right pal Nigel Farage. But if anyone thinks a trade deal with the US following a no-deal #Brexit would be better than the one we currently enjoy via the EU, they're living in cloud cuckoo land. #PeoplesVote #R4today
Post #Brexit, the UK becomes the only country in Europe whose citizens have their rights removed by their government to settle, retire or compete for jobs in 30 other European countries. What a prize you #Brexiters have won.Of course you knew that when you voted.
#Brexit Going to have a TV debate Theresa May v Jeremy Corbyn Why. Both hate Brexit both don’t want us to Leave the EU. These two useless pathetic politicians. What’s the point of the debate. Get a bloody Brexiteer on TV who represents 17:4 million people who voted leave EU FFS. 
.@jeremycorbyn says he’d “relish” debating #PM re #Brexit agreement - not sure many others would. Both support Brexit & it should be a balanced debate so @peoplesvote_uk must be included on equal terms
Perhaps it would be a good idea to remind @billybragg that the #FBPE hashtag was invented on mainland Europe by @AuroraBlogspotThe hashtag was then embraced by the cross-party Anti-#Brexit movement as a way of 'networking' for supporters of our movement.#PeoplesVote #FinalSay
TRUMP was right again..!   #Brexit #LeaveMeansLeave
I’m with Donald! Never thought I’d say that#Brexit 
PM’s assertion yesterday that  “I can say to the house with absolute certainty that there is not a better deal available.“ is only true if you accept her self imposed and ridiculously insular red lines.  It is blatant nonsense if you take any other position at all.  #Brexit

The part that’s “bad for the Union” is #Brexit itself. (Has he seriously not worked that out yet?!) 
A terrible mistake? Another referendum? An acceptable deal? We asked some Londoners what they think after EU leaders endorsed the #Brexit deal: 
"This deal stops #FreedomOfMovement"You say that like it's a good thing!Don't you know 63% of Brits want to retain that right? Rising to 75% when voters understand it's a reciprocal right they'll lose it in 31 countries, while EU-nats only lose it in 1?#Brexit punishes Brits 
Smile moment and take on #brexit and my favorite #unitedkingdom
His predecessor warned the UK would go "to the back of the queue" on trade - now President Trump has shared his opinion on Theresa May's #Brexit agreement. What do you make of his comments? Is he trying to influence MPs? Comments to #BBCTheBriefing

#Trump: #Brexit agreement may hamper trade with UK 
Listening to the guy in the middle here, the #Brexit options are clear- and a #peoplesvote needed to resolve the most contentious issue we have had since the war.
What a thoroughly decent, class act we have in @Dr_PhilippaW ,putting Theresa May to shame over her appalling #Queuejumper remarks on EU nationals. #Brexit #EU
There is absolutely zero value in putting Corbyn up against May, their pro #Brexit position is so similar there is nothing to debateCorbyn does not represent the opposition,he ran off to Europe whilst 750k of us marched for a #PeoplesVote He has nothing of value to contribute
isn't this view of migration effects from the Taoiseach much more forward looking and positive than the utterly reprehensible approach of Theresa May's tories? @Dr_PhilippaW #Brexit #freemovement @Feorlean
Just a timely reminder that "filthy Blairite" @OwenSmith_MP (who didn't win the leadership) is aligned with the Labour membership on #Brexit and has been right all along whereas "new kind of Politics" @jeremycorbyn (who did win) is trying to suppress the #PeoplesVote
It never ceases to amaze me that we can find £39Bn to Brexit but the RNLI and Air Ambulance depend on charity. Oh yeah, and 1 in every 200 are homeless.#Brexit is a vanity project for the rich and ideologues.We can’t afford this.
A #Brexit debate between two Brexiters. The very idea that this is proposed shows so much of what is undemocratic about Brexit. To reflect the division in the country, the debate must be between a Brexiter and a Remainer.  #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Great to see the @RNCMvoice addressing issues such as mental wellbeing. I'm sure the many uncertainties accompanying #Brexit weigh heavy on the minds of students #rncm #mentalhealth #MentalHealthAwareness #MentalHealthMatters #MentalHealthMonday
So let’s get this straight @BBCNewsnight . Scotland is an integral part of the UK when it comes to being Brexited against our will, but a peripheral part when it comes to our politicians and government being included in your #brexit #newsnight debate???
If May really has made the reported offer to the DUP then it's essentially telling us that we are being buggered senseless for the sole purpose of ending FoM - which is really not what this is all about.#Brexit
Norway option has come out of the blue according to @pollytoynbee? She and other MSM and politicians chose to ignore it for several years. #newsnight #brexit 
Ladies, if he:- ignores your needs- makes empty promises- is screwing you and the whole of the UK- is the child of David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Nigel FarageThat’s not your man. That’s #Brexit 
"What we're seeing is the Taoiseach playing politics when it comes to the North."Sinn Féin MPs will not be taking their seats in Westminster. We're Republicans. We won't swear an allegiance to a foreign power."@davidcullinane #TonightVMT #Brexit 
“Tonight we start the TV debate early” - without the 3rd largest party in the House of Commons among a panel of 5 MPs. #brexit 
1. Though I am an advocate of the EEA, I do not welcome the meddlesome interjections by @nickboles. He is a bluffer and he does not understand the EEA system - and because of that he will cock up the arguments and create more unnecessary opposition. (#Brexit thread)

I can’t remember a time when Britain looked so pathetic. #Brexit has poisoned our country. #newsnight
.@BBCNewsnight has a #Brexit special with FIVE MPs & not one from Scotland. All English MPs. Brexit is a constitutional crisis abt the state of the UK. Where are any Scottish MPs? Either make Brexit abt England or understand this is a fundamental crisis abt what the UK is.
Narratives BBC News has been pushing all day on May’s botched #Brexit deal- people just want to get on with it- you never know, funny things happen, May could win the vote (the vote no one else thinks she can win)Oddly enough, these are the lines No.10 are also pushing too 
Here is the Prime Minister a few months ago saying the backstop threatens the Union & no British PM would ever sign up to it....she cannot be trusted. Paragraph 50 guaranteeing the Northern Ireland Assembly a role also removed #Brexit
Labour to block #PeoplesVote taking part in #Brexit debateIf Corbyn's allowed to dictate the terms of a #Brexit related debate, denying access to a #Remainer there shld be NO DEBATE.Utter disgrace. Every step of the way he's shut down a #Remain option.
WATCH "Prime Minister, I plead with you, the House of Commons has never, ever, surrendered to anybody, and it won't start now". Another stinging question from Mark Francois MP. And he's right. If you agree, please RT. #Brexit 
Take note of Russia's treatment of Ukraine.Russia wants #Brexit.Russia wants to break up the EU.We need to stay in the EU and work with our neighbours to keep the EU bigger and stronger than Russia.Brexit weakens the EU.Stupid.Stupid.Stupid.#bbcnewsten
Oh folks can you PLEASE stop using the term #suicide and #selfharm when you talk about #Brexit It’s unnecessary, lazy and potentially very distressing to people struggling with overwhelming emotions or thoughts of wishing they were dead @BBCNews @jeremycorbyn
Popped into my local for a pint this afternoon & had really uplifting conversation with the barman. He knows I am #YES his comment "I have spoken to a lot of No voters who are now #YES not simply because of #Brexit but because of the way Scotland has been treated" Wow!
MUST-READ: New report shows Government’s dodgy #Brexit deal will cost Britain £100bn by 2030. Time for a #PeoplesVote to get us out of this mess.
Leave voters hit by austerity now realise how EU membership benefits them, study finds /#EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Well I never. Having been told in Washington in Jan2017 how excited US was looking forward to #Brexit and a new trade dawn with the UK I am now told Mays deal is not Brexit and the US govt know it. So no deal with them. @10DowningStreet deliberately blowing off Brexit benefits.
The people in the North voted to remain and voted for 7 MPs NOT to take their seats in Westminster.  Britain has never given Ireland a second thought and never will. Respect our mandate #Brexit
Given MPs are under a duty of care to act in the best interests of the country, and knowing what we all now know about the devastation of a no deal #Brexit, could we sue any MP who supports it? The question must be the deal or #remain#PeoplesVote#RevokeA50
National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) say May's #Brexit deal leaves the UK £100bn a year worse off so that means Scotland will be around £8bn-£9bn worse off annually.  Now how much does @LabourRichard want the @scotgov to spend on mitigating Tory policies?
With Trump weighing in on #Brexit, excited for him to share his thoughts on the Falklands when he makes it to Argentina later this week

Though I recognise freedom of movement in its current form must end it is still a way down on my list of #Brexit priorities. I think EEA controls are adequate - but I also think we are better seeking a consensus approach within Efta and making a new proposal to the EU.

All I’ve heard from Tory MPs peddling May’s line today is how we should accept her none-deal because we’re all apparently too sick of #Brexit to give a sh*t what actually happens. I’m afraid, chaps, nothing could be further from the truth. Let battle commence - again!
If Treeeza don’t like it, she can always bugger off. I have no sympathy for her being on the receiving end of an #HostileEnvironment She brought it all on herself. #Brexit 
Dear Jeremy Corbyn, a "strong single market deal" is meaningless waffle. Either we accept Freedom of Movement, which you have repeatedly rejected, and we can stay in the Single Market, or the EU will keep us at arms length from the Single Market. #StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote

"#Corbyn broke the cosy consensus on the economy, while keeping his party’s powder dry & options open on divisive idiocies of #Brexit. Despite panicked manoeuvrings of part of his party, he's pursued a coherent, consistent line against #austerity & reset the debate on his terms."

Hello @GaryLineker Mr Corbyn wishes to create a peaceful, prosperous & truly egalitarian society that works for all.He had campaigned for Remain & Reform. The failure of #Brexit lies with the Tories & their chums. A Jeremy Corbyn led govt will transform the UK #ForTheMany
Ex-foreign secretary Boris Johnson: Does the #Brexit deal mean "taking back control" or staying in the customs union and free market? Theresa May: "We will be able to negotiate free trade deals under this agreement" Live updates: 
So far we have had.......IDS. David Davis, Anna Soubry, Hilary Benn, Nigel Dodds, Vince Cable, Ian Blackford, Boris Johnson, Bill Cash, Yvette Cooper. Each one a hostile question. #brexit
Don’t panic @peoplesvote_uk whatever the #Brexit “deal” whether it’s the PMs agreement or a new “Plan B” namely Norwayplus I believe voters must have #FinalSay #PeoplesVote
I’m hearing that dopey Theresa May has just said that we won’t agree to French demands on Fishing because we’ll be in the CU backstop? What? So it’s lose fishing or lose FTA’s with ROW? What on earth is she doing? I mean really!  #Brexit #DitchTheDeal @FindlaterJake
You can tell @IanBlackfordMP has made good points when @theresa_may stares absolute daggers at him the likes of which nobody else receives. I voted to remain in the UK. If #Brexit goes ahead I’ll campaign to leave the UK in a second Scottish referendum. #IndyRef2
Vinz Cable has just stood up and said his party is "the real opposition". My, what a short memory he has.  #Brexit #BrexitStatement
Quite frankly every time Ian Blackford stands up in the commons with his sanctimonious tone & says ‘one day soon Scotland will become an independent country’ makes me shout ‘good’ #brexit

Sinn Féin deputy leader @moneillsf said anyone who believes the EU is about to open up a new negotiation and give a better deal than Theresa May has currently achieved is living in a fantasy world. That is absolute nonsense and a ludicrous position to take. #Brexit 
"We will always stand by you. We are proud that Gibraltar is British"Theresa May tells MPs her #Brexit deal ensures Gibraltar is covered by the whole withdrawal agreement, despite protests from SpainMore: 
PM alone and unsupported on her own benches - it’s a truly desperate sight. If she wants to appeal to the people - why won’t she agree to @peoplesvote_uk ?? #Brexit #FinalSay
This is no stepping stone process to sovereignty but a deliberate & deceitful attempt to overturn Brexit. This deal has shackled the UK's global trade opportunities, humiliated us as rule takers & EU colony with an enormous withdrawal bill not legally enforceable post #Brexit 
Quite astonishing that @theresa_may admitted there had been close consultation with the Gibralter Govt during the EU negotiations...  But Scotland?  Oh no ... you'll do as you're told.   Outrageous attitude towards Scotland..   #Brexit
Planning ahead with @dfatirl Nordic & Baltic missions: supporting around 25 ministerial visits & trade worth €13 billion this year. #Brexit and EU policy agenda to the fore. Kept in line & ontime by our 2 Cork Chairs! Tnx @IrishEmbSweden for hosting. #GlobalIreland #working4IRL
The EEA option has been declared dead a dozen times in the last two years. The reason it keeps floating back to the surface is because it really is the only way to secure an equitable and intellectually sound exit from the EU.#Brexit

'We feared it would not be possible': EU grimly satisfied as #Brexit plan pays off  
#Brexit has shown everyone the value of the EU, says President @EmmanuelMacron. He highlights three areas of importance in the future: fair competition, fishing rights & respect for the EU's decision-making autonomy 
Imagine how that 100,000,000,000 GBP #RemainDividend could be spent on such priorities. We have the wealth to transform the UK instead of flushing it down the #Brexit bog.Square one sounds like a great place to be - inside the EU & ending austerity.

In our latest blog, the man who brought us Tomb Raider explains why there's growing support in the British video games industry for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit.This industry is - currently - a world-class strength of ours, and Brexit threatens its future.

Interesting comment on @SkyNews that the passing of the #WithdrawalAgreement relies, in part, on voter fatigue. If @theresa_may and @OllyRobbins think this means that we’ll tire of supporting #Brexit then they’ve seriously miscalculated. Just ask @Leavers_Britain or @Lugey6.

Brexiters promised #Brexit meant “taking back control". This #BrexitDeal means losing control.As EU members we've been helping shape EU rules for over 40 years, from maternity rights to protecting our environment to aviation safety.That's why we need a #PeoplesVote.
Great work @SODEMAction you’re live on Sky #Brexit 
For all of those wailing about May's #Brexit deal, you really need to take it up with @BrexitCentral and @GuidoFawkes propagandists - along with Redwood, Paterson, Baker and the ERG gang. They shouted down the alternatives and this is what you're left with.
Bwahahaha. Theresa May: If you don't back my deal we will risk delivering on our manifesto of leaving the EU.What you need to do is accept my deal (remaining) or risk not leaving (remaining).Goodbye Conservatives. Hello UKIP!#Brexit #PeoplesVote #StandUp4Brexit
What do you think #Brexit is? It's giving up our sovereignty, we have a leading voice in the EU currently. EU still going to be there, having a massive impact on us if we leave or not. As a part of EU, we can help to shape it, outside, it will shape us!

If @jeremycorbyn betrays young people, after they trusted him & voted for him, they’ll never vote Labour again. I’m serious about this, @UKLabour. You’ll lose a generation of voters because of your #Brexit policy.

This mornings relief was short lived. The judge was left with no choice to adjourn after it became clear that the UK Home Office was not prepared. It's been 3 years, now certain to be 4, all because I identify as an Irish citizen. We are deeply disappointed @ImmPractGpNI #Brexit 
Problem for Corbyn, banking on #Brexit to create chaos so he can get keys to No.10, is that, it's one thing to create (May) or enable (Corbyn) chaos, its another to control it.Lab & Tory parties could split & Corbyn's utopian dreams could end up just another casualty of Brexit. 
A detailed critique of @NickBoles #Norwayplus - won’t avoid #backstop, won’t avoid tariff/access trade off for #fishing & delivers huge #democratic deficit. Concludes its main aim to make sure #Brexit happens, never mind economic/democratic costs #PeoplesVote

Watching the TV news coverage of May’s botched #Brexit deal feels like watching the EU Referendum again. TV crews descend on some town and pick out the thickest or most extreme people they can find to do vox pops and then pass them off as “public opinion”.#BrokenMedia
If the #FBPE brigade really want to stop #Brexit and not just slag off Jeremy Corbyn, they should be more concerned about Labour right-wingers like Caroline Flint and Gareth Snell who appear willing to vote for Theresa May's fudge rather than Corbyn who wholeheartedly opposes it.
"We're accusing him of lying about how much money the UK spends on the EU each week and year" says @MarcusJBall from Brexit Justice who's bringing a private lawsuit to @BorisJohnson over #Brexit referendum comments.Did you forget about the big red bus? 
In one tweet: #brexit means OUT of the institutions but IN the legal framework. It is the U.K. going from rule-maker to rule-taker. This is NOT taking back control. This is NOT better than membership. This is NOT worth it 
Incredibly important pointA significant number of Leave voters are likely now bored with #Brexit & couldn't care less either wayMPs need to get out of their "democracy undermined" bubble and recognise - there is no point in doing this, no one will thank them for it 
Good to see this confirmed #brexit 
white van men are 100% for #brexit - they assume that all the foreigners will go home and that then there will be more work for them.  Forgetting that nobody will be able to afford what they do any more

Has @theresa_may handed  leverage in phase 2 of #Brexit? Given that  is locked by  into a backstop / customs union (so no independent trade policy?) until we find a rich free trade deal which itself eliminates need for Irish border etc, is the answer ‘yes’? [THREAD]
Lidington & Barwell to brief Labour MPs about deal at 8pm tonight. Lab source reminds me last time govt did this, @BorisJohnson resigned halfway through meet. “We’re hoping it will be this entertaining this time around” #brexit
So Theresa May, you have written to the people, but you do not have the courtesy to let them write back with their votes. You have no respect for the people, and you are running scared of their verdict on your deal. Democracy needs a #PeoplesVote#StopBrexit #Brexit 
Wrong Mrs May you will loose your job and many Conservative MPs will loose their jobs if they don't vote this bad #Brexit 'in name only' deal!
'We'll build a platform and no one will see the #Brexit protestors'. 
The duopoly governance of Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn cooked a #Brexit which the  country is now united on wanting to scrap.Polls also confirm there is a growing majority of voters who select don’t know when asked to choose between May and corbyn. 
May has made two mistakes today. Matching her jacket to the backdrop so she looks like a disembodied head and, of course, a shitty #Brexit deal.
The Tories’ self-obsessed #Brexit soap opera has made our country look chaotic, disunited and isolated.They must stop fighting their own internecine dogma wars and claiming any of it is in “the national interest”.

May's #Brexit deal is the worst deal ever. It is a complete and total betrayal of the people. She isn't fit for office. Worryingly, there's undoubtedly more to come from this weak Government.. 
Enroute to #London to deliver an address for @FPALondon Annual Awards Dinner. I will have something to say about #Brexit & #Gibraltar as well as the importance to us of the  #WithdrawalAgreement & @theresa_may's unflinching & stalwart support for #TheRock. #WhenTheGoingGetsTough

In Germany you lose your job for supporting #Brexit. In the UK donors are threatened with extra tax, being puppets of Putin & supporters branded thick, stupid and racist. This repressive Marxist playbook is now part of corporate and party politics. 
#Brexit will not deliver greater sovereignty for the #British peopleWe are diminishing our standing as a global leader & opting for vassalage Brexit could never deliver on the contradictory promises made. Threatening civil unrest will not change thatP.S it's spelt Madeleina
Theresa May’s #Brexit letter proudly trumpets the removal of her right to live and work freely in 27 of those countries. As if that’s a good thing.So my response is: return to sender 
The future is only #Brexit, for ever and ever and ever. It will never end. Enjoy your day!
If you were to sum up May’s #brexit deal it would be this:...it has virtually none of the supposed advantages of leaving the EU, but significantly less of the advantages of full EU membership.It is, quite simply, the very definition of pointlessness.
If there had been no referendum and #Brexit was simply being enacted as a Tory party policy, #Labour would be fighting it tooth and nail, because it harms the country, businesses and its citizens.So why are theyjust sitting meekly by whilst this travesty unfolds?

There wasn't much sleep for either of us last night but we're relieved after 7 more months to be defending our case & the previous ruling. The UK Home Office will argue NI citizens are British by birth, regardless of GFA choice. We will argue that I am an Irish citizen #Brexit 
I support this Promo as it reflects the 17 million who voted for #Brexit ! The idea that one Party #UKIP owns #brexit is FAKE NEWS The 17 million people of Britain voted to take control of their Country & Future

Of all the bad arguments about #Brexit, “Vote for this and stop arguing, because people are bored” has got to be the worst. It’s the equivalent of, “I agree with you son, studying for A-levels is boring. Don’t bother. I mean it’s only your future.”

Nineteen months of #Brexit wrangling - and that's just a taster 
This has been brewing for a long time. This is real, it is dangerous and it is on our doorstep. That's why we need to stick together and why the #EU matters. And that's why #Brexit is a historical aberration. 
#Paris riots, #Gaza conflict, tear gassing on US-Mexico border, cholorine gas attack in #Syria, #Yemen, #Brexit chaos in #UK/#EU and now #Ukraine crisis. Conditions are ripe for players to take advantage of chaos/busy news cycle to conduct geopolitical blitzes. Be ready. Syria
Every MP who says they won’t vote for the PM’s #Brexit Deal needs to be asked immediately “But will you vote against it?” Opposing the Deal through abstention, rather than through opposition, could be the thing that allows it to get it through.
Now that the #Brexit circus begins to wrap up, some of the world's most influential business leaders have called on the EU to go for climate neutrality in a landmark new strategy due for publication on Wednesday 
Sorry, @Jeremy_Hunt, but your job security isn't our top priority.It's the thousands of Welsh jobs now at risk from your #Brexit deal.It's clear we're not going to get the "exact same benefits" so we're saying #NotMyBrexit and demanding a #PeoplesVote.
The UK says an agreement on fish isn't part of the post-Brexit trade deal. President Macron suggests it is. Which means we are in for a row about the meaning of "within" in paragraph 75 of the political declaration. (75 is the new 50 for #Brexit watchers?) 
A timely reminder from Macron: Those 19 months of #Brexit wrangling were just a taster. My thoughts: 
“I’m not locked in here with you, you’re locked in here with me....” #Brexit

The fact that Theresa May is now demanding a TV Debate with Corbyn re. #Brexit shows she considers him her greatest asset. If a TV debate goes ahead, it must also include other political figures--not just two Brexiters.
8. "A voice for free trade" - by leaving the World's largest free trade alliance? Seriously?!#WTO isn't waiting for us. 20 countries have already lodged objections against us, inclu. key allies like USA & Oz. Argentina is rubbing its hands in glee. #Brexit diminishes our voice.

It’s time to reclaim the language. When May and  the media talk about ‘the people’ they really mean ‘some of the people’. SoThe will of some of the peopleWhat some of the British people want.2 little words make all the difference.#Brexit 
As long as there are millions of people glued to the box every night in Britain, watching crap and even discussing it on #socialmedia as if it matters, Big Brother can do pretty much anything. That was why selling #Brexit down the river was a piece of cake.
The @theresa_may argument that if MPs voted for her deal we would be able to move on from #Brexit and get a life is disingenuous. We would have years more of this ahead, with all the hard detail still to come.

Perhaps when all the newspapers, the BBC and every single Tory brexiter admits that #Brexit is stupid, and then 60% of voters agree with them, Labour Leadership will find the courage & integrity to say it as well 
#Brexit..how many times have we watched the great Conservative custodians of the Union empty the benches when Northern Ireland question time got underway? How often did you hear @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @BorisJohnson et al preoccupying themselves down the years with NI’s well-being?
So why not ask them @Royston_Smith ? We finally know what #Brexit looks like & no other deal can realistically be negotiated. Now the public can weigh up the risks and benefits of the actual deal as opposed to Brexit fantasy so let’s give them a #PeoplesVote
#EUSummit - European Socialists underline that #Brexit decision “can be reversed if the UK was to change its mind.” :  via @TheProgressives

I don't want to be in a political union with those doing massive natural gas deals with Russia whilst underfunding NATO and planning a pan-continental army. May is entrenching our defence policy within an expansionist group of corrupt megalomaniacs.#Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
In response to the @Conservatives' deliberately misleading and outright untruthful graphic regarding their #Brexit deal, we've decided to make our own. We the people want to leave the EU *completely* and restore Britain's status as an independent and self-governing nation.

Hey #Remainers please READ  before you dismiss as rubbish. I loathe and blame the lot of you for sabotaging the country's democratic #Brexit. 
2/ Dear @CarolineFlintMP are you really happy supporting a #Brexit narrowly won with the aid of a torrent of lies and hate propaganda, against the EU, refugees and migrants spouted by the tax-dodging #Brexit billionaire press? 
Today was a truly momentous day in the #Brexit process... they’ve finally published proper CONTENTS PAGES for the Withdrawal Agreement! H/t @nvonwestenholz (thanks to all those who provided homemade ones in the interim)
Has anyone sacrificed more than people of NI in defending our precious Union. Men like Nigel Dodds who was almost murdered by IRA visiting his seriously ill child in hospital. Yet May has audacity to try and buy us off to further appease Brussels masters. What an insult! #Brexit
It is logical that May refused to express regret re: #Brexit .But when the PM of a country I admire so much is at pains to stress that she doesn‘t feel any kind of sorrow about parting ways with long-standing allies&friends,I can‘t  help myself: this feels personal. And it hurts.
Write to your MP today to tell them you're #NotBuyingIt. No one wants this dodgy #Brexit deal. Demand a #PeoplesVote:
Correct We want @theresa_may to stand aside, so that we can appoint a leader of the Conservative Party who will honour the Conservative Party manifesto promise to #LEAVE the EU, SM & CU, every current Tory MP stood for the HOC on in the 2017GE.We must deliver #Brexit promise!
I support #PeoplesVote. I support A50 being revoked. I support the EU ref being nullified. I support parliament overturning #Brexit. I support TM cancelling it. I support someone ousting TM and cancelling it. I don't give a shit HOW it's stopped - I just want it stopped.#Remain
Is @theresa_may a victim of misogyny? @junesarpong thinks she's had it tough.But @RachelSJohnson says the problem is that she can't deliver #Brexit #ThePledge

Scotland will pay £7billion before 2022 for a bad Brexit deal we didn't vote for. That could build 120,000 council houses (3,636 in every council area in Scotland.) The price we're paying for this bad #Brexit could literally solve the housing crisis.#DissolveTheUnion#indyref2

I'll tell you right now, I will be f*cking furious if the red Tories come out and vote with the rest of the Tory scoundrels for this shitfest of a #Brexit deal. Theresa May has f*cked over every single person who voted, both Leave and Remain.
So @EU_Commission becomes the first EU  institutional account above the 1M follower mark. Proud of my team! Thank you all for following us! Stay tuned for some cool threads and videos tomorrow.PS We will remember this #Brexit #euco for a couple of reasons now...
Somewhat ironic that literally the only person who has gone on record as saying he likes Theresa May's deal - is the Prime Minister of Spain.#Brexit
'The PM has won the backing of the EU27' you say Sajid.Not surprised as most of it is in their best interest, and most certainly NOT in the best interests of the UK.The majority of the UK electorate suspect the EU27 wrote most of the WA.PM's WA deal does not deliver #Brexit

If this, or any other, #Brexit deal ever makes it through parliament, then #fakenews, the far right and #CambridgeAnalytica will have won.If we have a #PeoplesVote based on the real facts now available to the public, then democracy will have won.It's as simple as that.
So glad the @f1 season is over so we can get back to #BrexitChaos #BrexitDeal #brexit #f1 
It’s not. Nigel knows it’s not. Nigel is knowingly misleading those that still listen to the DUPs #Brexit analysis

Ok, I’ve spent some time thinking about Theresa May’s #Brexit deal, and I think I can sum up my thoughts briefly as follows:Fuck you.Fuck your deal.#StopBrexit#PeoplesVote
The good thing to come out of the betrayal of #Brexit is that only a total fool would still believe in the fairy tales about the democratically elected #parliament and independent #judiciary and free and impartial #media All the parties to this treachery have blown their cover.
2/ As with the impact assessments, the government is first lying and then trying to conceal information absolutely fundamental to #Brexit being a democratic process. Consider how much faster the Remain campaign would have developed had these facts been known earlier.
Our sovereignty was the most important thing in #Brexit for me. We’re not going to achieve that with May’s deal or get our waters back! Time to go WTO, reinstate our borders and have the Royal Navy protect the interests of our fishermen, if necessary!
1/ A huge & largely ignored #Brexit scandal. The single most important fact about Article 50 is whether it is revocable. The government first lied about this, and since then has been trying to prevent the information being known.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Now put your letter in to replace her!"It doesn't matter how you look at it.You can squint with one eye, or stand upside down, or peer at it askew.It makes no difference.From every angle, on every basis, Theresa May's deal is horrific”#Brexit
Today is a sad day. It isnt a day for celebration but a day to reflect upon what an absolute tragedy #Brexit is. It has divided people across these islands, it has fuelled division & isolation.And for what? We still don't know. All we know is that we are poorer for leaving the EU
@Harryslaststand, I've been listening to you all day #IStandWithHarry #Brexit #PeoplesVote #EU
To all MPs - If you believe that what our PM is doing is wrong then you need to stand up, put your head above the parapet & do something about it.If not, you are nothing more than a spineless coward who doesn’t deserve to represent the people.#Brexit
JC Juncker tells me he doesn’t understand negative reax of many MP’s to #Brexit deal. Says EU respected U.K. voters decision to leave and listened to priorities of U.K. negotiators. Says the deal ‘is not a humiliation for the UK’
"This is the only deal possible" - After almost two years negotiating with the UK, EU leaders sign off controversial #Brexit deal
Dear @theresa_may, thank you for your letter asking for the UK to support your #Brexit deal. The answer is no. Many of us have asked you repeatedly to ascertain the will of the people in a #PeoplesVote. You have constantly denied us this, so don't ask us to support you now.
Gold  Star for the British Press the only ones who still care at the #EU #Brexit Summit 
Read this thread - already all the confident , arrogant #Brexit UK assertions are being revealed as hollow when confronted by the new reality of one versus 27….   British exceptionalism counts for nothing . 
"What's on the table is the only deal that's on the table"Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says there is no "plan B" when it comes to the draft #Brexit withdrawal agreement 
“Tragic” “No victors” “A sad moment” - sums up #EUCO European Council on #Brexit “deal”. But it doesn’t have to be this way - time for Parliament and the people to take back control now with a @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay 
Much as it pains me to say this, the UK we thought we were fighting for is not the land we are today fighting for after this final #EUCO capitulation. We have 14 days to re-frame the #Brexit vote
As I was saying earlier, the risk that #Brexit tears Labour apart is *at least as high* as it does the Tories. What an utter, utter mess.
.Here we go, BBC has started showing Battle of Britain WW2 films today !To remind us all of our finest hour! Wonder how many more will be scheduled along side PM May trying to sell her #Brexit Rubbish Deal ! 
Yesterday our members held a #PeoplesVote stall in the South Cambridgeshire village of Bassingbourn, and the #Brexitometer result was clear! Looks like they agree with @heidiallen75 that we can do a lot better than #Brexit! 
Judging by Twitter's reaction to #BackTheBrexitDeal, it looks like Theresa May has successfully united the country behind her #Brexit deal. Everyone hates it.
There is a clear realignment across UK, and fundamentally within English politics -- it's time for a new force to represent the unrepresented in #Brexit #EUCO
They know it’s not #Brexit Just going for a half way house trying to keep Remainers happy! A ‘compromise ‘. What’s the point in having a referendum if the Government who promised to act on the result are not going to fulfill that promise? #Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
@theresa_may has given up Northern Ireland, traded away Gibraltar and chucked Scotland's fish back into #EUCO waters. She has betrayed 17.4 million #Brexit votes
The tapping away of tomorrow’s newspapers being written - the British hacks at work - #Brexit 
It seems crystal clear after today's #EUCO that England -- I say that with precision -- is going to have to find itself pretty damned quick if the #Brexit it voted for is to happen
With respect, they’ve sold their souls to the EU, along with @theresa_may.MPs who approve this dreadful Withdrawal Agreement must justify their betrayal of our sovereignty to the electorate.What I don’t understand is how Mrs May has convinced herself this is #Brexit at all.
We’re used to government lies but this must be up there with the best of them – #Brexit will not secure the #NHS, on the contrary it is likely to be the ruin of it. What a load of bollocks. We need a vote with #InformedConsent #PeoplesVote
The Tories' awful #Brexit deal is 'the ONLY deal possible.'This was ALWAYS the case.By sniffling on about a general election, Labour have shut themselves & us out in the cold. A weak, cowardly party - concerned more with protecting votes than protecting the country. 
In addition to our own activities we’ve supported many others where possible, including several marches, rallies, SODEM, an all-night vigil and 4 days of #EUCitizensChampion campaigning. We will continue to fight for an end to the #Brexit madness.   /15 
#Brexit deal is 'a funeral masquerading as a baptism.' Clear-eyed and convincing prediction: It is already doomed. Here’s how the Christmas meltdown could play out @MatthewdAncona
Next we returned to Brussels to speak to a member of the EU's A50 Taskforce about citizens’ rights post #Brexit and we discovered just how bad the situation will be. We also lobbied several more MEPs about citizens' rights and found a lot of support for our work.   /11 
#Brexit was never going to make those figures better. Do not bleat about the poor and vulnerable when you have consistently supported a right wing policy to make them poorer and more vulnerable. Brexit was always going to hurt and it will hurt those groups the most! #PeoplesVote
On 18th May we wrote to 469 UK newspapers, providing them with evidence of the impact of #Brexit on ordinary people. We have yet to receive a single reply about these human interest stories. So much for taking our campaign to local newspapers!    /8 
The logic of the Government’s ‘deal’; ‘We present to you, the British people, a polished turd. We must embrace this turd, because the alternative is an unpolished turd’. How about flushing the chain & deploying some bleach. #Brexit
A terrible mistake? Another referendum? An acceptable deal? We asked some Londoners what they think after EU leaders endorsed the #Brexit deal today: 
So says the Arch #Remainer #JamesBrokenshire a #Tory #Minister who did not vote for, does not believe in or who wants #Brexit! Telling us all to behave and support @theresa_may's SH*T DEAL! No Thanks James we in the @Conservatives want a #NODEAL! #MayMustGo #ChuckMay @DCBMEP

Nigel Farage - "PM May is trying to please everybody. Philip Hammond made that very clear yesterday."She wants to please Leavers and Remainers, and in doing so, I think she’s signing up to a halfway house never never land, which really doesn’t make anybody very happy." #Brexit 
 Anti-Brexit campaigners from ⁦@OFOCBrexit⁩ burnt and binned copies of the #Brexit withdrawal agreement outside the EU HQ today. 
The biggest news of the day has nothing to do with #Brexit. While the world's media is distracted by EU leaders' latest purely symbolic meeting in Brussels, #Russia unlawfully blocks the Kerch Strait, effectively seizing the entire Sea of Azov and trapping S.E. coast of #Ukraine.
While the UK is embroiled in its #Brexit act of self-harm, dragging the rest of the #EU with it, #Russia is raising the temperature in its war with #Ukraine, & no-one is paying attention. #SeaofAzov remains international waters; perhaps #NATO should carry out some #FONOPs there.
It seems that @JosepBorrellF and @FabianPicardo are still saying the opposite, as are @theresa_may and @sanchezcastejon. The whole thing is a bit of a farce as the #Brexit ‘agreement’ as it stands probably won’t get through Parliament anyway ... 
There’s been lots of talk on Gibraltar & Northern Ireland but there’s no mention of Scotland - our views have been completely ignored, says @IanBlackfordMP on @SkyNews now #Brexit

After this #Brexit fiasco is there anyone out there who still believes the Tory Party is anything other than a bunch of lying, deceitful, xenophobic self servers. Let's hope #Brexit and the chaos it brings will see the end of them. For Scots only hope now is independence.

Dear Tory whips, the answer to this is very simple; pass #Brexit deal as written. Add a separate amendment that states that if at the end of two years, no technical solution is agreed by the EU, the UK withdraws from the Customs Union by withdrawing from this deal. Job done.

I'm on Virgin Media at 4.30pm discussing #Brexit and why people are not feeling the recovery. 
Why are people worrying about Theresa May’s #Brexit deal? It isn’t going to happen because it won’t get through Parliament. The worry is whether we end up with a “no deal” versus a General Election versus a #PeoplesVote. I’m hoping desperately for the later
Well said. Echoes my own sentiments. Sad that it’s come to this but we need to move on and try to minimise the downsides of #Brexit for all concerned. 
Not exactly a shock, but interesting Corbyn has telegraphed his intention. Combined w Tory Brexiteers there are more than enough votes to defeat the deal. Hard #Brexit it is.  
How are you all getting on with my great idea of #brexit ? 
I wonder when the high majority, in post Tory MPs who've been *told* to promote this farce of a #Brexit deal, will take notice of what people are telling them, & realise that they are shockingly out of touch with those who elected them.#StandUp4Brexit

Dear @theresa_may, your “Back the Brexit Deal” letter Is like something Donald Trump would write, like blaming immigration on the financial troubles of this country, rather than pointing out the massive tax avoidance and evasion schemes, which cost the UK £34bn per year. #Brexit
.@JunckerEU speaking to @BBCkatyaadler #Brexit   “This is THE deal - the only deal possible.” 
Good decision reached by #EU27 on #Brexit deal, although I would have preferred UK staying as part of EU, this is the best outcome under the circumstances. We need speedy ratification to provide clarity for our citizens. Hope to build close partnership between EU and UK in future

EU citizens in the UK are on average far better educated than their native counterparts & have higher rates of employment. The idea that EU migrants are a burden is a shameless lie peddled to obtain #Brexit by appealing to simplistic thinking and prejudice.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
What @Theresa_May needs to know, is that 2.5yrs ago, 1/3 of the voting population chose ‘some kind of #Brexit’, ranging from BINO to a complete break. Now, the majority *WISH TO REMAIN*, & almost 80% want a #PeoplesVote with that as an option. Democracy DEMANDS a PV! #fbpe #govuk

Most countries including Switzerland are not signing up to the UN migration pact. @theresa_may and the @Conservatives despite you trying to hoodwink the public over #Brexit we will not allow you to sneak this under the radar either. We as a country should not sign up to it.
2 new words (“build on”) added late in the day make the fishing part of the final Political Declaration even worse for those who believed Tory promises - they indicate that far from rolling back the current situation it is to be used as the basis for future agreement #Brexit
Why does Leotard always say there's no Plan B, like it's a good thing?It's his job to have a Plan B and indeed C, D and E if necessary. #Brexit, Brussels. 
The one good thing to come out of #brexit is it has shown us all what a useless bunch of lying politicians the UK has....
UK PM May gives a briefing after EU agrees #Brexit deal, saying: - it is the "best deal"- it gives control of the border and UK's own money - no second referendum will be launched 
Gee, why won’t #Brexit bad boy Nigel Farage answer questions about his ties with Roger Stone, Alex Jones, Julian Assange, and #Russia?Could it be that he’s afraid to expose his #treason against the UK along with his key role in #TrumpRussia?
So true, its just very sad.#Brexit

I actual feel sick, this #Brexit negotiation is soul destroying, depressing. Theresa has completely trashed my belief in democracy. . but the hardest fact to swallow is that it's happening here in the United Kingdom.I'm absolutely furious !!

Theresa May repeatedly denying the public a right to vote on a deal they could have had no knowledge about in 2016. It is a grotesque abuse of democracy to allow people to vote on lies and fantasies but not on facts. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit

#Brexit: High Court to rule if referendum vote ‘void’ as early as Christmas after Arron Banks investigation via ⁦@Independent⁩  
Brexit is 3000 hours away. #brexit
Today’s stunt does nothing to change the legal position regarding #Gibraltar,  #Brexit and the future relationship. It’s a piece of political theatre for domestic consumption in Spain. 
#Brexit can and will be stopped. There is time to legislation for it, there’s time for a people’s vote, there time for us to revoke article 50, and there’s time to rethink. Jeremy, May & the rest of the brexiters just want it, which is why they deny this. #PeoplesVoteNow
As 600+ MPs hate May's #Brexit, it is now clearly just the will of one person. A true dictatorship.
Very interesting to see @Telegraph confirming what I have been hearing for weeks - that extension of #Article50 being considered to end the #Brexit chaos - for eg @peoplesvote_uk or GE to take place.

And the absurdity is that with the tailing off of pent up demand to migrate and faster economic growth in Eastern Europe, the migration surge from Eastern Europe is naturally ending. So there is isn't even a bogus reason left for #Brexit.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Pretty decent here from Charles Moore. #Brexit MP’s must stand firm in Withdrawal Agreement votes. Britain’s future is at stake in avoiding ‘vassalage’. NI backstop is key. Sign this & our country is defunct as sovereign. ⁦#StandUp4Brexit 
Goodness me “strong and stable” has only gone and sold The Rock! #Brexit
Once we’ve quashed #Brexit, we can oust this, the worst government of the 21st century, and begin fixing the issues they’ve caused. First though, we get that #PeoplesVote, and end this farce once and for all.
In a nutshell, Spain - which slams #Gibraltar as an anachronistic "colony" - attempts to colonise it using #Brexit
Listen to the arrogance of the EU considering what happens if the Withdrawal Deal is rejected by Parliament: They could "change the staples or the colour of the paper".So glad we're leaving such a corrupt, antidemocratic and bullying organisation #brexit
The great @omid9 explains the reality behind #Brexit

DUP MP Nigel Dodds - "Theresa May’s #Brexit plan is the worst of all worlds. It doesn’t please Remainers or Brexiteers."It is worse than staying in, because you’re taking all the rules and laws and dictate or Europe, you pay £39bn and you don’t have a say at the table.” 
PODCAST: Theresa May delivered a highly flawed compromise on #Brexit. @Breakingviews explains what could come next 
It's a very bad look that @NadineDorries fake concern over the non-concession on #Gibraltar #Brexit is being boosted by Russian bots. I'd urge MI5 to investigate her, but I'm sure they already are.  
Lord Trimble - "The thing no-one talks about is that we don't have to do a deal with the EU. "It's not accurate to call it a no-deal scenario, because you'd be operating under WTO principles. Being in the EU is not profitable." #Brexit 
Just got this through my door.A touch extreme surely, even for the most committed of #Brexit devotees.Leaving the world seems rather over the top.

There is no “success” in #Brexit.  It is a failure in vision, politics, policy , statecraft and democracy.   And we haven’t “worked as a nation” - a small group has imposed its will, fraudulently.

Absolutely. And it will potentially hurt all of us in ways no one understood at the time. Please take a look at these videos that show how much #Brexit will hurt ordinary people. 
Boris Johnson promoted the message on the #Brexit bus "We send the EU £350 million a week, let's fund our NHS instead". Did this message influence you to vote Leave?
In chess there's a saying: "Weak players look at the pieces, strong players look at the board." UK politics is obsessed with pieces. No one seems to care about the board. #Brexit is not only a social, economic, cultural catastrophe, it is also a geopolitical blunder.

"The fact is the People cannot be sold to anymore by this tired political class – social media has made the average Brit that much more politically savvy – the consequence of May’s lies can only be the continued shredding of her reputation." #csm #brexit

Theresa May says her Brexit will be a "different sort" of relationship with the EU. A BMW and a Trabant are "different sorts" of cars. One is very much better than the other. #Brexit #bbcnews
I learnt hard Left Lexiteers @LiverpoolGuild are a heartless lot who refuse to show #Solidarity with @The3Million I asked for show of hands on whether EU migrants living/working in UK & paying tax should have had a say in their future? Most disagreed #Brexit

It angers how much those in power are getting away with. Here & across the atlantic, there's corruption in plain sight & nothing is being done. May's chosen to knight John Hayes - an arch brexiteer - as she rallies for votes. Its brazen corruption & needs to be condemned #Brexit
Westminster political system is having a nervous breakdown ... Listening to #bbcaq, like #bbcqt on TV last night, and again they know what to do but they can't - hence stuck in #BrexitShambles #Brexit
Never known such a weak opposition. Remain would get around 60% of vote in a new Ref.. Its why Brexiters are running scared of one. #Brexit 
DELUSIONAL: Leave would win again if fresh referendum held on Brexit, Diane Abbott says  / #EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote
1. May's #Brexit deal is the worst possible deal because it's less about delivering Brexit as it is electoral triangulation - and trying to please everyone always ends up pleasing nobody. Thread...
I'm one of the lucky ones. I have dual nationality, so after #Brexit I will be British when in the UK and Italian when in the EU. No loss of rights. It will take three years, but my wife and kids can become Italian, too. 1/4
How do you commit the crime of the century and get away with it?Simple, #Brexit and steal FOM from 65 million people in one foul swoop.
The BBC are really going all out to promote Theresa May & her pure banter of a #Brexit deal. Radio 1 ran a story today about a young Lady taking a trip to Belgium to 'Help Theresa May with Brexit'. AS IF!You need to pack it in @BBC. I can't feel sorry for Monsters.

The UK always had control of its money, borders, laws, and influenced EU trade policies as it sat at the top table. And it had a good economy.#Brexit costs £39 Billion and there's no return for the money.

The ideological project for a United States of Europe continues at an alarming pace. #Merkel says:"patriotism is the exact opposite of nationalism because nationalism is treason!" States will give up sovereignty to include foreign affairs, migration, and fiscal resources. #Brexit 
The EU has taken the Tory Gov for idiots & mugs.#Brexit was all about taking back control & we have ended up giving MORE control to the EU.Not only that, we will be tied into the EU for evermore with no exit door &N. Ireland split away from the rest of the UK.#Unbelievable
There’s a lot of uncertainty around #Brexit, what will happen next, what May’s plan B and so on. May had the opportunity to clear that up on her BBC phone in. Here’s some of the hard hitting questions the BBC asked to get that clarity for us all...#BrokenMedia
Get the facts about the #Brexit deal with our new blog 
Theresa May, you are abusing the British people & undermining democracy with your lies. The majority want a #PeoplesVote and to stop #Brexit. Why are you denying a public the democratic right to vote now they have much more information than in 2016?
Why would anyone seriously be in favour of taking away their own right to travel, work, live and love in 27 other countries Maybe it’s just me but I find it absolutely baffling - who supports taking away their own rights?#FreeMovement #BrexitDeal #TheresaMay #Brexit
#Brexit It looks increasingly unlikely May will get her #WithdrawlAgreement through the HoC. The EU has said no more negotiating.If it is voted down in the HoC, will she resign, go for a PV or a GE?Not what you want but what she will do...
The Govt gave the public a binary decision on a massive constitutional issue. Then, because they didn't get the answer they wanted, they embark on a huge anti #Brexit PR campaign to try to force another vote rather than implement the decision. And you think that's democracy? 
"The most important point about the draft #Brexit withdrawal agreement is that, once it is ratified, the UK will have no legal route out of it unless the #EU agrees to let us out & replace it with another agreement."This is not Brexit#StandUp4Brexit

The “only” unresolved issue ahead of #Brexit summit is Gibraltar (though Madrid and Downing Street working on it). My thoughts on how we got here: 
Robert Peston claims that an increasing number of MPs are saying that the only option is to stay in the EU...and for the first time he thinks there is a real prospect that we end up staying in the EU.I agree. That’s why MPs must #VoteDownTheDeal#brexit
Thanks to @Femi_Sorry for helping us to highlight how Northern Ireland may have been ignored in 2016, but the voices of young people are shouting ever louder, and they want a final say #PeoplesVote #brexit 
It is the duty of every Member of Parliament to do what is right for our country, to make it better, to improve people's lives. You failed to do that which is why we ended up with #Brexit, don't fail us again by making Brexit happen, it is not in the best interests of our country
#Brexit is bumping into two European past conflicts, Ireland and Gibraltar. A way of reminding us that in Europe, a painful history is never far away and that the EU has been created to obliterate these “scars”.

It was a grave error @Nigel_Farage to prematurely demobilise after the referendum result. The fighting was still continuing and was to intensify over the next two years. UKIP opened its gates to the barbarians and quickly became unfit for purpose. It is a dead parrot. #Brexit

Kudos to @faisalislam & team @SkyNews: the Rubik’s Cube of #Brexit. Brilliant piece of storytelling. 
What #Brexit has givilen us is a real insight of how EU institutionalised the establishment & media has become, entrenched & ingrained into the very heart of parliament & how far these people will go to preserve it against the wishes of the British people
I dont know how you think you have bragging rights about your deal (not the democratic result the people of Great Britain wanted) on twitter. Your deal would make #GreatBritain become just Britain. Hang your head in shame women. You failed us all #Leavers & #Remainers #Brexit
#May says the #EU won’t give us a better deal than hers. Yes they will, it’s called not leaving at all. A #PeoplesVote to give the people the #FinalSay on #Brexit is still on the cards, if we #ExitFromBrexit now we can #Remain and keep our bespoke status.
So @BorisJohnson @DominicRaab @johnredwood & Ian Duncan Smith all voted leave, but now they see this #brexit deal (which is the only brexit available) they have changed their minds. You might say they are #RemainerNow It's ok to change your mind when facts change.#PeoplesVote

When the EU Referendum delivered #Brexit it was a shock to the whole corrupt political system in Britain where all political parties were serving the City of London but ignoring ordinary people. All of a sudden the spotlight was on crooked politicians enriching themselves.
Our party has nothing to offer Scotland or its fishing industry. It's shameful that spineless talking heads can't even be trusted to resign when #brexit sells out Scottish interests. 
Brilliant!#NoDeal is a scary word that Remoaners use to divert people from the concept behind it. And the concept is simple: just #Leave the EU, get back to how things were before we joined the bloc.#Brexit #BrexitShambles #FridayMotivation
“Would we be better off if we'd stayed in the EU or will we be better off with your deal?"Theresa May tells caller Michael her #Brexit deal will leave the UK better off because “our future is in our hands and that’s what’s important”.#BBCAskThis | @EmmaBarnett | @BBCNews
With pro #Brexit MPs wriggling our of the woodwork to acknowledge #Remaining in the EU is better than May's fudge, why aren't they now clamouring for a #PeoplesVote.We need someone high profile to break ranks and start the avalanche.
Who made the @EUCouncil the headmaster? Who knows what this #Brexit deal is? What did we agree to in the first place and how deep is the next hole?

Conflating a clean #Brexit with chaos and disorder has been a deliberate linguistic device used by the Government to influence their argument. A No-Deal Brexit would only be chaotic or disorderly should we not prepare adequately, another indictment of the Government’s approach.

Dominic Raab, staying in the EU is better than the May deal because in the former at least we had control over our laws/regulations, you couldn't make it up, #Brexit was always about xenophobia/hatred and a fast buck for the vulture capitalists such as Rees-Mogg etc #r4today
For those still maintaining that Ireland will want to leave too post #Brexit, just remember the last poll here put leave at just 7%, lowest across Europe 
Going ahead with #Brexit means selling out #Gibraltar:
Commentators & journalists cite the #GardenBridge, #watercannon, #Brexit, cable cars, #policecuts etc as part of #BorisJohnson 's political legacy but the £1billion loss to our economy per year due to his approval of the demolition of #earlscourt is hardly mentioned.

Quite legitimate for Remainers to criticise May’s #Brexit agreement. We lose a lot of influence via EU and don’t gain much else. It is a bit rich for #Brexiteers to criticise it, however. Any #Brexit deal has to be pragmatic, and a No Deal scenario would be economic suicide.

How Spain can veto Brexit.The withdrawal agreement (WA) is to be adopted by the EU27 with a qualified majority. The declaration on the future EU-UK relation however requires unanimity and without a declaration on the future there will be no WA. #eudk #Brexit

Two years of failing to oppose. Two years of aiding and abetting and facilitating Mrs May’s @theresa_may inevitable #Brexit train wreck. If only you had done your job and opposed Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn. This is on you too.
The rotten state of Britain: Brexit has exposed a deep rooted political dysfunction - and it's worse than we thought. #Brexit 
Remaining in the EU? If only. That would be the sensible option having seen the whites of #brexit's eyes. I just hope that the UK is mature enough to realise it made a mistake.
Was speaking to my not at all political sister about Brexit and she said “I thought we left that two years ago, wasn’t there that vote”People outside of Westminster fed up with shenanigans and just want us to get on and get out #bbcqt #brexit
3rd time I've seen a Labour front bencher try to explain the Labour #Brexit sequence and "we'll get a better deal" & they've been laughed at each timeIt's not working, they just look shiftyLabour need to find a better position, the only option left is a #PeoplesVote & Remain
#BBCqtGrumbles & boos in the audience for the 5 #Brexit panelists biggest cheer of the night was for a #PeoplesVote Is it too much to ask that @BBC starts to reflect the growing majority who are sick of this and want a chance to stop #Brexit? Where are the Remain panelists?
#Brexit  how dare you threaten UK over Gibraltar's democratic vote to be British. Britain did not veto Spain Joining EU while unfit. Ukip Scotland will back Catalans, Basques and Morrocco re Ceuta&Melilia against Spanish Empire. Two can play that game 
#bbcqt No sleep is better than a bad sleep #Brexit 
The Commons is packed with cowards. Let them be warned, the Remain majority will grow relentlessly and if they drive #brexit through without a #PeoplesVote we will destroy their careers & ensure the worst are locked up. #StopBrexit
#TommyRobinson has his mojo back. to film "Rape of Britain"organizing a demo Dec. for #Brexit
"If we've discovered what we all thought we were voting for, was not what we were going to get, shouldn't we have a 2nd Ref". #Brexit #bbcqt
#BBCQT Go on @labourlewis! The only person with vision and courage on the the panel! Keep going. #Labour are the only ones who know how to get us through this #Brexit mess! Get @jeremycorbyn and @Keir_Starmer in the cockpit! Nobody else can do this. We all know this.
First to map out their predictions on our Brexit explainer board is Stephen Bush from the New Statesman@stephenkb | #newsnight | #Brexit 
How will Brexit progress from here? LBC's Iain Dale gives his take@IainDale | #newsnight | #Brexit 
Most Tory MPs, like Karen Bradley has just done, will talk about #Brexit in terms of “anyone who has done any negotiations will know...” I have yet to see any evidence that Karen, David Davis, Raab, Barclay, Fox et al have ever successfully negotiated anything #bbcqt
My statement to @gibparl on the finalisation of negotiation work on the MoUs and Tax Treaty pursuant to our return from Madrid this week! #Brexit.  #Gibraltar.
#Brexit @peston "For the first time I think the UK may well stay in the EU. It is not just what MPs are telling me but European capitals, too". @itvnews at Ten. #Bong
Both #Brexit options mean lost jobs, more damage to our economy and a sharpening of austerity.The only option that avoids all this self inflicted damage?A #PeoplesVote with the option to #Remain in the EU.
#Brexit vote was a peaceful revolution, #BrexitBetrayal could have dire consequences #bbcqt
You’ve been played @cbicarolyn - better to admit it. Every #Brexit scenario causes loss of wealth, opportunity + potential for our citizens and businesses. There is no majority for no deal. We don’t have to settle for worst of all worlds. Britain deserves better. @peoplesvote_uk
So the cost of #Brexit is now clear. We’re impoverishing our country so that Europeans can’t live here (and we can’t live there). And so foreign funded think tanks have more control over the U.K. #greatdeal
This emphasises how stopping #Brexit is fortunately for so many people above party.@LibDems like @SFejfer & myself happily campaign alongside Tories like @Anna_Soubry & Lab members like @mikegalsworthy Anyone wanting #PeoplesVote #FinalSay #ExitFromBrexit & #Remain is my friend
Critically important British business gives honest opinion on PMs #Brexit agreements.  ‘It’s not a good deal’: Email reveals doubts within the CBI about Theresa May's draft Brexit agreement - ITV News.   
THIS.#Brexit will wreck the #NHS. Watch just one episode of #Ambulance, then try telling anyone that leaving the EU is what the UK really needs.#PeoplesVote
Round of applause due to @Channel4News for giving voice to EU citizens and their children living in #Brexit limbo 
Ok ...This reminds me of when the Greek and the Italian PMs held the signing of David Cameron’s (I’ll-fated) EU renegotiation deal hostage until they got an audience with leaders of France and Germany to discuss the Greek debt crisis and immigration crisis #Brexit 
Nothing to see here. (It turns out, other countries have national interests too.) #Brexit. 
Well only an idiot would not see this coming. Was Baldrick doing drafting with Raab? Going bring back Walter Raleigh &Francis Drake from dead to get Brexit agreed with Spain? This ##, fiasco, costing UK billions is a conservative party production.  #Brexit 
Anybody celebrating the end of free movement of people should consider this. Think of the last time you were at a hospital. I guarantee that more than one of the brilliant #NHS employees treating you or your relative was a "foreigner". How will we replace these heroes? #Brexit
So unless I'm much mistaken, the "impartial" BBC has one Leaver against four Remainers on tonight's Question Time, in a constituency (Cannock Chase) where 68.5% of people voted for #Brexit – you have to laugh!  #FairAndBalanced #BBCQT
If the draft “deal” is already agreed ahead of Sunday ‘s #Summit , then what is the point of #TheresaMay’s much vaunted #brexit talks with Juncker scheduled for Saturday?
**VOTE & RETWEET POLL**Given the current #Brexit situation -How likely is a #PeoplesVote?
Met @Peston this evening, absolute gent and #Brexit expert.Said he doesn't meet too many friendly Irish men on Downing Street  
Want to know why ABE exist? Below are a series of leaked emails from the #CBI showing they privately think the #WithdrawalAgreement is a terrible deal too. Yet they do what the government tell them. We do not.Retweet the hell out of this. #brexit
A packed @OpenBritainShrp event at Shrewsbury kicks off with @MadeleinaKay performing. @mikegalsworthy & @Anna_Soubry to come.The turnout shows how much public mood in Shropshire is shifting to support a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay on #Brexit so we can #ExitFromBrexit & #Remain
"It's not a good deal." No support from business or Parliament for this dodgy #brexit deal. #PeoplesVote: 
Now more ministers are lining up to admit a #PeoplesVote #Brexit referendum is a real possibility.They might think it’s a threat, many will hope it’s a promise.A #FinalSay with an option to #Remain should lead to an #ExitFromBrexit

Hang on, isn't your Magic Grandpa's position on #Brexit that we have go ahead with it to appease the far right? Utter hypocrisy. 
Hello, the UK here. Our PM is stuck in maybot mode and is repeating over and over again that her deal delivers on the #brexit vote even though absolutely nobody likes it. Please send help x
I'm preparing for a no deal #brexit. I've bought loads of tins of baked beans and jars of jam. I'm a war baby. I was brought up on beans on toast and jam sandwiches and can do it again. Bring it on.
Corbyn’s betrayal of #Brexit – a cause he has believed in his entire political life – is shameful. If he were to get his wish for a General Election, no left democrat should countenance voting for Labour’s Brexit betrayers, writes Mick Hume.

BREAKING: Here are all the 88 Tory MPs who have indicated so far that they won't vote for Theresa May's #Brexit deal.This list consists of both Leave and Remain Tory MPs. All 10 DUP MPs are also expected to vote against the deal. 
No #Brexit Better than No DealBetter than a bad deal which is actually no deal at all.No Brexit is the best dealBest for the countryBest for the peopleIt's not rocket science.
"Young people would like to be listened to in this debate" - @JustineGreening Precisely. It is our generation that will have to live with the consequences of #Brexit. Will other MPs on all sides put country before party and support a @peoplesvote_uk? #C4PV
Why does May keep saying she's delivering #Brexit for the people of the UK, that is a lie. Only 17 million that voted for it, so she's delivering it for a minority, not for 'the people'. Oh and hundreds of thousands of those #Brexit voters have since died !
If the Prime Minister is so confident her #Brexit deal is best for the UK, why is she against a @peoplesvote_uk? The #WithdrawalAgreement & #PoliticalDeclaration don't add up to the #Brexit we were promised, so it is only right that people get a #finalsay. @BestForBritain
Biggest turnout to vote for #Brexit and Chancellor Merkel says give up your sovereignty NO we voted to get it back control our finances,waters,laws it's called democracy!  
When democracy is conducted by means of a referendum treated as mandatory, then the public must be well-informed. That is precondition for the process being democratic. It was not the case in 2016, it is just about so now. To block a #PeoplesVote is to oppose democracy.#Brexit
WATCH: In Wimbledon, people are telling their MP Stephen Hammond MP why they want a #PeoplesVote on this dodgy #Brexit deal.Write to your MP to let them know you're #NotBuyingIt and demand a #PeoplesVote: 
This info was widely available, circulated, (and verified) before the #Brexit referendum, but made no difference then and makes no difference now. 
NEW - Equalities & Rights Page just launched on our  website.  Explains what rights we all enjoy now & which might be gone post #Brexit
.@theresa_may’s tactics now seem to come down to “the people voted to leave” & “the people want it settled”. She’s relying on the public’s extreme weariness with the #Brexit process to drive through a policy which satisfies neither leavers nor remainers & leaves UK less sovereign
I will be there, will you? #BrexitBetrayalMarch#DemocracyBetrayalMarch#Brexit  
Daniel Hannan MEP - "It’s not just that Brussels will control 100% of our trade policy with 0% input. It’s even worse than that. "Our economy would become a bargaining chip to be used by EU negotiators wholly for the benefit of the continental economies." #BrexitDeal #Brexit 
I am agreeing with a Johnson. MPs must not be frightened into voting for the bad deal to prevent a no deal. They must step up and vote for no #Brexit which will prevent both the bad deal AND a no deal Brexit. 
In case you missed Theresa May's latest #Brexit statement: here's where her deal currently sits in Parliament 
Wasn't #Brexit supposed to benefit UK farmers by leaving the CAP?Instead we'll get shit food and poorer farmers @mikegalsworthy @RobertCPalmer13
Peter Bone MP - "So, we are going to be tied into the customs union. Tied into all the laws of that the EU want on trade.“And, I assume, being governed by the European Court on it. It is worse than many people had anticipated." #Brexit #BrexitDeal
The #Brexit FutureRelationship Declaration is just a to-do list that fails to settle key issues, leaving them to be negotiated afterBrexit, from a weaker position.Where it has some clarity, it either rules out UK participation in useful things, or allows it but gives us no say
‘Taking back control’ in its pure form means getting poorer. Many leavers didn’t mind that, which is fine, but nowhere near 17.4m people, as Tory division today makes clear. There is no mandate for any #Brexit. We need @peoplesvote_uk @LibDems
Article 50 can be reversed says Lord Kerr #Brexit 
The rich see an opportunity to become richer.The far Right see an opportunity to spread their hate.Those worst off have been tricked into blaming immigrants &the #EU.The Prime Minister is lying to us.The world wonders what we've become.#Brexit #PeoplesVote #ToriesOut
The current model of British party politics is a busted flush. We need some fresh alternatives. There’s a new anti-Brexit political party @RenewParty offering fresh solutions and creating a new vision for the country. #Brexit #BrexitDeal #Ad #Politics
There she goes again. #Brexit = End of FOM. May thinks this was the only reason people voted for #Brexit. The damn woman is obsessed with it. She's just a thumping great xenophobe who hates foreigners.
Is this the moment Theresa May's #brexit deal really started to unravel?   The declaration on the future relationship with the EU was met with a level of hostility by MPs as yet unseen.  Her #Brexit plan seems truly unloved by  leavers and remainers alike.   But who knows?
I don’t want this #Brexit. Nor do the majority of the country #PeoplesVote
Without #InformedConsent there is no valid consent. We need a #PeoplesVote on the PM’s final deal now that the public can weigh up the risks and benefits of #Brexit reality as opposed to the fantasy Brexit miss-sold during the referendum campaign
Makes me laugh when England say they will be an independent nation again,,, er no yer not and wont be untill you are independent from Scotland . You will just be silly #Brexit separatists 
"What on earth has the government been doing for the last 2 years?"@jeremycorbyn savages @theresa_may's #Brexit Agreement as "26 pages of waffle". 
In the wake of the publication of the draft #PoliticalDeclaration, MPs are questioning the Prime Minister. Find out what the former #Brexit Secretary @DominicRaab asked: 
Leave campaign, 2016: Vote for Brexit. We’ll have a trade deal before Art50. Theresa May, 2017: Vote for Art50. We’ll have a trade deal before the transition. Theresa May, now: Vote for the  transition. We’ll have a trade deal by 2020. The essence of #Brexit: jam tomorrow. 
In betraying #Brexit, Labour has finally abandoned the left’s historical position as champion of democracy. And it has done so, not under the centrist, pro-EU Blair, but under the allegedly left-wing, Eurosceptic Corbyn, writes Mick Hume.
Former #Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab says the Irish backstop "ties the UK to the customs union… with an EU veto over our exit"Theresa May says the backstop will not "automatically" come into play
"We should junk forthwith the backstop" Boris Johnson challenges PM on #Brexit draft agreement 
#Brexit Britain stupidly throwing away the rights, freedom and liberty of EU Freedom of Movement out of a hysterical fear of a temporary migration surge now fading away. A fear whipped up by the lies & hate propaganda of the tax-dodging #Brexit billionaire press.#PeoplesVote
BREAKING - Apparently good news@GavinWilliamson has announced HMS Severn will be reactivated and HMS Mersey and Tyne retained in service for UK waters patrols, in addition to the 5 new batch 2 OPVs. #Brexit Just need to find a few more sailors? 
Reaching this deal wasn’t easy for the EU27 nor for the UK, but it is the best package we could achieve to avoid a no deal scenario. We want to build an ambitious partnership between the EU & the UK after #BREXIT. An orderly withdrawal is the basis for this. 
Jeremy Corbyn labels the #Brexit political declaration a "vague menu of options" and says until Parliament has debated it "there is no UK agreement" with the EU
Other Fishing associations such as @CFAScot and @CreelScff are not part of the SFF as NOT all fishermen, and certainly not all fishing industry, support #Brexit
#Brexit trade deal is "26 pages of waffle", says @jeremycorbyn claiming it "falls short" of Labour's six tests
hey look its Iain Duncan Smith speaking on #brexit but why isn't he in prison for the tens of thousands of #disabled peeps he's killed #PoliticalDeclaration
Here’s an English Tory MP confirming that the #PoliticalDeclaration commits UK to #CFP in all but name. Surely @DavidMundellDCT can’t survive thus. Waiting to hear what @ScotTories & Bertie Armstrong have to say about this #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
It is not #Brexit. It is a sell out. Wouldn't be surprised to see a white flag along with the EU one go up over Downing Street later 
As the draft Withdrawal Agreement currently stands it is not good enough. We need to do better.  #brexit
Theresa May tells House of Commons draft #Brexit agreement is a "good deal" for the UK which honours the referendum result, while "protecting jobs and security" and "ends freedom of movement once and for all"
After the PM's speech and confirmation of her disastrous #Brexit deal, which basically is not Brexit all, I expect the flags above Downing Street to be changed to this later #StandUp4Brexit
Jeremy Corbyn right to call #PoliticalDeclaration an "empty document" - "The government has managed less than one page a month since the EU referendum - what on earth have they been doing?" #Brexit
The problem for the PM and the Tories on fishing and many other bits of the agreement are that the words on the page don’t say what she claims they do - and it’s the words on the page that the EU27 will stick to #Brexit
This week has shown again the danger of #Brexit for #Gibraltar. Spain won’t have an impact if it votes against the WA on Sunday but from April next year it will have a veto over future UK-EU trade deal + there won’t be a UK voice in the room standing up for Gibraltar’s interests.
THREAD: This proposed #Brexit agreement – it’s not even a deal – suggests we should hand over power & influence we have as full voting members of the #EU in return for a long list of vague promises. We'll have no substantive say over vital areas of national life.
BREAKING: The only important date to put in your diarySUNDAY 9TH DECEMBER 2018 The Great Brexit Betrayal March in London. Speakers including Lord Pearson, Gerard Batten and Tommy Robinson.The day before traitorous May's #Brexit deal goes to the Commons for the vote.. 
The new draft of the #PoliticalDeclaration contains a severely weakened commitment to the European Convention on Human Rights.  The ECHR is a crucial tool for defending our human rights. The Government must ensure we can protect our rights and freedoms after #Brexit 
.@junesarpong thinks @theresa_may is a “victim of misogyny”. She says #Brexit is a “shambles” and many of the men who were involved have quit - leaving the PM to deal with the issues without any thanks. Do you think she's been treated unfairly by men in politics? #ThePledge
While I accept the absolute right for people to hold differing opinions on #EU membership for the #UK - the results was clear (according to pro-Remain PM rules) and the UK must Leave.  Shame on any Tory MP (elected on the promise of #Brexit) who signs up to this sellout.
In other words, Britain will have no single market participation, it will be subject to standard third country controls, it doesn't safeguard jobs or trade - so we are making MASSIVE concessions for NOTHING. #EFTAisBetter #Brexit 
Full text of draft political declaration now online: #Brexit 
People seem to forget: workers, students, pensioners, services, goods & capital will continue to flow freely through the rest of Europe, while the UK becomes an awkward, hamstrung mess at the edge of the continent.Simply, #Brexit places the UK at a competitive disadvantage.

Wow! In their handling of #Brexit, Tories abandoned all other Scottish sectors to focus on part of the sea fisheries sector and even manage to betray them as well (again)? 
There is no way this #Brexit deal can get through Parliament. It’s a totally blindfolded stab in the dark, and that is NOT in the national interest. @theresa_may wants only to protect the interests of the @Conservatives party. Meanwhile @jeremycorbyn is doing the same. #shameful

Dominic Raab has said the Irish Government want to control Northern Ireland. I would go even further; it is a land grab, they want to aggressively subsume NI into their own sovereign territory by coercion & stealth. #Brexit

The letter has got longer and yet remains a wish list. The #PoliticalDeclaration still reads like a #LettertoSanta. It does not deliver what was promised by Vote Leave in 2016. The case for a #PeoplesVote continues to grow. The British public must be given a #finalsay on #Brexit

“The language is warm but the message is brutal” @IPPR response to the #PoliticalDeclaration#Brexit 
Some quick thoughts on the #Brexit Political Declaration which we've all been reading and digesting. (Shorter: unicorn hunters are goin to find themselves in a target-rich environment).  1/THREAD
Brexit Dept. own analysis:No deal #Brexit:2,800,000 lost jobs £158bn loss p.a.Trade agreement Brexit (out of single market):1,750,000 lost jobs£99bn loss p.a.Soft Brexit (EEA & single market):700,000 lost jobs£39bn loss p.a.Remain in EU:No impact on jobs£ no loss
Can’t believe we are still on this #Brexit path.Everybody knows we are going to be worse off, economically, politically, culturally.And all for the 17.4 million, so many of whom were cruelly misled.It really does defy belief.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
1. The UK could use #Brexit to take up a leadership role within Efta, using our collective clout to reshape and reform the EEA, strengthening the non EU tier of Europe and trading independently with the world. Instead May is choosing vassalage. She has no vision.
The #Brexit political declaration still calls for fisheries agreement on “access to waters and quota shares” which all 13 ⁦@ScotTories⁩ MPs said in letter to PM “cannot be included”...?
You are no longer negotiating the terms of our Leaving the EU.You merely agree the terms of our ultimate & complete surrender.Had we lost a war to these people, they'd treat us less harshly.Time for a new PM & a new approach to #Brexit.
Forget #Brexit, this is the day's biggest story:#GreenhouseGases hit a new high in 2017 - with C02 levels at 405 parts per million, a level last seen 3 to 5 million years ago:  Without UK & global action, we're headed for #ClimateBreakdown.
The bits of the non-binding #PoliticalDeclaration I've read are laughably vague.This is Blind Brexit: leaving next March with nothing more than a Wish List of fudge about our future relationship is folly. #bbcnews #PoliticsLive @BBCPolitics #Brexit
Time is short for real #Brexit. You need to write letters to your MP threatening their seat, not emails. Toolkit here: @Nigel_Farage @GerardBattenMEP @UKIP Can #UKIP give it a push please?
Beware! Much smoke and mirrors from No.10 and the media on May's latest #Brexit "breakthrough". To use her own phrase "nothing has changed". The real deal, the Withdrawal agreement is STILL botched. This Thread on why May's deal is still flawed...(Thread 1/6) 
Scots Tory MPs letter to PM on 14/11 says specifically that “access and quota shares cannot be included in the Future Economic Partnership”.   Political Declaration now agreed  shows they have been.  The 13 therefore cant support May’s #Brexit deal ( including @DavidMundellDCT )
A quick reminder: today's political declaration on #Brexit is exactly that - a POLITICAL declaration. It is entirely aspirational and doesn't commit anyone to anything. It means walking the plank blindfolded followed by years of further negotiations with the EU. #PeoplesVote
The Govt has proposed a contract that, unlike EU membership, cannot be cancelled without the EU's permission. This proposal, after our decision to "take back control", is one of the greatest civilised insults from politicians to the people in any country in history. #Brexit
Merkel, speaking in the Bundestag about May's ‘deal’ says we (Britain) could be stuck in customs union in perpetuity- and can only leave when the EU/ Germany say so. EU are determined to strangle an independent UK and with her #Brexit betrayal deal, our PM is allowing them to! 
Leaked Brexit political declaration confirms that UK government is signing up to a common fisheries agreement with EU including ‘access to waters and quota shares’. #Brexit

8) BUT Spain has a kind of moral veto here in that Tusk said the 27 EU countries would jump together when comes to #Brexit. If one country ie Spain is publicly v unhappy about text then will be difficult for Tusk to say at Sunday summit ‘the EU endorses this text’

The manipulation of British #media that jointly helped to derail #Brexit was so obvious that you'd expect parliament to sound alarm bells and call  editors and media owners to account. But parliament is full of traitors itself so it investigated 'Russian meddling' instead.

This is the axe blow on the present Withdrawal Agreement as far as I’m concerned.As the legal analysis says:it’s not just the back stop, it’s the continuing supremacy of European Courts.This is not #Brexit as voters ever understood it.
#TeamJunckerEU continues today: updates on #Article50 #Brexit negotiations, latest developments leading to the endorsement by the College of the political declaration on the future relationship between the EU and the U.K.  Now subject to leaders endorsement on Sunday. 
Vote Leave won the referendum by criminal means. #Brexit #Courts
Forget Mick McCarthy. My cartoon in today's @thetimesIE. #MartinONeill #Brexit 
No-one can say that @yanisvaroufakis didn’t warn the British government. This is a truth obvious to anyone who’s read his excellent book Adults in the Room. It should have been compulsory reading for every British politician and civil servant working on #Brexit. 
what has the UK come to, not only are we destroying the UK with #Brexit we are punishing the poor and sick for being just that @conservatives are sick in the mind, how do they sleep at night knowing they are destroying not only our country but the people in need.
The media push the lie Labour’s #Brexit policy isn’t clear. But when they let Labour front benchers get a word in the position is very clear. Well done to Rebecca Long-Bailey for cuting through the mansplaining.
NO DEAL is what we voted for @theresa_may We didn't vote for 'a deal'; we want to leave completely and be a free nation!Comprende?#Brexit
The PM says the #Brexitbill is £39bn.But if you add in an extended transition and costs identified by the National Audit Office the bill could be more like £60-70bn.This #Brexit deal is going to cost much more than May claims. We need a #PeoplesVote
Real risks here. Was talking to big hedge fund boss recently - who was making precisely this point about #brexit market assumptions. The turbulence may not come til it’s too late. 
What IS #Corbyn’s strategy? @jennirsl explains it’s to fix #Brexit on the #Tory party & win election for the left. But she says he deserves to be found out for his Brexit vanishing act.
6) Spain over Gibraltar and France over fishing rights... These are mere tasters of the arguaments to come when U.K. begins real negotiations on a trade deal with EU after #Brexit day
Watch the penny drop! Imagine going on a TV show specifically to debate #Brexit and the draft EU deal, without actually familiarising yourself with what is proposed in the draft EU deal! 
1) Ambassadors of 27 EU governments expected to see draft of political declaration on post #brexit EU-UK future this morning. Should start leaking out soon after if that is the case ..

May’s legacy: her #Brexit deal could crush the Tories.“As one Cabinet minister acknowledges, the decision to put unity ahead of sectarianism and entrust a Remainer with the project has proved disastrous.”
And now we have it: Labour’s “jobs-first deal”. It is the happy Brexit. The one in which the sun always shines. We get all of the benefits of EU membership with none of the obligations. And jobs first. Oh, and a unicorn. We all get a free unicorn. Simple. Just rejoice in #Brexit

We need to vote May's rotten #Brexit deal down and fight for a General Election. However, if we don't get one, we should give voters a final say!   
The Gibraltar issue hasn’t vanished magically yet. #Brexit  Here’s the Spanish PM reiterating that it cannot accept a Brexit deal which affects Spain’s own capacity to negotiate the future of Gibraltar with the UK. If that doesn’t change, Spain will vote no on Sunday.

Our new report, out today, concludes that #Brexit presents challenges and opportunities to tackle the nitrate pollution ‘time bomb’.Read it here: 
We can't support a deal that puts paid holidays, time off for working mums and dads, and equal pay for women at risk.Mrs May's #Brexit deal is bad for jobs and a disaster for worker's rights. MPs should vote against it.
Well, no. But then they're not telling the truth about the consequences of a "soft" #Brexit, either. There's no deal better than the deal we already have as a full member of the EU.
One wonders if and when former No voters are going to accept a Yes vote at #indyref2 is the only answer. Things are getting so daft, dangerous and embarrassing now, it's surely a no brainer? If not, they're effectively giving up on #Scotland. #SNP #Brexit

‘Managed No Deal or Orderly No Deal’ is gaining traction. Especially what with Normandy stating that France,Netherlands,Ireland & Belgium r going to be hugely impacted. Some member states appear rebellious at EU. Little wonder with their businesses getting very agitated! #Brexit 
So EU Juncker did the BIGGEST tax avoidance deal in history. Amazon, Luxembourg.Theresa May's husband is an executive in a $1.4 trillion hedge fund.that owns $20 bn of shares in Amazon.@theresa_may is trying to stop #brexitStrange coincidence ?
Somebody tell me what #Brexit is about then as it's not about giving the NHS more money, getting better trade deals or controlling our borders or getting our unlost sovereignty back either. Is it really just about blue fucking passports then? 
a nation without border protection isn't a nation, we europeans suffer because of that #brexit #nexit against EU.
Ex-tory deputy PM Michael Heseltine is right. Yes we should fight #brexit for the short term but why we must do it is for the generations to come.And, as he says.."The electorate has changed and changes everyday. Let them vote to stay" it's #RemainerNow
Simple problem with #Brexit since the outset.Everyone involved in organising it don't want to do it.EU see the end of a cashcow.MPs are weak & don't fancy actually working.Businesses are lazy/greedy, can't be bothered competing fairly.Only us plebs want it.This time we win.

I wonder if 'Spreadsheet Phil' has a running total on one of his spreadsheets for how much #Brexit has cost the United Kingdom up until this month? Lost revenue from people & businesses leaving the UK for the #EU27 + lost UK jobs. How much has Government squandered on Brexit?
On #WalesLive @mark4leader reiterates #Brexit position. PM failed to negotiate deal that meets Labour’s 6 tests so we must push for a GE, and failing that the public should vote.  To say this is ‘enabling a Tory #Brexit’ is an attempt to distort that view. #C21Socialism
Hello John McDonnellYou won't be lifting anyone out of poverty if #Brexit happens.All social policy is dependent upon the contents of the communal piggy bank.Brexit will render that empty.Labour need a radical new policy: demand a #PeoplesVote. #Newsnight

Good to meet the Director General of the Confederation of British Industry @cbicarolyn in #London tonight. We talked about #BREXIT and the importance to avoid a no-deal scenario. After BREXIT, our shared goal is to build an ambitious partnership between the EU & the UK. 
.@theresa_may threatening MPs: "If you don't vote for this deal... we could risk no #Brexit it all."Nope.Sorry, love."No Brexit" isn't risky at all... We know exactly what that involves - it's being part of the European Union - And it's fucking great! #StopBrexit
2014: England "Scotland can't join the EU, Spain won't let you."2018: Spain "Scotland is welcome to join the EU but we'll veto the UK #Brexit deal" 
So there you have it. Accept the negotiated "deal" or no #Brexit.  Whatever happened to "no deal is better than a bad deal"? 
What the F***What was once the party of business turns utterly feral in an idiotic quest to ram home its ridiculous #Brexit obsession.This is madness. 
The United Kingdom should not be pandering to the EU tyrants who are demanding we surrender our sovereignty & mutilate our precious Union in order to appease them. Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive; let’s walk away without giving them a penny #Brexit
The EU27 will accept May's deal because it largely protects their interests but gives the UK no unfair cake after #Brexit.The UK won't accept it because the UK still wants cake.Cake comes with EU membership.Cake with cherries and icing at that.Brexit means crusts.#bbcnewsten
#BREAKING:The Irish parliament has passed a motion supporting the #Brexit deal without the need for a vote as less than 10 TDs were opposed to it.
#May  again claims there is a risk of No Brexit if her deal doesn't win in HofCThis is completely at odds with her manifesto when we were told #NoDeal is better than a #BadDeal - At no time did she offer #NOBrexitThis woman is dishonest and is attempting to deny us #Brexit

Sorry folks but I am getting seriously pissed-off with the lack of attention this is getting. The account containing the greatest amount of info on the transatlantic network behind #Brexit has been shut down. This is very important.#PeoplesVote #FBPE
This is important.30 Labour CLP delegates demand that Corbyn respects Labour party policy on #Brexit including the final option of a #PeoplesVote and, frankly, to stop watering down or being inconsistent with that policy (for example saying "we can't stop Brexit" in interviews)
Of course not.That's why #Brexit is so illogical.It was not meant to happen.It was a ploy by #DavidCameron to blindside #UKIP and the eternal  #eurosceptic rump in the Con Party.But it backfired.Now here we are: #BrexitShambles#PeoplesVote
This is an absolutely amazing look at the potential opportunity for Ireland/US relationship in a post #Brexit EU. Of course, we’ve come to expect nothing less from our friend Ambassador @DanMulhall #GlobalIrish
My view after a few days in London is that #Brexit is even worse up close than it appears from afar.It’s sad to see a great country - and a pillar of the West - engaging in a pointless and distracting act of self-harm.
#Gibraltar #Scotland #Catalonia #BrexitA bunch of irrational contradictions.Let people vote and respect the outcome. Is not that difficult. #indyref

Tories rolling out same old Remainer Cabinet members to push Project Fear This time against No Deal #Brexit  People will not be fooled by this frightened approach & propaganda Especially now we see the hypocrisy in @theresa_may 's so called deal
Spain alone cannot ‘torpedo’ the #Brexit deal. It needs to be approved by qualified majority of EU countries and not unanimity. But the European Parliament does have a veto
May said we are leaving the EU "definitely" in March 2019, yet also claims we "risk no #Brexit at all"She claimed her deal was "finite," now she returns from Brussels insinuating more is to be discussed. She's a liar buying time. Her govt is unworkable. #GeneralElectionNow
Gibraltar borders Spanish region of Andalusia which holds regional elections in 10 days and is key for  Sanchez's socialist party as well as for the main conservative opposition which has accused him in the past of being soft over Gibraltar in #Brexit negotiations
To counter the ERG, TPA and IEA alleged so called 'think tanks', I am pleased to announce the Institute for Go and Fuck Your Fucking #Brexit. My message is Brexit is fucking bad for our country and I receive no public or shady funding in arriving at this conclusion.

The Tories are OBSESSED with teaching poor people fiscal responsibility, all the while not having the first clue about it themselves. How much has this idiotic #Brexit thing cost us so far? Is anyone keeping count?

This evening the Dáil is debating a motion on the #Brexit Draft Withdrawal Agreement. In her opening remarks, Sinn Féin Leader @MaryLouMcDonald said: "This is a very important motion before us this evening, which I hope all Teachtaí will support - along with the SF amendment."

Laughing as @paullewismoney explains that #government brought in plain packaging for cigarettes so they have extra space to work out #Brexit !
DUP MP Sammy Wilson - "Conservatives have torn up their side of the bargain when it comes to #Brexit. They have torn up their own manifesto. "They have torn up their own promises to the party, and the promises they made to us last December." 
Was shocked by this but it is brilliant.Corbyn & Labour Leadership are hiding behind "GE is the answer to #Brexit" So, force Corbyn's hand by forcing the call of no confidence which will fail, and we're on to a #PeoplesVote as the only option left
Gove’s  #FisheriesBill fails to address the key issues or meet the pledges made by the #Brexit supporters:
Andrew Rosindell MP - "Will the PM now even at this late stage please think again and instead lead our country in a new direction, completely cutting away the tentacles of the EU." #Brexit 
Theresa May is an absolute disgrace, accusing Mr. Corbyn of playing politics over #Brexit, her fucking party have been playing politics over Europe for decades, they called a referendum, messed up the negotiations b/c of her party politics we're headed for oblivion #PMQS

1/2 Is govt thinning EU/#Brexit options from three to two; excluding ‘no deal’ and making it a choice between May deal and a ‘rigged’ second ref? It would be major betrayal of manifesto if so. At election PM promised a good deal or no deal. ‘No #Brexit’ was specifically ruled out
"No #Brexit at all is the only way to protect workers from this impending disaster" - my latest views on May's rotten deal and what our Labour Party must do next!

Dear @Theresa_may - I didn't have a question at PMQs today, but my 8-year-old constituent has a very valid question (pictured here in her letter) about Santa and Freedom of Movement #Brexit #SantaClause #BrexitChaos #BrexitShambles
Theresa May was elected on a manifesto to Leave after a referendum was won on a no-deal prospectus. To actually now threaten a withdrawal of #Brexit if you don't back her Chequers deal shows her utter contempt for the people, weak leadership & just how bad her negotiated deal is.
“I’m not saying the people who voted for #brexit are stupid, but they did vote to leave Europe because there are too many Middle Easterners coming to the U.K.” - Frankie Boyle.

In the Chamber for the Fisheries Bill debate, Michael Gove offering warm words and #Brexit platitutes but struggling to offer any real answers to how #Brexit offers any real benefit to Scottish fisherman. A real fear that they will be sold out by the Tories again.
Possible #Brexit outcomes in focus: the OECD says a no-deal #Brexit scenario could wipe off more than 2% from UK growth over two years.
An unelected body attempting to control the actions of a democratic government... supranationalism must not be Europe’s future! #Brexit
Austerity and above average exposure to welfare reforms swung voters to #Brexit, & now they are swinging back again. So once again we see #Brexit being driven by home-grown factors, and voters misdirected by the Brexit press to blame the EU.#PeoplesVote

The key error of judgement that wrecked the elite and Theresa May's anti #Brexit mission

Tory Ken Clarke tells @adamboultonSKY he thinks @theresa_may's #Brexit agreement will not pass through the Commons the first time.He adds it will eventually be accepted as only a "handful of extreme people want no-deal".Latest on Brexit here: 
We can't support a deal that threatens paid holidays, time off for working mums and dads, and equal pay for women.And MPs shouldn't either. Whatever happens, people must have the final say on #Brexit.We need a general election or a popular vote now.

#TeamJunckerEU today: European Semester Autumn package to bolster inclusive sustainable growth, making sure recovery benefits everyone; Updates on #Article50 #Brexit negotiations, 2019 Budget; internal governance rules; tomorrow Single Market, InvestEU, standardisation package. 
This account is getting likes, shares and follows from literally every aspect of the political spectrum. Which just goes to show Theresa May has finally miraculously, united the country. The problem is, the country is united against her. #LameDuck #NoMajority #Brexit #BrexitChaos
“Scotland will be free to rejoin EU, says Spain”. Unexpected and welcome splash by the  @dailytelegraph #Brexit #Scotland 
Our Govt & Opposition 'respect' #Brexit, based on the opinion of 37% voters, lies & illegalities.We'll lose Rights & Protections W/O Consent & will be made WORSE OFF.I ask again has the EU ever removed Rights or harmed you in this way?#PeoplesVote #ABTV
After #Brexit, we will no longer be at the top table of the world. The people can get their future back by demanding the PM's third option: no Brexit. #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk @FFSake_ @OFOCBrexit @Business4PV @UKHouseofLords
I am returning to #Gibraltar now after further #Brexit negotiations in Madrid. Tomorrow at 3pm I will fully update Parliament & the community on the state of play ahead of the Special European Council on Sunday. Before that, I will brief the Cabinet & the Brexit Select Cttee. 
The EU has never labelled, and will never do, Brexit as a success or as a win-lose game. Brexit is a lose-lose situation. And that has been said since day one.Whoever tries to sell #Brexit as a succes (for the UK or for the EU) is, simply, lying. 
Least convincing Last Supper ever. #Brexit 
Will Theresa sell out the Gibraltarians like she's selling out the Northern Irish?  Summary about #Brexit and the Rock: 
#Brexit has increased depression.A new study reveals anti-depressant subscriptions in the U.K. have soared since June 2016.
#Brexit: Backlash over May's EU nationals 'queue jumping' vowWhen the fabric of society is tattered and torn through a policy that has split the nation in two, incendiary remarks like May's are going to do nothing to heal the rift.She should go now. 
Journalists maintain the alternative to #Chequers is “abyss”, “cliff edge”, “disorderly #Brexit”, or even “No deal”.  Wrong!The 95% of the Deal agreed weeks ago is fine.It is in the #EU’s and #UK’s interest we revert to that with free trade - not locked into the Customs Union.
"Is this a done deal?"  Why does May insist on thinking that the EU means what it says?  Great #Brexit piece in this morning's Brexit Facts4EU output: 
The #UK will be “frozen out” of #EU decisions on no fewer than 182 new rules in the months after #Brexit, a new analysis says, including over budget spending, road signs and drinking water.
NEWS: Small businesses need clarity and certainty over Brexit so today we're publishing an open letter signed by business owners in support of the withdrawal agreement #Brexit #BrexitAgreement
Working people need a long-term, binding guarantee that rights in the UK will keep pace with those across Europe. The Prime Minister's #Brexit deal fails this test. Trade unions can’t support it.MPs shouldn't either.
Great to hear the Conservative chairman of @CommonsCMS @DamianCollins come out for a #PeoplesVote on @BBCr4today. He’s done more than almost anyone to uncover the law-breaking by the pro #Brexit campaign.
The backlash against May’s ‘Brexit’ deal shatters the elitist prejudice about #Brexit voters being obsessed with immigration. She offers an end to free movement but Brexiteers aren’t happy, because in truth it is sovereignty we want, writes @Tom_Slater_
Strange times make for strange bedfellows. Lord Green (⁦@MigrationWatch⁩ )also came out for #PeoplesVote last night, and noted that this was “the sense of the House” #Brexit 
I supported the EU for years but this is sounding more and more like the plot of the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Who wants to stay in such a dangerous organisation? #Brexit
Someone seems a bit fed up with the #Brexit fallout.Look who stole the show from @RaynerSkyNews steering the focus away from the turmoil in Westminster... Larry the cat .Follow the latest on #Brexit here: 
We asked their celebs for their verdict on the #Brexit document - all 500 pages of it. This is what they had to say. 
The new #Brexit? Romaine vs Leaf?
I don't want the UK to leave the EUI don't want Scotland to leave the EUEverywhere I look, it's a disaster!I want the best for the UK but Scotland MUST leave. We cannot continue within the UK whatever happens! #Brexit was NOT of our making! #DissolveTheUnion
I've got a better idea @DominicRaab why don't you debate if going through with #brexit is necessary or desirable with @JolyonMaugham, or @mikegalsworthy.I'd love to see that. @jeremycorbyn is conflicted re #PeoplesVote - they're not.We, the people, need our #FinalSay#FBPE
Pleasant predictions from those democrats at #FBPE with usual contempt for their fellow citizens who had temerity to vote #Brexit 
I was interviewed on @BBCNews this evening - for 6 minutes! Talking about the impact of #Brexit on my small business and clearly making the case for a #PeoplesVote.Watch from 30:55 
Theresa May and the UK Government have suffered a humiliating defeat in their attempts to derail a Scottish court case seeking to determine whether the UK can unilaterally reverse #Brexit. 
Theresa May will go down in History as the most deceitful Prime Minister the UK has ever seen, & this took some doing after Blair! #Brexit
#Brexit..fascinating to observe @duponline adopting political guerilla tactics to ambush PM Theresa May. Is it conceivable that Mrs May will strike back .. possibly choking off the financial package negotiated during the confidence and supply agreement discussions?
Within a day David Lammy called on Parliament to "stop this madness" and he wasn't alone. From outset, instead of implementing #Brexit, stopping it was objective of far too many MPs 
I have said for ages that the logical thing to do is ask the people of Northern Ireland do they want the British border in Ireland or on the Irish Sea, post #brexit.It would be in keeping with the principles established under the Good Friday Agreement.#TonightVMT
What is it with the Beeb. Constantly opinions vs fact. There is a truth and this should be reported. The damage that #brexit will cause is not a matter of opinion. It is a fact. FFS what is wrong with this country. #FBPE #peoplesvote
If ever there were a time to go full throttle #Tory its NOW!! #Brexit is aligned with EVERY SINGLE PARTY PRINCIPLE; FreedomDemocracyPersonal LibertyLow TaxationSmall State Governance AspirationWTH are we killing a golden chance to dance our tune!?!?
You are the only person I know of to have ever been responsible for negotiating a deal that you yourself were unhappy with. You are the walking talking embodiment of a joke. And you're really not funny either. You absolute muppet #Brexit #BrexitChaos #BrexitShambles
Brexit: the lies of the ERG - illustrating once again how the ERG works. The case they make, founded on lies, is terminally flawed. The way they behave is disgusting, adding immeasurably to the debasement of politics, and the erosion of trust...  #Brexit. 
Former #Brexit secretary accused of being ‘deluded or just plain stupid’ 
If after 3 years of Brexit campaigning we dont have 48 Conservative MPs, prepared to defend democracy, by delivering a no confidence vote in Theresa May, then the Conservative Party is truly finished as a political party!#Brexit@andrealeadsom @michaelgove @BorisJohnson @LiamFox
I have seen the future...and I’m not in it! #brexit 
Practically at once after the Referendum voted to leave the EU British #media colluded to block the result by launching a campaign of misinformation presenting #Brexit as highly complex and posing numerous dangers, all to confuse people. This was deception on a massive scale.
Another sobering dose of #Brexit reality. Spectre of Brexit is already driving away employers and costing jobs.If we go through with Brexit, this will just be the beginning.It's time to stand up for industrial Britain. It's time to back a #PeoplesVote
The Withdrawal Agreement is an absurdity. The British people are expected to pay £39b in order to allow a foreign power (that is trying to raise an army) to make our laws, to have those laws enforced by a foreign court & to have our precious Union carved up. Say no. #Brexit
UKIP’s @GerardBattenMEP on #Brexit ahead of May’s meeting tomorrow“Get rid of May & get somebody who genuinely wants to leave the EU. We tell them how it’s going to work. We repeal 1972 European Communities Act & leave under our law” 
As a long time Tory voter I am pleased to see gov in difficulties. Well done DUP, it's a shame that Tory Brexit rebels are not joining in. The Tory backbenchers may largely be a bit thick but hopefully they will get the message that preventing a clean #Brexit will lose their jobs
The proposed #Brexit withdrawal agreement is a comprehensive and fair settlement that solves many thorny issues. #Spain is keen to support it. This notwithstanding, we need more clarity in article 184 regarding the territorial scope of the negotiations between the #EU and...(1/2)

Well, well, well.....#Brexit  
Jeezus Christ Labour!!!! Wtf are you doing? Voting against the Welsh Continuity Bill WITH UKIP & TORIES is a new low. Be aware Scotland!!#Wales #indyref2 #Brexit 
Take some advice from someone older and wiser than yourself @theresa_may. There is a pro #brexit demonstration in London on 1st December. There will be some very, very angry people there. Stay away from London on that day.
Welsh Labour tonight vote WITH the Tories & UKIP to remove any form of protection afforded to Welsh powers after #Brexit. And people still vote for these spineless bootlickers? 
Scandalous. Welsh Labour vote with Tories and UKIP to repeal the Welsh Continuity Bill. This means protection to Welsh powers after #Brexit have been removed. 
A MINORITY government pushing through a destructive act wanted only by a MINORITY of parliament and a MINORITY of the population. Not a single person in this country can legitimately argue that this is democracy. #Brexit is blatantly a coup. #StopBrexitSaveDemocracy #PeoplesVote
NEW: AMs have overwhelmingly voted to scrap the Welsh Continuity Act.It seems only @Plaid_Cymru AMs voted against repealing the law #Brexit 
.@Theresa_May is desperately trying to win over the #Brexit hardliners on the Tory benches by promising tough new immigration controls.But she still refuses to publish any details of her plans, more than a year after the white paper was originally due.
Larry the @Number10cat knows how to negotiate free movement of felines - we know who’s really in charge of these #Brexit deals  #CatsofTwitter

“Rebels don’t go to the House of Lords!”Is this the reason why the plot by Tory Brexiteers to oust Theresa May has fallen flat? @Nigel_Farage | #Brexit 
First time I've done one of these polls so participation appreciated.  Neither of the two main Parties are fit to govern our country. Do you support the formation of a Unity Party to get the country out of this #Brexit mess.
WATCH: "What I'm determined doesn't happen is that Scotland's interests are completely shafted" - @NicolaSturgeon spent today in Westminster in meetings with opposition party leaders seeking to make common cause to defeat @theresa_may's draft #Brexit deal. 
9 times out of 10, when I  mention to a taxi driver that I am an academic working on #Brexit & @BorderIrish, *he* tells *me* how to solve the problem.
A really excellent document by the ERG and @GlobalBritain team.  This is a must-read. Get it here:   We'll be summarising this on our site shortly, but we recommend reading the full report.Distinctive #Brexit research & news daily: 
Tánaiste @SimonCoveney on the draft #brexit agreement between the UK & EU: "It's not a draft text... it is THE text and it is not going to be reopened." 
What to look for in #Brexit declaration? 
The stupidest thing here is that if he hacked a #PeoplesVote then all indicaters suggest that #Remain would win and that by itself would surely bring down this Government thus triggering a General Election.Just goes to show how much #Corbyn is still clinging on to #Brexit 
ROLL UP for the Black Friday special. This dodgy #Brexit deal will cost us jobs. If you're #NotBuyingIt, write to your MP today and let them know you don't want this dodgy #Brexit deal: 
We can all agree Theresa May’s #Brexit deal is terrible, so what’s the alternative?Don’t miss this important event in London on Thursday with Grace Blakeley, Larry Elliott, Costas Lapavitsas among a fantastic lineup.
We #FBPE people do more to fight Tory #Brexit in one hour than the Labour front bench has done im 2.5 years.

Any BBC or other MSM blue tick presenter or "star", regardless of whether in the political range or all positions, who have tweeted about #Brexit but not tweeted about the #austerity or UN Poverty report, should be regarded as culpable in the tory regimes attack on the poor.

In 6 days the UK Home Office will argue against the citizenship entitlements of the Good Friday Agreement. We will argue for them #WeAreIrishtoo & sharing this tweet would be massively helpful @UKCharityTues #charitytuesday #Brexit #HostileEnvironment
There remains decent principled people in the @Conservatives- both @Torygrassroots Members and MPs. We wouldn't have got this far towards #Brexit without them, but undoubtedly the "modernisers" & Cameroons have done damage which may be irreparable.
The Tory Party is already irreparably split.  It cannot come back from the mess that Theresa May has made of #Brexit.  The only reason that people of the Leave persuasion stay in the #Conservatives is a lack of spine.
Friends! I'm pretty fucking bored of people using 'logical' arguments, e.g. "Leave won - get over it!"#Brexit is a treacherous invention of Right-wing ultra-capitalist selfish gits - i.e. taxpayers - used against working people, e.g. Our Terrorist Community.Talk about end of! pic.twitter.com/6JnLPWBMXy
There is a world of difference between democracy and the dictatorship of the majority which is the model Brexiters  from Theresa May downwards have applied to #Brexit. Mind you, the majority was gerrymandered, and even that no longer exists. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Theresa May Gambling On "Unicorn Fantasy" Compromise To Save #Brexit Deal; EU Says Take It or Leave It—Negotiations Are Over. NEED TRUMP TO NEGOTIATE FOR U.K. #PatriotsUnited

Any yet David Cameron campaigned to stay in the EU. How does that work for him?#BrexitChaos #Brexit 
So it turns out #Brexit WAS about hatred towards immigrants all along.Who could have guessed?
When the Brexiters spoke of "ending the gravy train”, the public did not expect Bisto running out and a dry Sunday lunch. Nobody voted for this chaotic #Brexit, people are entitled to a final say on Brexit in a #PeoplesVote to put a stop to this mess
 *this* *really* *matters* Our constitution has been seriously abused by #brexit. 
The #Brexit elite are a bunch of wealthy, arrogant, patronising tossers who treat public opinion since 2016 with contempt, and deny the people the democratic right to vote on the reality of a deal, rather than the lies they peddled in 2016. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
As ⁦@GavinWilliamson⁩ says,France & Germany first need to spend their mandated 2% of GDP for NATO which has successfully kept the peace in Europe before they start forming an #EU Army which suspiciously looks like the start of a new European "Empire" or State. #Brexit ASAP!

Brexiter elite looking like the establishment figures they are!I hope those voters who thought voting #Leave in the #Brexit referendum was sticking one up to the establishment, take a long hard look at this!It's why we need #PeoplesVote #FinalSay to #ExitFromBrexit & #Remain
Real chance now there are TWO meaningful #Brexit votes in the @HouseofCommons - with final one in in January I'm hearing - if it happens will make for a very, very nervous festive period
Tory pleading for Labour support should be dismissed out of hand.Labour knows if it backs a Tory #Brexit it is Dead as a party of Govt.Tory #Brexiters keep saying we should back the Govt deal & do what is in the Natl Interest.That would be to #StopBrexit.#REMAIN IS AN OPTION
1/ May continues to whip up EU migration hysteria, but migration from Eastern Europe is naturally falling with the tailing-off of pent-up demand & faster economic growth in Eastern Europe. The main popular motive for #Brexit no longer exists!#PeoplesVote
Those who continue to, rather frantically, peddle the nonsense of “free trade deals will be better than single market access” - have failed to provide any plan for #Brexit, any solution to the Ireland border issue, and any evidence of the FTA utopia that supposedly awaits.

Here's the Spanish Foreign Minister on Brexit and Scottish independence in interview with @politicoRyan for @POLITICOEurope #Brexit #Scotland #Europe
They did privately. They hyped up ‘proplems’ in public to help Mr. Cameron. But the Tories, post #Brexit , have few friends in the EU. As I reported last year senior German politicians now saying “Scotland will gain faster & easier (re) entry than any other applicant in history.”
.@Number10cat Larry voted out ... now immediately wants to be let back in #brexit
Let's make no mistake, #Brexit was the voters reaction to unnecessary austerity and government failure to fund public services.And the xenophobic press pushed home the message by blaming the EU for all the UKs ills.The result is country forever divided and forever poorer.
NEW Steve Baker says of the failure of Tory MPs to reach the 48-MP threshold: "It has left me in a position today answering questions about my own credibility. "But ...  I am really not bothered about my credibility - I am bothered about getting the right exit deal."#Brexit
Due to meet with @ScotGrocersFed shortly to discuss #Brexit - like all of us they want an end to instability but unfortunately Prime Minister’s “deal” will prolong instability whilst severely weakening  the economy.  A better alternative is available.
A massive Brexit scandal: The government has been trying to block the path to an ECJ ruling on whether Article 50 is unilaterally revocable. Think of it, the government doesn't want people and MPs to know the single most important legal fact about #Brexit. #PeoplesVote #FBPE

#Brexit..is this an Icarus moment for @duponline? It would be foolish to second guess the mood of the DUP’s constituency, however, the RHI report is just over the hill and the absence of a Stormont administration has burgled DUP MLAS & the SPADS of their bank of swagger & muscle.

Why is business/industry not having an impact on DUP opinion I hear you ask? Remember they opposed the GFA, despite the overwhelming endorsement of industry here and still overtook the UUP 5 years later. The bulk of their voters are in a different place on #Brexit.
Spain’s last minute posturing on #Gibraltar was always expected, and is unlikely to amount to much, but the Spanish foreign minister’s comments are shockingly confrontational & undiplomatic. I suspect there is an election in Spain soon. #Brexit
#Brexit psycho drama continues with EU members lining up to question the agreement.  So far - France, Spain, Netherlands, Denmark. Germany "can't be Chequers through the backdoor.  With no time to bargain or work out the winners/losers - we 're all going into the unknown.
The UK Supreme Court has refused the UK Govt permission to appeal the Scottish courts referral to #CJEU of question of unilateral revocability of #Article50. Our case will proceed in Luxembourg on 27 Nov. A vindication of Scots & EU law #Brexit #PeoplesVote
A failure to deliver #Brexit will see a Ukip surge. I'm not their biggest fan at all but if May signs this deal it will remove any objection I had to voting Ukip. If that means a Corbyn government then so be it. The Tories are no use to us. 
You know you’re living in interesting times when Jeremy Corbyn is echoing DUP concerns and the DUP is commending the Labour leader for “getting it”. Remind me again, who’s propping who up in government? #Brexit 
.Backing #Brexit no matter what impact it has on Scotland Because they think more of their party than their country!

Theresa May government to ‘engineer financial crash’ to frighten MPs into voting for #Brexit deal – report 
Wonderful picture. And precisely why #Brexit is so important, so we can invite more such people here, instead of denying them places in favour of those with no skills whatsoever to offer us. 
READ: Senior city figures call for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
Corbyn's right - we need radical change. But #Brexit would make it harder to transform our economy. Instead of pretending some magical version of Brexit can fix things, we must start rebuilding our country by gving people a say with a #PeoplesVote
Superb work by @JolyonMaugham 6 others on this. Now ECJ will be ruling on if A50 is unilaterally revocable. It’s important for MPs to know before they vote on May’s #brexit deal & can frame arguments for a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay referendum with option to #Remain & #ExitFromBrexit
22,000 have now signed! RT or add your name now if you think all Labour MPs should join @jeremycorbyn and @Keir_Starmer and #VoteDownTheDeal#Brexit #BrexitChaos
Having spoken many times through this #Brexit process to EU citizens who have made the UK their home, I know how hurt they will be by @theresa_may’s language - that they “jumped the queue”. It adds to the post-referendum vibe that they’re not welcome. And it fuels xenophobia.
European judges WILL decide whether or not Article 50 process (ie #Brexit) can be stopped by the UK 
The British military will never turn on us, but A UN or European army definitely will. The only purpose for them is, one world government.I don't want our money funding that.Retweet if you agree.#Brexit #EUArmy #BritishArmy #NATO
Heating up over #Gibraltar with Spain asking for changes in the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement  ... Spanish PM Pedro #Sanchez this morning ... “As of today, if there are no changes with respect to Gibraltar, #Spain will vote no to the agreement on Brexit.” 
Good to see these senior business figures standing up for the majority of businesses & demanding a #peoplesvote on the Government’s dreadful #Brexit deal  
We were the ones out there leafleting and knocking on doors in the pouring rain. This was not the #Brexit we voted for.Pleased to have signed this open letter to the @Telegraph alongside 18 other #Leave groups asking MPs to vote this horrendous 'deal' down.
2) Melanie Philips is a regular pro #Brexit columnist, arguing for a tough line on the EU.This is her finding out *only last night* that we represent 10% of the EUs total exports compared to 45% of ours going to the EUHer confused look is remarkable
1) who are the stupid #Brexit people John?A regular device from brexiters is to say that #PeoplesVote supporters think Leave voters were stupidIt's true that there were very many incredibly, boneshakingly dense Brexiters, but they were leading, not followingSome examples
4) This will become even more apparent when detailed negotiations of the future EU-U.K. trade deal start in earnest AFTER #Brexit day
London to lose market in selling EU government bonds to Milan it was announced yesterday. Yet another bit of the allegedly irreplaceable financial services plumbing disappears. Grazie #brexit
3) France lobbying for fishing rights in U.K. waters and Spain digging heels in over Gibraltar - both issues of domestic concern in their respective countries - are a reminder of how politics in EU countries, not only EU law play in to the #Brexit negotiations
UK #music industry to take a significant hit if we go ahead with #Brexit : 
1) Germany and Barnier do not support the last minute lobbying by EU countries eg France and Spain to harden #BREXIT conditions on the U.K. at this late stage
Today, Welsh Labour Gvt wants to repeal the Welsh Assembly's Continuity Act. It is aimed at enshrining all existing EU regulations into  law when #Brexit happens, to secure high standards & stop a Westminster power-grab. EFA & @Plaid_Cymru say NO REPEAL!
1) Any hope the PM had of last minute lobbying on the EU-U.K. post #Brexit relationship document in her visit to Brussels this week is out the proverbial window. Eu officials suggesting the text will be signed off EU internally before she meets JC Juncker
 The latest #Brexit twists from Brussels. Is unity of 27 remaining members of  beginning to fracture? @SkyNews learns that some are not happy with aspects of the deal. That could spell trouble this week & it demonstrates how hard it could be to secure a  free trade deal.
An irrational attack on the UFU. They have a differing point of view and perspective, this does not make them puppets. #BREXIT 
Brilliant: @colmoregan’s guide to #Ireland for UK’s #Brexit|eers. As told @ClaireByrneLive.

Peter Lilley is on #r4today @BBCr4today arguing with the Reality Check correspondent. That’s where we are now; Brextremists arguing with reality. “You’re putting the case for Remain” he wails despondently. Yes Peter. Because the reality IS the case for Remain. #Brexiteers #brexit
You'd never know it from programmes like #r4today and goons like Peter Lilley but we're currently also in negotiations with the WTO and several other countries have raised objections to our proposals for future terms. #Brexit
So significant. Every MP will have the opportunity to compare #Brexit reality to the status quo.Every MP who votes to endorse Brexit (in any form) will do it knowing it will make their constituents poorer.Every MP who wants to defend their constituents can back a #PeoplesVote
Whether it’s the figures on the side of a bus or a bundle of letters, why would anyone trust these people on #Brexit when they can’t even trust each other
#Spain FM, José Borrell, threatens to scupper #Brexit deal over #Gibraltar, ceded to #Britain under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht in which Britain betrayed #Catalonia and gave it to the BourbonsThe Deplorable Case of the #Catalans should be Reconsider'd too

This fool thinks people won’t be allowed into the EU from March next year. Tariffs less than currency fluctuation, more opportunity to sell domestically and we could reduced tariffs on raw material. Best he gets fired from talking about #Brexit 
Ideology spawned #Brexit. It’s where extreme Tories who believe in free market utopia meet the hard left who believe in socialism in one country. Both believe their fantasy will be hastened through national disaster. Pity Britain @Labour4EU @euromove

#Brexit and #Gibraltar. The conflict between #Britain and #Spain is awakening as result of Brexit.  The important question is: Should a #referendum decide?  And if so why not #Catalonia also?
Trump & #Brexit are peas from the same pod. “This is being coordinated across national borders by very wealthy people in a way we haven’t seen before." It’s all here: 
Evidence mounting that U.K.’s vote leave campaign funded in part by American fracking interests. This is particularly sad, given what we know about fracking. Trump will make some pro-Brexit (read: fracking) statements soon.  #Brexit
W/O being overly melodramatic & whilst things aren't 2B settled on battlefields, we're in the midst of another Civil War.As B4 #Brexit represents as deep a division betwn 2 radically opposed philosophies.A #PeoplesVote is required to begin to resolve it.

Good lord this is unbelievable.@MelanieLatest, ardent #Brexit commentator, did not realize until *this evening* that the EU's total exports to the UK represent less than 10% of their total exports Vs 45% of ours.How can she still not know this? She writes on this for a living!

The lot at the #BBC know that if Britain leaves the EU their future as a state funded liberal propaganda mouthpiece may be under threat. So the BBC hacks are lying like mad about #Brexit and throwing their support behind May and her treacherous #BrexitDeal that keeps the UK in EU
Okay, a lot of people seem to want a #PeoplesVote. I'm going to do one now. The result will show which side has more determination to win. Vote & share widely with your audience. This is a competition. You have 7 days. #Brexit #Remain #FBEU #StandUp4Brexit
If the politicians don’t have what it takes to stand up to @theresa_may and the @Conservatives and actually listen to the people, maybe a show of boots on the ground in Westminster will send the message. #Brexit #TommyRobinson #MayMustGo
O'Leary, Ryanair, getting into trouble with French authorities over unpaid debts.Ghosn, Nissan, now arrested for dodgy finances.These are the guys they wheel out to scare UK voters over #Brexit.A highly amusing coincidence. 
"Pooled sovereignty" is just a euphemism for the transfer of political authority from the many to the distant few. Little by little they will take it all until we have no power at all. The plan was always to make us dependent then snatch it all away. #Brexit

I guess it's down to whether Andrea Leadsom, Michael Gove, Liam Fox, Penny Mordaunt & Chris Grayling are honourable in their defence of a real #Brexit or are they just run of the mill Tory sheep ?May says no to changes in her plan ... will they resign ?
Hating Brexiteers has become the most acceptable prejudice of our time among the supposedly liberal establishment:  #Brexit
The break up of the EU is as inevitable as the break up of all corrupt over bureaucratic empires. They always crash in chaos. The EU exists to further the interests of centralised banks and its own over remunerated elite. It is a regression away from improved democracy. #Brexit

Keir Starmer has said this evening that #Labour will likely pursue a "vote of no confidence" in the government if and when the #Brexit deal is voted down. If a majority of MPs vote for it, there's 14 days to form a new government, if not - there's an automatic #GeneralElection
The choice is now apparent. We either remove @theresa_may and install a leader who respects the union and the #Brexit mandate, or the govt collapses without DUP support, and we fight a General Election. @BrandonLewis @JamesCleverly @Conservatives

2017: "Vote for me or risk a coalition of chaos, with the govt held to ransom by the SNP"Tonight: Despite their £1bn bribe, 10 DUP MPs held the Tory government to ransom by abstaining on the budget votes in parliament. That aged well. #Brexit #GeneralElectionNow
Gisela Stuart - "One of the difficulties has been that Downing Street did not reach out to the Leave community."It allowed a climate to develop where 17.4m people were, in language abused as being old and they didn’t know what they were voting for." #Brexit 
Marcus Fysh MP - "There is a point in time when you have to understand that the negotiating strategy that the UK Govt has been pursuing has been entirely the wrong one."The PM has led that, personally against the advice of two #Brexit Secretaries who have resigned." 
I didn’t jump any queue. We came here as a reciprocal agreement of freedom of movement, giving Brits the same right. This statement by Ms May is incredibly arrogant and downright offensive. #brexit

It’s in America’s national interests to have a Great Britain on the world stage that is a sovereign, independent nation that can work closely with the United States—and a US/UK free trade deal is a big part of that. #Brexit #SpecialRelationship
Great @Channel4News feature on how to market the post #Brexit UK. Full of innovative ideas. Every single image English. That, itself, is very revealing.
Your periodic reminder: frictionless trade does not happen without extensive regulatory harmonisation. If you don't want the ECJ having direct jurisdiction and you don't want to be a passive rule taker, the only way is Efta.#Brexit
Why was tonight's #c4news presenter desperately pushing his guests to agree that a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government would be much worse than Theresa May's #Brexit fudge? Orders from Ian Katz?
I've spent much of the last 12 hours reading the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement and the #backstop for NI (UK) that comes with it. I'm left rather gobsmacked by it. I just can't understand how we negotiated this, thinking that it wouldn't then be the basis for a future agreement.
Watching the news. Scotland didn't vote for this Brexshit show, we voted to remain! It's time for us to get the hell out of this joke of a Tory run 'United' Kingdom!! #stillyes #indyref2 #brexit #ScottishIndependence #ImAScotGetMeOotOfHere

Safe to say, whilst Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn has a view on #Brexit, it isn't one I will ever share.I want the Tories out, but not so that Corbyn can have his own bullshit Brexit instead. Give it up Jeremy, there is no jobs first Brexit & no future for @UKLabour while you persist
Theresa May's handling of #Brexit negotiations are disastrous: Gardiner  @MorningsMaria @FoxBusiness

I'm not giving way today. Today's Westminster Hall debate on stopping #Brexit is pathetic. We voted to leave. We did not vote to remain or vote for a bad deal. MPs need to start building trust not breaking their promises.

Many businesses might back #Brexit but what you are trying to deliver isn't Brexit and you damn well know it! Your action is so bad, false and against the public interest that you will condemn the Tories to years in the wilderness for messing it up so badly.
Calling EU citizens ‘queue jumpers’ shows lack of respect for people who live, work and contribute to life in the UK. That type of attitude is why European Parliament will ensure guarantees on citizens rights are water tight in #Brexit withdrawal agreement and its implementation.
At this point, even MPs asking for a second referendum annoy me. Get it together, Parliament. Do what you’re there for. Stop #Brexit because the effort, expense, disruption and sacrifice are too great. It’s not in the country’s best interests. The vast majority of you know that.

I was interested in your earlier thread @VickyFord How would you respond to this? On the day the draft #BrexitDeal was agreed with #EU,deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weygand wrote this to all EU27 ambassadors. I’m afraid it looks very much as if they want control after #Brexit 
If you replace 'woman' with 'gay man' or 'black man' or 'disabled man' or 'Jew' or 'Muslim' etc., I think it becomes clearer why this tweet is so ill-judged. #Brexit competence transcends patronising equality protections: Mrs Thatcher would have slapped this nonsense right down. 
We are not allowed to incite hate against people because of their colour or religion, but Theresa May is allowed to whip up hate against millions of people because they were born in the 'wrong' countries.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #FBPE

Raab, Truss and Priti Patel were members of a group of Tory MPs who called British workers the "worst idlers in the world" and called for an Asian style work ethic and Asian style low taxes. #Brexit is the Tory way of implementing those demands. 
David #Cameron should become PM again if Theresa #May is forced out over #Brexit, says his former director of strategy 
Spot on from @EdwardJDavey Theresa May is trying to make her #Brexit #Deal appeal but any detail on how key post-Brexit policies will work are being suppressed. May's plan truly is a #BlindfoldBrexit
Victory! After Plaid Cymru urged the Welsh Government last week to hold a meaningful vote on the #Brexit deal in the National Assembly before the 'meaningful' vote in the House of Commons, today, we understand that @fmwales has agreed.
Brexit is about xenophobia and stupidity. It does nothing for British business except weaken it. Those pushing for #Brexit are trashing their own economy and country. #CBI2018
#Brexit implementation period should be over "before the next general election", says Theresa May - earlier than 2022 date suggested by EU negotiator Michel BarnierMore:  #CBI2018
#Brexit has now gone beyond leave and remain, the tories have had over two years to negotiate, they've failed, May is about to inflict an economic crash on us in her and her party's lust for power, this is deliberate, why the fuck is the media not up in arms about it? #FinalSay
Everybody who is seeking a #PeoplesVote should watch this. It's not what we voted for. The 2016 referendum was a FINAL SAY. End of. Please RT. #Brexit

At a business briefing on #Brexit WA agreement with @NIOgov SoS Karen Bradley in Belfast this morning. Confirms;* unfettered access NI to GB market* present day trade N/S Ireland would continue without barriers* constitutional integrity of UK and NI is protected
And here we see one of the real goals of Tory #Brexit, to replace workers from the EU who have rights with workers from the third world who will have no rights and will work longer hours for lower wages under worse conditions.  #Brexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE

James O'Brien sums up the madness of Theresa May's Brexit in 60 seconds.@mrjamesob | #Brexit 
The fundamental problem with this deal is that it doesn't solve anything. It provides marginal continuity for business, fobbing the public off with changes to FoM, but the desire to be a sovereign independent nation will not go away. It won't end here. #Brexit
.@thomasbrake has today warned the “only alternative to #Brexit is a #PeoplesVote” ahead of Jeremy Corbyn’s speech to the CBI on his alternative Brexit plan. Labour should join the Liberal Democrats in that campaign. It's what their members voted for, so what's stopping them?

Theresa May is talking out of both sides of her mouth in her desperation to ram her miserable #Brexit deal through Parliament.Don't fall for her Project Fear. There is an increasingly strong chance of a #PeoplesVote
PM has betrayed the #Brexit vote, so those MPs who want the votes of the 17.4m to be honoured, need to remove the PM so the biggest democratic vote in the history of the UK is respected and delivered without further delay.#NoDealBestDeal#BrexitNow#MayMustGoNow.

It was revealed by the Times over the weekend that the Tories may try to engineer a market crash in order to manipulate MPs & the wider public into accepting May's #Brexit plans. Manufacturing fear is a classic Tory tactic, & it's scandalous. Don't let them get away with it.
The business lobby will back the deal because they don't give a tinker's toss about democracy. Now we find out who Westminster really serves.#Brexit.

There will be a concerted effort today to move the debate toward the political declaration on the future relationship. It goes further than an FTA but offers no guarantee that the backstop will not be activated and it certainly does mean extensive ECJ jurisdiction.#Brexit

We know prolonged anger and conflict are very bad for our health. It'll be interesting to see what all the anger, inflammation, uncertainty and stress from an interminable #Brexit does to the nation's health, as well as the nation's health service. Premature deaths all round?
One of the ironies of #Brexit is that trust in civil servants keeps rising (up 37 points since 1983)  - whereas trust in politicians remains unchanged at 19%

'The right thing, the democrat thing is to put a second referendum to the people,'Lord Adonis says it's time to head to the polls once again to decide if #Brexit should happen - or if it should be ditched. 
If 48 MPs trigger a no confidence vote in Theresa May and she wins, the rules state that there can be no similar vote for 12 months. That would strengthen those who want to frustrate #Brexit.  I explain the rules and consequences in @Telegraph.

Four great #Brexit pieces in today's edition of Brexit Facts4EU. Here's the first: 
THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A JOB-FIRST BREXIT!With #Brexit, jobs go first.You guys know this — if you don't you're not fit to govern. Stop peddling fairy tales. We expect this nonsense from the Cons, but not from you. Wake up. #Brexit = more austerity = no #Labour manifesto.

This analysis of #Brexit chimes with my 2017 paper with ⁦@MagneFlemmen⁩ in ⁦@BJSociology⁩. Brexit is the project of a cynical Tory elite. Those who will suffer will be from the poorer areas who rallied to it. An historical tragedy will unfold.
#Brexit 17.4 million people voted for Brexit. We’re all getting pissed off with Theresa May & Jeremy Corbyn. Theresa May got the worst Deal ever it’s not Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn trying to stop Brexit the IDIOT. If we don’t get our Brexit we voted for TROUBLE Parliament Finished. 
Yes, there should be a referendum on the #Brexit deal because May’s deal is rubbish and I wish this whole #Brexit nonsense had never started.#PeoplesVote
The Sickest part of the #Brexit process has been the Weaponising of Youthful Fear. Adult Remainers are nothing but Political Groomers, gathering support with Lies, Fear & eventually the Mental & Physical sickness caused by Constant Stress piled onto kids.
"while the DUP could quite reasonably trumpet the evidence of its influence on the #WithdrawalAgreement,it may yet instead choose to threaten to cut off the hand that has fed it so well."I've a heavy @IrishTimesOpEd piece on #Brexit & @duponline today.

Sadly there is currently no idiot shortage… even if we may soon see food, medicine, radiotherapy, x-ray, and manufacturing shortages in the UK#brexit#trump
I call on our MPs to do their bloody job, for a change. Get together, there are about 400 of you who don't want #Brexit. Force a vote. Don't say there's no procedure for it, make one. It's way past time MPs earned their huge pay.
The most accurate #Brexit assessment to date. 
A no deal Brexit has always been the best possible outcome. You can not compromise with tyrants, even of the bureaucratic variety. #Brexit 
American Republican party contributed to #Brexit ... you can go to the bank that #Putin had his paws all over this!
Analysts at #Bernstein , one of the best-respected research houses on Wall Street, believe that the UK's #Brexit future is so unclear that the country is currently "uninvestable."  
Why would the EU force us into a deal with a backstop (to protect the Good Friday Agreement) which we can't get out of?It's almost like they don't trust us not to recklessly Leave international agreements we've made with them. #Brexit

Dense #Dorries just slammed May’s #Brexit plan because leaving the EU means the UK won't have any MEPs A new phrase enters the UKs lexicon. As thick as a Dorries.
Time for an exit on WTO terms then. #Brexit 
Jamie Bryson, Arlene Foster, Jim Allister and George From The Shankill all know better than business owners and farmers when it comes to the economic and agricultural impact of #Brexit. The idea of Arlene Foster lecturing *anyone* on fiscal responsibility is laughable.
#Brexit is an abandonment of the Left in Europe. We need to stay in the EU to lead a transformation for a truly social project, working alongside our brothers & sisters for @Another_Europe Please read and share my article in @Chartist48
We can’t even look after our patients now, so how much worse is this going to get after #Brexit? 
A reminder that in 2016 Farage and the Tory Right, including Raab were already preparing the ground for a 2nd referendum in the event of a Remain victory. And that was to be a straight replay, not a Final Say on the #BrexitDeal.They have no right to deny a #PeoplesVote!#Brexit 
Eventually this will mean less tax for the Treasury, which is why you hear persistent rumours about Mrs May selling off our NHS to the Americans. They're dying to get their hands on it, and it may be the only way to make the books balance if we #Brexit.
The nation voted for a pain free #Brexit............in 2016This is not a pain free #BrexitIt is 2018This is your #Brexit and the will of you.That breaks your duty as an MP.#PeoplesVote
Unfortunately, Mrs May has interpreted #Brexit as meaning leaving the Single Market. This is a disaster for our economy, as we make 80% of our GDP from services and there's no other free market that's as well developed for services as the SM./5.
It is @PeterBoneUK who is speaking rubbish. Nearly all food from developing countries coming to the UK is already tariff-free under EU agreements with third countries.Plus #Brexit is already costing the UK economy a staggering £800m a week
Kwasi Kwarteng thinks benefits should be a repayable loan, this sums up the modern @Conservatives, ffs i pray #Brexit implodes and a GE is called so we can sweep these callous bastards out of power for a generation at least #Marr
Voters in the Tory seats that #Labour hopes to gain, back a fresh #Brexit referendum, major study finds : 
In which Jeremy makes it TOTALLY clear he is 100 per cent committed to  #Brexit. Possibly more committed than May. #remain have to turn their back on him. The future is NOW. The country is in crisis. Corbyn is complicit
This idea that the EU has “bullied” Britain over #Brexit is dangerous and deluded nonsense. The EU has actually defended a red line of both UK and Europe - that the Good Friday Agreement must be upheld and a hard border avoided.   
.⁦@DUPonline⁩ hardens stance on May’s proposed #Brexit deal.‘It is time to work for a better deal which does not undermine UK integrity,’ says ⁦@NigelDoddsDUP⁩
No. There should be a first legal, fact based #Brexit referendum that treats the UK electorate with a modicum of intelligence. The electorate of the UK (#Leave and #Remain) deserved better than the 2016 debacle. We still do. #FinalSay

The #Brexit that was promised pre-ref was one in which we would all prosper, that the UK would benefit from, and which would cause NO harm. THAT is what I believe most leavers voted for, NOT what the reality has turned out to be. We have ALL been cheated. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay

Fascinating to read that Brexit is costing the UK an estimated £500 million a week. That's on top of the £350 million bus figure. So enjoy this national pageant of madness: the current bill is in the region of £850 million a week. That's a lot of hospitals.#Brexit

The establishment wants us to panic over no deal, but we should not fall for it:  #Brexit
My heart sank when I read this tweet. I've often wondered if this might be the case... My worst fears are realised. I was once a great supporter of the #EU but I voted to leave as I don't feel it's democratic enough. The whole #Brexit process has only deepened my dislike. #NoDeal
'Theresa May: Brexit won't be easier if I'm ousted'...it might be easier if we have someone who believes in brexit running the negotiations? #brexit
 As we’ve known for a while: Brexit was the warmup for #TrumpRussia. Now, new emails have surfaced that directly link Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica to allegedly ILLEGAL “fundraising” by #Brexit bad boy, Aaron Banks.
Some Conservative MPs have warned they will push Britain towards tighter relations with the EU or even turn against #Brexit altogether if “purists” in their party tear down Theresa May’s draft withdrawal deal.

You only resigned for your own skin! Don’t make out you stand for the people. A lot are homeless and fed through food banks because of you! UN report due out too condemning you. Very clever to make it about #brexit #WalkedBeforePushed #PleaseLetTheDoorHitYouOnTheWayOut
As @SkyNews reported on Friday night, the EU say that there can be no renegotiation of the 585-page #Brexit withdrawal agreement (UK negotiators agree with this view too!) but the 8-page outline of the future relationship is still subject to negotiations now  (THREAD) 
On #skynews this morning, @ThatTimWalker absolutely right. Severing our ties with the EU will create a "laboratory" for some of the most extreme right-wing experiments this country has ever seen.#brexit
If the #libdems had a leader actively undermining and opposing a policy passed at our conference in the way Jeremy Corbyn is towards the Lab conf motion on #Brexit options, s/he would not last long
Ken Clarke says it's time to talk to the option on #Brexit but not with the Corbynistas, who dominate the Labour front bench, as they're some of the most hardline eurosceptics in the House of Commons but with pro-EU Labour MPs. #peoplesvote #ridge #marr
No 1 in the iTunes charts. Cheers everyone.  (Sorry for knocking you off the top spot @GaryLineker and @prodnose but all in a good cause). As we chart these tumultuous times before the cliff edge of #Brexit and #Mueller indictments, do let us know what you want us to cover.
Economists (IMF, UBS, CER and others) say UK economy is already, in 2018, running at about 2% lower GDP as a result of #Brexit.That is a cost of of £40bn a year or £800m a week. Let that sink in.Let that sink in.Why would anyone in Parliament want to let this continue?
Huge respect for the determination of @carolecadwalla to reveal the dirty truth about the sinister alt right attempted coup that is  #Brexit , for which much of the current UK Tory Government was (and remains) merely, in the classic Leninist analysis,  a “useful idiot”.

Nigel #Farage is returning to the political fray – and this time he won't be holding back #Brexit
I know #Brexit is the only show in town at the moment but this is significant as it means we do not have strong voices for the North at the cabinet table which is yet another problem for the beleaguered PM and her failing Government #Northernpowerhousefail

Former #Brexit secretary @DominicRaab : “There were certainly dark forces in the commission, which you would hear rumbling that Northern Ireland was the price the U.K. must pay for leaving the EU.”
Brian Wilson yesterday: “#Brexit shows that breaking up Unions is complex and painful.”This is obviously becoming the new Unionist trope, lukewarm and insipid though it may be. Keep your eyes open for more on this theme.

Not true @KwasiKwarteng. Snap poll showed 59% support a #PeoplesVote. There is clear public appetite for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal:

Three final observations from our campaigning in #Morley yesterday:1. Die-hard Leave voters aren't so much angry about May's #Brexit deal, as frustrated. They feel worn down by it & tired. They won't fight for Brexit though. They want to get on with the rest of their lives./1 
Do you ever wonder if the ‘EU is a bully’ rhetoric is because we let the country be run by an upper class who’ve never been told no? You don’t always get your own way - the rest of the planet know this. #brexit
#TheresaMay said on #Ridge that Britain must go ahead with #Brexit to respect the will of the people. Shouldn’t she then check that it is still the will of the people, now that #BrexitReality is turning out to be very different from what was promised?#marr
Just switched on the telly to hear the PM on #Ridge suggesting @UKLabour are playing party politics voting against her #Brexit deal. The barefaced cheek of it when she can’t even get it passed by many in her own cabinet let alone her back benches. Are they all Corbynistas now?
#Labour members, activists, MPs and voters will feel a deep sense of betrayal as @jeremycorbyn fails to back @peoplesvote_uk @SophyRidgeSky It’s the only way out of #BrexitCrisis & ppl have a right to vote on #Brexit now we know what it is & what it means for all our futures

Theresa May is incapable of having a regular human conversation. She is talking to a media that already has her back, and will spin it in her favour, yet she still comes across as utterly stale, cold & clueless. #Ridge #Brexit #Brexit
PM: Leaving on the 29th March, 2019Then there’s the transition period and potentially a further extension of remaining in customs union depending on the back stop and that is a decision that needs to be made jointly, so the EU can veto the U.K. leaving.Got it?#ridge #brexit

Exactly! Both the US & UK got played by Putin, elections were tainted, and we should demand new elections on #Brexit and #POTUS. Our common mistake was carrying on as if our democracies had not been attacked. Putin & oligarchs counted on this.
Why is @theresa_may going to Brussels? Why not her new #Brexit secretary? Presumably, because like the last two, he's not allowed to negotiate. Amazed #Ridge isn't asking her about @DominicRaab's comments, nor picking her up on any other of her lies on borders, money, ECJ, etc.
Brilliant @mortenmorland #Brexit

There needs to be an urgent public Inquiry into #Brexit. No 10 is deeply implicated in all this, Theresa May personally blocked an investigation into Banks when she was Home Secretary. Parliament has to wake up and stop this coup. 
Corbyn is so on the fence over #brexit his backside must be full of splinters. Nothing is off the table but nothing is definitely on it either. Completely two faced and untrustworthy

This is very encouraging. In my humble opinion, the Tories need at least a 5 pt lead over Labour to win the next GE. When campaigning begins & Corbyn speaks with less establishment media filter, lies & spin, Labour's support increases. Bring it on #GTTO #Brexit 
It's obvious from your meetings that far from being patriotic and British, #Brexit is being driven by a transatlantic network funded by billionaires and businesses who hate the democracies that impose taxes and regulations on them. #BrexitBetraysBritain #Brexit #PeoplesVote
I have two pieces in this week’s @sundaybusiness. The first asks a #Brexit question: now that we’ve won, what should we do to help the UK? The second piece is part 2 of my series on what the state gets right when it comes to health, education and our children.

LISTEN: Last night's meeting in Helston convened by UKIP & @DerekThomasUK, @Conservatives MP for St Ives, was full of the usual fact-free bluster about #Brexit.  But #Cornwall for Europe's Joe Brook was there to challenge this - with surprising results...
listen to this arrogant feck , he wants all member states to hand over more power to EU #brexit 
There’s no chance of conjuring up a renegotiated #Brexit in 18 weeks left. Labour needs to immediately support a #PeoplesVote and campaign to remain in the EU.We can all now see what Brexit entails - it’s one of those things that just can’t be polished.

1. Even on a cursory inspection it is easy to see that May's deal is BRINO. The fault lies squarely with the ERG Tories. They failed to plan. Had they done so they would have had a better grasp of the issues and anticipated this ambush. #Brexit thread.

Prime Minister May’s 'Brexit Deal' Is an Insult to the British People  #Brexit 
I'm pretty sure most of the people who voted for #brexit weren't voting to have the #nhs betrayed to predatory US health care trusts as part of a "there's-no-alternative" US trade deal.
Why all the angst about a ‘second referendum’! We want a first legal, fact based #Brexit referendum that treats the UK electorate with a modicum of intelligence. The electorate of the UK (#Leave and #Remain) deserved better than the 2016 debacle. We still do. #FinalSay

The Euro crisis is still unresolved and the crazed EU elite is still hellbent on creating a superstate/empire. It's worth remembering what staying in would mean for Britain:  #Brexit
It's one of the few positives of #Brexit - it has shown up the startling incompetence of senior politicians in the @Conservatives and @UKLabour.The UK may or may not "deserve" better.But the UK certainly NEEDS politicians who are more than talking heads.

Talking of #Brexit, they think we’re morons. They really do.
The situation you describe shows just how ridiculous and futile #Brexit is. Friend A loses a job helping to safeguard our security and UK‘s security is weakened by losing access to EU data bases. I’d rather be safe than #Brexit just to get  *sovereignty* back.

For four years I have been one of the most vocal opponents of no deal, preferring instead what is termed "soft Brexit". So how can I now be in favour of no deal? Simply... because May's deal is not soft Brexit. It's not #Brexit at all.
I may differ with @angelasmithmp on how we move forward in relation to #brexit. But I know the value of a hard working local constituency Labour MP - which she is. These motions are destructive they undermine not strengthen @UKLabour
This is SO simple to understand. Before #Britain joined the #EU they were our waters & our fish. When we joined they became a 'common resource'. #Brexit would restore them to us. Any 'deal' that doesn't is a scam and not Brexit at all!
‘“The people want it” is not an argument’. Yes, it is. It’s the only argument. The “deal” we get is irrelevant. #Brexit has nothing to do with economics or trade. It’s much more important than that.
Young people don’t want #Brexit. It is time to stand up for our future, and give us a #PeoplesVote
The UK is becoming a failed state , focused on enriching a Tory elite and impoverishing the rest.  Moreover those in charge hate any and all attempts to do things differently in Scotland .  Yet far from being a solution  #Brexit will actually  exacerbate the problem…. 
John Humphreys on @BBCRadio4 just now on #Brexit. "Nobody has died" Jo Cox died.
May's #Brexit deal will destroy the country. It is a threat to national security.

My #Brexit prediction?  Having called the ERG's bluff, Theresa May will survive & UK will exit EU under the terms of this Withdrawal Agreement.  The EU Withdrawal Act will kick in and UKGovt will immediately gain powers to make law without Parliament.  Endgame. #AVeryBritishCoup

The Great Brexit Betrayal: MPs are anxious to get back to business as usual. The less brexity Brexit is, the happier they will be. The never intended to honour the vote. #Brexit 
The entire rule book for the referendum was set by a pro-EU PM and the whole negotiating process has been dictated by another pro-EU PM.  Is it any wonder that the prospect of a proper #Brexit has been fly tipped?  Democracy has become a plaything.

So much has been said to me about #Brexit "restoring pride" by friends I have in some of the most vulnerable communities in the whole of England. How can anyone be proud of a country like this? What has gone on - is going on - is utterly shameful. 
#Brexit & #TrumpRussia are the same scandal. Putin attacked NATO and has yet to face consequences. #Resist
Reading the latest on #Brexit. New definition of the lowest form of democracy: campaign for Brexit, negotiate Brexit, realise that Brexit is a disaster; then resign, blame others and challenge for leadership. I know that democracy is not perfect, but this is simply repugnant.

What you need to know about about Britain's #Brexit drama 
If UK rejected it and said ‘we’re leaving without a deal’ then I’m sure EU would come back on 28th March 2019 with a better offer! Problem is we’ve got a PM who never wanted to leave in the first place. EU needs unfettered access to UK market. #Brexit 
Exactly this.How much money have we wasted on #Brexit already?When we all know it isn't going to happen!Billions £££ to entertain #NigelFarage & #JacobReesMogg's little fantasy?I wish that money had been spent on the #NHS!
Life's tough. It's what we voted for. We voted to Leave the EU. Many people were too young to vote in the seventies. Then with Lisbon and Maastricht we had our British sovereignty taken away without even being asked! #Brexit
What about all the people who had no say when we joined 40 odd years ago? Also they were lied to and told it was "a common market" I voted #Brexit to stop cruel #liveexport which we HAVE to do under evil rules! Those poor innocents have a terrible future with death at the end

I’ve thought this for a while. Boris Johnson has already said he’d prefer to #Remain in the EU than to have May’s deal. After all he didn’t expect to win when he backed #Brexit it was just a tactical move for future leadership of the Tories.

Theresa May is hailed as a hero for doing her job and standing up in parliament for 3 hours. Meanwhile a nurse at your local hospital is on their way to a foodbank, having just finished a 12 hour shift. #UNvisit2018 #UniversalCredit #Brexit
EXCLUSIVE EXPRESS POLL: Readers say NO to May’s #Brexit deal as 86% REJECT plan 
Dear @StephenLloydEBN, it is time for you to put the welfare of the British people before the matter of your personal honour. Which comes first, your honour, or 65 million people?  #PeoplesVote #Brexit #LibDems
Surely, if you're PM and on the same day you're attacked by your own police federation and told by the UN poverty watchdog that your "ideological" policies have caused "unecessary harm" - it's time to go  #Brexit #UNvisit2018 #ToryPoliciesCausePoverty
So, which one of you wants to be the next #Brexit secretary? #BrexitAdvent
It’s getting really bad now in the UK. #TheresaMay #Brexit 
Today in NYC a CEO of one of the top 3 banks told me : France is welcoming Finance from London like Singapore did 10 years ago. They want the talent, the eco system , the business and the taxes that with comes with it. France is winning in Europe ! London is loosing. #Brexit

Talking to people in #Dublin today, although they are happy about the #IrishBorder compromise in the #BrexitDeal the concern is if it is voted downA story on RTEOne radio about New IRA weapons stocks makes me genuinely terrified of #NoDealBrexit#Brexit MUST be stopped! 
This will make for some interesting discussions in Cabinet! Amber Rudd supports a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay referendum on #Brexit if Theresa May's 'deal' is voted down by Parliament. I wonder how many other non-brexiter cabinet ministers privately share this view? 
#Remain is consistently ahead in polling & has been for many weeks now. Our campaigning across social media is making a positive difference.We all need to keep on keeping on. Making the arguments, showing the positives, welcoming #RemainerNow's to the #FBPE family.  #Brexit 
After more than 40 years of Eurosceptics banging that drum we had a referendum and @Nigel_Farage said it would be unfinished business if remain won 52:48. He fed us lies and now we understand what #brexit really means it is not unreasonable to have a #PeoplesVote

Where is JC? As limp & unappealing as the coat he wore to thecenotaph. Serious Lab MPs are so frustrated with front bench befuddlementover #Brexit @LibDems have always said it will need a new vote. A view now shared by majority #PeoplesVote
Lee, Lee, that's a pretty large chip on your shoulder mate. Neither side of the #brexit argument was particularly well informed. The whole episode laid bare the worst prejudices in our society. This applies to everyone who voted, irrespective of their "class".
Can you imagine it. The #UnitedKingdom failing to get a proper #Brexit and then the Italians succeeding. How embarrassing that would be.
So, Corbynistas, you’ve been saying for two years now that Labour couldn’t oppose Brexit because we didn’t know if the deal would pass the ‘six tests’, well now we do, and it doesn’t, so why aren’t Labour opposing Brexit? Why do you respect a vote from 2016, but not 2017? #Brexit
Can brits ever leave any place without making a complete mess and confusion? #Brexit
What does Gary Neville know about #Brexit? 
UN Special Rapporteur: There's been almost no discussion of the effect of Brexit on poverty – but poorer people will bear the brunt of the economic fallout from it. Brexit will make the economic concerns which contributed to the vote to leave EU worse #austerity #Brexit #poverty
When I was a child I set out to dig to Australia, the goal was clear and straightforward, and I was sure it could be achieved with sufficient effort and persistence.#brexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE
Seattle got to vote twice on a baseball stadium, a large new park, and a city-wide monorail system. Seems to me that voters in the UK should get to vote twice on motherfucking #Brexit.
ThisIf #Brexit just went away the majority of people would be a lot happier, it would become a distant memory in no time 
Joking aside, this chap should actually be Prime Minister; laugh if you will, but I think you’d be surprised at his tenacity and brilliance. God knows we need some strong leadership and values now more than ever. #Brexitchaos #Brexit @Jacob_Rees_Mogg #CurseReesMogg
We've voted, we won, they didn't expect it, it wasn't supposed to happen. Now May deliberately makes the worst deal in history, a deal so bad it would be better if we had stayed in. And thats it, that's been the plan all along. #Brexit #HardBrexit #MayMustGo #MayMustGoNow

I'm 18 and a British citizen and I cannot vote to remove Jean Claude Juncker from power. This'll impact my future to a large extent and tbh, I feel my future is being greatly damaged by this. We, British people, have been stripped of our democratic sovereignty. Time to #Brexit. 
Name check @mrjamesob ! The #Brexit Fantasy Goes Down in Tears 
JACOB Rees-Mogg finally puts forward the ERG's candidate to replace Theresa May "Nanny can deliver a #Brexit that works for everyone I know in the Tory party. It worked in 1952 and I have no doubt that it can work again today" 
Not getting involved in the #Brexit debate, BUT this did make me chuckle!  
If you didn't object to a second General Election in 2017, you can't complain if the #PeoplesVote want to give folks a chance to change their minds on #Brexit.
Sadly all the events around #Brexit have subsumed the findings from UN’s Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty. 14 million ppl, that’s 1/5 in this country are now in poverty. And almost 1 out of every 2 *children* are in poverty. Austerity policies have punished poor & BME ppl. 
In our next #BrexitIsPersonal film, Debbie's been forced to make decisions she would never have had to make if it wasn't for #Brexit. What would you do?    /1 
Britain risks a “brain drain” after #Brexit, with a quarter of young workers considering leaving the country to pursue opportunities overseas. Why stay in a economically declining country that treats you and your values with total contempt.#PeoplesVote
BREAKING: CBI backs May's #Brexit deal.I wonder why 1) EU is CBI’s largest source of public sector funds, £7 million+2) CBI received £955,484 from Euro Comm, 2009 - 20153) CBI campaigned to Remain & join the Euro4) Undermined case for #EURef
So everyone complaining about #Brexit. The vote was 51.89 in favour for and 48.11 against. Don’t know why we don’t have a revote !!! So many people voted for are now against
You'll be doing nothing of the sort. Your role is to take orders from unelected remainer civil servant Olly Robbins. If you really believe in #Brexit then, please stand down. May's lashed herself to the mast; you don't have to suffer her fate too. #StandUp4Brexit #MayMustGoNow
Tony Blair: This #brexit deal isn't a compromise.. it's capitulation. Remainers & Leavers need to come together & understand there is only 1 way of ending the argument & reuniting the country.. the British people must resolve the matter. Gut-wrenching Labour not  leading on this. 
Keep up the great work team @RemainerNow! Mounting evidence that more & more people across the country are changing their mind on #Brexit and embracing a #PeoplesVote, especially #Labour voters, who are overwhelmingly pro #RemainWe stand with them. Brexit is not inevitable

Pity #TheresaMay didn’t make Chris Grayling #Brexit Secretary - we’d have been guaranteed that it would have been delayed.

The whole point of the #EU is that the best deal goes to members. For non members the more membership conditions you agree to the better the deal. How any #brexit zealot doesn't get this is beyond me. It isn't a conspiracy. It is the whole point of the EU.

This morning BBC radio 4 went chatting to people in Mansfield about #brexit.These 2 voters opted for #leave in 2016 #euref, they are getting older and were concerned about NHS funding. But now they see the £350 pledge is not possible they are #remainernowRespect.#PeoplesVote
EVERYONE should read this report. #Austerity was always a political choice to strangle the poor while stuffing the rich. This is the record of Tory's dogmatic, dangerous ideology and is why we need a #GeneralElectionNow more than a #PeoplesVote. #Brexit
.@SkyNews are you serious right now? The UN has just given an incredibly damning press conference re the Tories unnecessary and reckless damage to this country's poor, and you take a break from #Brexit only to discuss the comedy wildlife photo awards?
Schrodinger's Tory MP:"I can't support May's botched #Brexit deal, it's wrong for the country""I can't support a leadership election against May, she must be allowed to carry on with Brexit" 
My Munster mistake was pretty hilarious, but one of the most powerful men in the EU- to whom Mrs May wants to utterly capitulate- turned up at a press conference wearing one black shoe & one brown shoe. I think that tops it all. #Brexit
Meanwhile...Sky News just now? "It's not all about #Brexit today" *holds breath* "It's also about the coveted Wildlife comedy photo awards"...
If @UKLabour want a GE they may get a nasty surprise While they continue to support #Brexit I like millions of others wont vote for them #stopbrexit #PeoplesVote #OptionToRemain @Remain_Labour
You know if Government cancelled #Brexit on the quiet and just got on with other stuff maybe no one would notice
#Brexit is like two children ripping a doll apart because one wants to dress it in a tracksuit and the other prefers dungarees but in fact it's already wearing a tuxedo.
"Britain's two child tax credit limit is akin to China's one child policy. Effectively, Britain's poor are only allowed to have two children"My goodness me. We knew this would be bad for the Tories, but this is next level. Get them out.#UniversalCredit #GTTO #Brexit

Two devoted Brexiteers @montie & @MrTCHarris have both come out in favour of May’s deal in the last 24 hours. They campaigned tirelessly for #Brexit. Their arguments deserve a hearing.
The UK is in this #Brexit mess because a handful of Tory xenophobes stirred up trouble so they could make political gain. A country mugged off by a bunch of self centred lying barrowboys. A half decent PM would have seen them off well before June 2016.
#Brexit is an ugly public divorce. Europe should stay together for the sake of the kids! 
Theresa May has compared her Brexit approach to the playing style of Geoffrey Boycott. Here's what he said about #Brexit. 
James O'Brien explained why the claims of Brexit allowing us to "take back control" are a complete myth.@mrjamesob | #Brexit
This 'limited edition' #Brexit mug pretty much sums everything up 
Many have previously crossed swords with Pete about the best means of delivering Brexit but May’s deal has now changed the situation. A democratic line must indeed be drawn in the sand with all brexiteers standing behind it. This is an excellent blog.#Brexit

Dear @UKLabour, are you a #Remain party, or are you still clinging on to the deluded, respect the vote achieved by cheating & breaking the law, cake & eat it jobs first #Brexit party?Your response is going to define your future, so it's important you climb down off the fence.
#Brexit negotiations: @MichelBarnier 2016-2018.No punishment, not revenge, not blame game. In a spirit of transparency & telling the truth about consequences for both EU & UK. From day one until the last day. With respect for a great country that will remain ally and partner.
Call me cynical, but I predict that the Tories will announce this "no confidence" vote at the exact same time the UN poverty envoy releases his sure-to-be damning findings into the impact of their policies at midday today.  #Brexit #UniversalCredit

The #pound has steadied after enduring its biggest one-day decline for more than two years amid Thursday’s #Brexit deal chaos.
Is this mic on? Testing... testing... Right. As new indictments loom in the US, @peterjukes and @carolecadwalla are about to launch an urgent new podcast about everything #Trump #Russia #Brexit and why Britain needs its own Mueller style special inquiry.
Today @Conservatives have a choice between the U.K. or the EU.  If they chose U.K. and ditch @theresa_may, install a #brexit PM they can recover. If they chose the EU and betray the electorate, they will pay a heavy price for decades to come.

I'm finding it truly offensive to hear people saying hard #Brexit will be OK because we survived two world wars. 80 million people didn't survive. Gov choosing this pointless & damaging policy isn't remotely comparable to decision to go to war to protect freedom from Nazism. 
There ya go: "A group of French-led #EU member states including Denmark, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands have called for changes to fishing arrangements in the draft #Brexit deal agreed between London and Brussels"
@LowTaxChloe  referencing May has had a good go at keeping UK in the EU but it's failed. Natural course of action as they will not compromise is a WTO trade deal. I'm for #Brexit so happy with that outcome. Makes sense.
#Brexit voters have watched for two years as our vote was attacked, our intellectual capacity was called into question, and our democratic rights were threatened. But we should be patient no more, says Brendan O’Neill #BrexitDeal
While the government tears itself apart over #Brexit, here in the Liverpool City Region we are putting people first by investing in our communities through a transformational half a billion pound fund.Find out more about last Friday's announcement here:
May told a caller on LBC that Brexit meant having more money to spend on public services - including £394m on the NHS. She’s wrong. #Brexit means we have less money, not more, to spend on the NHS.Listen from 15:00: 
BREAKING: ‘NO NEGOTIATION!’ Merkel SLAMS DOOR on more #Brexit talks as EU angrily reacts.May's treachery will not get through parliament, EU won't renegotiate. Let's walk away and flick the finger.

#Brexit..absolutism & ideology informing DUP stance. Reality: people & farmers challenged daily to sustain income & jobs. DUP hoisted with their own petard. Nationalism felt abandoned by Theresa May then she affords NI special status: DUP’s notion of exceptionalism shattered 
I keep on seeing people commending Theresa May for having worked hard. There is nothing commendable in working hard at doing something foolish and self-destructive. There is a British failing in valuing hard work over intelligent work.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #BrexitDeal

BREAKING: #Brexit bombshell - BBC's Laura Kuenssberg REVEALS the REAL reason Dominic Raab resigned.IN a nut shell, AFTER Raab agreed the October draft this was changed by unknown forces. Probably May and Olly Robbins. #Snakes
The UK should also use its #Magnitsky legislation to hold to account those responsible for the horrific killing of Jamal #Khashoggi. @theresa_may's decision to postpone implementation of the UK Magnitsky amendment until after #Brexit is unacceptable. 
FOM is GOOD for us. It gives us rights and freedoms to live or work in 27 others countries. It enables us to extend our families and our opportunities. In a financial sense FOM greatly benefits the UK. So why stop it? ONE reason - XENOPHOBIA. It's fucking shameful #Brexit
Main question I get from German media today is What happens if Parliament rejects May's #Brexit deal?⁦@CER_Grant⁩ has written a very good summary of the options. But there are three caveats from an EU27 perspective:
Don't be fooled by Jacob Rees-Mogg. He's only interested in forcing a "No Deal" #Brexit scenario from which he's protected his wealth.Economic crises represent misery for the 99%, but for multi-millionaires & predatory arch capitalists, it's where they make the biggest bucks.
For 3 centuries England has lorded it over Scotld. We have had to accept Westmr rules, with no influence on the rules.  In terms of the #EU #TheresaMay 's #Brexit deal has reduced the UK to the status of Scotland.  All credit to her.  #BrexitChaos #Gove
#Brexit #shmexit this Bottlenose dolphin has a distinct #FridayFeeling look about him

The only way to restore confidence in parliament is to have a #GeneralElection, where each party sets out their #Brexit position. Yet the country is once again being held to ransom while the Tories fight a civil war.They don't a give a toss about the "National interest"
"We would ask the DUP to consider voting for this deal"Wesley Aston Chief Executive of the Ulster Farmers Union to @StephenNolan #Brexit 
#Brexit/ @StephenNolan big moments for @duponlie. RHI sword of Damocles hanging over DUP. Bloodline of business/farming bodies support May deal. Normally silver tongued Jeffrey D dropped ball last night  @bbctheview challenging capacity of business/farmers to read. Seminal moment
It is clear that @UKLabour want a General Election.Well let me be clear, if you want my vote then your manifesto must be clear and unambiguous on a #Remain position.I will not vote for a jobs first #Brexit
May's abuse of the rights of the #the5million has been so gross that she and several of her cabinet ministers belong in jail.  I for one will campaign for that to happen regardless of the outcome of Brexit.#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
The #EU are our friends. @Jacob_Rees_Mogg & the ERG lunatics are the enemies of this country, determined to impoverish us with #nodeal #brexit is collapsing, the lies have been exposed. Time to #stopbrexittime to #remain
You can just imagine it can't you?"Shit shit this #Brexit sitch is getting us loads of bad press.""Quick! Someone call Corbyn an anti-semite!"Classic Tory tactic.  #Bbcqt #GTTO
Hey .@nusuk any outcome yet on the #JessBradley investigation. Taking nearly as long as #Brexit. A draft result even?
Very odd myth peddled by Remain that the country is in thrall to ERG Ultras. On the contrary, the problem is #Brexit led by Remainers: May, Hammond, Robbins, Whitehall. The result - this appalling, abject travesty.
Friendly Friday reminder for those who may need it;1. The DUP does not speak for the people of the 6c on #Brexit 2. The proposed Backstop will not and cannot change the constitutional position of the 6c, that was dealt with in the GFA in 1998. 
This weekend campaigners will be out in communities across the UK campaigning for a #PeoplesVote because they're #NotBuyingIt when it comes to this #Brexit deal.Make a difference in your local community and come and join us!
#Brexit The Ulster Farmers Union has thrown its full weight behind the Theresa May Brexit package flying in the face of the DUP’s stance. @StephenNolan. If Jeremy Corbyn failed to win a General election given the turmoil in Tory ranks he too would have to resign as party leader.
You could read an awful lot of #Brexit commentary today if you wanted to. You shouldn't though. Just read @CER_Grant's take on what happens if MPs say no to the deal Mrs May has put in front of them.

Shout out to my colleague who acutely noticed that @michaelgove was carrying a @valeriecafe bag in front of UK press today. Their CEO, Paul MAY, just resigned - which the world only knows thanks to @MattChorley. WAS THIS DELIBERATE? Is it a subtle message? #maysresign #Brexit

Actually, she lived through it in Rotterdam. It was known as the hungerwinter. Eating grass & tulip bulbs, no fuel, no clothes, shoes, nothing. Daily executions, fear, deportations, bombings etc. No wonder the loved the British so much pre #brexit! Alas..@stopbrexitsavebritain

Theory: #brexit was never about #Brexit, it’s just that all the other issues in the U.K. had been totally resolved, and we needed a project to focus on, you know, like taking up model railways when you retire, to keep us busy.
Sterling volatility is approaching emerging market levels. 1-month implied sterling/dollar vol almost as high as South African rand and Turkish lira vol, and is actually now higher than Brazilian real/dollar vol. #Brexit 
Dear @HackedOffHugh - I feel very strongly that a new party is for the future.  There's only one fight now to #EndTheChaos - the fight for a democratic people's vote on the real #Brexit options.  Once resolved, turn to the broken political & policy infrastructure across the UK. 
More evidence this guy’s judgement is terrible, Canada. #BrexitChaos #Brexit 
Thousands are joining this massive open letter to MPs to give the people a final say on #Brexit -- add your name! 
The Prime Minister has become a political zombie. Shuffling around media studios insisting her rotting Withdrawal Agreement delivers for Britain. It's beyond embarrassing now, isn't it? Just GO #Brexit
The fundamental mistake May and her sycophants made was to think the EU would want to offer us a good deal. It is simply not in their best interests. THAT is why No Deal is way and by far the best option. #Brexit
If you can tear yourself away from David Davis, Michael Gove, James Brokenshire #Brexit or #r4today for a moment...Here’s the UN Special Rapporteur on Extreme #poverty and #HumanRights about to report on his findings after investigating the impact of austerity in the U.K.
A reminder that @Alston_UNSR will be making his end of #UK mission statement today. His messages about #poverty and #HumanRights in this country must not be lost in the #Brexit clamour. 
The hard Brexiteers have had their shot at #Brexit. They've tried and failed which is why Gove is so indecisive about taking the job.They are left with 2 options:1) Betray their supporters + go back on their word to accept the deal offered by HMG, or 2) Support a #PeoplesVote
Confused by the #Brexit chaos? This is probably the best primer I've seen so far. Start here if it all seems impenetrable.
What needs to be said: #Merkel and Juncker are playing a risky game with #BrexitAgreement – and apparently it's going to blow up in their faces. #Brexit or #NoBrexit? Even #NoDeal is better than the betrayal that is going on in Berlin and Brussels...
Why the PM’s Deal is not #Brexit: We will be rule takers not rule makers We won’t control our laws We won’t have control of our money We won’t have control of our borders It stops us agreeing trade deals#StandUp4Brexit Details 
This is shame and dereliction of duties. Eng. Yarisow, Mayor of #Mogadishu, should be more concerned about the plight of Mogadishu residents than #Brexit. 
Mrs May @theresa_may would have you believe that if you reject her deal then No Deal becomes inevitable. It does not, she has even said it herself, there is a third option, Stop #Brexit. It is the only option that will preserve the jobs, economy and our precious union.
Brexit is out of control. If our politicians are serious about acting in the national interest, they should get their heads together and form an emergency national unity government to navigate through this mess.#Brexit #BrexitDeal #BrexitChaos
From now on, Feeling like commenting on #Brexit only in psychoanalytical terms. The sight, seen from Europe, is one of utter inextricable folly.
#Gold prices rose, as investors sought safe haven assets amid fears of #Brexit, and is trading at 1214.48 at the time of writing. Its a good time to take a look at the world's official Gold holdings by tons. *Your Capital is at risk.
Someone who voted #Brexit apologises live on air on @mrjamesob's show -- "What have I done to my country?" -- and James offers him serious compassion.... and tells him where the blame should actually be placed.  This is passionate, compassionate broadcasting at its best.
He still wants a General Election first and then a #PeoplesVote.That really doesn't sound to me like it's the right way round.Once #Brexit is finished, Labour are a real contender.As long as they continue to say 'we can negotiate a better Brexit' they are not credible.
.@IanBlackfordMP: If we crash out of the single market and customs union it will cost jobs and living standards. No one voted to become poorer - and we all have a responsibility to our constituents to find a sensible way through this #Brexit 
We need to go full-time, full-on, to save #Brexit.  We carried on 365 days a year since 23 June 2016 and have exhausted our own resources.  Can you help? Pls WATCH VIDEO HERE: 
So much anger about today.Some feel lied to...Some are fed up with being told they would have voted differently if they’d known...Some can’t believe it’s taken this long...There aren’t many who have any faith in our leaders...A real test of our togetherness #Brexit
All of that. But also “incompetence, intransigence, inflexibility, arrogance, unrealism and an utter inability to communicate”. The failings of this #brexit shambles are all HER failings. She should have had these conversations from the start. 
France's Liberation: “The farce of #Brexit, sold to the British by a gang of irresponsible nationalists, is coming to a (provisional) conclusion as clownish as the antics of one of its most virulent advocates, Boris Johnson." 
On my mind today: ‘In politics, if you want something said, ask a man.  If you want something done, ask a woman’ - Margaret Thatcher.  I don’t agree with May on any level, but you’ve got to admire her grit and resilience.  She is doing her best in an impossible situation. #Brexit
There’s one reason and one reason only the SNP won’t call for a general election - they know Labour are on the march #Brexit
From John McDonnell to Michael Gove, ‘I would negotiate a better deal with the EU’ has become the new Cakeism in #brexit Britain. As ever, no reason given why EU would reopen negotiations....
A few reminders about Govey ~ or 'Knifeman'.1. He ***ed up education2. He ****ed up #Brexit3, He ****ed up the environment4. HE WAS FRONT MAN for #voteleave5. He wouldn't know 'truth' if it bit him in the bum6. He 's a Trumpet "Michael Gove" #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #finalsay
Ireland has highest level of 3rd level grads among 30 somethings in Europe. This is the sort of massive social change I talk about in my new book #RenaissanceNation - eduction, drives tolerance, driving economic vibrancy, while our neighbours are engulfed by #Brexit madness! 
#Brexit Brexit Brexit Brexit Brexit. Bored with it just get on and do it for 17.4 million that voted leave the EU. Put some brilliant music  on get away from Brexit. Everyday politicians & journalists going on about it every bloody MINUTE.  
Prime Minister @theresa_may discusses #Brexit with her fellow countrymen/women on UK Radio show.Wonder when will PM @narendramodi ever take questions on key issues (#Demonetisation, #GST, #Rafale, #Jobs, #BankDefaulters, #BetiBachaoBetiPadhao and much else) from the open press?
Progress on #Brexit, which should have been delivered months ago, looks very likely to stall again. This is fundamentally a characteristic of politics – which is why it remains so important that it doesn’t dominate our lives.Today's @CityAM column:
If we remain or sign this deal we'll be saying to the people of the United Kingdom, who have waited all this time to have a voice, that their votes weren't worth a damn and they will remain voiceless. In so doing we destroy all trust. THAT is more dangerous than no deal #Brexit.
As regards the whole sorry saga of #Brexit no one appears to be even embarrassed by the unholy mess of it all - then I saw the artwork proposed for the British Mint’s 2019 50 pence coin. 
Hang on ! The remainers have spent two years saying @Nigel_Farage and @BorisJohnson were  wrong to stand by that bus saying 350 million a week would go to the #NHS MAY has just said 394 million would go to the NHS a week ! So the  us was right! #Brexit 
PM committing to spending an extra £350m+ a week on the NHS once we leave the EU.  Doubling down on the pre-referendum promise.Where’s that bus? @LBC #brexit 
Says it all - Fraser used to be the civil service head of the Foreign Office #brexit 
No 10 lied last night, and Theresa May is misleading the country again this morning with Nick Ferrari on @LBC @NickFerrariLBC - the ECJ will still have jurisdiction as part of the withdrawal agreement - and she should be challenged on this. #Brexit 
Speaking to Belgian broadcaster VRT, economist Paul de Grauwe says it is “unprecedented for a country to inflict so much damage on itself”. #Brexit

French paper Le Figaro sees “no majority for the accord on the table, no majority for a no-deal accord, no majority for a new referendum. A total impasse.” #Brexit 
And yet "no Brexit" was expressly rejected by the voters in the biggest democratic mandate in history #Brexit #BrexitDeal
Harsh this, but you know the pitchblacksteed rules: if it’s funny it goes up...#BrexitChaos #Brexit...image via @AndyBL
We are now approaching the moment where Britain’s imagined power comes face to face with its actual power. #Brexit
1. There is No Compromise...May's attempt to find one is falling apart.There is no #Lexit..all versions = Tory #Brexit..all Remove Rights w/o Consent, Threatens Jobs Public Services & are far worse than to #Remain.A choice betweenPay & Obey No Say & No Deal is not a choice.
A wee reminder: This document of the @scotgov was published in Dec., 2016The Scottish government was the only one to publish a plan for #Brexit. They have remained faithful to this plan & they were never allowed to participate in the negotiating table  
What would the draft #Brexit deal mean for the key issues for #architecture – trading with the EU, mutual recognition of professional qualifications and the status of European architects working in the UK? Find out what you need to know 
UK Gov's #Brexit negotiating team, headed up by the overgrown schoolboy Oily Robbins, managed to come home with a shopping list for the EU, rather than a deal.They were sent to the corner shop, on an errand, like kids.End this national embarrassment.
David Davis was a terrible #Brexit Secretary. He could hardly be bothered to go to Brussels & rapidly lost respect there. Preposterous for him now to suggest that EU deliberately delayed negotiations. They spent months waiting for him to engage..
Hearing lots of speculation about @michaelgove. He needs to stay where he is and focus on the important stuff. A strong #EnvironmentAct is more important to our future and our childrens'  future than #Brexit 
Brilliant comment about #Brexit by chap on @r4Today Brexit is like asking whether you want to shoot yourself, poison yourself or drown yourself, and I don’t want any of those! Sums it up well.  Let’s put it back to the country @peoplesvote_uk
Brexit explained in 6 sec#BrexitChaos #Brexit  
The media could go a long way in helping us end this #Brexit crisis if they confronted these charlatansWhy are they not saying to Davis for example: "you believed that we could do unilateral deals with Germany. You didn't understand the EU so how do you have any credibility?" 
“In the imperial imagination, there are only two states: dominant and submissive, coloniser and colonised” ⁦@fotoole⁩ on the myths underpinning #brexit

As we pore over the nuances of #Brexit again today take a moment to remember the people of Paradise. Up to 700 residents have been burned alive in a place they called home
'Europe is not only facing #Brexit from the #EU, but we may also see a #Ruxit, #Russia leaving the European Convention on Human Rights #ECHR.  It will be a different Europe, and I don’t see any good things coming out of it'.

If we sign this deal we are flushing our democracy down the toilet. It's time to walk away. #Brexit 
Mr Gove is considering his cabinet position#Brexit 
Every time I see, hear (or even think about) May, Farage, Mogg etc. it adds to my resolve to help in whatever ways I can to prevent the UK from succumbing to their ultra-right, populist nationalism and to the idiocy that is #Brexit. I'm never far from disgust at these people. 
#TheresaMay says people voted for #Brexit & #BrexitMeansBrexit so she must deliver on the "Willofthepeople2016"I think people voted for £350m per week for our NHS. Which did actually mean something to them& Now we know that #Brexit means death - people should have a #FinalSay
Dear Britain aka United Kingdom  You gave us & the world modern Democracy & told us vox populi, vox Dei ... Britons voted for #Brexit .... You cannot approbate & reprobate on the Referendum Results ... Not to crash out of Europe will be utter betrayal of what you taught us.
TIME FOR NEW LEADER, NEW DIRECTIONAILING @theresa_may’s deal backed by FEWER than one in five in #Britain#BRITISH people decide they've been #betrayed by May's FAKE #BREXITONLY a NEW leader can deliver the REAL #Brexit the #British people voted for 
Prime Minister @theresa_may faces another difficult day as she defends her #Brexit deal.
“All along, it feels like this has been characterised by timidity.”The eloquent @portilloandhen sums up the problem with the PM’s #Brexit plan & that trust is now a big issue & suggests that the backstop could be handled differently#StandUp4Brexit
Anyone who now says we shouldn't have another referendum is basically saying "we know that the British people no longer want #Brexit, but we're going to push it through anyway." In what world is that democratic?#PeoplesVote
Of all the things I'll be talking about in the pub tonight, #brexit will not be one of them! 
Will the last person to leave Downing Street please turn out the lights....#Brexit  
TIME TO GO. Forget Geoffrey Boycott - Mrs May is the Roy Hodgson of British politics and, like Hodgson, whatever she tries in the future her career will always be marked by the utter humiliation delivered to our country - Chequers her Iceland. #csm #brexit

People who brought us #brexit run away from responsibility for brexit because they know well they cannot deliver it. It’s so much fun to leave it to Remainers and then critisise them non-stop for not being able to deliver.
It's about time @BBCNews properly interviewed this guy. He has shown more dedication and commitment to his #Brexit policy than any politician. He should be on #bbcqt or @BBCPolitics
This is priceless!#BrexitChaos #Brexit 
What’s the best way to organise #Brexit? Amid the chaos in Westminster, I’m at a brewery in Edinburgh talking to businesses about what they want from the deal. Join us on @BBCBreakfast.
Good morning from #Germany, where it is more and more worthwhile to go to London for christmas shopping. Pound is undervalued by 8.3% vs the Euro when measured by the Big Mac Index due to #Brexit chaos. 
If I were in Theresa Mays shoes I'd offer the #Brexit secretary job to @Jacob_Rees_Mogg but it would have to be at  gun point. otherwise he'd run a mile from any responsibility for making his lies come true
US $ down to INR 71+, crude oil down to $64, British £ down to 92. #Brexit & rise in Iranian oil supplies post-waivers kicking in

Just take the hard Brexit, @theresa_may. There is no other choice. #BrexitChaos #Brexit
"There is more time for negotiation - we're not due to leave until March. What we need to do is get rid of #TheresaMay, get a #primeminister who voted for #Brexit... Go back to #Brussels and stop kowtowing to the #EuropeanUnion." We salute you, Sir.
"The #Brexit we are going through is one Brexit of many possibilities & this particular one is the one that #TheresaMay has chosen. It is a product of her personality, of her policy choices and also frankly, of her limitations as a prime minister.

If the #Brexit vote taught us anything, it was that funding for education in this country was far below what was required to produce intelligent, analytical, reasoned thought. Instead, we have the @darrengrimes_ types who, with no experience, just bleat out tired old predudices.
#Brexit agreement is oddly European: hard to achieve, fragile, divisive. A 2 minute tour of the 600 pages... @cnni @holmescnn
I hope all those "lifelong Labour members" who ripped-up their membership cards and joined the Lib Dems to oppose #Brexit are feeling suitably embarrassed.  via @skwawkbox
Julian #Assange's prosecution today means he could be handed over to the US at any moment now - I guess today's #Brexit negotiations were the best possible time to do that.Certainly will make sure the focus is elsewhere. Nice use of a distraction in the news cycle there.
Each part of the UK clearly want and more importantly need different things, with that in mind:POLL: Do you think we should explore the option of breaking up the UK and give full control to the people of England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland? #BrexitChaos #brexit #UK

Little bit of perpetuating myth that EU won’t budge from their current position on WA. Total nonsense if they r terrified enough by new Tory leader determined to front up for Managed No Deal. Shortness of macroeconomics reality on display on #bbctw with that! #Brexit
I hope the MPs of this country will not submit to the fear tactics of ‘the unknown’ & stand fast in their rejection of the agreement placed before them that will betray every promise made on #Brexit - has anyone dared whisper #HardBrexit yet? They need to.. #BrexitChaos
That's Us Fucking #Brexit pic.twitter.com/VaK4alQ4Y7
At a time when we're being let down heroically by our MPs consider the epic dishonesty of the Labour LeadershipThey'll fix #Brexit by calling for a GE we have no time for, so that they can go re-negotiate a Unicorn deal which the EU absolutely won't even entertainReally? 
Mrs May's @theresa_may aim was to produce a deal that suited everyone, instead she has produced a deal that suits no-one.Stopping #Brexit is now the only option.
We had a vote on #Brexit so we should just accept it? Hmm. Imagine if you could only have one driving test?
#bbcqtLab and Cons have had two years to educate the electorate to the consequences of #Brexit They chose to hide behind a flawed vote, but even worse than this cowardice. They hid the facts of #Brexit with them.
Barry Gardner's respectful and dignified response to vile Claire Perry's personal attack on Jeremy Corbyn was the highlight of the night. Bravo Sir! #bbcqt #brexit
Bed, bed I couldn't go to bed, my head's too light to try to set it down. Sleep, sleep I couldn't sleep tonight, not for all the...#Brexit in the drown.
When the president of another continent cares more about our country and #brexit than our own PMSad times.
Cannot believe what I've just witnessed on #bbcqt regarding Claire Perry insulting Jeremy Corbyn like that!She has spent the entire programme blaming and bashing Labour instead of answering questions regarding her Party.She's an embarrassment to Politics!!#Brexit
The well-groomed & terribly-gentlemanly @timothy_stanley is playing this panel & audience like a boss.  Nailed this totally.#Brexit was a binary choice - why do Remoaners struggle to understand that?#bbcqt
To the audience member who asked why the parties can’t work together on #Brexit I think @claireperrymp’s complete meltdown and slanderous attack on @jeremycorbyn explains it all. A shame, because #Labour’s Shadow Brexit Team are so much better than anyone on the Tory side. #bbcqt
Will the many politicians in Westminster still cowering in the face of a 2.5 year old referendum vote, finally start to pay attention to the change in public opinion? Or will they continue to behave as if democracy ended on June 23 2016?#Brexit #BrexitDeal #PeoplesVote
#Brexit..@bbctheview .. where is all this going? DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson now telling the NI business farming/ community they don’t understand what they are reading. This is unJeffrey. Is this not insulting?
From an audience member on  @bbcquestiontime ‘Jeremy Corbyn has been absent for two years - only the @theSNP and @Plaid_Cymru have been fighting #Brexit’. #bbcqt
"None of us voted to destroy the economy" says Barry Gardiner.Correct.But the govt's impact studies all conclusively show that every form of #Brexit will severely damage the economy.We need a #PeoplesVote so the people can confirm their desire to be poorer.Or not.  #bbcqt
How condescending is @claireperrymp? “MPs must realise they’re not writing Santa’s Christmas letters”With attitudes like that from the #Tory party is it any wonder that there has been no cross-party working on #Brexit?This is a mess of the #Tories own creation #bbcqt
Barry Gardiner totally cleared up Labours #Brexit position on #bbcqt there. Said no one ever.Jeremy Corbyn & the Labour party are as complicit in this #BrexitChaos as Theresa May & the Tories - inc the ERG.They have been all over the shop, before, during & after the referendum
It’s eight days to the DUP’s annual conference. Imagine being Arlene Foster’s speechwriter. #Brexit

This bloke in the #bbcqt audience thinks we should go ahead with a no-deal #Brexit because it won't be any worse than World War 2.This is about all the Brexiters have left now, and they genuinely don't understand how ridiculous they sound.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
Leaving with a No-Deal outcome wouldn’t be the final outcome. The only way the British government can now take back control of the negotiations is to declare a no deal WTO leave. This would sharpen the EUs focus.#Brexit

Great, I spent the last 20 years disowning fellow Muslims who commit terrorism, now I have to spend the next 20 years disowning fellow PPEists like David Cameron #brexit 
Another side effect of @theresa_may #remain deal is we’d continue to pay all import duties over to Brussels. Currently around £77m per week (not incl in our £350m/wk members fees ) It’s hardly taking back control of our money is it ??? #Brexit #BrexitResignations

Theresa mays #Brexit plan finally unites a bitterly divided nation in agreeing its just shit
Perhaps the most eye-watering move in the #Brexit chaos today has been the steepening of the long-end, Citi says. Uncertainty is dominating bearish drivers like fiscal risk (which becomes more of a concern if a general election is called). The 10s30s curve is 9bps steeper.

No nation needs to sign a 585-page agreement in order to leave the EU profitably. It simply leaves the EU, abolishes tariffs and quotas, and starts trading.  #Brexit
We’ve had 2yrs of Theresa May, now we know Tory PM spent 2yrs negotiating #brexitchaos to leave UK on its knees without a real say Its time for General Election to end austerity; stop Universal Credit; renationalise railways; invest in pubic services & save our NHS #Brexit #BBCQT
1, One of the pernicious features of this deal (and indeed EU membership) is the non-regression clauses on environmental and labour rules. It;s one of the most obnoxious and offensive facets of the EU. (#Brexit thread)

There seems to be confusion about how a GE can be called.The "Non PM announced" route is for MPs to table a vote of "no confidence" in govt. If a majority in the house support this then there's 14 days grace to form a new gov. Failing that, there's an automatic GE.  #Brexit

Brexit in a nutshell.#Brexit #brexitchaos
Since when does a country decide to hold a public vote on offering a fantasy world as an option? The frauderendum is mere blanket over for a policy to make people poorer for social engineering. They’re too fat, lazy, living too long. That’s the reality of #Brexit.
People have been coming to the UK to work and settle for centuries and nobody complained. It's what made Britain great, a diverse culture enriching the lives of everybody.Then came along a few xenophobes who stirred up a hornets nest of trouble.#Brexit was born.
This is fine. #Brexit 
Not to their advantage to call a GE , even if TMay says #BackMeOrSackMe.One thing about #Tories: they complain, etc. But when it comes to the bottom line-they stick together. I can't see the #Conservatives bringing down a Tory government. They don't do that. Not even for #Brexit

Proceeding on the results of a crooked referendum (the full truth will eventually come out) and when the people are turning against #Brexit, is a foolish way to run a country. It will lead to disaster. @jeremycorbyn @theresa_may

“My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemen, sorry I’m late, I just popped to the toilet. And while I was there, I saw some graffiti and it said ‘I used to be indecisive, but now I’m not so sure.’” #Brexit 
One positive - probably only one - is #Brexit has shown young people as more accepting, altruistic, aware of inequalities & environment, with more inclusive worldview. Political imperative should now be about their future (& they should have vote at 16).
How many Brexiters does it take to change a light bulb?....One to promise a brighter future and the rest to screw it up#Brexit #BrexitChaos #BrexitDeal
Weird piece of #climate + #Brexit trivia... @MichelBarnier led France's delegation to the first @UNFCCC COP in 1995. Should have known he'd be good at negotiations...

This is actually the best analysis of #Brexit so far! 
I’m logging off for today. But once more - for the umpteenth time in #Brexit process - today felt like the day it’d all crash.But it didn’t.May stays, weakened.There aren’t 48 MPs seeking a no confidence vote, even now.2 cabinet ministers resign, but .And tomorrow?
Then there is baffling sight of intelligent people doggedly chasing deal they knew would make poor poorer, leave NHS with less ££ & add to social care crisis, tying up vast amounts of civil service time, while evidence of lies & illegality stacked up. #Brexit
It’s getting really bad now in the UK. #TheresaMay #Brexit 
We pay 650 MP's £77k pa, probably treble in expenses.Millions for a Civil Service, unanswerable to anyone.100's of dottery fools £300 per day to sleep in the Lords.When do they act for us, who sweat to fund their idleness & incompetence?#Brexit 1st, #DrainTheSwamp 2nd.
Guys,#Brexit is going to happen. The economy will have about six months of cloud and then be fine. Cabinet has had the bureaucracy spend about 50% of its time preparing for No Deal. view of a senior govt source I spoke to over the summer who supported Remain in 2016.
Michael Marks, was a Polish immigrant who arrived penniless into the UK. He met a chap called Thomas Spencer and persuaded him to invest £300 into a business idea. Marks wouldn't be allowed into the UK under the #Brexit deal. Good job our forefathers weren't so xenophobic.  #M&S

Mrs May spoke once about those who were "just about managing". Today there's a real risk that this will describe a post-#Brexit UK alone in the world because of our own stupidity. And it's the poor among us who will be its first casualties. Shame on us.
I hate to say this on a day like this, but the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement was supposed to be the easy bit...If we avoid no deal negotiating a future framework could be excruciating and a race against time (unless Brexit is reversed via people’s vote or we go for EEA+ ie SM+CU)

It's pretty clear that the best way to stop #Brexit always was to get a deal so bad that staying was a better option.The EU knew this.Theresa May knew this.
The reason why the #peoplesvote is the right thing to do is because now we all KNOW what we are voting on. We voted on lies and propaganda before and now we have access to a document that tells us what it really means. An educated vote is the only right and fair option  #brexit
You have to check everything they say. #C4News says markets have “plunged” today on #brexit turbulence. This is what really happened. The FTSE is up. 
In stark contrast to #TheresaMay's #Brexit chaos, in Scotland we have been debating what kind of a country we want to be.Please join us in #NorthBerwick for the first in a series of talks, Future Scotland: Facing Global Challenges with @MaggieChapman#Indyref2 #Scotref #Hope

15 seconds of why May's Brexit deal is not what you voted for? Filmed on your phone? Thats what we need from YOU! #HaveYourSay #Brexit #Democracy
Let's have a referendum on whether to pay tax or not. We could put an end to paying vast sums to the treasury to waste on ridiculous nonsense such as #Brexit.Obviously the people will keep access to fully funded public services in the event of a zero-tax vote. Because unicorns.
Owen Paterson at Heritage: “[May’s] deal is so bad it cannot be allowed to proceed... it is bitterly disappointing” #Brexit
The most frustrating aspect of the #Brexit debate is that it has no competent defenders in the public eye. Just think tank drongos, London media loudmouths and Tory quarterwits who have a slender grasp of the issues. Leavers are represented by straw men and walking clichés.
David Davis MP at Heritage Foundation: “It’s a very poor deal... this should be a huge opportunity...” #Brexit
True political leadership now would be to call out not just the #Brexit deal but the self-serving nationalist xenophobia that got us here, that poisoned public debate & tainted us all.

Politics is about public trust, says the resigning UK #Brexit Sec.He believes that his party is deviating from their campaign promises to the UK citizens.Will this make sense to #PMB & other APC fellows whose manifesto document is a little more than a tissue paper: UNKEPT?
Had the 70’s referendum asked if we wanted a European Superstate do you think the answer would have been yes? Of course not. 40 years of erosion caused this. Enact the will of the people and do a proper deal - or let Mogg get on with it.. #brexit
UK Prime Minister Theresa May holds onto her #Brexit plan and job - for now. See more Brexit coverage here: 
The PM @theresa_may has shown incredible resilience and strength in leading on #Brexit and we should just take some time to reflect on what has been achieved and move forward in a calm & pragmatic way in the interests of our nation. 
Just to insert some reality into your tweet. If the UK had left without paying the €50 billion that we owe there would be zero trade deals and the UK would be suffering sanctions not only by the EU but by the UN who are both signatories to the Good Friday Agreement. #Brexit
#Corbyn in an email this evening: "If we cannot get a General Election, in line with our conference policy, we will support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a people's vote"  #Brexit #GeneralElectionNow
You may not agree with Theresa May’s stance on #Brexit, but her commitment and tireless efforts to find a solution to this mess should commended. Some senior figures in her party should be ashamed at their posturing, maneuvering, and self promotion.
For the avoidance of any doubt, I agree with Keir & definitely won’t be voting for May’s bad #Brexit deal. 
“Made a note in my diary on the way here. Simply says: ‘Bugger’.”#Blackadder #BrexitChaos #Brexit 
May's deal makes massive regulatory concessions but none of the ones that would actually safeguard jobs and trade. That defeats the purpose of making concessions. She's keeping us in the EU except for the one bit that's actually worth having. #Brexit

We were only ever going to get frictionless trade with regulatory harmonisation. The only way to do that and end ECJ jurisdiction was through Efta. Both the leave and remain extremes have brought us to this point by rubbishing the one viable #Brexit option.
With the Tory party, Government and #Brexit now in chaos, it is clear that we must have a #PeoplesVote. My thoughts on the Government's unfolding crisis:
May got the best #Brexit deal available in these ridiculous circumstances - but it's still a terrible deal compared to RemainThe EU have said "this is it, no further negotiation"A GE won't change anything, it'll still be this deal, no deal or remainSo @UKlabour, now what?

Break out the popcorn! We pulled together the juiciest parts of the heated debate around #Brexit in UK parliament today 
LATEST: UK Prime Minister Theresa May vows to fight for her #Brexit deal and carry on 
The #Brexit agreement has triggered walkouts by top politicians, hours of debate and calls for Theresa May's resignation. Here are some alternative views... What would you do next? 
She seems to think the #Brexit vote was only about business. It wasn’t. It was about regaining our sovereignty and our independence.
Whatever you think of her politics you have to be impressed with Theresa May’s fighting spirit. She ain’t no quitter #Brexit *reaches for tin hat*
“Fuck This, I’m Taking Back Control”  #brexit
Mogg (FINALLY)  Goes to War with May: @jackbuckby —  | #UK #Brexit #politics
1/3 of Labour voters voted Leave. 2/3 of Labour constituencies voted Leave. If Corbyn had opposed the referendum result every Labour Leaver would have felt betrayed and the Tories would have benefited with an increased majority and a Tory hard #Brexit would have been inevitable. 
Penny Mordaunt just gone into Number 10. Full of originality we asked if she was going to resign...#brexit.
As much as I do not support #TheresaMay I do not blame her for this entirely. I voted Leave but fear I was horribly wrong. The politicians that sold Leave have let so many people down. When we needed them most they dissapeared. I despise the division #Brexit has created.
The stickiest situation since Sticky the Stick Insect got stuck on a sticky bun.#Blackadder #BrexitChaos #Brexit 
What gets me is that they always knew they were in a weak position because, no matter what promises they made, they needed the agreement of 27 other countries.  Sooner or later, they were going to be found out. Why did they think they would get away with it? #Brexit
More proof that the #FBPE brigade are neoliberal status quo merchants who are only interested in slagging off Jeremy Corbyn. If they really wanted to stop #Brexit they'd be thanking Corbyn for making Theresa May's job virtually impossible. #BrexitChaos
“I believe with every fibre of my being that the course I've set out is right for our country.” The PM today.Sounds like conviction. But Mrs May, you voted #Remain. You must have believed in it then & thought #Brexit to be wrong for our country. So the lady’s all for turning?

Theresa May ended her press conference by invoking the spirit of cricket legend Sir Geoffrey Boycott. If only she'd actually listen to him on #Brexit: 
'We asked people their view, they said we should leave the European Union, and we will leave the European Union, and we will leave on the 29th of March 2019.' @theresa_may -This is not what you have proved so far! What happened to 'Brexit means Brexit?' #Brexit

#Brexit May's news conference says it all. "This is the best deal for those that voted Brexit & the many, many that voted remain".This proves she's more concerned with losers & tossed our Brexit instruction away 2 years ago.Her deal doesn't deliver for the British people at all
Today proves that #Brexit is the final humiliation of those clinging to our colonial past.  After Suez, De Gaulle's rejection, Thatcher's defenestration, ERM, all the Powellite proponents of Empire 2.0 have been hit by hard reality. We pool sovereignty or we lose it.

So, @theresa_may is carrying on carrying on, but as @bbclaurak put it rather neatly at the press conference just now, Prime Minister, is it not true that you are in office but not in power? #Brexit

The PM conference is a complete flop a non-entity, it was a re-run of what she said today in the house. The Tories are in chaos on #Brexit just repeating the same line over and over again "in the national interest" will not wash, it is now time for the PM to go #BrexitChaos
Theresa May tells some home truths - finally - and says there is no deal that can be agreed with the EU without a backstop for the Irish border. Says she doesn’t see anyone else with a better solution. #Brexit
Tin ear Theresa doubles down. Same old robotic script which does NOT reflect what this so-called “deal” fails to deliver. She’s trying to spin her way out of this but looks - while in office - no longer in power. Let’s end this #Brexit chaos. Time for @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay

It sounds like @theresa_may's imminent statement will *not* be to resign as PM, nor to abandon her deal. She's going to keep flogging this dead horse, apparently.We've found 70% of Brits feel badly represented by it, and most now don't think #Brexit is in their interests at all 
From the US to New Zealand, the world's media is currently focussed on Parliament Square.Yet all their viewers can hear is some dude in a blue top hat shouting "STOPPP #BREXIT."Welcome to 2018 Britain guys. Pull up a chair 
If today's shenanigans tell us anything simply confirms what we already know, the deal we already have is the best deal possible.  End of. Forget all this #brexit madnes. It's nothing to do with us or even the EU. It's a coup of maniacs trying to sieze power. Nothing more.#FBPE

For me the fucked up thing about this #Brexit drama is that I'll be at Oldham foodbank and Stockport jobcentre next week and absolutely nothing will have changed for people there. There'll still be people trying to get by on fuck all. It's like another universe.
Peter Bone MP - "Theresa May has always said a no deal is better than a bad deal. She’s presenting a bad deal so the logic is we should have a no deal."That’s what the Act of Parliament says, if there’s no agreement we come out on 29 March with a WTO agreement." #Brexit 
Britische Kollegen: „We have absolutely no clue what she‘s going to say.“ #May #Brexit 
Nearly lost my voice from shouting over progressives & protestors - but to all Brexiteers I say - remember what you voted for, remember why it matters. Hold the line. This fight is not over. #BREXIT 
Data Protection and the Draft #Brexit Agreement - we give our first impressions on what this means for personal data:  
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "What has been achieved today is not #Brexit. What we need is a leader who will say to the EU it is impossible to divide up the UK......it is impossible to agree to a situation where we have a perpetual customs union, and pay £39 billion of taxpayers money." 
If you haven’t read up on Article 13 it’s pretty scary stuff. There is a very strong possibility YouTube will cease to exist as we know it in the EU - simply a few music and corporate channels will remain. All this on top of #Brexit makes UK/Europe a gloomy place to be right now

Condemned from all sides, there is no saving the Deal that the Tory government struggled to reach for 2 years. Now  it's time to face the facts -The best deal is NO BREXIT! We need a #PeoplesVote, as we can no longer pretend that #Brexit is any benefit for the country. 
It seems @Jacob_Rees_Mogg as no confidence that the proposed #Brexit deal will prevent him from hiding his millions from the tax man.

Donald Tusk has just told reporters apparently that though the EU is prepared for a final deal with the United Kingdom in November. BUT “We are also prepared for a no-deal scenario - but...we are best prepared for a no-Brexit scenario." Time for @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay #Brexit
Risks of political gridlock over #Brexit deal will be shouldered not by MPs, but by the people we represent.Those risks can only be mitigated if MPs put conscience before party politics and party whips - and support a #PeoplesVote on what happens next.
This is *not* a constitutional crisis, or even a looming one: it is a crisis of politics and political leadership. Her Majesty is fully prepared to take the reins if necessary. The Constitution has endured frays far worse than #Brexit, and will rise to the challenges ahead. 
Even Larry the Cat has had a gutful #Brexit #BrexitChaos
Simply unacceptable. #Brexit means full independence in all areas of law, government and public administration. It does NOT mean giving away any sovereign rights whatsoever. 
We've had a look at the Draft Agreement for the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU. 585 Pages.These are how many times the UK's territories were mentioned.Cayman Islands, Pitcairn and Bermuda receive more mentions than Wales and Scotland#Brexit #IndyWales #indyref2

Going on the @georgegalloway show, this should be interesting. Lots to talk about especially about  #BrexitChaos #Brexit 
'Cakeism' is defined as 'the belief that it is possible to enjoy or take advantage of both of two desirable but mutually exclusive alternatives at once' - i.e. to have one's cake and it it too - and is primarily seen in the UK as part of its ever-growing #Brexit lexicon 
I'm German and my wife is British. She has a job in UK, I don't. We would love to live together again but I don't dare to move to UK at the moment. (British) friends and family keep telling us we'll be fine even after #brexit. I'm not so sure.#AlreadyNotFine

I completely agree. If @theresa_may does resign, there is still no Commons majority for any one option, so “no deal” will happen simply because the clock will run out, something Remain Tories appear not to have considered. #Brexit 
VILE BIAS from @SkyNews pretending #Brexit not possible.   FOUL LIE. We don't need unelected EU chiefs dictating policy! @BorisJohnson
This is a botched, blindfold #Brexit deal that I can't sign up to. A video for my constituents - I'll set out more of my reasons in a blog post later 
Well #Brexit was a great idea, wasn't it? Who could ever have predicted this wouldn't go well...

The Tories are literally falling apart in front of our eyes. If it continues like this, I am confident Labour can pull level in the polls and Jeremy Corbyn can close the gap on Don't Know as best Prime Minister. #Brexit
Aha. Looks like the mainstream is cottoning on to ‘Managed No Deal’. This terminology ‘Orderly No Deal’. Is it finally getting through that there’s no such reality as ‘crashing out’? In fact lots of contingencies prior to sensible FTA r already on way! #Brexit #StandUp4Brexit
Anti-Brexit parties @SinnFeinIreland and @SDLPlive welcome assurances outlined in the draft #Brexit withdrawal deal, saying the Good Friday Agreement has been protected 
New nickname for #PM: ‘#TheresaTheDeceiver’ she has BETRAYED #Brexit voters - we gave her the benefit of the doubt - to OUR COST - looks like #Brexiteers need to remind her that ‘LEAVE’ WON! (Capitulation to #EU will NOT be tolerated)!
Fascinating talking to @lemnsissay about his Christmas Dinner for young people who’ve been in care. @LemnSFoundation. Amid the chaos of #Brexit it’s great to talk to someone who’s decided to put others first, without self interest, pigheaded stubbornness, or ego. 
So who is going to take a cyanide pill by becoming Theresa May's next #Brexit Secretary?Must be like Hitler's last days in the bunker.Michael Gove has already reportedly turned down the offer.#BrexitChaos is like watching a Carry On film (but with less competent characters).

Wouldn't it be great if Theresa May, in even her most posh voice, turned to a parliament that created a situation that was no-win for her or her country and announced, "All my right honourable friends,  go f**k yourselves, I'm out, you fix it". Actually feel for her. #Brexit

For the seventh time I asked the Gov for a debate on the public health approach to violence. @andrealeadsom said she's not joining the resignations over #Brexit today - so she can settle in for more Qs (and pressure from @UKYP I'm sure) until this crucial debate is granted.
I have to ask who doesn't believe that Theresa May is a special politician? She has had to produce a 500 page document to make the idea of #Brexit work when she didn't even believe in it to begin with.
Scotland voted to remain in the EU with 78% of people in #GlasgowNorth voting remain. This deal is a farce and delivers nothing for #Scotland. We all know that the best possible relationship we can have with the #EU is membership #Brexit #WithdrawalAgreement #BrexitShambles

Watching MP interviews outside parliament is astonishing today. They are all at each other, it's total chaos. The script has been torn up, it's dog eat dog. Masks are slipping. The Tory party is in disarray. The only way to restore order is through a General Election. #Brexit
Talking loyalty and #Brexit on @GMB this morning - if I could bust into the HOC and tell politicians one thing it would be to remind them of the need to be loyal - not to their party, not to their conscience, but to democracy and the directive 17.4million voters gave them.
More business reaction to progress on delivering #Brexit  
Incredibly calm and resilient performance by the PM today in the Commons. A leadership contest now would surely be madness. No other credible path to #Brexit is on offer. Cool heads must prevail. 
All the EU want from #Brexit talks is to retain control of the UK. We are the EU’s piggy bank propping up the failing project not to mention they want to keep control of our economy & trade. #TheresaMay is more than happy to appease the EU & make sure a real Brexit never happens!

Theresa May seeing her cabinet resigning around her... #Brexit 
Outstanding statement of clarity and foresight by Mike Russell @feorlean in Scottish Parliament. What a contrast with the failing Prime Minister's statement in #Westminster. #Brexit #BrexitShambles
For two years Britain has been bogged down in its self-imposed #Brexit crisis which has turned into a maze without an exit, let alone an exit strategy. Even Col. Qaddafi would have done a better job if not Saddam Hussain or even Mugabe. 
#Brexit has collided with reality and now the cowardly bastards who plotted its course scramble for the lifeboats squealing ‘it’s all her fault! We could have magicked the icebergs away!’ This is a crisis. The country has the right to speak again. We need a #PeoplesVote.

The thing is we shouldn't even need a #PeoplesVote.  If Labour & Tory party leaderships had any integrity they'd come clean on #Brexit, say it's a disaster for the country, stop it, and take the consequencesWe only need one because May & Corbyn won't do their job
Right. That's enough #Brexit and crappo politics nonsense.The British military swears allegiance not to the State, but the Monarch, so she's got the forces to disband Parliament, grab supreme power, and chuck May, Rees-Mogg, Corbyn et al in the Tower.Now's the time Ma'am.

Today, listening to the #Brexit power-play, I keep thinking of the Tempest quote in @ellygriffiths's #StrangerDiaries. Hell is empty, and all the devils are here.
After visiting London last week, it is dismaying and disheartening to see the UK and U.S., for the last century the backbone of the West, both fall into political and existential crisis.  Hard to know what is more debilitating to our collective future—#Brexit or Trumpism.

So if Gove has turned down Brexit Sec , a guy who led us out is opting out of leading us on ? Curiouser and curiouser #Brexit
Tory infighting  and grandstanding dragged the whole of the UK into this mess and Tory infighting is now trying to drag us all off the cliff.  It’s as if people’s jobs and futures just don’t matter to them #Brexit
A casual reminder that #Brexit is a deliberate attempt by wealthy private interests to crash the UK's economy so that it is forced to sell off the country's assets on the cheap to stay afloat, and those private interests can buy it all up. Brexit is one big privatisation scam.

 my Q to the PM. 64% of the UK want a #PeoplesVote if the Withdrawal Agreement is rejected (which it’s clear from today it will be) according to overnight @YouGov poll. @theresa_may must allow the British people to decide based on the actual #Brexit terms. #PeoplesVoteNow

Actually Deputy, what has been agreed is a legally binding draft treaty which is by its nature stronger than a political statement. Ample space is being given. Your partisan desire to lay all #brexit problems at the door of the Govt is quite something.

So the brexiters are all screaming treason. Shame that none of the brexist ministers @LiamFox @DavidDavisMP @BorisJohnson @DominicRaab managed to do the #Brexit deal the EU was supposed to be begging for.
Tory shill John Pienar says "May does not have the word quit in her vocabulary" and sings her "resilience" to the heavens...funny how the Tory BBC don't give the same respect to Corbyn after the 24/7 lies and smears he has had to put up with #politicslive #BBCBias #JC4PM #Brexit
Since Theresa May has now mentioned the possibility of no #Brexit, it is looking increasingly likely that a #PeoplesVote may take place to decide the UK‘s future relations with the EU. How would you vote? please RT for large sample
Reading this morning's news from the UK, and recalling where many of Canada's leading Conservative politicians were on the great questions of the day. #Brexit 
I ask the ERG and the 1922 Committee, that it's time to stop this betrayal and save our nation. Give us the #Brexit we voted for.And avenge her. She was ousted for being spot on about the EU. Now it's time to return the favour and destroy the Wets!! 
#BrexitChaosThe most unbelievable moment in HoC was Peter Bone and bill cash lamenting about what the #brexit Payment could be spent on in their constituencies.What about all the jobs and livelihoods that have been destroyed??????!!!!!!!
Alliance Deputy Leader @StephenFarryMLA today met with the Taoiseach and Tánaiste in Dublin alongside the other pre-Remain parties. He described it as a "useful and productive meeting at a crucial time in the #Brexit process". 
Anyone seen this chap? He’s the one who got the UK into this mess. Maybe he has a plan? #brexit 
Funny how when a Tory PPS resigns Tory shill John Pienar says it's a "very very minor matter" but when Labour PPS' resign it's included in "opposition front bench resignations" #bbcbias #brexit #politicslive
#Brexit is about a lying, cheating gang of rich bastards exploiting the fears & anxieties of ordinary people in order to slash their tax bills and tear up the health, safety, environmental and workplace regulations which eat into their profits. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit pic.twitter.com/8Muwz6xFNa
Imagine if there was another referendum. Absolute carnage. I genuinely think giving ‘The Purge’ a go one night a year might sort us out. Hahaha. #Brexit

My question to the Prime Minister on suspending or revoking #Article50 #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
What is extraordinary is that Theresa May just keeps on going, still answering questions in the House of Commons, as her Government appears to disintegrate around her. She is the epitome of resilience. #Brexit
#Brexit has reduced the UK from an international, political and economic powerhouse that sat squarely centre stage, to a quivering gibbering and broken wreck being laughed at all over the world. Well done #Leavers, you've got back control of a crippled and lame duck.

Sheer number of questions by MPs in Parliament today asking @theresa_may to give the people a #FinalSay on #Brexit is remarkable - and unprecedented.This is no longer something MPs, or the wider public, feel reticent to demand.Let's have a #PeoplesVote and #EndTheChaos!

Whatever anyone may feel about #Brexit, or about the detail of this deal, it’s the only deal on the table. Or remotely likely to be on the table. And the general public understand that. #RelevantFacts
The only deals that we need to worry about are those locking UK army navy airforce R&D Procurement Strategic Defence Industries Nucs Money into EU Military Unification. To claim #Brexit when giving our military to EU is Treason and we need to call it Treason. Hold MPs to account

“It feels to me we are very, very far down a slippery slope now for the May administration” @bbclaurak after #Brexit resignations #politicslive 
What the hell happened to self-belief, confidence, resolve? How did we become this castrated nation of weepy wets? The lions are no longer roaring, they're meeowing. We're being bullied, plain & simple, and we're grateful for it?#Brexit NOW. NO DEAL. Show some gumption Britons.
As from next week, unless #Brexit is cancelled now, the atmosphere in the EU will be:1. Limit damage2. Move on, compete, protect the EU, fight the UK3. Learn how it's easier to improve EU laws without the UK pulling the brakes.#StopBrexit now. It's Britain's last chance.
Hearing he can’t decide whether to accept it or resign #Shambles #Brexit 
If we had had a Leaver PM it would have been. We should have gone for No Deal from Day 1 and then spent the last 2.5 years negotiating for a trade agreement while operating under WTO. If we can't get a trade agreement than WTO then obviously we stick with WTO. #brexit

Not going to apologise for reminding this constantly. No Deal is Effectively ‘Managed No Deal’, or EU caves & accepts some type of SuperCanada arrangement. Remoaners trying to blackmail public out of #Brexit with propaganda narrative about disastrous ‘No Deal’ which won’t happen!
Yesterday looked like a victory for Theresa May but with several cabinet resignations and the fact she doesn’t appear to have the votes to get her draft deal through Parliament, things are looking potentially dire for the PM. #brexit
Draft #Brexit deal is "damaging for the economy but devastating for public trust in our democracy" - says ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab in his first post resignation interview 
Should #TheresaMay resign as #British #PrimeMinister and give someone else a chance to deliver a #brexit deal that more people support?

Oh come on Laura. Brexit is falling to bits along with Theresa May as Tory leader. Time to come clean #Brexit has been a lie from the very beginning and the BBC have NOT been unbiased. Shame on you all.
A Corbyn govt inside the EU would have a massive catalysing impact on progressive forces across Europe, pushing back against the far right and presenting Brussels with the greatest challenge to neoliberalism it has faced. #Brexit
Well said, my thoughts exactly when watching this debacle this morning. If England is so desperate for #Brexit why doesn't England #DissolveTheUKUnion & leave #Scotland & #NorthernIreland to get on with what *they* voted for; to #Remain in the EU & prosper as *they* want?
Met with reps from Northern Ireland parties earlier to discuss the latest developments in the #Brexit negotiations. The draft Withdrawal agreement includes important assurances re the Good Friday Agreement & the need for continued close relations among all parts of these islands.

.@thatginamiller therefore calls today on Her Majesty's Opposition to back a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit so we can #EndTheChaos.The will of the people is not static, frozen in time two and a half years ago.It is a dynamic thing, and much has changed.
This #BrexitAgreement keeps us bound to the European Union, acting as a supplicant puppy to a federal block.”“In short, this deal does NOT deliver #Brexit, and as such I will NOT be voting for this when it comes to Parliament.” 
How many people who campaigned for #Brexit actually understood the complexities involved? How many people who voted leave did any real homework on exactly what it’d entail? I feel for my kids generation. So many Brexiteers won’t even be around to live the carnage. Well done 
Brilliant from @BarrySheerman in the Commons."It is time to have the courage to put the #Brexit question back to the people".#PeoplesVote
Well, looking around Twitter this morning, (to paraphrase Alan B’stard) it appears that #Brexit is about as popular as Jeffrey Archer at the Daily Star Christmas party... 
There is NO best possible #Brexit for Scotland
So, no mention of Scotland in UKGov #Brexit deal. Any mention of refugee rights? Community integration? Commitment to the principle of refugee protection? Very worried about what this #BrexitChaos means for all of our rights.

And surely this is the most important point of all. Are we really going to knowingly do something that will damage our country. #Brexit #BrexitDeal
Theresa May is doing a good job defending her position. I just think there never was any deal to be had with the EU, which wants to deter any other state from leaving.UK should go the no deal/WTO route and ride it out.#Brexit
So May cannot - hand on heart - say that what she has negotiated is better than the situation the UK has in the EU just now.Rather revealing answer.#Brexit

May again telling Commons that ‘the British people just want us to get on with it’.No, @theresa_may, sensible people want to see #Brexit abandoned.
Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg tells Theresa May what she says on #Brexit and what she does "no longer match", threatening to submit letter of no-confidence in the PMLive updates: 
Tory Steve Baker calls for all “no deal” contingency plans to be triggered because her plan will be ferociously opposed in the Commons. #brexit
With two Tory MPs supporting Theresa May’s deal she has one breakthrough: enough tellers for her #Brexit vote
Why isn't anyone in the Commons where #TheresaMay is explaining herself without really explaining anything challenge her on the money that the EU channeled into the Remain campaign and the mysterious funding for Gina Miller's disgraceful challenge in the courts against #Brexit ?
My god.  The Media Gammons are NOW selling #Brexit on the basis that it won’t be as bad as the two world wars that killed 80 million people.

"As the UK government crumbles, Brussels is watching in horror." - While parliament discusses this as if it is their choice, the #deal they seem to loathe, isn't even a done deal. #Brexit #WithdrawalAgreement
Theresa May shamelessly lying that the referendum was an "instruction". It is a matter of law that an advisory referendum cannot be an instruction. It is absolutely unacceptable that a Prime Minister should lie about the legal status of the most important vote since 1945.#Brexit

The Cabinet turmoil threatens to overshadow something the PM said last night. The choice is her deal “no deal, or no Brexit at all”.This is the first time she has put no #Brexit on the table so clearly, and opened the way to a #PeoplesVote
Just as I predicted when the #Brexit vote went the 'wrong' way for the elite, we're on course for a Brexit that is no such thing. Or a political upheaval which ends with us being made to vote again and again until we give the 'correct' answer.
Loud cheer in #Parliament just now as @theresa_may said again we could take her deal or risk no #Brexit at all!  it seems #NoBrexig is the popular choice.. Meanwhile @jeremycorbyn  confirms her deal does not meet the 6 tests...

Anne-Marie Trevelyan resigns as a parliamentary private secretary in the Department for Education saying she cannot support #Brexit deal after negotiations "built on the UK trying to appease the EU"For the latest reaction and updates: 
I love it when these resignation fests reach the point where people you have never heard of are resigning from posts you didn't know existed... #Cabinet #Brexit
Must read: @NicolaSturgeon @Daily_Record - #Scotland didn’t vote for this shambles.... we won’t accept it #Brexit  
...and another one.  That’s five.  Almost like it was planned, or something #Brexit
#Brexit update! #GBP now down a whopping 1.7% as Brexit Minister Raab resigned.
There has never been majority support for any real implementable version of Brexit. The supporters of each version hate the other versions, and now they are fighting bitterly over the mess they have made. #Raab #McVey #Braverman#Brexit #PeoplesVote
German tv suggests draft #Brexit deal allows UK to have cake + eat it after all when comes to goods. But when German lawyers read doc carefully they’ll see the proposed ‘customs agreement’ is nothing like the frictionless trade May promised  
Put Kevin Gray in charge of #Brexit. Will be sorted by midday then we can all decamp to the boozer for the rest of our lives.

While the UK government is in public meltdown, Merkel and her cabinet are holding a two-day seminar to discuss AI and other digital challenges. I know Germany is playing catch-up here but the contrast is striking all the same. #opportunitycost #brexit

I know #Brexit and resignations are going to dominate today's chitter chatter, but just to let you know something else important that's happened: the @attorneygeneral has published the government's review of disclosure in the criminal justice system.

#Brexit is a complete mess - resignations, left, right and centre: The real choice facing Britain now is one between this dodgy deal that no one is buying and the excellent deal we’ve already got inside the EU as a member state with a seat at the table. #PeoplesVote
General election now. The whole left must demand it.(And that necessarily means abandon all ye the remain guff. At this point #PeoplesVote is a lifeline to a drowning Tory party) #Brexit
Two cabinet resignations over @theresa_may's #Brexit agreement - Brexit secretary Dominic Raab and work and pensions secretary Esther McVey.Sky's political correspondent @KateEMcCann says more resignations could follow. Latest on the fallout here: 
If Theresa May is toppled as British PM, we could see up to a 3 to 4% decline in sterling. Until we get clarity the leadership is stable, the markets remain very nervous, says our Chris Turner  #Brexit

#BREAKING Britain's Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey becomes the third minister to resign over a draft #Brexit withdrawal agreement with Brussels 
Esther McVey resigns as British work and pensions secretary over Brexit plan, following #Brexit secretary Dominic Raab 
May looking vulnerable as Dominic Raab, Esther McVey quit Cabinet positions over #Brexit battle 
Brexit: Mrs May's plan A has failed; now for Plan B: - rejoin EFTA and stay in the EEA. #Brexit 
Let's be perfectly clear, this #Brexit process that we're all now going through has been forced upon us by a globalist elite, it is and was always going to be the case unfortunately as these people care not for the democracies of nation-states, the people but themselves
"The deal you put before the Cabinet yesterday does not honour the result of the referendum"UK Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey's resignation letter to PMLatest #Brexit updates: 
"Theresa May has definitely betrayed and humiliated us" says @jongaunt after #Brexit Secretary @DominicRaab resigns following a 5-hour Cabinet meeting on #Brexit agreement.

So @EstherMcVey1 will resign over #BREXIT saying she couldn’t ‘look constituents in the eye’ but was happy to preside over #UniversalCredit which was destroying people’s lives. Wonder if she looked those people in the eye and didn’t flinch?

Two things that surprised #DominicRaab as #Brexit secretary.1) That the UK is reliant on the Dover/Calais crossing.2) What was in the #BrexitDeal.
Business is watching with horror the resignations now taking place. Yesterday we had a plan and stability and today we do not. There is now no time to negotiate another deal. We thought we had stability - now we have instability writ large #brexit
I tell you what we need right now, twelve members of the public sat around in a studio sharing their views and talking over each other.#BBCNews #Brexit

#Brexit Secretary @DominicRaab resigns: "This is a full-blown dramatic political crisis," says our correspondent @BenedictePaviot
Nobody left for Gove to betray really.   Made the wrong call AGAIN.  Imagine what he would do in power, luckily not a hope in hell. #borisjohnson #Brexit #boris johnson
Leadership candidates: Boris, Leadsom, Rees-Mogg. The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. #brexit #Raab
Under the authority of President @JunckerEU and with the support of @EU_Commission, we reached an important step last night in the #Brexit negotiations. But there is a long road ahead. We remain determined to deliver an orderly withdrawal with the UK. 
Being Irish watching all this is like watching those trashy neighbours have a loud fight in the front garden again. You know it’s gossip and a form of entertainment but they’re bringing down the price of property and getting a bit annoying at this stage #brexit
#Brexit: What does the draft withdrawal agreement reveal? 
Hey #Britain. Miss you. Hear you're having some probs with the old #Brexit deal.Luckily there is a very obvious solution:Remain. Problem solved. You're welcome.
Relax , Raab has only resigned to spend more time with maps of UK’s import/export routes #brexit
"It means @theresa_may doesn't have the backing of her party" - @Keir_Starmer reacts to @DominicRaab's resignation. @hilarybennmp adds that the "fantasy #Brexit that was sold to the country is not possible".Latest on the fallout here: 
We joined a Federal Europe without a Vote. Created by stealth by Politicians from both sides. Then the Electorate finally got a vote. The rest is history. Are you now saying we can’t leave. That we can’t survive as a nation without being part of the EU. #brexit
Now it’s clear the Government cannot get their #Brexit plan through Parliament, Labour must immediately commit to a #PeoplesVote and to campaign for remaining in the EU
#brexit.. work this one out..Dominic Raab was Brexit Secretary in the EU negotiating tent. Did he not know what was coming down the line? Why jump now leaving PM Theresa May with this mess? With a name like Raab cartoonists will be busy. 
The "get Corbyn" machine appears in need of an MOT. Some of his detractors are saying he's wrong to whip MPs to vote down May's mess, others say he's been too kind to her, and some are still going on about his coat...Get your excuses in order guys. #Brexit #BrexitDeal
Obviously May knew #Raab was going to resign, yet she still came out last night and delivered that pile of tripe in an attempt to convince the country. Theresa, the guy whose sole job it  was to get a good deal says it's shite. Game over. #Brexit #GeneralElectionNow
#Brexit Goodness me. 
Enough of #Brexit. The real news is that with Knowles and Edmonds on board, #ImACeleb is becoming a jungle version of @Coldwar_Steve. Time for a Fray Bentos Bush Tucker Challenge.
No.We need a General Election now to rid ourselves of the Tories & their infighting which gave us this terrible #Brexit 
Smart move by May, letting total #Brexit chaos slip out, while all the major media outlets are distracted by #SocialEnterpriseDay.
With the latest resignation from the Brexit Secretary I cannot see how the Prime Minister can stand in front of the house this morning to try & sell such a bad deal for the U.K. #Brexit
So let's get this right, Dominic Raab, the #Brexit secretary who was responsible for negotiating the draft agreement with the #EU has resigned because he can't support an agreement he helped negotiate.Maybe it's not just geography he is bad at! #BrexitChaos #raab
Hard to see there not being more #Brexit resignations today. That in turn increases the chances of a leadership vote. I suspect  No10 is regretting how the Lancaster House speech allowed expectations to be set in the wrong place for too long.
A Tory minister with a spine and a conscience. Any more? #Brexit #BrexitBetrayal
We don't need a General Election we need independence. Why the hell are we dealing with this shambles that we didn't want, didn't vote for and will seriously damage our country. I'm not willing to sell out our country based on UKIP, Tories and lies. #Brexit
2 resignations and counting this morning. To the rest of May's cabinet - get out now while you still have a shred of dignity. She needs to be removed now. #Brexit #BrexitBetrayal
The #UK had a clear choice - in the words of #MargaretThatcher. Shame.#Brexit 
Dear Prime Minister I never wanted the job, who would? It was just too hard to deliver, that's why David resigned, he knew it couldn't be delivered either.Your best bet is to come clean to parliament & the country & just admit #Brexit is an undeliverable promise. BestDom 
Whatever happens with #Brexit, we need to make urgent progress on devolution. Here's an update from me 
The draft #Brexit deal and science. What you need to know: 
Brilliant. #Brexit #Raab
Just let work know my train is delayed and I should be there in approximately three Cabinet resignations time....#brexit 
CONGRATULATIONS TINY ISLAND ON #BREXIT DEAL. (sound on) 
So another #Brexit secretary resigns & joins @SteveBakerHW & @DavidDavisMP who resigned from the same department.See the similarities? There’s clearly an issue in that the ministry is disregarded by the leadership.It must stop now.#StandUp4Brexit
So it looks like the "experts" were right after all. #Brexit
Everyone agrees that No Deal would be a catastrophic disaster in nobody's interest but the few.Everyone agrees that the May deal is in nobody's interest at all.That leaves No #Brexit, not everyone will like it, but it is in the best interests of our country and for the many.
Chuka Umunna not holding back in his damming assessment of Raab and other Pro-#Brexit MPs who have resigned, calls for a #PeoplesVote.
All of us this morning #brexit 
Paul Gascoigne has arrived at Ten Downing street with a bag of beers. #Brexit
Oh dear, these scaremongers never give up. IMF wrong about the impact of a #Brexit referendum result. Wrong now. 
Dear UK, Please take a breath. The EU really isn’t that bad. It’s quite good actually - what with all the peace and prosperity and rights and stuff. You should stay with us. We’d be delighted to have you back even at this late stage. All the best, Everyone Else in Europe. #brexit
Sterling after UK’s #Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned - via Bloomberg @business
It just isn't gonna happen. Parliament won't support this & it will tell the #ERG to go jump. Further turmoil is on the cards but one thing for sure #Brexit will be binned. Let us stay true to our beliefs, continue to fight for the good of the country & put down this coup. #FBPE
Listening to Jesus Christ Superstar and these lyrics seem appropriate today:I think you've made your point nowYou've even gone a bit too far to get the message homeBefore it gets too frighteningWe ought to call a halt soCould we start again please?#Brexit
The outline political declaration on the framework future relationship between EU and UK after #Brexit is utterly feeble. Just a laundry list. Confirms that blind Brexit really is blind Brexit, and still no clarity on longer term destination.
#Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab quits.Who will do the job now? Will any self respecting #Leaver be prepared to do it?Or is the job completely redundant now rather like the Trade Secretary’s? No bilateral foreign trade deals possible in a Customs Union.
This is a crucial moment. The Government is in disarray over #Brexit. Labour are hamstrung. Joining the Lib Dem’s won’t influence Labour. That’s why so many people who want to send a clear message about a #peoplesvote are joining @TheGreenParty 
Whatever your political persuasion... we appear to be in a spot of bother! Tea anyone? #Raab #Brexit #BrexitAgreement #RoyalBaby #Bisto
"They are part of a Vote Leave campaign that made impossible promises on #Brexit."@ChukaUmunna on resignations from Theresa May's cabinet. He says it underlines why Brexit should be referred back to the people.Latest here as Dominic Raab quits:

I can't take any more popcorn.#brexit.
Anna Soubry calls for a" government of national unity." Too many games; game theory etc. being played. A sad day. Very very sad. #Brexit-as people voted for it was never deliverable. Magical thinking. Air.And it takes  500 pages.#Raab#BrexitAgreement
HI Everyone This morning I woke up to find  this confused gammon in my garden he must of got lost during last nights news at 10. If anyone recognizes him please DM me. #brexit #brexitmeansbrexit
A bit like standing on a manifesto commitment to deliver full Brexit with no intention of honouring it so you can betray it as soon as your leave voting constituency re-elects you isn't it?#Brexit
BUT - he was the #Brexit Secretary - was he not party to the negotiations. ! 
If only everyone felt this strongly about the lives of the sick, disabled, people being forced into poverty and the homeless ...The welfare cuts would have been rolled back by now #brexit#GetTheToriesOut
We will discover soon enough who, in the final analysis, determines the future of the U.K.: bureaucratic and corporate elites or the people of the country. #Brexit
So David Davis negotiates a deal, then resigns because he can't back it - just after it's approved. Dominic Raab negotiates a deal, then resigns because he can't back it - just after it's approved. British politics. Can you make sense of it? #brexit
Selfish, self focussed, self indulgent narcissists with zero empathy cry over their failure to deliver the #Brexit monster. 
To paraphrase Mrs Merton:"Tell me, @Theresa_may.  What was it that attracted you to a hastily-cobbled-together #Brexit that will stop the #EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive applying to you & multi-millionaire hubby Philip May?"#Remain
The UK is quite literally destroying itself over #brexit. It’s just awful to watch.
Life advice 1. Delete this tweet 2. Practise with me “would you like fries with that?” #Brexit
"The only option left is the Schrödinger - #Brexit: we build a big box around Great(!) Britain and as long as no one lifts the lid, UK stays both in the EU and leaves." - Thanks, @zeitweise, today UK really needs creative solutions !
Having lost two #Brexit secretaries, there must be a complete belief that Theresa May and her allies in Cabinet are doing their very best to prevent a meaningful Brexit at all costs
One thing is certain in the midst of all this Tory chaos. None of the Govt’s actions  are based on the national interest. It’s all about desperately trying to hold the Tory Party together & who will next lead it #Brexit
The idiot Tusk announces EU27 leaders' meeting on 25 Nov to agree Theresa's abomination. The deal won't be on the table after today.  Should be an interesting meeting.Distinctive #Brexit research & news: 
Efta would have placed the UK in a partnership of codetermination. May has delivered vassalage. She must go. #Brexit
Just how badly will May’s botched #Brexit deal be defeated in The Commons? This is one forecast from ITV News. I think it’s a bit too optimistic, I’m not sure this many Tories will rebel but even with that, a defeat looks on the cards if Labour MPs follow the party whip. 
It’s always been clear to me that #Article50 can be extended or revoked and EU would allow. Both of those now look like serious possibilities. Time for @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay #Brexit
Daily Briefing:- May girds for #Brexit battle in parliament- EU to endorse Brexit deal on Nov. 25- Three candidates to succeed Merkel speak at regional conferenceCatch up on the headlines: 
Sorry, but if you can't keep your own chief negotiator behind deal you've agreed than (a) clearly he wasn't really your chief negotiator & (b) there's a very basic failure of management, communication & competence far more troubling than the disagreement over #Brexit details 
The #Brexit referendum was pushed along with potent fearmongering and propaganda, including misleading repurposed photographs mostly carried on... would you believe it if I said Facebook? And instagram, of course. They hyper targeted it with the help of Cambridge Analytica 
The final blow to Theresa May's disastrous tenure.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigns over May's disastrous non-exit #BrExitAgreement which makes the UK Slaves to the EU until 2099 in a "Hotel California" deal where we can NEVER leaveMay & her #BrExit deal, dead in the water

I am so sorry, it just can't be done. Let's just stay and fix the causes of #Brexit instead. I'll start by firing all the Brexeratti who started this by making promises no one could ever deliver.You then do your bit by not voting for them ever again. 
It's time. #Brexit 
Pretty awkward to stick around after the Treaty you negotiated's  got the thumbs down. What #Raab does: is give the greenlight  for the rest of them going.And on our other stage: #Labour is starring in "Waiting For Godot".#BrexitMagicalThinking#Brexit
Good to see that @DomincRaab has integrity. He has resigned saying that @theresa_may 's #Brexit plan threatens the integrity if the United Kingdom. Well done and thank you Dominic.
#Brexit is the biggest #owngoal of modern public policy.  That much is clear.  Can it be reversed ?
"I will not vote for this if they put a shotgun in my mouth."Conservative MP Mark Francois gives #bbcbreakfast his verdict on the #Brexit withdrawal agreement #BrexitAgreement
A (once) fast-growing country, with its own currency, is trying to leave the EU - and is tearing itself apart. Now imagine what would happen were an economically fragile state to try to leave the euro. #Brexit
So May effectively gives Gibraltar to Spain despite 97% of Gibraltar’s wanting to stay British. She gives Dublin a greater say in the govt of Northern Ireland than Westminster & threatens the democratic #Brexit vote. This woman is no democrat. #MayMustGoNow
“Having led the process that led to an agreement, I feel I have no choice but say it was a terrible idea that leaves me no choice but to resign”Kind of sums up the #Brexit omnishambles, doesn’t it?
More resignations Tory Ministers unhappy with the #Brexit deal yet the Scots Tory Leaders opting to stay in post when they’ve got the strongest reasons of all for resigning!
United Kingdom will be included as a member state of the EU EXCEPT as regards decision making. #BREXIT Leave means leave. 
Who negotiated those UK terms again...? Surely the #Brexit Minister had nothing to do with it and learned of the terms yesterday.....? Oh wait 
Thought we were in mid November but it seems to be the end of May. #Raab #Brexit
Enough. Time for this crumbling and failing Government to move over and call a #GeneralElection. Only Labour has policies to #RebuildBritain and protect our economy and rights from a bad #Brexit#JC4PM

Our grateful thanks to @DominicRaab for your integrity. #Brexit 
If Britain can undo #Brexit and the United States can replace Trump in 2020, a great deal of damage to global security can be undone. 
No talk in the media on the one issue that drove people to vote #Brexit - immigration. Do we now control our borders? If so why is May not trumpeting the fact?
Conservative Party brought us #Brexit and now they are bricking it

By appointing @DominicRaab as #Brexit Secretary but then humiliatingly putting Olly Robbins in charge of negotiations, Theresa May has - yet again - contributed to her demise by mistreating people so badly.

#Brexit.. “YOU CANNOT EAT A FLAG” (John HUME). Absolutism means holding absolute principles in political, philosophical, or theological matters. DUP feel betrayed by Mrs May but NI business is in a win win position. Best of both worlds. EU funding remains. No tariffs into UK/ROI.
So, it's looks like "Deal or no deal" has turned into "Deal or no deal or no #Brexit". Which proves that we still have everything to fight for. #PeoplesVote -> #StopBrexit. The sooner the better, before any more damage is done to the UK and to innocent families.
I am no fan of @theresa_may nor do I want #Brexit but #NI is a politically unique place. We can’t ignore the need to achieve North South balance. On reflection I therefore think her deal is the next best thing to no Brexit & potentially very good for NI businesses.
Last night @theresa_may admitted 'no #Brexit' is an option.We're closer than ever to securing a #PeoplesVote with an option to reject this dangerous deal, stay in EU & address real reasons people want change.We can win this. Tell your MP to give the public a say on the deal.
A Frenchman sums up #Brexit in two words... 
Fight with everything you have, for our future's sake.Campaign in your local community and tell your MP that you're #NotBuyingIt on this #Brexit deal and that we demand a #PeoplesVote
Wow! Page 10 of the Draft U.K./EU withdrawal agreement....! Looks like it applies to the commonwealth too!! Looks like the EU really are looking to divide and conquer! #Brexit #TreasonMay
Well played, Bentham Pottery  #Brexit 
10) not enough, not nearly enough leave voters were prepared to pay for reality hard, meaningful #Brexit, and if Leave voters wouldn't then why should Remainers?There is only one consistent, cohesive, realistic majority - Remain. The Leave vote has always been splintered
Conservative Ministers. Cabinet Ministers. NOW IS THE TIME. Not for empty words. But to fall on your sword and put country before self. Resign. Leave the viper in its nest. And help lead us to no deal Brexit. #BREXIT
Again: we don’t want a #Brexit. Not at all. It’s a lose-lose situation for both the #EU and #UK. So sad. Yet given the circumstances a “soft” Brexit and close relations between EU and UK are in our common interest.

Politicians and the media have lied to British people for decades, they've twisted the truth, manipulated facts and withheld information. In addition Britain's postcolonial delusion was heavily reinforced by British exceptionalism, hubris and racism. #Brexit is colonial karma. 
7) What Theresa May knew, what these guys knew after the referendum, was that the public would destroy any party who delivered a hard, meaningful, painful #Brexit, because they didn't expect it or vote for it - they voted for Unicorns

Shailesh Vara, Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, resigns  over #Brexit deal 
Have a feeling they will hammer this deal through. MPs can't be bothered with #Brexit or with taking responsibility. This deal parks it all on a shelf so they can let it all fester for another 20 years while they piss away the rest of our democracy.

I stayed up late reading the #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. Here's 585 pages in 2 mins. (It's a quick, first take so happy to be corrected as we learn more.)

I am currently an expert on the draft withdrawal agreement which I have definitely read and thus have authorative views on. New PSA Blog coming shortly! #brexit #BrexitDeal
Good morning. Today seems like a good day to tell you about my conversation with a brexiter, that I had a few weeks ago. That day I was told to my face that #brexit means they can finally switch out all those EU migrants with better foreigners. /1
Brexiteers like Farage never had a plan beyond "blue passports" "control of fishing" and "leave." That was it. They got us all to jump out of a perfectly good plane without parachutes on the promise that a flying carpet would come along. There is no flying carpet. #Brexit
#brexit is actually very easy.The tricky bit is that there are consequences to this.In a country deluded not just about the EU, but also itself many thought that these consequences were minimal.The problem is not the EU, but rather UKs inability to face reality.
Remember, main reason why erg are hopping mad today:"Britain must also transfer three EU tax directives into law – on the exchange of tax information, reporting on investment firms and the EU’s code of conduct on taxation."#brexit
Breaking: European Council President Donald Tusk tells press conference that #Brexit deal is about 'damage control' and has no doubt 'Brexit is a lose-lose situation' 
A buyer in Peterhead this morning: ‘We’re not getting our waters back.’#Brexit #Fishing
Our deal with the EU was essentially a gold plated Ferrari and through the Brexit process we are trying to essentially dismantle that car, throw the bits in a skip and then try and rebuild the vehicle with gravy. It cannot be done. #Brexit
The deal is another classic EU Great Deception. We are led to believe it is something other than what it is. But it's a full blown customs union with all the trimmings. We could not say in a material sense that we have left the EU. #Brexit #BRINO pic.twitter.com/SHPrXJkkBP
Brexit was never going to work for the simple reason that no deal could come anywhere near to the one we had already. Any other option was always going yo damage the UK. Sensible people who took the time to inform themselves of our relationship with the EU knew that. #Brexit
Let me say to our British friends: as much as I am sad to see you leave, I will do everything to make this farewell the least painful possible, both for you and for us. #Brexit
#Brexit: Theresa May says her draft deal has the backing of cabinet. Does this mean everything is decided? @LeilaNathoo explains the challenges ahead [tap video to expand]
.@Keir_Starmer & @ShadowBrexit have been reading the detail overnight.The verdict: this #Brexit withdrawal agreement will harm the country, not help it. The #Labour leadership will vote against.A critical step towards a Labour backed #PeoplesVote
This cannot be said enough. Before the Tories turned it nuclear, for their own political ends, the EU was the TENTH most important issue to voters. #Brexit
As a life long Conservative voter.The electorate are not fools. Those MPs & Ministers who back the unmitigated disaster, which is the PMs #Brexit plan, & consequently sellout the UK & democracy, will feel the wrath of the electorate at the Ballot Box.#StandUp4Brexit #Brexit 
‘David Davis really did promise a #Brexit with “the exact same benefits” with “no downside”. Liam Fox really did promise a free trade agreement would be “one of the easiest in history”’..the actual deal has blown away the fantasies’ ⁦@pollytoynbee⁩

The fact that this was said in Cabinet just illustrates what a monumental act of self harm Brexit is (by @SamCoatesTimes). Those who lied through their teeth about the sunny uplands should be ashamed (Johnson, Mogg, Farage et al). #BrexitAgreement #BrexitShambles #brexit 
The British Book Industry generates up to £7.8bn within UK GVA - that is (for comparison) 5 times that of the fisheries industries. Here’s our letter to the Prime Minister, sent with a copy of Middle England, by @jonathancoe, to say how #Brexit will effect books. @PenguinUKBooks
John Redwood on @BBCr4today blithely advocating UK leave EU without paying a penny & start making 3rd country trade deals ignoring reality they won’t want to make deals with a state that has form for breaching it’s international treaty obligations #Brexit
I firmly believe with my head & my heart that the PM has betrayed the 17.4m who voted for #BrexitPM promised to take us OUT and she is keeping us IN.Thankfully #LEAVER and #REMOANER MPs reject the #BrexitBetrayal so it is dead in the water.#MayMustGo#BrexitNow#NoDealBestDeal
"SHAMEFUL - May's Cabinet in Sovereignty Giveaway" - Very interesting #Brexit Facts4EU take on the abomination from Theresa May last night: 
"When you strip away the detail" #Brexit is a nasty crusade against migrants disguised as a nostalgic wet dream about recreating The Empah or WW2. 
.@roweafr's latest cartoon. For more:  #Brexit 
Whether you were Leave or Remain this thread is worth reading - 50 separate evidence backed effects of #Brexit we could do with a 51 that summarises the combined effect of them all. So much the majority of us aren’t aware of ... 
Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has told Good Morning Britain that Theresa May's #Brexit plan is 'a miserable failure of negotiation'.He claims the 500-page document has scarce detail on the Irish border backstop and the future of Britain's economy. 
You know I voted #Conservative in the last General Election because I believed if #Brexit was to happen they’d deliver it best. HOW WRONG WAS I!? #BrexitAgreement #BrexitShambles
EU keeps mistrustful eye on UK .. Volatile politics could still land 585 pages of #Brexit deal in the bin.. All before this month’s special summit. My thoughts: 
Theresa May's new #Brexit deal plans in a nutshell. 
.@theresa_may's won the approval of her ministers for her #Brexit agreement, but she's on "very, very shaky ground" 
I took the view that the compromises on social, environmental, and labour rules under EEA were tolerable because of the Efta firewall but maintaining them under direct ECJ rule will end up being permanent and that really is "vassal state".#Brexit
The EU made it perfectly clear before the referendum that Britain would be worse off outside of the EU than in it.Now Britain has its #Brexit deal.Which confirms it will be worse off.And now Britain is shocked.What's the surprise?
Big day for ⁦@theresa_may⁩ as she faces the Commons with her #Brexit agreement today ⁦@tamcohen⁩ with me for analysis@donaldtusk⁩ ⁦@MichelBarnier⁩ deliver their verdict this morning @skynews #Sunrise plus ⁦@UKLabour⁩ reaction with ⁦@Keir_Starmer⁩
Battlelines are being drawn over #Brexit. Here's the latest:- At least two senior ministers said to be on the brink of resigning. -  Brexiteer rebels within the Tories say leadership contest 'will be triggered' - PM reaches out to rivals for supportMore from @ranvir01
If the ERG don't get rid of May now then they will go down in history as the biggest time wasters of all time. Not on any level does this deal satisfy #Brexit.
'Theresa May has promised again and again to deliver #Brexit. She hasn't' 
I'd have settled for a compromise, but this is capitulation. If the ultimatum is between trade or democracy, then we must choose democracy. #BRINO #Brexit 
In what manner shape or form is this best deal from Scotland? You conveniently forget that Scotland voted remain. If this #BREXIT goes ahead the majority in Scotland will be poorer financially, culturally and have lost  opportunities we have enjoyed for 40+ years.
I'm very impressed at the way the other 26 nations stood firmly with #Ireland.  Ireland could easily have been rolled over & shafted, but they stood together as a bloc & supported the country in its time of need - exactly as any member should expect from union membership. #Brexit
I cannot see this #Brexit deal winning the support of MP’s, parliament or the population. Prepare for extreme turbulence. @talkRADIO #EarlyBreakfast
We have a PM elected on a manifesto to Leave after a referendum was won on a 'no-deal' prospectus. To actually now threaten withdrawal of #Brexit in its entirety if you don't back her Chequers deal shows nothing but contempt for the people & highlights how weak her leadership is
Theresa May has managed to agree a #WithdrawalAgreement that is similar to the relationship with Europe that most Brexiteers incorrectly thought we had and voted out of! #BrexitChaos #BrexitDeal #Brexit #BrexitShambles
.@PwC_UK Head of #Brexit @AndrewGray_PwC welcomes the news a #BrexitDeal has been approved by the Cabinet but "there are still a number of hurdles to be jumped before the deal is binding. We urge business to continue preparing for both a deal and no deal 
The devil's in the detail - and it stinks#BREXIT #BRINO
The point of making concessions to the EU is for trade and to safeguard jobs. This deal does not do that. It simply hands political control to the EU while the EU gets to cannibalise UK trade and stop us making deals.#Brexit #BRINO
May's deal is the worst of all worlds. #Brexit #BRINO

If you think that Westminster will protect the #Irish, #Welsh, #Gaelic, & #Cornish languages after #Brexit, you're kidding yourself. Without EU funding and protection, they're in real danger. Choose what's best for the survival of our culture. #indyref2 #YesCymru #UnitedIreland.
No, the voice of the people overturning the voice of those who have made a fortune convincing otherwise intelligent people to vote to leave.This is what #Brexit was really about. A get rich quick scheme by that devious little sh1te #Farage.
The basic test is whether the deal allows the UK to repatriate political authority and frees us to reform economic and social policy through our own democratic institutions. It doesn't. #Brexit
If the @Conservatives don’t get rid of @theresa_may before she betrays the democratic vote taken by the nation on the 23rd June 2016 and we end up with a corbyn government I can assure you the following government will be further to the right than they would like #Brexit
 “There will be no Christmas Day episode of Doctor Who this year”BLOODY #Brexit and #TheresaMay are at fault....Or was it #Trump , he did visit this year.....Get Bond onto it please....Not good enough !
Blimey, this from @SamCoatesTimes on the cabinet meeting to approve the draft #Brexit agreement “Others concentrated on no-deal consequences. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the room that he could not guarantee people would not die as a result of a no-deal Brexit.”
Thank u to our team of diplomats + negotiators who have worked tirelessly with @MichelBarnier + the UK to secure a credible #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement that protects Ireland, our shared Island + our future relationship with UK. Let’s hope deal now survives Westminster. 
Sign this if you think @UKLabour  should provide some opposition to #Brexit by supporting a #PeoplesVote with #OptionToRemain @Labour4EU

Here is more from @IainDale. As he says he is an ardent brexiteer but he is clear that the #brexit being delivered is nothing like what he voted for & if that's all that's on offer he is a #remainernow It's ok to change your mind when facts change.Let's have a #PeoplesVote
WATCH: went head to head with arch Brexiter Peter Bone this evening on @SkyNews to explain how people changing mind on #Brexit and @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay
My team downloaded the #Brexit doc. Nearly 600 pages. We ran a few searches. ‘Wales’. ‘Welsh’. ‘Holyhead’ (I represent Ynys Môn/Anglesey, home to the 2nd busiest UK-EU ro-ro ferry port - kinda important.)Results: 0.
Dear @theresa_may - in the words of Oliver Cromwell; “Depart, I say; and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!" #Brexit

Steve Bray of @SODEMAction has been the public face and voice of #Brexit resistance for 2 years. Steve, you are awesome!  
I don’t think you understood my point. Can I suggest you might profit from spending a few hours looking at the #deal rather than recycling old arguments in blissful ignorance of what your Govt has signed up to #Brexit #DraftWithdrawalAgreement #indyref2
Rarely have I ever seen such a mismanagement of policy, ineptitude, pathetic attempt at strategic negotiations than what is occurring in the UK over #Brexit May has to go. This is a debacle.
I've known my son to put more effort into comparing breakfast cereals than most MPs have done in comparing #brexit #leave vs #remain. At least he has opportunity to study things like the ingredients list, use by dates, etc.Whatever happened to proper consideration of options?

Scotland must walk in any case - #Brexit just the latest crap thrown at us by this rotting Union
Your sad little @ScotTories threats won’t work any longer. Upside of this daft #Brexit deal is eternal transition/backstop will keep rUK so close to EU it’ll be quite easy for an #Indy Scotland in the #EU to maintain trade with rUK & we’ll be rule makers 
Here is the key point which can not be disputed; Dublin would have a greater say in NI in relation to the Single Market than the sovereign Government. You don’t need to add anything to that fact. That is enough in of itself to inflame every self respecting unionist. #Brexit
Bizarre to hear people expressing their outrage over Theresa May's betrayal of #Brexit Did they actually think that as a Remainer who was appointed PM in a palace coup by the pro-EU conspirators in the Tory party she was going to act differently?
There needs to be a ‘Brexit for dummies’ guide because I’m so lost in all of this #Brexit Anyone else feel the same?!
Secretly, one of my main disappointments with the #brexit shenanigans is that we feebly succumbed to the term "backstop" instead of "wicketkeeper". #takebackcontrol
This deal is insane. #Brexit in name only. What is UK is getting out of it? A hugely watered down version of status quo minus any say in rule making resulting in an intolerable #democraticdeficit. If this can’t be reversed then Scotland must walk #indyref2

There is no escaping a) this is a Potemkin Brexit b) the public aren't daft enough to miss that c) it's an abject capitulation and d) it *wont* have the numbers in parliament.Catastrophic failure of government. #Brexit 
Fed up with #TheresaMay 's  #Brexit ? There is an alternative.And here it is... 
Can’t keep up with all this #brexit news. My brain's hurting. Need John Craven to break everything down for me 
Serious question, has anyone come across a single person on here outside of the government who supports this deal? I haven't. It's quite astonishing to unite the left, right and centre in condemnation of the same thing. That is Theresa May's legacy. #Brexit #BrexitDeal
“We’ve got @Theresa_May saying #Brexit Means Brexit, but Brexit Means Remain” is what she really means! @Nigel_Farage“I'm so angry today I can barely put it in words!This is the lowest point I've seen in my life in government & trust from the people.”
How many times is Wales mentioned in the draft #Brexit agreement? 0. Wales is not mentioned once. With no regard given to Wales and the damage Brexit could bring to the Welsh economy, jobs and livelihoods, we must have a #PeoplesVote with the option to remain in the EU. 
UK: 54% of voters would vote remain if European membership referendum was held again (Survation poll, 20 Oct–2 Nov ); 52% think it was wrong to vote to leave the European Union (YouGov poll, 4-5 Nov). #WithdrawalAgreement #BrexitChaos #Brexit #TheresaMay
Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EUScotland voted to stay in the EUMost of England & Wales now wants to stay in the EUThe continuation of #Brexit now seems to be an act of extreme selfishness on the part of a minority.So much pain for no perceivable gain.#bbcnewsten
It's on days like today that I like to remind twitter that about half of people in the UK either don't know anything at all about the customs union or have never even heard of it #Brexit 
Labour could make a net gain of 1.5m votes if it backs a #PeoplesVote but Corbyn regards a Final Say as 'not a priority' So it seems Corbyn prefers #Brexit even to very large gains in the Labour vote. This has a very bad smell. #StopBrexit
May’s draft ageeement includes a £39 billion brexit withdrawal bill for the UK... paid over the course of a year, that’s £750m a week.. didn’t see that on the bus  #BrexitAgreement #brexit #bbcnews
Spoken to @theresa_may this evening who outlined broad terms of #brexit deal. We now need to consider detail of what’s proposed. Consistently made clear the need for full & unfettered access to single mkt & participation in a customs union to protect economy & Welsh jobs
Glad to see the Tories still making time for levity and satire, jolly good sports! #Brexit #brexitdeal #BrexitBetrayal
#bbcnews The #brexitdeal is not much better than no-deal, worse than what the UK already has now as a member, and nothing like what was promised... No wonder people want a chance to reconsider #brexit with a #PeoplesVote#newsnight
UK Prime Minister May backed on #Brexit, but she still faces battle in parliament 
This has been an interesting day  politically for the Prime Minister, she really is Teflon, she’s faced down the hardliners in her own party along with the DUP and survived to fight another day #Brexit
This, on the day May admits no #Brexit is an option, shows Corbyn’s determined to be on wrong side of history on #PeoplesVote #FinalSayLabour need to ditch Corbyn rapidly or rational moderates must break away.In contrast @LibDems want an #ExitFromBrexit
"This is the best cup of cold sick on offer. Drink it." #Brexit
So Theresa May admits there is a No #Brexit option...that is quite significant given she has hitherto stated the only choice was her #Brexit or a No Deal #BrexitShambles...let's take the #StopBrexit #Remain route please...it's better than either of the other 2!

Just extraordinary. A more disgraceful, dishonest farce it is hard to imagine. This abject surrender document MUST be voted down! #Brexit #BrexitBetrayal

For what it’s worth I think the government and @merrionstreet have handled the communication of today’s #Brexit agreement extremely well. High stakes require strict discipline, then @campaignforleo hitting the main evening @rtenews senior hurling indeed.
The EU, have tarred and feathered the UK today.  They have everything they wanted, including the fish and Theresa May, has the worst of all possible outcomes.  Although no one's admitting it,  N Ireland is no longer part of the UK.  #Brexit #indyref2
A #WithdrawalAgreement that will rob Britons of their right to live, work and study in 30 countries. A right removed with no referendum mandate, and no proper debate, let alone the kind of super-majority that should be required for such a measure.#Brexit is robbery.#PeoplesVote

I am pleased an agreement has been reached between EU & UK negotiators on a draft #Brexit Withdrawal Treaty. While I welcome these developments, Brexit is not our policy & is something we regret. However we respect the vote of the people of the UK. 
Today Scotland has suffered a gross insult from the Tory Government in Westminster. If Scotland is to retain any dignity out of this #Brexit shambles the @theSNP @scotgov must initiate steps to ensure that in the days to come Scotland takes her own decisions re. the EU!

Statement from @campaignforleo #brexit 
For regular Brits, the gulf between the pure elation of 23 June 2016 and the crushing despondency of 14 Nov 2018 has never been greater. Brexiteers. Remember why you voted. Remember what you voted for.  Remember why it matters. Hold the line. This fight is not over #Brexit
#BrexitDeal reaction from a Number 10 insider: "Yes. Well it started badly, it tailed off a little in the middle and the less said about the end the better! But apart from that, excellent!" #Blackadder #BrexitChaos #Brexit
Hold on.  Listen carefully.  She's giving three options here.  Her deal, no deal, or no #Brexit at all.  That sounds like she's paving a path to a #PeoplesVote for after the UK Parliament rejects her proposed deal.
Theresa May says the cabinet's backing of the draft #Brexit deal is a "decisive step"[Tap to expand] 
I am #NotBuyingIt - and back @peoplesvote_uk so delighted to hear from constituents! #Brexit
#Brexit..how is @duponline going to square up to the details emerging in this draft Brexit agreement? They may well have to depend on ERG and other dissidents to give them cover. This deal ties GB to EU but really YOKES NI to EU.
So Theresa May finally admits #Brexit can be stopped.Jeremy Corbyn’s most recent pronouncement, on the other hand, says it can’t.Corbyn’s just been outmanoeuvred and trussed up like a turkey! I can’t say I didn’t see it coming. 
With billions set to be wiped off the Welsh economy and irreparable economic damage predicted, we must seek a way out of this #Brexit madness. There is a better way – a #PeoplesVote that includes the option of the people of #Wales, to remain in the European Union.
The Cabinet agreement to May’s botched #Brexit deal WASN’T unanimous, according to Sky, at least 10 ministers voted against. The deal isn’t secure, May isn’t secure. The shambles continues. 
A comprehensive #BrexitDeal published tonight by Michel Barnier seems, at first reading, to address Ireland's concerns. There is no such thing as a good #Brexit but the progress made on the island of Ireland since 1998 will be protected as far as any Brexit allows. 
Abject surrender, without a shot being fired.  Shameful.  Watch out for our strongest #Brexit article yet, tomorrow.Distinctive daily #Brexit research & news : 
Barnier: “regrets” #Brexit and says there is “no value added”. Indeed. Time for @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay

.@MichelBarnier “We have never negotiated against the #UK but always with the UK. Today, in my capacity as the @EU_Commission’s chief negotiator, I consider that we have achieved decisive progress in the #Brexit negotiations. UK will remain our friend, our ally and our partner.” 
Called to a briefing at 9:30pm tonight what the Tánaiste re latest #Brexit developments. Currently going through the daft agreement, all 585 pages of it! @fiannafailparty
Dismayed, disgusted.  MPs get your letters in. The only way to save #Brexit is a new leader. The fight continues..
'Our precious union' ciontinued:A 585 page UK Govt #Brexit plan. After a first word search I cannot find a single reference to the Scottish Government. Or the Welsh Government. But there is a reference to British Overseas Territories such as the Cayman Islands.
#Brexit dossier is over 500 pages long...ZERO... Number of times are #Wales and #Scotland mentioned.We are the real vassal states, a lifetime of slavish indignity, no thanks. Only with independence can our nations claim equality & self respect in the modern world. @YesCymru
Draft Brexit deal between Britain and EU includes a solution on the so-called backstop to prevent a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland  Read more #Brexit coverage: 
May must go. #Brexit
If anyone who voted leave ever expected us to come out on top when negotiating a deal with a block of 27 other countries then they were kidding themselves and have an inflated sense of this country’s standing. #Brexit #BrexitChaos
PM May has placed a Brexit deal on the table disguised as a burning bag of dog feces. Is it any wonder? She was a “remainer” all along. If you feel cheated by some illegal ballots in Broward, imagine how the people of the UK feel having their referendum vote ignored? #Brexit
#Brexit roundup:- Draft Brexit deal ends Britain's easy access to EU financial markets - Ministers back PM on Brexit, battle ahead in parliament  - For latest #Brexit updates: 
Well I, for one, am really glad that this #Brexit business has finally put an end to the Tory party's internal conflicts over Europe.
The final page of the 585-page withdrawal agreement contains a bit of a shocker. #brexit 
Looks like European Court of Justice will continue to reign supreme in UK in very significant respects for four years after end of transition period - Articles 87 & 89 #DraftWithdrawalAgreement #CJEU #Brexit So scratch that red line @theresa_may

Here is that #Brexit deal in full. Ironically nearly all text was drafted by @EU_Commission .  UK Govt thinks it's regaining power but this document demonstrates opposite is case. The extreme #Brexiters positions would make this even worse. Sad day for UK.
We recommend to the European Council (Art 50) to find decisive progress in the #Brexit negotiations:

BREAKING NEWS: #Brexit 
Theresa May concedes there are now 3 options: her deal, no deal or no #brexit. The democratic thing is a #peoplesvote to decide which is best for the country.
A "long, detailed and impassioned debate"UK PM Theresa May's cabinet backs her draft #Brexit deal 
They ignored the result of a national referendum.If this is allowed to stand, the UK is no longer a democratic country. #Brexit
Ministers back UK Prime Minister Theresa May on #Brexit but she faces battle in parliament 
"It is ironic is it not that the last two years the prime minister has told us no deal is better than a bad deal, and now she is arguing that we have got to accept a bad deal for fear of no deal. That is a false choice." #Brexit 
Today we learned our votes do not matter. This is an utter betrayal, a shameful humiliating disgrace. May has no mandate to sell our sovereignty. This has to be stopped. #Brexit #MayMustGo
The DUP dinosaurs are self-combusting because the north might be treated differently to "the rest of Britain".Hello  Abortion rights?Marriage Equality?#Brexit
Is he seriously still showing his face & giving out advice on #Brexit ? What did Mr Little Britain expect  
Theresa May in September: "No deal is better than a bad deal."She's now completely reversed that position and sold the country out in the process.Total capitulation.#Brexit
Well, it looks as though @theresa_may has now accepted that there are 3 options going forward....1. Her #BrexitDeal2. No Deal and crashing out3. No #Brexit at all.This is progress.#RevokeArticle50 #StopBrexit#PeoplesVote #FinalSay #FBPE #FinalSayForAll #NotBuyingIt

At least kids learning about history will have a new total fucking shambles to learn about. No more Henry VIII murdering his wives, instead it’ll be how we fucked ourselves for no reason for decades. #brexit
May has finally admitted what everyone else has been saying for a long time, #Brexit can be stopped.All she now needs to admit is that there should be a #Peoplesvote #FinalSay referendum with the option to #Remain Then we can #ExitFromBrexit
I voted with my head and heart for  #Brexit - you have NOT delivered it and I'm sick of you saying you are delivering on it.  YOU MUST GO @theresa_may
Most interesting thing about the PM’s statement - with “or even no Brexit” she acknowledges the @HouseofCommons could provide for a #PeoplesVote enabling the British people to stop #Brexit if they decide the deal we have is better than her deal ie.Brexit is NOT inevitable
‘Never forget and never forgive’The people may need to storm parliament and take back control the old fashioned way.THERESA HAS SURRENDERED THE UK TO THE EU EMPIRE.#BrexitBetrayal #Brexit 
#Brexit is a good example of the shitshow we call voting & government. They voted to leave, their politicians drag their feet and make an apparently shitty deal when the shit isn’t that complicated. How’s about draining that swamp? You are Fools
Can someone in the Scottish MSM, when Sturgeon is pontificating about #Brexit please finally ask her why leaving an economic Union of 40 years is Armageddon but leaving a social, political and economic Union of 300 years would be a stroll in the park. It's long overdue...

A UK Cabinet that Scotland didn’t elect has just backed a draft deal on #Brexit that Scotland didn’t vote for and has ignored the pleas of the elected Scots Gov representing Scotland that voted to Remain. No wonder support for Scottish independence is growing.
Breaking: Theresa May says Cabinet has agreed to back her withdrawal agreement, paving the way for the UK's departure from the EU. The PM said talks have led to a 'decisive step' towards #Brexit happening. Latest: 
Dear DUP,Please learn the lessons, and failures, of the past - do not repeat them.Come back home where you belong and embrace a future in Ireland where ALL the children of our nation can, and will, be cherished.Le grá,Ireland.#Brexit #Endpartition
Even @theresa_may confirms #Brexit can be stopped
You have to hand it to the government - it has managed to twist the most exciting demand for change in recent British political history into yet another reiteration of There Is No Alternative. How utterly depressing. #Brexit
Whenever I hear the words 'end free movement of people' it is heartbreaking for my country Scotland, and all the young folk who will not be able to travel freely, work and love wherever they may find themselves in Europe. #brexit
The Scottish Tories, who threatened to resign over May’s Brexit Deal three hours ago, have just ratified it.Tells you everything. #Brexit
Does May really think that threatening no deal or no Brexit will make people accept any old thing she's cobbled together? Goodness me. #BrexitDeal #Brexit #Brino
The DUP probably shouldn’t have retweeted that threat about BrexitBy @baldpolitiks #Brexit #BrexitChaos #BrexitDeal
Commemorative #Brexit flag announced 
After a pack of spin and false claims - the PM concedes herself this is NOT a two way choice between her “deal” - and no deal. She says it could also mean NO #Brexit - all the more reason why it’s time for a @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay for the public - with #Remain on the ballot.
FUCK. #brexit #statement #May How on earth can she say that this is in our county's best interests? She doesn't believe HERSELF! Oh God.
"When you strip away the detail* the choice before us is clear." - @theresa_may.*You, your life, the well-being of your kids & your parents & the NHS, are "the detail." "The detail" doesn't bother rich people like her. #brexit #c4news #bbcnews
Well, whatever you think about #TheresaMay, after 2 years of hideous debate, she has finally done the unthinkable, and united the UK!Everyone thinks the deal is shit. #Brexit
Utterly content free statement on #brexit from @theresa_may Treating public with contempt. #BrexitChaos
Theresa May just making at statement outside no.10, she has secured collective cabinet support for the draft withdrawal treaty. Now we need to see the actual text and the detail! @fiannafailparty #brexit

Astonishing. @duponline MP Sammy Wilson tells BBC his party still hasn’t seen draft #Brexit agreement and is relying partly on “briefings from the media” while authorities in Gibraltar have seen text @markdevenport @BBCNewsNI
Sat with a cuppa waiting for the @theresa_may speech.If there is one person that I am glad I’m not right now, it’s her. So many people have used this #Brexit process as a point scoring/back stabbing/personal agenda exercise.They know who they are & they should be ashamed
PM choice of words bingo tonight anyone ? What will discussions be ? Fruitful ? Ongoing ? Robust ? Meaningful ? #no10door #brexit
It's been two and a half years since we voted to leave the #EU and quite frankly the government has made a mess of this. If the #PM comes back with a #Chequers-type deal, it will be an abomination of #Brexit and she will be betraying the British people." 
The PM's #BrexitDeal will seemingly involve a UK-wide customs union being implemented straight after Brexit. That will almost certainly mean the UK will not be able to sign and implement trade deals with third countries - That's not good enough, not independence and not #Brexit
The Bow Group & members of the @brexit_advance coalition call on Prime Minister Theresa May to resign, following her failure to secure an acceptable #Brexit dealSuch is its significance, if conservative MPs cannot support her deal they cannot support her continuation as leader. 
Theresa May expected to make statement shortly after marathon cabinet meeting on draft #Brexit dealFollow the latest here: 
And still media will not tell the truth or do the proper investigation. Puppet theatre in Westminster UK's military signed away under smokescreen of #brexit without the exit  Read 
In years to come, when people want to say something is very confused, they’ll be able to say “It’s as clear as #brexit”, and everyone will understand what they mean.
Latest image released by No 10 #Brexit 
Theresa May has at long last succeeded in uniting the nation, as she had promised she would. Brexiters & Remainers alike are united in despising the sorry state that the government she leads has brought our country to, & in asking the question: “#Brexit: What is the point?”
If I was British and voted to leave the EU I would be furious listening to tripe being spewed from Theresa Mays mouth as a  solution. She has sold off democracy and turned her back on the British Citizens. #Brexit
An idealised timetable for the #Brexit endgame is circulating among the EU27 (italics are mine). Who knows if this still stands but it suggests a FULL draft of the political declaration on the future relationship being published next Tuesday. 
We wouldn't be able to replace capitalism, or even reform our capitalist system, to make it much fairer and more equal, within the confines of a neo-liberal EU.Maybe this is the moment to be brave?Ps, I am a European and I voted remain.#Brexit

Polite reminder. These torturous negotiations are just to allow Britain to leave the EU. They have yet to start work on the future trading relationship. This shitshow will take years to play out. #Brexit

It's time to respect the democratic mandate served and Leave the EU.Commentary by David Cameron and Dominic Lawson.#Brexit 
The opposition is united, Theresa May must come before Parliament first and face proper scrutiny on her #Brexit deal. 
I grew up in the 80s, I was brought up to believe and I personally always have stood up to bullies. It sickens me to see our leaders bend over to the EU mafia as seems to be happening. This is not the English way, we don't capitulate we don't give into threats #Brexit #BrexitDeal

In what world did the PM think that she would persuade her cabinet in just 3 hours? She has spent 2 years negotiating and has barely moved from square one. Missing every single deadline along the way.  #Brexit 
Do you think that #Brexit is:A. Delivering what was promised (lots of money saved that would go to the #NHS, new&easy #trade deals, no job losses, ability for Britain to ignore common European rules, etc)B. Bears no resemblance to what was promised and should be ditched
FACT 2: The NHS already has an additional £900m a year bill thanks to the fallen pound and that's only getting worse. Can anyone else feel the #Brexit dividend slipping away?  #NotBuyingIt #PeoplesVote

Says the multi-millionaire Saudi advisor whose adherence to Margaret Thatcher's bogus trickle-down economics created the perfect conditions for an anti-establishment #Brexit vote. Every time Tony Blair appeared in the media during the referendum campaign, the Leave vote went up. 
No hard border can be imposed on the island of Ireland. Citizens’ rights must be protected & the Good Friday Agreement must remain protected in all its partsGiven the latest news that a potential #Brexit deal has been struck, the Taoiseach must confirm this will remain the case 
Poised hack pack outside Number 10 #Brexit 
If you’re wondering why May is seeing cabinet ministers one-by-one it’s that she’s telling pro-remain ministers if they don’t back her #Brexit they’ll get a no deal brexit.But then she’s telling ERG/hard brexit ministers that if they don’t back her they’ll get remain in EU.
As the Cabinet meets to discuss the #Brexit draft agreement, former PM Tony Blair gave me an extended interview on #AfternoonLive to discuss his thoughts on the deal, Labour’s response and whether there could be a second referendum
Theresa May’s #Brexit deal is the worst deal since #Munich It is #BRINO Brexit in Name Only and is considerably worse that remaining IN the #EU Members of Parliament should vote it down! #GeneralElectionNow
I have received hundreds upon hundreds of emails from constituents in the past 24 hours. My position on #Brexit has been unambiguous throughout, and I strongly believe the only way out of this Tory mess is a #PeoplesVote or a General Election. The people must have the final say.

Speaking to BBC @joannaccherry explains that @IanBlackfordMP invited main opposition party leaders to join him in writing to the PM to point out UK govt must adhere to promise of having meaningful #Brexit vote. That means a motion that's amendable by the adding of conditions.
Discussing fishing in #Brexit negotiations, @joannaccherry says to watch not only verbal undertaking on CFP but reality of what's going on behind the scenes. Reminds BBC that Scot & Brit Tories sold Scotland's fishing rights down the river & it will be very hard to get it back.

Well she clearly hasn't and doesn't plan on doing so! Your inaction looks like cowardice or capitulation. Neither of which are behaviours becoming of a @Conservatives MP. We want her gone bc that is the only way to save #Brexit, the party, the country & democracy.
We are witnessing the final phase of Operation Bury #Brexit that started when Theresa May was appointed PM in a palace coup. Notice how all the key players in this farce including the whole of the #media are acting out their parts in accordance with the script written by the EU.
It has come to light that the @WelshGovernment has not yet been briefed on the #Brexit papers by @10DowningStreet, concerns that were also raised in the @SeneddChamber today. A symptom of tensions in the devolution settlement perhaps?

What is the point of #Brexit?There are no winners and 66million million losers.Totally effing pointless waste of time and money.
So now truth is out. A #Brexit fudge that pleases nobody & a cabinet who put their own survival above interests of the nation. It will not pass the Commons. Now #PeoplesVote is the only answer
Can confirm the entire cabinet has resigned and I'm just sitting here watching Netflix x #Brexit #PMQs
#Brexit #WithdrawAgreement The lack of respect from the UK Government to Scotland is once again as outrageous as it is heartbreaking...  And the Scottish Tory MPs are happy with it. What a disgrace! Scotland deserves better ... You are a great Nation #GaunYersels
Finally I asked Mark Drakeford whether he agrees with @plaid_cymru that the only way to resolve this mess over #Brexit is through a @peoplesvote_uk? He confirmed he is still in favour of seeking a general election first. It's unclear to me what that would resolve. #PeoplesVoteNow
“The Irish government is behaving terribly in relation to #Brexit. It is allowing itself to be used by the EU to undermine British people’s democratic wishes. All this talk of a ‘hard border’ is just fearmongering designed to weaken Brexit.” Brendan O’Neill on Sky 
Remembering the outrage when @theSNP MPs refused to give a standing ovation to the author of this #Brexit debacle. Who’d applaud today? #PMQs
In years to come, this will be a riddle in every British Household: For 22 months, Theresa May told the British People, that no deal was better than a bad deal. But on the 23rd month, Theresa May stated that a bad deal was better than no deal. What did she mean?#Brexit
Like many Scots I am as implacable and determined in my opposition to independence as I am in my opposition to #Brexit, and I refuse to allow Scottish separatists to co-opt my 2016 Remain vote in their campaign to divide and Leave the UK. Two wrongs don't make a right.
Some of the people pushing the false idea that Scottish independence is a solution to #Brexit are just misinformed and repeating others' lies. Some of them, though, know full well that independence would do even more damage than Brexit, but are saying this anyway, Shame on them.
Sinn Féin deputy leader @moneillsf will be talking to British PM Theresa May today. Sinn Féin's position is clear, the Good Friday Agreement must be protected and the backstop 'cast iron'. #Brexit #BrexitDeal
Press release from #ForBritain on #Brexit betrayal 
The EU have archived all of the 'Euromyths' printed in UK media - and it makes for some disturbing reading  via @LondonEconomic #Brexit #PeoplesVote
A comment on the #Brexit deal. We await final confirmation of the detail.  But if it is as reported, it will not have my support. More than that, it will represent a disastrous failure of policy.
Are you a normal person who doesn't understand international trade, the #WTO, why #Brexit is so complicated, or why you should care? Tune in to @BBCRadio4 tonight at 8:45 as @baddiel Tries to Understand Global Trade. I'm slightly worried he might put me out of a job.
"It has to be said May looks nervous ahead of this dive... She's attempting the never before tried 'Career Implosion, Election Trigger and British Union Break-Up' with 3.5 twists..." #Brexit #BrexitDeal #BrexitChaos
Just asked @theresa_may if #Brexit will leave the UK as a vassal state, as rule takers not rule makers & if she would call for a People's Vote  Pitiful that she chose to ignore this call  .@LibDems have led & will continue to fight for a #PeoplesVote #PMQs
The Prime Minister is due to meet the Cabinet today to discuss #Brexit plans. For a ‘deal’ to be introduced to @HouseofCommons it first needs to be approved by @EUCouncil. What might happen next in a ‘deal’ or a ‘no deal’ scenario? 
This is what happens when those demanding Brexit for 40 years fail to put forward a coherent workable plan. They have held key ministries since the referendum yet been utterly incompetent. If #Brexit fails, they have only themselves to blame.
With the @WelshLabour Government lacklustre in what it demands from the British Government on #Brexit, @Plaid_Cymru will speak up for Wales. When will devolved Parliaments see the Withdrawal Agreement text and see the devastating impact of Brexit on devolved nations? #PMQs
If May truly believes her deal has the "will of the people" at its heart, as she said several times today, then she should prove it by taking it to the country in the form of a General Election. #brexitdeal #brexit #PMQs
I think the PM has finally *lost it* ! #PMQsShe stated - with some *force* - that the British people would EXPECT the HOC to vote in SUPPORT of her #Brexit deal !!!Theresa  As the Tory MP Peter Bone said -many of your own backbenchers  CAN'T support it.
Theresa May still trying to push her Brexit agreement like... #Brexit
Here you go. Slap a QR code next to it and I'll send some money over to sponsor this bus in case there is a #peoplesvote #Brexit 
I have more faith in @Keir_Starmer @EmilyThornberry & @BarryGardiner negotiating #Brexit than the Tories... don’t you Jess? Also, we need a #GeneralElectionNow so Labour can win & end austerity for the good of the people.Don’t you get this?! 
So Peter Bone has become the nation's psychic.Hello Mr BoneHow do you know which version of #Brexit the nation voted for?No particular version was specified on the ballot paper and the various leagues of Leave came up with every possible variation under the sun.#PMQs
SNP's @KirstySNP raises a point of order. The ministers of Gibraltar have had sight of May's Brexit deal. Why has Scotland's government not had sight of it? #Brexit #BrexitDeal
Ha!Astonishing how the PM- on a whim - can change the language of her #Brexit strategy.The *transitional period* morphed into the *implementation period* and has NOW morphed into the *continuity agreement* !!!!#PMQs
The PM's former Rail Minister said last week that her #Brexit deal will leave us: economically weakened  with no say in EU rules  years of uncertainty for business With little support in Cabinet & Parliament, it's time she admitted her deal is bad for Britain #PMQs

Theresa Mays final ‘resounding retort’ to @jeremycorbyn on her #brexit deal completely blown apart within seconds by the first Tory MP to speak after her. Both embarrassing and tragic
As we’ve reached the #Brexit endgame let me remind the govt and MPs that, in the end, they have only one duty: to protect the people of this country from harm. No courage should be needed for that, but it is today — and #CourageCalls. Here’s why politicians must answer that call:
VARADKAR Breaking: “If an Agreement is made, it is an international treaty between the UK and EU”, “and therefore it would continue to apply even if there is a change of government in the UK” #brexit #brexitdeal @euronews
Corbyn: "If the #Brexit secretary happens to still be in office this afternoon, he should be made aware that his woeful ignorance (re Calais) is disturbing to so many people." - Zing! #PMQs

Prime Minister Theresa May takes questions in parliament following proposed #Brexit deal #PMQs
I agree with every word of what @Michael_Heaver has said on @SkyNews. He’s absolutely spot on. This is not #Brexit. It’s a £39bn #BRINO trap.
95 terrifying examples of how #Brexit is already set to decimate* the British economy*I use the word advisedly 
The real tragedy is that the UK, under the most inept political leadership in a generation has wasted time, treasure, global influence, over 2.5 yrs in an attempt to deliver the impossible.#Brexit can only Remove Rightsw/o Consent & leave the maj WORSE OFF.On the basis of LIES

Sammy nipping to the bookies to put a 5er on a no deal #Brexit 
No matter the deal, #Brexit will hurt the pockets of ordinary people and leave the UK weakened.No one voted for this.No one deserves to be punished because of this Tory Brexit mess.
Conservative MP @AmberRuddHR tells @EmmaBarnett that the draft #Brexit agreement does “deliver” and that “perfect was never going to be on offer.”#EmmaBarnettShow
Whatever their views on #Brexit, no @UKLabour MP can vote to prop up @theresa_may & this Govt & then claim to represent the party. They represent their constituents & the country, but they only sit in Parliament because of Labour & its members. It would be the ultimate betrayal.
Flybe is a lifeline for many in the SW, including many business people. And this is just a drop in the ocean of #Brexit damage that threatens to overwhelm our economy. We hope @SNewtonUK will join her colleages @sarahwollaston and others in taking a stand against this insanity.
Strange to hear people on the TV arguing against the draft #Brexit plan because the UK would ‘lose sovereignty’ when their original argument was that we didn’t have any! Which came first... the chicken or the brEGGit?PS don’t shout at me 
“It’s notable in what Mr Heath has said that he hasn’t mentioned the idea of democracy at all. My remarks, however, are centred on the question of democracy.”Ted Heath and #Labour’s Michael Foot discuss sovereignty and Britain’s membership of the Common Market, 1975. #Brexit 
“An object in possession seldom retains the same charm that it had in pursuit”--Pliny the Elder on #Brexit
How ironic that many who panned Cameron’s renegotiation thought that the UK would suddenly be able to magic cake and cherries in the Brexit negotiations.  The deal will be worse than what the UK had before - but this was always inevitable. #Brexit
Nigel Farage says he doesn’t want to be “part of a ‘German’ European Union, yet he’s made sure two of his children have German passports!“This man wouldn’t know hypocrisy if it stared him in the face.”  #Brexit #EU #NigelFarage
1. No doubt we will see a procession of smug, self-serving articles about how the #Brexit deal is "giving up control" but the regulatory alignment that exists is only a faction of the EU acquis and covers areas largely governed by best practice. (thread)

Good analysis of the direction of travel on #Brexit. EU wants to use NI backstop to keep UK in customs union permanently. I suspect that's what much of the UK establishment wants too, regardless of what people voted for both in the #EUref and the 2017 GE.

‘This is political fraud and I am not putting my name to it,’ @DrPhillipLeeMPon why he is calling for a public vote on the final #Brexit deal.The Cabinet is set to discuss the draft agreement.
‘We need to stop this over-the-top evoking of wartime spirit – we need to get real,’ @JennyChapmanShe’s responding to Mark Francois’ call for the Cabinet to find a Winston Churchill. It is set to discuss the draft #Brexit agreement.
Looks like the #Brexit that was promised isn't remotely possible. Choice is vassalage or chaos - time to stay put and keep our seat at the EU's top table!  
‘There is absolutely no way this will ever get through Parliament,’ says Mark Francois MP.The Cabinet is set to discuss the draft #Brexit agreement.
#Brexit is now the  Rolling Stones vs the Eagles; May -  "you can't always get what you want but if you try some time... you get what you need"  and Brexiteers - "you can check out any time you like but you can never leave"
Today we may be facing the reality of a Blind #Brexit Fudge.It might be the Best Possible Deal anyone can get but whatever happens it will be Far Worse than the deal we have.Not once since the flawed EURef has anyone promised a BETTER DEAL..on that basis we should #StopBrexit

Dear @maitlisI knew @jeremycorbyn campaigned for #Remain (with 60% of @UKLabour following his lead) & that he said he voted Remain, but I had no idea he'd vote for #Brexit given another chance. Can you plse give me a link to more info on this amazing revalation?@BBCNewsnight
WATCH: The Government has finally cobbled together some sort of #Brexit deal - but they know that this dodgy deal isn't better than the one we currently have inside the EU.This deal will leave us worse off & with less control - we're #NotBuyingIt 
Noteworthy that Andrew Neil uses the same insult as Arron Banks against @carolecadwalla. Looks like they're working for the same team. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Support for remaining in EU now stands at 66% in Scotland. The unfolding Westminster Brexit car crash shows the UK political system is not fit for purpose. Regardless of how we voted in Scottish independence referendum, we shouldn't accept that this as good as it gets. #Brexit 
EU supports this #Brexit deal and they’re happy @theresa_may has signed up to it – trouble with negotiations all along is that EU holds most of the cards – ultimately UK will exit on EU’s terms or there will be no deal at all - @CER_Grant on @SkyNews 07.30 
On the EU army... yes the UK could have vetoed it had we remained but #Brexit day by day reveals the true nature of the beast. Britain could govern the pace, but never the destination. They'd have done it anyway but called it something else. Integration by stealth. The EU MO.

Prime Minister @theresa_may has been meeting individually with her cabinet as they read the draft #Brexit agreement.
But, Iain, you did vote for this, because you voted for #Brexit - an unrealizable Tory fantasy - and thereby helped unleash the storm the nation now finds itself in. There's no exculpating yourself now. Time to repent and ask for a #PeoplesVote.
What is the position of @RuthDavidsonMSP & @DavidMundellDCT this morning on #Brexit? They backed the DUP & their absolutist Brexit & idea of the union & threatened resignation. DUP now going for No Surrender Unionism; will Ruth & David join them? 
Wasn't #Brexit supposed to be about sovereignty?Govt's deal takes away our say over EU rules - but still forces us to follow them.We can still take back control. MPs must back a #PeoplesVote to let the people decide their future.
A pattern is emerging of U.K. Govt cynically exploiting legal processes first to frustrate the will of @ScotParl on #ContinuityBill & now to keep MPs in the dark re unilateral revocability of #Article50 #Brexit #FBPE
Ironic that it takes an Irishman to write the most incisive article about the folly that is #Brexit. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Sign of the times: major #NHS teaching hospital is closing one of its ITUs due to staff shortages and safety fears. This is what long term austerity does to health services - and #Brexit has made things worse from an EU staffing perspective

'This is the worst deal in history' @Nigel_Farage says Theresa May's #Brexit plan doesn't stand up to expectations, slams the PM for not walking away from the EU.

My personal opinion on #Brexit:1. It is a lose-lose proposition.2. Only the UK can derail it.3. A second referendum necessary.The EU must:1. Protect the treaties.2. Keep the UK as close as possible.3. Be flexible on timing if necessary.This is too big to fail. EU&UK

oh dear..... @Nigel_Farage ...the man who lit the #brexit touchpaper is now describing it at 'the worst deal in history'.  Maybe you should think it through next time, or leave it to someone who understands politic.  Either way, 'youre not laughing now, are you!'
If you voted for #Brexit because you love the NHS and wanted to give it more money, this is the reality. Don't you think you should be able to say you didn't vote for this? Don't you think you should be able to change your mind now you know you were lied to?

On #r4today William Hague trots out Tory mantra about risk of Corbyn Government as though, if this were to happen, it would be somehow by default and nothing to do with voters.  Yet when they talk about #Brexit it’s ALWAYS in context of ‘what the British people voted for’.
Yeah. Right. #Brexit

Watch the mask slip as the true colours of the Tories in Scotland are exposed. They will have a choice to back their country or their party. Guess which one they'll choose? #Brexit
Expect more sterling volatility in short term amid barrage of Brexit headlines. Implied overnight sterling/dollar vol hits 23%, highest since June 2017 general election, on track for biggest weekly rise in at least 5 years. More than #Indyref, #Brexit referendum & 2017 election 
“Everything alright, Sir?”#Brexit 
It seems @theresa_may is now trying to boss the #Cabinet like she is head of the #Stasi. Her bullying of Cabinet colleagues would be enough for me to resign in itself irrespective of the contents of this wretched “agreement” which she will not let them read! #Brexit 
William Hague on @BBCr4today “Did everyone think we could leave EU without a lot of compromises ? “.                                                      Well, yes. let’s start with Farage, Fox, Rees-Mogg and many others........ #Brexit
Imagine if it were @TheGreenParty as the parliamentary opposition. We would have clear leadership from @CarolineLucas and a solid position to reject a destructive #Brexit deal and go for a #PeoplesVoteWhenever the next election comes, please remember this
Standby for Govt line on #Brexit agreement “don’t panic don’t reject it it’s just a back stop we’ll negotiate the promised deal after we leave & it will be far superior to this” Baloney. Conservative colleagues need to get real - after 2 1/2 years this is as good as it gets.
Lot of people on @twitter talking about this thread by @uk_domain_names. He lists 50 real stories about the effects of #Brexit on the UK economy + business, w/ a source to corroborate each one. Whether you're Leave or Remain  it's worth a read. #BREXIT #BrexitDeal
Popular line on one phone-in this morning: “No idea what it says, but I think we should get behind it”. We absolutely never learn. #Brexit
So we have EU officials stating Theresa May deal will ensure: “The EU will retain all the controls. They apply the same rules. UK wants a lot more from future relationship, so EU retains its leverage”This is NOT #Brexit, NOT taking back control, NOT Independence. It is Bondage!
Look on the bright side, Western #Balkans. At least you’re aligning your laws to eventually get a seat at the #EU decision making table. And, just think, the #UK will then have to accept your decisions because, well, ‘we’ve taken back control’! What an utter farce. #Brexit
Editorial: Be encouraged, Cabinet, and #ChuckChequers The EU is scared that Britain will make a great success of itself outside the EU. Why would the EU be so scared of that eventuality if it was as improbable as the remainers claim? #csm #Brexit #EU
I find it curious that those who railed against neocons, neoliberals, ‘occupied’ stuff after the credit crunch, etc. now declare cult-like devotion to a top-down corporate superstate with dreams of empire and a mighty military. #brexit #peoplesvote
We are really unfortunate that FG are in government for #Brexit. No other party suffers from such demented Europhilia or is so willing to sacrifice Ireland's interests for brownie points from Druncker & Gee.Of course we are unfortunate that FG is in government period.

So what you’re saying @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is that your government and party are extraordinarily incompetent, but deserve another chance at screwing up #Brexit? 
Farage spelled out: a man who led his country out of the EU but made sure his children have German passports #Brexit 
After being told we were ‘shackled to a corpse’ and should get out, the deal is now to lock the UK into EU trade rules without a say for years to come. Yes, the imaginary chains are being replaced by real ones. #brexit is utter madness.
Theresa May published her woeful  #Brexit deal. And Tony Blair attacks @jeremycorbyn Hmm. Anyone else suspect that there is fear of a #GeneralElection ?
Some Leavers accuse Remainers of being unpatrotic. The simple retort is that #Brexit is what a traitor would do to Britain. #BrexitDeal #PeoplesVote
Today it’s time to highlight that the negative impact of #Brexit on EU citizens isn’t just a story about individuals, but also of how families and loved ones are affected. Deal or not, they too are #AlreadyNotFine. Like Juliette and her family. 1/
So it looks likely that the government will announce & push on with a #BrexitDeal which almost everyone knows will harm the country, with the sole justification that people voted for it 2.5 years ago, when of course no-one could have known what it would be.#PeoplesVote #Brexit
When @DavidDavisMP is given his inevitable airtime on this #Brexit deal, the only question should be "but you promised immediate deals directly with Germany, you promised "exact same benefits", you were in charge of negotiations. How do you have any credibility whatsoever?" 
Tony Blair thinks he can defend his record AND attack Labour's current leadership. This man was responsible for increased deregulation & privatisation, neglect of towns & cities in the North & Midlands, and supported Dubya's invasion of Iraq, with appalling consequences. #Brexit 
A better man would have some humility over his collosal misjudgement.  A patriot would put his country first.@DavidDavisMP didn't say we'd "survive" #Brexit but that we'd get the "exact same benefits"He campaigned against the EU without even bothering to try to understand it

PM May and #EU have agreed on a #Brexit plan.My take:- UK Cabinet will likely pass the deal↓Parliament will likely vote down the deal↓Three possible outcomes:i. Snap general election (30% chance)ii. May ousted→Hard Brexit (30%)iii. 2nd referendum (40%)

After #Brexit the #EU should have absolutely no power over the #UK & get no say on how we run our country just like in other non EU nations like the #USA, #Australia, India, #SouthKorea. @theresa_may wants to use her deal to let #Eurocrats rule us & make the UK an #EUcolony!

This bodes well for #Brexit. Vultures picnic awaits...

Oh my god. Yes, Boris - there is “no point in leaving the EU” if you still have to deal with the EU, but have forfeited any role or authority in that process. So why did YOU lead Britain down this path of misery and crisis? Did you not once look at a single FREAKIN’ MAP? #Brexit

If you haven’t done so already, NOW WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD GODDAM TIME to email your MP asking them to reject the #Brexit deal that the Govt have brought back. #PeoplesVote
Make no mistake, people, the second referendum on the membership of Britain in the EU will bury #Brexit That is the whole point of this whole scam by May's cabal and Remainers generally who are all funded by the EU.
It’s remarkable how many people have already made up their minds about a deal that they’ve not even seen yet #Brexit
Unbearable to hear @BorisJohnson pontificating about how  the draft @theresa_may #Brexit deal damages British democracy & sovereignty. Yes it does. But the man who both campaigned for Brexit and argued to stay in the single market has no credibility on this.
Earlier tonight @IanBlackfordMP wrote a joint letter to Theresa May, with the other Westminster opposition leaders, calling for a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal so Parliament can make amendments - and fully express its view on the terms of the deal #Brexit #Newsnight
As a matter of principle, any backstop has to be something you could live with indefinitely, however unlikely you think this might be. But if we end up tied to a customs union, with a common rule book, that's simply not #Brexit. And if it breaks up the Union, its even worse...
 SNP Westminster Leader @IanBlackfordMP will be on tonight’s @BBCNewsnight outlining the SNP’s sensible alternative to a hard Tory Brexit - and calling for a truly meaningful vote on the proposals to protect jobs, living standards and the economy #Brexit #Newsnight
Today at Justice Q’s I asked the Conservative Government to give a guarantee that any new arrangements between the UK and the EU will respect Scotland's separate and independent justice system.Minister’s answer showed total lack of understanding of Scotland. #Brexit 
Film critics are stockpiling foreign phrases in a Tilbury warehouse in anticipation of a hard #Brexit
I’ve tweeted many times about Jeremy Corbyn’s failings (particularly on #Brexit) but this is a vital and welcome letter he’s signed on behalf of Labour along with with @libdems @vincecable and the HoC leaders of the SNP & Plaid Cymru.
The EU made it perfectly clear before the referendum that Britain would be worse off outside of the EU than in it.Now Britain has its #Brexit deal.Which confirms it will be worse off.And now Britain is shocked.Are we a nation of idiots?#bbcnewsten
MPs react to reports about what's in that all-important draft #Brexit deal[Tap to expand]
It is important to recognize the fact that the @BBC is part of the #Brexit problem. When was the last time BBC made a great documentary about the added value of the UK's priceless EU membership, how it's more sovereign than other EU members with its opt-outs and about its future. 
The gleeful determination with which the #Brexit zealots embrace the prospect of their own country experiencing grinding economic decline in pursuit of a silly fantasy.And the meek response from self-proclaimed defenders of the poor, scared of angering the fascists.Sickening.
Well done to @IanBlackfordMP for his leadership on this initiative. It seems a complicated issue, but we cannot have a take it or leave it #brexit vote, there has to be the ability to amend first. Otherwise it isn’t meaningful. I expect this will rather put a dampener on No10

#brexit .. it seems to me Dippy in the @UlsterMuseum knows as much about the @theresa_may brexit deal as the DUP’s MPS.
The Westminster Govt want people to think the only choice is between this deal or no deal but there is a better way - reverse Brexit! Cross-party support tonight at a rally in Central London calling for peoples vote on Brexit. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #PlaidCymru
MPs and supporters take to the stage to show that they're #NotBuyingIt and want a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Join them, write to your MP and demand a #PeoplesVote: 
Reserving judgement on the draft #Brexit deal til I see the text. All's I can say is I hope the EU side made sure there's no square brackets in that draft, though. We all know where that leads....
#Brexit mug from Bentham Pottery #BenthamPottery
Share, share and share again #ConservativeHome #conservatives #brexit 
Tories, do not think the country, the electorate or history will forgive you for signing up for colony status. The 17.4m will not forget, and will not forgive. #Brexit
.@LaylaMoran: The logical choice is a choice between the #Brexit deal and the deal we have now. Anything else is a false choice #PeoplesVote 
.@LaylaMoran: This #Brexit deal leaves us as a vassal state. We will have to take laws but with no say over them. We are better than that #PeoplesVote #NotBuyingIt
Rees-Mogg: Hoist the White Flag!Brexit means Brexit, No Deal better than bad deal.What May says & what she does don't match!It's a failure to deliver #Brexit & dividing UK.We will need #EU permission to Leave Customs UnionIt's eccentric, it's bizarre!
.@LaylaMoran takes to the stage. Nobody wants this botched #Brexit deal. It's a world apart from what was promised by the Leave campaign. 
David Lidington is de facto Deputy PM, he said #Brexit will make us poorer, think about that, Theresa May's deputy said we'll be poorer, a 2nd referendum is now a must, do 17.4m people still want to make us poorer? They probably do, but fuck them #PeoplesVote is required.
Too many people think #Brexit will only affect export/import businesses but it will hit everyone and will have a significant impact on provision of Healthcare in the UK - from staff to drug access! 
And if you vote against the deal will you FINALLY back a #PeoplesVote ?! We can see another General Election is just a desperate power grab by @UKLabour. Let the people answer the crucial question: are we backing Britain or are we backing #Brexit?  #BackBritainNOTBrexit
I've supported @jeremycorbyn since he was a joke nomination, I still think he will make a good Prime Minister and I want to vote for him, but right now, as I write this @CarolineLucas is my leader. #stepup #brexit #Remain #PeoplesVote
Remember: the bludgeon of no deal is not a credible reason to vote for a bad deal.  This #Brexit means austerity at home and weakness abroad.  
MPs have a choice now - either put your name to the greatest national humiliation of modern times, or vote down the deal and respect the biggest democratic vote in our history. You can't do both. #Brexit
Justine Greening - I’m *never* going to back a bad deal on #Brexit - we need a @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay
And now my brilliant @UKLabour #Redcar colleague @annaturley speaking up about how the genuine anger in areas like hers was exploited to drive #Brexit - and now in this chaos working people stand to lose out - and that’s why we need a @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay ! #WeAreNotBuyingIt
Tonight, with other opposition leaders, I am demanding that Theresa May and the UK government drop any & all plans that would deny the usual democratic procedures of Parliament. The final #Brexit vote must be amendable & any attempt to stop that would be an affront to democracy. 
ERG source tells me: "We fully expect the first Withdrawal agreement to be voted down. God knows what will happen in terms of change of Government.” #Brexit
.@MrAndyParsons leads the crowd in a cheer to demand a #PeoplesVote. It's clear people are #NotBuyingIt and don't want this dodgy #Brexit deal: 
.@IanBlackfordMP & other opposition leaders demand Theresa May drop Tory plans to change Parliamentary procedure preventing voting on opposition amendments to the final #Brexit deal.  Read the full letter here. 
Alastair Campbell - In 2016 we had an ill informed debate.. we had a lot of lies told & a lot of fantasies pedalled.. we now have a more informed electorate.. so we could now have a more informed debate between a #NoDealBrexit & NO #brexit. #PeoplesVote#C4News @campbellclaret
All the stars in #Westminster tonight for the #PeoplesVote rally @acgrayling @DaveRowntree #EUsupergirl and a whole hall of Remoaners demanding a #FinalSay on May's abysmal #Brexit deal  #StopBrexit
Breaking - @IanBlackfordMP & other opposition parties have written a joint letter to the PM, calling on the UKgov to drop plans to change Parliamentary procedure which would prevent opposition amendments being heard on the UK government's #Brexit deal.
Massive turnout in Whitehall tonight, people demanding a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit. We're #NotBuyingit.
#Brexit is about to collapse, and already the cowards Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg are, just like David Cameron, running away from the consequences of their actions. 
NEW: The Westminster leaders of all four main opposition parties - Jeremy Corbyn, Vince Cable, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts - have written a joint letter to the PM demanding a “truly meaningful vote” on her #Brexit deal.
Nigel Farage warns Britain is about to be signed up to the “worst deal in history” if the draft Brexit agreement is given the go-ahead @Nigel_Farage | #Brexit 
 Our message to the Government 1. Democracy didn’t end on 23 June 2016.  2. A #PeoplesVote is the only democratic way forward.3. The movement for a #FinalSay feels unstoppable - and with your chaotic handling of #Brexit, it will continue to grow.
Just 5 minutes to go until the #NotBuyingIt rally. Central Hall is packed and the crowd is ready to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Write to your MP to let them know you're #NotBuyingIt and want a #PeoplesVote: 
How @ChrisMasonBBC hit us with some #Brexit real-talk. #realtalk
.@Nigel_Farage wouldn’t recognise hypocrisy if it would stare him straight in the face. Part of my speech on #Brexit in the #FutureofEurope debate with Angela Merkel today 
Well..#BorisJohnson finally admits we could make our own laws before #Brexit 
#BrexitShambles Looks like #TheresaMay just can’t get a deal that satisfies even her own cabinet and Tory MPs, let alone Parliament or the country.  Probably because neither #Brexit option is good for #Britain :
No end to hyperbole on both sides of #Brexit. Location of phytosanitary checks threatens statehood; EU setting lightbulb regulation is slavery; trading outside the EU is calamity. Has anyone actually been to Norway, Switzerland and felt they were visiting vassal states? 
Leaving you in the capable hands of @skynewsniall tomorrow @skynews #Sunrise - his face when I told him I was having the day off! He won’t sleep tonight because he is by his own admission a #Brexit geek and it looks like there will finally be some movement tomorrow!  
We're #NotBuyingIt. The stage is set for our rally this evening where we will be demanding a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal #PeoplesVote
Get your diaries out.Tonight marks the end of #Brexit.Tonight marks the end of @theresa_may as PM.Tonight marks the end of the @Conservatives as we know them.And you’d have to have a heart of stone and a brain to match not to be thrilled at all of that.#13November2018
Last night and tonight it's @KatieGHannon on the Maurice McCabe story. #Whistleblower Just now it's @tconnellyRTE with a global scoop on #Brexit.Superb journalism from @rtenews.
Right so the "deal" is agreed and without even seeing it we know the DUP aren't having it, and Brexiteers aren't either. This alone suggests it isn't going to get through parliament. A general election really could be coming.  #JC4PM #Brexit #GTTO
Waiting for the day that #Brexiteers and #Lexiteers realize that #Brexit.... is illogical..Until then  we're in a combination of Satre's "No Exit"; Carroll's "Through The Looking Glass"..."The Emperor's New Clothes"..and "a  version of  Monty Python's "Dead Parrot" sketchDubbed 
Important to remember in coming weeks that any #Brexit deal means:No longer being able to live, learn and work freely in 27 other countries No free, frictionless and full access to the Single MarketHarm for every region and nation of the UKWe need a #PeoplesVote! 
After WW2 the EU was created to bring solidarity and peace to Europe. Trading block..ect. It's turned out to be a bureaucratic facist state and now they want a frigging Army! #Brexit
Following reports of a deal between EU and British negotiators on the border issue, Sinn Féin Brexit spokesperson @davidcullinane has this evening said: "The reality is that Brexit is not temporary. It is permanent and we need permanent solutions for Ireland."#Brexit 
NEW Nigel Dodds , the DUP’s Westminster leader, is absolutely furious: "Our laws will be made in Brussels –not in Westminster or Belfast. That is the fundamental red line.” #Brexit
Important thread on #brexit deal . From @theSNP point of view, Indefinite #CustomsUnion with partial single market for NI only & no free movement not acceptable. What’s the point of this vassalage? Time to vote down deal & reverse this madness #PeoplesVote
No shame!!! As a member of the EU we had control, we had a say.. But then because of you Boris, we threw it all away. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
If #Theresamay leaves us tied to the #eu she will have single handedly destroyed the #Conservative party. I wouldn't vote for them as long as I live. #Brexit #BrexitDeal
1) Brussels keeping stumm as regards a #brexit deal tonight
I bet there isn’t a deal. And if there is a deal, I bet it’s like a really bad drug deal that goes totally wrong and everyone ends up getting completely fucked. I bet it’s like that. #brexit
One former Brexiteer Cabinet minister tells me: "We are all toast aren't we. This is almost like the Titanic - she can't steer it and she is not going to let anyone else steer it. Normally rats leave a sinking ship - this lot have stayed on it." #Brexit
It's an irony that @theresa_may can only stay PM by pretending to have always wanted #Brexit & @jeremycorbyn's best chance to become PM is to pretend he's always been against it.
.@vincecable warns “Any #Brexit deal will leave the UK weakened and the public poorer." He says "before the ink is dry, the Conservative Party will tear into what little Theresa May has been able to agree." #ExitFromBrexit #FinalSay
Anyone who has studied in depth the connections between #Trump #Russia and #Brexit will not be surprised ⁦@Nigel_Farage⁩ is in the sights of Special Counsel Robert Mueller “Jerome Corsi to Guardian: ‘They asked about Nigel, I can affirm’ 
Hang on @BorisJohnson, I thought you said we had to leave the EU in order to be able to make our own laws again - but here you are saying we *already* make our own laws and *wouldn’t* be able to do so if we #Brexit. Which is it??? #makeyourmindup#StopBrexitSaveBritain
NEW Iain Duncan Smith suggests no Cabinet ministers will resign over the deal because their 'spines do not yet meet their brains'." #Brexit
Boris Johnson makes the case for staying in the #EU - The agreed #Brexit draft deal is vassal state stuff... for the first time in 1000 years this Parliament will not have a say over the laws that govern this country... #peoplesvote #FBPE
BREAKING: Exclusive footage just leaked from Tory HQ #Brexit #BrexitDeal
There are 2 acceptable positions for any #Brexit supporting MP to hold right now. Either: a) support the PM’s Deal through Parliament or b) Publicly withdraw support for Theresa May to continue as Prime Minister. Time is over for bombastic criticism from the side lines.
Poor @Jacob_Rees_Mogg has his nose seriously out-of-joint that it was @tconnellyRTE who broke this evening's major #Brexit news "and not the British Broadcasting Corporation" saying it was "discourteous to the nation". @drivetimerte @rtenews @BBCBreaking #backstop
TBF I think her benches have been plotting for a while and they want her to be blamed for the Conservative Party mess they have collectively created. #brexit

Forget the media hype. It’s not enough for the PM to secure support for the deal from her Cabinet, or even from Parliament - the people need to be asked to approve, or reject the final #Brexit deal.

It looks like we have a draft #Brexit deal. The paradox is that it will be easier to sell this plan to 27 EU countries than to 22 UK ministers.

Nigel Farage - "I believe having heard you today, leaving the EU is now indeed a liberation."It’s a European Union that we are now to be told to become an empire, a militarised EU, an undemocratic EU, an EU that seeks to continually expand to the east." #Brexit 
Potentially a huge moment for the Good Friday/Belfast agreement. Protecting it should be the key test of any #Brexit deal. 
Good to see the good citizens of Bicester (my old home town) agreewith me, we need a @peoplesvote_uk to settle this #Brexit mess.

Let us not forget the very first #Brexit lie. That the Referendum was only "advisory" and therefore 3 million British Subjects living in EU did not need to have a vote. Now they can lose their pensions and health care if there is no "deal". And they did not get a vote at all!
BREAKING The commons calls for final legal advice on #brexit to be provided No division as govt had called on its MPs to abstain so passed on the nod. Speaker Bercow is insisting documents are provided 'swiftly' and Starmer clarifies he wants  legal advice before meaningful vote
House of Commons approves the @UKLabour motion without a division. This requires the Government to make certain papers relating to legal advice on the #Brexit agreement available to MPs. 
There never was a clear Will of the People...it's simply a clever catch phrase used by Autocrats & Ideologues more interested in imposing their wills on the Ppl than in determining the Real Majority Will of the Ppl.PS A multi-issue GE can't decide #Brexit

Andrew Neil has to be sacked from the @BBC.#PeoplesVote #Brexit 
HMRC is not only recruiting 5,000 more staff to cope with  Brexit, but has now bought 700 office chairs, 700 desks & 1,000 lockers for new staff at an office in Leeds.Far from slashing red tape, the #Brexit con is creating more bureaucrats at greater cost to taxpayers.
I avoid #Brextremist but this irresponsible rant qualifies. #GFA/Belfast Agreement massively endorsed by Irish people N&S who knew what it meant & why. Wants to demolish it to fit #Brexit he pushed with a narrow majority (not in NI!) with no care for context, cost or cosequence. 
.⁦@JunckerEU⁩ in #FutureofEurope debate with A. Merkel: Support of multilateralism a strategic choice, open borders in 2015 the right choice; #Brexit a tragedy but we have to make the best of it; Solidarity, not charity for #Africa; #Germany needs Europe, EU needs Germany.

Scared about what’s happening with #Brexit? Have you written to your MP yet? If not please do so, the future of your country might depend on it, if you have, write again (or email, or visit) 
Brilliant presentation and summary of the Annual #ScaleUp review delivered by Irene Graham and @scoutu at Canada House this morning. #Brexit temporarily forgotten in all the excitement of the UK’s progress as a #ScaleUp nation! Thanks to our #Entrepreneurs who lead the way.

Good to meet with @JohnBlairMLA @allianceparty Environment & Agri spokesperson at Parliament Buildings to discuss Brexit and the crucial need to protect our environment as negotiations continue. #Brexit #crucialtime

"We are almost within touching distance" of a #brexit deal 
Little diagram on the #Brexit process ahead and the possible outcomes. With the current rumors coming out of Cabinet it looks more like we are moving towards a December summit and the right-hand side of the diagram. 
Timely warning from the London Evening Standard to ⁦@CBItweets⁩ & other business organisations not to allow themselves to become “useful idiots” in selling May’s botched #Brexit deal when there’s a better alternative in a #peoplesvote
It’s Tuesday.And my fear is that fatigue will determine the UK’s fate.Everybody is simply exhausted by this endless nonsense, relief will greet any form of words that wraps up the #Brexit process.This must not be allowed to happen.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote
This article is (by some distance) the most read item on @irishtimes this morning 'Fintan O’Toole: Historians will not believe the sheer ignorance of #Brexit supporters'
Keep  for new amendment tabled by @ChukaUmunna @Anna_Soubry to the finance bill. It is close to winning if Labour front  bench support it.It calls for impact assessments to be expanded to compare the #Brexit deal to remain as well as false choice of no deal.
A no deal is looking more likely, that means #Remain must be the outcome. No one voted for No Deal, no one voted for troops on the streets, no one voted for stockpiling. #Brexit can and must be stopped.
Did the Lib Dems sell data to the Remain campaign?  #brexit
.@DLidington unable on #r4today to say #Brexit will make UK better off & does not contradict @bbcnickrobinson summary of his position as ‘I thought in 2016 it would make us worse off & I still think that.’Lab & Tory Brexit-enablers lack courage to tell Leave voters the truth
#Labour MPs from the North East call for #PeoplesVote now that the actual #Brexit reality can be seen 
If this is all true about #Brexit, what on earth is the British media doing? Why is it so uninformed? Where is the investigative journalism needed to inform the public? 
Again we get the nonsense that "The British People" - an entirely fictitious entity that thinks with one mind and speaks with one voice - "just wants to get on" with #Brexit.I'm sure some do but that's not the same thing as "The British People". #r4today

Voters in most vulnerable #Tory seats back fresh #Brexit Ref.So Mrs. May it's evident when you say the Ppl just want you to get on with this #BrexitShambles it appears your claim is groundless.Labour seats & Tory seats. MPs better offer a #PeoplesVote!
The left need to learn to accept defeat in elections or risk causing civil wars all across the world. You can't deny the result of a vote just because you don't like the outcome. And blaming Russia for #Brexit and #Trump just because it didn't workout the way they hoped is sick.
So according to this study....20% of leave voters would have voted differently if they had been fully aware of #brexit ramifications when it comes to their holiday costs.That is a big number of #remainernow to come from just one issue.#PeoplesVote?

Important point, a man of the cloth, @giles_fraser was asked "at what point does #brexit get so bad for the vulnerable that it's not worth it?"He dodged the question - so people, who may not have voted for this, or may want to change their mind, will just have to suffer

She's currently chuntering on about 'the British people overwhelmingly want us to get on with #Brexit' at the Lord Mayor's banquet. How delusional is she? I'm serious. US Presidents get health checks. I think these should be obligatory for our PMs. Something seriously wrong here
Theresa May says it's time to make the "right choices" not the "easy choices", as #Brexit talks enter the "endgame"

Labour led by a man who is anathema to its values and, on Brexit, its members, continues to agitate for GE rather than #EUref2. Corbyn &McDonnell know the fastest &most likely route to power is the most disastrous #Brexit possible & bringing down of gov.

Remoaners: #Brexit caused the biggest drop in the value of the £ everReality: Take a look at Oct 2007-Jan 2009, then compare to #brexit referendum in mid-2016.  Not even close to being an accurate claim, by comparison brexit looks like a blip 
Now Gordon Brown weighs in and says we need a #PeoplesVote. #Brexit is an undeliverable shitshow. It is too big, too complex, too damaging to comprehend. Only the few think otherwise, i.e. Mrs May @theresa_may, Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn and Mr Mogg @Jacob_Rees_Mogg.
Suppose @UKLabour get its wish for a #GeneralElection very soon. What would make you vote labour? Manifesto commitment to #PeoplesVote? A promise to renegotiate #brexit better than @Conservatives? @peoplesvote_uk What would make you vote labour? RT for a decent sample 
JUST LISTEN,MAN! The NE is @RemainerNow. This isn’t some crazy, liberal-elite obsession: it’s the simple reality that #brexit will make the UK go broke and then neither you nor anyone else will have the cash to help people.AAARGH!#Nissan @Remain_Labour @FFSake_ @OFOCBrexit
Jeremy, how will #Brexit make for more secure employment in the North East? Or help steel plants to prosper? It will be catastrophic for both, and will make @UKLabour's aspirations impossible to achieve.Listen to @Keir_Starmer and Labour's membership.We need a #PeoplesVote.
British Prime Minister Theresa May stares into #Brexit abyss as domestic opposition mounts 
In which case, @theresa_may must no longer want to be PM. So she should just step down, end this #Brexit farce and force a @Conservatives leadership election.

WATCH: @DrPhillipLeeMP says the #Brexit being delivered is not the #Brexit promised in 2016. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal 
Continued economic uncertainty is hardwired into Theresa May's #Brexit proposal. It has a transition to nowhere and a risk of “no deal” down the line. That's why business should back a #PeoplesVote.
Everyone ready for NO DEAL Brace yourselves UK. The world is about to NOT go into a meltdown.#Brexit crunch time is almost here.
This isn’t about replaying the 2016 referendum. We must find way to move forward, to unite the country.A bad deal #Brexit or no detail Brexit is no choice at all for MPs. People must decide their future via #PeoplesVote with option to remain.@peoplesvote_uk @WalesForEurope

Was there ever such an egregious case of false advertising as #Brexit? Touted as saviour of the #NHS in 2016 - now, on top of staffing and drug shortages, it emerges hospitals may not even be able to feed patients.We don't need to do this. #EndTheChaos
When, in the 2016 campaign, was there any discussion of the Army being needed to maintain order after #Brexit? This is such a drastic departure from our normal way of life; we must surely now accept the need to give the people a #FinalSay and #EndTheChaos!
"It seems @theresa_may has sold out the @duponline, she can't last much longer" says @UKIP's @davidkurten after leaks suggest that Irish Sea border plan could be part of final #Brexit deal.Do you want a border in the Irish Sea? 
Speaking from London after the north's four pro-Remain parties met with British opposition parties, Sinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O'Neill said the backstop is the bottom line and must be protected. #Brexit 
I'll say it again. The way the government is treating 5 million people must be regarded as crime. And we must make it clear that we will exert every effort to ensure the perpetrators are prosecuted and jailed. #PeoplesVote #brexit #StopBrexit
As the #Brexit deal is getting closer to being finalised expect: - More calls for a 2nd ref from people who didn't like #Brexit in the 1st place- A playing down of concessions in the deal - Project fear mark 5 to underpin a Second Referendum narrative It's all comms baby.
Hi from Paris! Join us this week on @hereandnow @NPR for our special #Brexit broadcasts from London Wednesday and Thursday. 
Without Jeremy Corbyn, Labour wouldn't even have those policies. They wouldn't have 650,000 members either. If Yvette Cooper was leader, Labour would still be advocating austerity. Funnily enough, she also supports Corbyn's stance on #Brexit, so your entire argument falls apart. 
WATCH: Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown shares why he thinks there will be a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. 
Labour’s Keir Starmer has a clever mechanism to give comfort to MPs who are scared to reject the miserable #Brexit deal Theresa May is concocting.
In #Brexit Britain... Muddled opinions hold the same weight as clear fact. We must respect the will of people seeking to harm us. Xenophobia is a legitimate concern about immigration. Internationalism is treason. Voting is anti-democratic.#BrexitLogic

Gordon Brown provides a healthy dose of realism in the #Brexit debate. He knows how negotiations work. Of course we need a #peoplesvote
Can anybody tell me who the woman was on #PoliticsLive who is happy to see troops on the streets/food shortages/lack of medicines/chaos at the ports, i mean did people really vote for that? She's another well off brexiter who won't be impacted by a no deal #Brexit

65% of voters now want a #FinalSay on #Brexit. Why we should be entitled to change our minds about cars, hairstyles, governments & relationships - but not the most important issue of our time, on which almost all signs now point one way - is anyone's guess
Hear, hear.. Nothing Pro-#Brexit MPs promised would happen, has happened.. The turmoil they've put this country in, is borderline criminal. 
Don’t trust us that the Single Market is not working for the U.K.? Then will you trust the Commission which states we benefit least out of all 28 countries? Remainers...you’ve been conned.#brexit #BrexitBetrayal
Thank you @Keir_Starmer I and other @Remain_Laboursupporters pushed you to be bolder in the famous conference compositing meeting. But since we democratically agreed on a policy, you have been steadfast in defending it. We can stop #Brexit
WATCH: Former PM Gordon Brown share why a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal is so important 
All three constituencies in Hull, which voted Leave in 2016, now favour a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit.There is no shame in revising your view as new evidence comes to light. In fact, in this case, it's the sensible thing to do.Let's do so and #EndTheChaos!
With a Johnson brother denouncing her deal from either wing of her party, and a revolt brewing in Cabinet, May’s #Brexit seems impossible.The most democratic solution is a #PeoplesVote now that we know what Brexit will actually entail.

The moment they announced the result of the EU Referendum in Britain false narratives claiming that people who voted for #Brexit were racists and haters and did not know what they were doing were injected into the public debate by agents of the EU operating in politics and media.

You can't "bring people together" by forcing 75% of the UK population who didn't vote for #Brexit to back a damaging Brexit deal that even the 25% who did, don't want! Uniting the country in misery is NOT leadershipStep up to the plate #Jezza & back a #peoplesvote!
I find this idea that #Corbyn opposes a #PeoplesVote as he ‘respects democracy’ absolutely hilarious 1) How can more democracy be undemocratic? 2) Using that logic, why did he support another GE in 2017 & why does he want another now? It’s a load of bollocks#Brexit #Labour
Just to clarify.Jeremy Corbyn said #Labour can’t stop #Brexit, he didn’t say Brexit couldn’t be stop. Labour have no parliamentary majority to do this. Typical misleading headlines / people not reading the article. Social media for ya. Actually read the damn article

I do not see how anyone could read this, and then have any moral objection to the need to call off #Brexit.  It is INSANE.  It is INSANE.

The list goes on and on of the damage being done to our country. #brexit is taking it apart. Well worth a read of this thread, extremely well researched, the reality of the #brexodus. There are those that will have no idea at all of the storm that's rolling in. Let's avoid it.

When this #Brexit thing finally either blows over or destroys the country, theres a lot of politicians who are going to look really silly...
Of course #Brexit can be stopped - if politicians want to stop, or pause, or reconsider it is up to them - at Westminster (in the UK’s hands). You are LEGISLATORS. laws change. Nothing is inevitable,. What is “profoundly undemocratic” is to suggest otherwise. #BrexitShambles

Global mkts have started the week on a pos note w/China trading higher, shrugging off leads from weak US session on Fri. #Oil jumps after OPEC inches closer to supply cuts. Pound slides below 1.29 as #Brexit turmoil deepens. With it being Veterans Day in US, US bond mkt is closed 
Early start - on the way to Brussels for EU General Affairs Council + meeting with @MichelBarnier who continues to have our full support - negotiating teams have been working hard, let’s hope we can find a breakthrough on #Brexit this week....
I am going to say this until I am blue in the face.You don't get people to come together by ignoring them.You don't win over people by saying you don't acknowledge they can change their minds.You don't win people over by saying your #Brexit is better than the Tory #Brexit

This lad had two years in a key cabinet position to resolve #brexit & never bothered, hollow commentary is all he offers 
To every Brexiter who has levied the accusation 'Project Fear' at Remainers for the past 2 years, I commend to you the facts of the damage of #Brexit to date.*Read the entire thread*

Ms.Thornberry has repeatedly said she wants "All the benefits of EU membership whilst respecting the will of the people"A literal embodiment of cake-and-eat-it@UKLabour must accept the illegally won #Brexit vote is undemocratic & the #Brexit fantasy undeliverable#PeoplesVote
1) "We can't stop #Brexit, leave voters will feel betrayed"This is the final desperate battle cry of some leavers & indeed some former Remainers, even raising threats of violence and the rise of the far rightReality is #Brexit, any Brexit, will be seen as a far larger betrayal
"The issue now has to be how we bring people together."Well it won't be behind you Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn. You have as much chance of that as me being Pope.You have betrayed your party, your members and your country. I will never get behind you or your #Brexit 
The EU is not merely an economic union.The EU is what makes the WAR in Europe unthinkable...#Trump #Brexit 
I am fucking SICK of being called UNDEMOCRATIC for opposing something which we all KNOW will, and in fact already IS, causing HARM to the UK in many ways. #Brexit is NOT good for us. I am RIGHT to oppose it. Fuck you and fuck your #Brexit. #StopBrexitSaveBritain #PeoplesVote
Pound starts lower to the week as odds of a #Brexit deal this week look to be fading and Speculators keep increasing their bearish bets. 
"What happens if MPs vote down the deal in Parliament?"1) @theresa_may resigns2) government has to request extension to Article 503) #Tory leadership competitionThen...4) #PeoplesVoteWRITE TO YOUR MP!TELL THEM TO REJECT THE FINAL #BREXIT DEAL!

"My brother is right #brexit deal is the biggest statecraft failure since Suez. We have already agreed to pay £40bn for nothing. And yet even if the Cabinet mutinies – as they ought – it will make little difference," writes @BorisJohnson
Dear @UKLabour a number of your MPs have labeled the desire for a clean, factual & fair campaign on #Brexit via a #PeoplesVote as Undemocratic.I will democratically remember that the rest of my voting life.RT if you agree.
Unbelievable....how did a great country allow itself to be abused by a low-rent character such as this?  #Brexit Russians Offered Business Deals to Brexit’s Biggest Backer 
John Redwood: Some port statistics for Mr RaabIn 2017 UK ports handled 482 million tonnes of cargo.Dover accounted for just 5.4% of this.Dover Calais should work fine,But plenty of other options if French don’t want to keep the business!#Brexit #EU

Yeah Emmanuel, that shit is SOOOO 2008.#ArmisticeDay100#Brexit"Macron condemns nationalism in speech for Armistice Day"  
This is such a picture of hope.Just think how far #europe has come in a hundred years. The peace we have enjoyed for so long should not be taken for granted. Must admit I find #brexit a dangerous self interested step away from peace to a more divided continent. 
Nothing to panic about folk. The #Tories have #Brexit under control.  
I actually think the chap is unhinged if he can't see that #Brexit has split the country, split families, split friends and split neighbours. You heal the rift by cancelling the whole shambles and let the nation get back to the pre-referendum United Kingdom. 
It is anti-democratic to deny the people a vote on something no-one knew in 2016 & very different from all the Leave campaign promises. And it is anti-democratic to drive through a massive consitutional change against the will of the majority. #c4news #PeoplesVote #Brexit
Tories are gearing up for a Remain leadership. #brexit has failed.

Whatever your views on the rights or wrongs of #Brexit one thing cannot be deniedThe Labour party wants a #PeoplesVote 150 CLPs engaged in a heroic effort to make it party policyIt got a standing ovation at conferenceAll that means less than nothing to Corbyn
#Brexit is not a glorious liberation from the EU, it is a shambolic retreat from Europe by a confused, divided & deceived country led towards disaster by a rabble of liars, cheats, crooks & cowards.Let's take back control #PeoplesVote.#StopBrexit
#brexit #pollupdateMay's in a mess. What would you prefer?Retweet
There's no long game, there's no cunning plan, Corbyn is either a committed Brexiter, or he believes a damaging #Brexit necessary so he can achieve his utopian nirvana. Either way he won't push for the much needed #PeoplesVote #FinalSay with option to #Remain & #ExitFromBrexit
Make no mistake about it, everything #corbyn has done since he took leadership has given oxygen to #brexit 
IF we had an effective opposition, #Brexit would be dead and buried. The PM would've been challenged every inch of the way, and Tory rebels would've had the balls to stamp out the ERG. The bigger betrayal and failure in duty is by #Labour and @jeremycorbyn#PeoplesVoteNow

My position too. I would love to have a @UKLabour government which works to make the UK a fairer , more equal society - but leaving the right-wing coup/ shit-show that is #Brexit unchallenged is unforgivable
Hi Gloria - have you seen the @peoplesvote_uk poll of Ashfield? It finds that 68% of Labour voters in your constituency now support a #PeoplesVote.It will be your local voters who will be angry if you back #Brexit in parliament.There is still time for you to stand up for them.

EXCLUSIVE.My interview with @Jacob_Rees_Mogg for the @smh and @theage - he warns of an 'accidental' change in  prime ministership, No Deal #Brexit now 'most likely' and @BorisJohnson the reason Leave won.
Apparently the BBC thinks the leader of the British government should be somewhere other than the U.K. on #RemembranceDay. This constant shaming of anyone who prioritises their own country over all others has gotten truly tedious. #Brexit can’t come soon enough. #Armistice100 
Only Brexit will do. The political and economic certainty of EU membership just means more of the same; slow inexorable decline, a hollowing out of politics and the collapse of meaningful democracy. Brexit is the last chance to arrest the decay. #Brexit 
@sirharryevans “What's been forgotten, is how the war started ...nationalist fervour overwhelmed the whole of Europe.” #Brexit “Britain has always been conflicted in its patriotic nationalism and its desire, bred of an extinct empire, to be a world leader.“
FYI, yet another #Brexit injustice which Corbyn *should* be able to attack the government on but can't because:1) doing so would undermine Brexit2) responding effectively involves being, well, politically effective2) it happened after 1983 and so is outside of his awareness

Some may find this offensive, but it is a fact, and should not be ignored.The #EU is the greatest and most successful Peace Process in human history. After centuries of war in Europe, It has maintained peace between its countries for seventy years.#Brexit is a moral crime.

“There is no good Brexit” The Observer is right. Time for @peoplesvote_uk on #Brexit | Observer editorial 
I think that many leavers were hoodwinked by the Tories into believing that their poverty was caused by the EU. I think it’s fair to say that many of those calling for a ‘peoplesvote’ were also hoodwinked by the Tories, into believing Lbr can stop #brexit. See the connection?
Observer editorials on #Brexit are always worth reading: “Britain has been outmanoeuvred & out-negotiated ... The reality is that Britain’s position was incoherent from the start – simultaneously wanting the benefits of EU membership even while leaving.” 
Phillip, You were elected on a Manifesto that promised to deliver #Brexit.You have reneged on that pledge.You think you know better than the 17.4m who voted to #LEAVE.How arrogant is that?You should take time to reflect on what you have done.
Unpopular view in my echo chamber time:I'm optimistic Corbyn and his chums will eventually do the right thing on #Brexit. I don't think they'll have much choice. Ultimately they want to protect jobs.I'm pessimistic, however, of a Corbyn Labour's chances of beating the Tories.

Calling it the "Irish border" is a sneaky way of putting the responsibility for the border on to us Irish - Andrew Maxwell Nail. On. Head #raydarcyshow #brexit
As a law student and amateur pianist, I believe that @DrPhillipLeeMP has a record of contempt for democracy and belief in rule by an enlightened elite (of which he is obviously a member), and that anything he says about #Brexit can be safely disregarded: 
"@theresa_may has been plunged into a deeper crisis after Brussels rejected her key #Brexit proposal which was intended to avoid the UK being trapped in the Customs Union"2 years to bring us to this point. How much time have we wasted?Somebody #StandUp4Brexit & sort this mess

Poor @jeremycorbyn, remarkably gains control of @UKLabour party, and then #Brexit comes along and shows him up to be utterly hopeless and self serving
Labour Remainers, it doesn't matter what else happens, so long as Corbyn and Labour MPs are sure they can take your support for granted, all our efforts will be in vain and #Brexit will happen.#PeoplesVote#StopBrexit
I agree with you about helping the UK and its people. I'm a lifelong @UKLabour supporter but there's no version of #brexit that'll make life better for the country. The country is turning against it. Corbyn should too.

Is #JeremyCorbyn correct in saying #Brexit cannot be stopped?Please RT Poll after you vote for a larger sample.
The Tories are imploding over #Brexit and this clown wants Labour to give Theresa May a get out of jail free card. 
No, Jeremy Corbyn, I agree with you on alot, but not this.#brexit can be stopped. Should be stopped and, if we are reasonable, will be stopped.There was no mandate. The vote was misled. Polls suggest majority are too remain. Your party wants to remain.Time to rethink.
Spoof billboards celebrating Putin's "contribution" to #Brexit pop up around London

Corbyn criticises the EU for neoliberal economic policies but wants #Brexit which would create immense pressures for the UK to move towards an ultra-free market economy. That's why the ERG so want #Brexit. They are right, Corbyn is hopelessly wrong.#PeoplesVote
.@AaronBastani if @jeremycorbyn does nothing to stop #Brexit he’ll certainly define the electorate for the next 20 years by making them poorer. 
The Titanic hit the iceberg and sank with huge loss of life because the ship was not provisioned with radar or enough life rafts. I know, there was no radar.The difference with #Brexit is we know it's going to sink us but we don't have enough life rafts.
Who said there's no #Brexit bonus?There is if you're a disaster capitalist eagerly awaiting a recession so that you can asset-strip the UK economy.#PeoplesVote
I do not Remoan.. I've given up nearly 4 years of my own time with 1000s others w/o pay to prevent the break up of the UK & to ensure the Ppl get the #FinalSayForAll & a #PeoplesVote before any #Brexit is allowed to stand.Been called Snowflake, Remoaner, Traitor & Evil..enough!

#LeaveLies have wholly subverted #Brexit as a democratic process. When we depart from representative democracy and treat a referendum as mandatory it becomes absolutely critical that voters are properly informed about the issues. They were not. #PeoplesVote
Hey @AlecShelbrooke you are laughing at the 56.8% of your constituents who voted Leave. I hope they remember that & vote you out. Anyone with so much contempt for democracy should not be an MP. #Brexit #MayMustGoNow

Were it not for the support of the DUP and Jeremy Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, Mrs May @theresa_may and her frightful bunch of despots and charlatans would be out of office and @UKLabour could have been getting on with addressing the causes of #Brexit. 
For those who call on @sinnfeinireland to break their mandate and take seats in Westminster to stop #brexit. Can we now put that nonsense to bed. 
This is the tack @UKIP need to take. If you voted #brexit, there is only one Brexit party. You have to vote UKIP or you're voting for a worse deal than staying in.

Update: exactly as I reported in September, now confirmed by @SkyNews. Ministers prepared for No Deal #Brexit since this summer. 
Although he is not saying so, I’m sure @JoJohnsonUK recognises that the real problem is neither  @theresa_may nor her proposed messy withdrawal deal, but the fact that there is simply no good version of #Brexit for the UK.
This is a must read for anyone wanting to understand the continued shambles of the @Conservatives approach to negotiating a coherent #Brexit that doesn’t burn the whole place down. Not for the first time, @rtenews puts @BBCNews to shame with the quality of its analysis.
Here’s the Rees-Mogg trade case for #Brexit. We should leave the world’s deepest, most advanced free trade area with by far our biggest market because WTO rules are good enough & it stops us pursuing much weaker agreements with smaller markets where WTO rules are not good enough.
Brexit was never about taking control. It was always about a right wing coup installing an authoritarian government to turn the UK into a tax haven and tear up human and employment rights.#Brexit is unpatriotic.
Jeremy has been an awful disappointment, the biggest open goal in history and he decides he doesn’t play football! Nothing worse than a missed opportunity.  Looks like I’ll be back at work soon! #brexit #Peoplesvote #wakeupjeremy

Tanja, I’m sorry you have to endure such ignorance & xenophobic hostility. I am truly ashamed of the words & deeds of a significant % of the public. #Brexit released our ugly side & it needs to be reigned in, but we fool ourselves if we see it as s/t new, it was always there.
"It's a travesty of the referendum result." @JoJohnsonUK says it's "wholly unacceptable" that MPs are expected to choose between @theresa_may's "deeply flawed" #Brexit deal or the "chaos" of 'no-deal'.He's resigned over Brexit plans, read more here:

"Government policy is always government policy until it isn't" - #JoJohnson.He's right, we have everything to play for, including stopping #Brexit.
Listening to Jo Johnson on #r4today - it occurred to me that he was making the most cohesive,  compelling and conclusive case for ditching #Brexit ever !!Although I'm NOT sure that was his intention !#UnintendedConsequences
Time is running out on #Brexit - realistically we have the choice between BRINO bad deal and no deal. No deal clearly preferable. Keep Project Fear 2.0 in perspective. Clearly now being ramped up to stop #Brexit
How about adding that we should let the public decide if they want to stop this #Brexit disaster? Future generations won’t thank you for staying silent #PeoplesVoteNow
Well, well ⁦@ScotTories⁩ can’t say they weren’t warned, repeatedly, that their Westminster masters would sell out on promises made to #fishing communities as part of #Brexit deal. What are they going to do about it I wonder? #FBPE
Corbyn: ‘We can't stop it (#Brexit). The referendum took place. Article 50 has been triggered’. Nonsense. Just admit you don’t WANT to stop it!You HAVE stopped listening to Labour voters though, which means it’s over... for both of us!I really tried with you. No longer.
I'm not sure the Leave Campaign has correctly understood my tweet above so to clarify. #BREXIT WILL BE FATAL FOR SOME ELDERLY PEOPLE. IT WILL BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR DEATH. THE CAUSE... OF THEIR DEATH.
So why did your Shadow Transport Team ABSTAIN this week when Transport Ministers pushed through lorry licences lottery limiting our 40,000 trucks to just 4000 permits? I was only one on committee voting against! Time for Labour to do more than abstain on #Brexit #PeoplesVoteNow
May’s #Brexit deal hits iceberg: The EU27 have rejected Britain’s proposed model for independent arbitration of a temporary customs partnership with the bloc, senior Whitehall sources have revealed. 
#brexit Don’t let all the people died in 2 World Wars die for nothing. We don’t want to be controlled by Brussels or the Germans who run it.17.4 million voted leave  the EU. All MPs fighting with each other all Parties get on with it FFS. 
What has been truly revealing in the #Brexit negotiations is that our politicians have taken us so far into the EU it is proving extraordinarily difficult to leave - all without direct democratic consent.
Meet Professor Mariana Mazzucato. She is a famed economist, a member of Corby’s Econ Advisory Comm, author, has lived in the UK for 20 yrs, had 4 children here, and just had her application for permanent residency rejected.Welcome to post #Brexit Hell.
The original tweet asked why Corbyn is silent on the criminality around the referendum. Trying to spin it as Tory #Brexit doesn't get Corbyn off the hook: silence is complicity.

Whatever side you are on, @JoJohnsonUK’s resignation is another reminder #Brexit as campaigned for was nothing more than a fantasy that hasn’t survived contact with reality. There is no wondrous option available - just bad, worse and disastrous.
Jo Johnson reminds us of Orwell's dictum: "In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act."That's all Johnson has done. But it is devastating.A complete game-changer.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #r4today
If May is ruling out a referendum and Chequers seems dead in the water the future #Brexit choices seem to be these. Which would you prefer? (Please RT)
Can someone clarify to me what the  #Labour position is regarding #Brexit? If it's "we put our hands in the air, shrug and say there's nothing we can do", then fine. But if it's anything else why is Jeremy Corbyn still Leader? 
Wake up .@UKLabour #Corbyn is help in the Right Wing Tories on #Brexit You WILL carry the can too!Glad to be #LibDemsNow
Funny old world isn't it, where Arron Banks is more of a #Remainer than Jeremy Corbyn @jeremycorbyn?We CAN stop #Brexit Mr Corbyn, but you have made it abundantly clear that you don't want to.You are the reason I cannot vote @UKLabour.Labour, #EarnMyVote you know what to do
No, I’m proud I voted for #Brexit, campaigned for Brexit & would do so again. Only I’d work even harder & spend more of my money on the campaign. Everything that has happened since confirms my view that the #EU are obnoxious totalitarian bullies that we are right to divorce.
Important for Conservative MPs to appreciate that accepting PMs #Brexit Wdrawal agreement is the beginning of more years of arguing over our final deal because despite the promises it hasn’t been delivered. 
Analysis of the 130k mob who attended the recent People's Vote March in London is very telling. There were high numbers of:> EU nationals> students> immigrants> middle class champagne socialists> under 12's> dogs> the ill informed and EU brainwashed#brexit #FBPE
Worth reading Jo Johnson’s argument in full.  UK faces a Suez moment.  After all the bluster and ignorance, a clear cut argument from my old @FT colleague #Brexit 
Just imagine your fellow British European Citizens fighting #Brexit win so the U.K. stays with a renewed sense of EU identity - that would be a stronger & more vibrant EU - don’t forsake us @donaldtusk @MichelBarnier @guyverhofstadt #PeoplesVote
Our Labour family is united in its opposition to Tory #Brexit. Our MPs must vote against May's deal and a popular vote must be held if this doesn't lead to a General Election!  
Meanwhile in other news, UK government bickers endlessly on about #Brexit, and contorts policy and reason to favour shale gas production, while the world literally starts to burn. 
It was never about £350m for the NHS. The real Brexit dividend is worth substantially more. #Brexit 
#Brexit is about a lying, cheating gang of rich bastards exploiting the fears and prejudices of ordinary people order to slash their tax bills and tear up the health, safety, environmental and workplace regulations which eat into their profits. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Remember when they said the EU would fall apart over #brexit? They meant the UK.

Tell me again how Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn is a #Remainer? Remind me again how he is playing a 'long game'?Jeremy wants #Brexit as much as Mogg does, his actions speak louder than your defence of him. He is an accomplice to the Tory #Brexit.

Today, Jo Johnson became the latest Cabinet member to resign over #Brexit. He joins a growing number of Tory MPs who see a 2nd referendum as preferable to Theresa May's #Brexit fudge, And yet some people still refuse to accept that Jeremy Corbyn's played an absolute blinder.
So much for Jeremy Corbyn losing the youth vote over #Brexit. Looks like today's youth value a socialist Labour government above membership of a neoliberal club. As they should. 
I can’t help wondering if #brexit is actually a #Johnson family dinner argument that’s got out of hand?
Well said @ajcdeane ... Deciding to resign at this time when the PM is in the Somme laying wreaths to honour this country's war dead is just crass #JoJohnson #Brexit 
This is a choiceCorbyn could have said "#Brexit is a mess" or "the Government is a shambles"Instead he avoids the Q "would you stop #Brexit?" by answering "well no one can!"But his party's policy is to (eventually)   have a #PeoplesVote to do exactly thatStop defending him
The resignation of Jo Johnson is nailed by @ajcdeane for the "crass" #Brexit political posturing stunt that it is. No holds barred tonight.#SkyPapers 1/2
I will never forgive @UKLabour for #Brexit. It is not the party I thought it was. Who would ever have thought @jeremycorbyn would be so stupidly self-destructive, bringing society down with him? You expect this from Tories. #peoplesvote
Corbyn says #Brexit 'can't be stopped' amid calls for #PeoplesVote.Of course it can. He's the major obstacle now in denying the Democratic right to a #FinalSay & needs 2B forced to follow the maj will of his Party voters & as is now clear the Ppl.#Remain
Democracy doesn't just mean the right to vote. It equally means the right to oppose, the right to be informed & the rule of law. And that is why a #PeoplesVote is indispensable for the health of our democracy. #Brexit #FBPE
Mr Jeremy Corbyn @jeremycorbyn says 'we can't stop #Brexit'. Not exactly the words of a leader of the opposition who doesn't want #Brexit, more the words of an accomplice who does.
I want to extend a cwtch to everyone.We need to be a strong Britain.#brexit bluff has now been exposed, let’s just cancel Brexit and get back to normal. Please.
#brexit pitiful of EU to block Britain being European country of culture in 2023. Childish & petty  & another good reason 2 leave
Let's be clear, #brexit will be fatal for some elderly. Bills will go up, the cost of living will go up, meds will go up or not be there. They will freeze to death or starve. Welfare will go, pensions will go. People need to realize what the fuck #brexit is really all about.

Yes, the far right are a threat around the world, but they're here in Britain in the guise of May, ERC, DUP, Ukip, Britain First, For Britain, National Action and a host of others. The far right are already here but neither the govt nor Labour are doing anything about it. #Brexit
One final observation about tonight’s #brexit Coreper readouts...The closer the sources are to ‘the tunnel’, the gloomier their outlook.
Rational moderate #Remain MPs in Labour must be at their wits end!As #Brexit can be stopped, there's only 2 possibilities. Corbyn is incapable of understanding; or deliberately misleading. Only option left for those MPs seems to be to leave Labour & reduce it to a cultist rump. 
The major U.S. investment banks are planning to shift $283 billion of assets to Frankfurt because of #Brexit.Not so much a trickle as a tidal wave of departures.When will the madness end? via @markets

If it is @jeremycorbyn's view that #Brexit can't be stopped, why has his Brexit secretary spoken of a referendum with an option to remain? At conference, why didn't he interrupt that standing ovation to tell everyone that, sadly, what they were applauding was now impossible?
It seems increasingly possible that the British may get a chance to rethink #Brexit and vote again in a referendum. That'd be sensible. #understatement
It gets better. £745m Aberdeen Bypass contract price includes “maintenance for 30 years”.  Do not approve of #Brexit , but if must, can we get the ⁦@transcotland⁩ negotiating team on the #Brexit case.

Imagine Boris Johnson's younger brother speaking more sense on #Brexit than the Leader of the Labour Party. What a travesty, what a grotesque farce.
Britain’s #brexit stance: we want frictionless trade that isn’t frictionless, a backstop that isn’t a backstop, a border without a border and  a concept of a sovereignty that hasn’t existed since the 19th century - is that so much to ask??
We have got to hit the streets to bring @theresa_may down - her wimp MP’s do nothing so we 17.4m #leave voters must act.Let’s have an #HonourOurVote protest march with speakers.Every UK city, town and village must march against May’s #Brexit betrayal and constitutional treason!

It should really be abundantly clear now to unionists after the #TheresaMay #Brexit letter leak that that British establishment doesn’t care about them or any part of Ireland. But we do. Time to #think32.
Jeremy Corbyn's #Brexit. Labour members oppose Brexit as do Momentum members. But the old style left-wingers Corbyn & McDonnell arent interested in listening to members. They are willing helpers of an uber-right-wing project. 
Arlene Foster @DUPleader and the DUP must hold the world championship for political stupidity. fanatical unionists who backed #Brexit as a result of which we are now talking about a defacto United Ireland which would  absolutely not be on the cards if we remained  in the EU
How ironic! He believes politics has left young people behind, then ignores their voice on #brexit
Have the scales fallen from the Corbynista's eyes yet ? He is not the messiah , he's an elderly Marxist-Socialist who hasn't changed his mind on anything in 30+ years. Including that the #EU is a capitalist conspiracy . #brexit delivered by @jeremycorbyn .

"If we get to a position where this referendum from 2 years ago is overturned, and there is no #Brexit, then we will have Donald Trump Be careful of what you hope for over here."Be careful of trying to unwind that referendum. Because 17.4m people will be very annoyed." 
#Brexit  has shown itself to have turned into the mother of all messes It seems to be getting worse Day-by-Day!What do you think will resolve the above issue?
Jo Johnson calls for public to have another #Brexit vote as he quits government, saying the deal being worked on now is "radically different" from what was talked about in 2016
"To present the nation with a choice between two deeply unattractive outcomes, vassalage and chaos, is a failure of British statecraft on a scale unseen since the Suez crisis” nothing more for me to add #Brexit

More and more people are coming to the right #Brexit conclusion which has long been argued by our @TSSAunion: it will either lead to damaging chaos or vassalage - time to stay put!
Huge respect for @JoJohnsonUK . It’s tough resigning from a Ministerial post, he’s done the right thing. Now is the time for people to stand up for what they believe in or we will sleepwalk to a #Brexit disaster. There is another way – it’s a @peoplesvote_uk

Stop trying to upstage your brother you ghastly opportunist. For once, it's not about you. You never could articulate what #Brexit was in any form. And you even signed-up to Chequers when you could have resigned on principle (but you had no alt plan). Back under your stone, Boris

#bbcqt The key point is that #Brexit is turning out to be very different from what was promised. No wonder public opinion is swinging against it. If a democracy cannot change its mind it ceases to be a democracy. Let people confirm or reject Brexit when they see the actual deal.
.@DAaronovitch on #Brexit: "Let's just not do it!" Biggest cheer of the evening from this #bbcqt audience. @KwasiKwarteng is clearly wrong to claim people are"bored" by Brexit. They know that it will have a dire impact on jobs, social cohesion & peace in Northern Ireland.
Dominic Raab the Dunce is given a 100 lines "BRITAIN IS AN ISLAND REALLY NEAR EUROPE" to teach him geography @DominicRaab #brexit 
As expected all year long Theresa May has told Arlene Foster the DUP will be thrown overboard in final #Brexit treaty. #tomorrowspaperstoday #r4today
Dear British Govt: if you weren't stockpiling food & meds, buying big shipping containers & giant fridges, converting motorways into lorry parks, and recruiting public-disorder kapos for #Brexit, wot would you be spending our money on?
Former UK civil service chief backs a People's Vote to stop #Brexit 'catastrophe' 
BIG SCOOP by ⁦@SamCoatesTimes⁩. He’s got a letter that Theresa May sent to Arlene Foster.  A Brussels plan to put a customs border in the Irish Sea if there is no #Brexit agreement will be included in a divorce deal, a leaked letter suggests.

UK Media: "Irish PM, Leo Varadkar, said..."That's all I needed, I stopped listening to him a while back, when he threatened Northern Ireland with terrorism.He no longer gets a say in #Brexit, he can push his own cart.
Yes @DavidDavisMP #Brexit is like buying a house. Sometimes after a long house search we decide that it's better not to move at all. But you want to deny us the chance to make that decision. Hardly democratic are you David!#PeoplesVote #FBPE
#Brexit has not yet happened but already people are losing their jobs, being ejected from the country they have chosen to call their home, & now people genuinely fear for their lives if their medical supplies are disrupted. Do you support this?
The Tommy Robinson of #Brexit admits he’s never been a real journalist, admits he was - as I described him - a failed showbiz hack and a useless reporter. Why would anyone listen to his lies and unfashionably stupid conjecture on the #EU - ah yes. Money

By lying and cheating the #Brexit elite have got their prize, and they have no intention of letting democracy relieve them of their ill-gotten gains. Should these thieves be allowed to enjoy the proceeds of their crimes?Of course not! #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Where is the #NoDeal Party to put the uncompromising case for respecting the vote to Leave? Is anybody in British political life prepared to seize the moment and stand up for the 17.4million?Mick Hume on #Brexit in crisis
May's #BrExit "deal" will be crap for the UK - she has deliberately sabotaged the negotiations from the very beginning.She now plans to sell it with a massive PR campaign of propaganda crap.How do you know when Theresa May is lying?Her lips are moving
SNEAKY PM MAY signed the UK up to Macron's EI2 Army in June. not publicised to avoid alarming Brexiteers keen to stay out of European defence unions post-Brexit.  THE WOMAN IS A MENACE!@borisjohnson #borisjohnson #boris johnson  #Brexit 
SNP MP Joanna Cherry QC said “It's absolutely vital for MPs that they get the answer to this question. The UK Govt want people to think the only choice is deal or no deal, but there’s the possibility of a third choice - to reverse the madness of #Brexit." 
One way or another a British prime minister will sign the NI backstop. Either it will be May as part of a negotiated exit deal or by someone else after we crash out when the EU is calling all the shots and demanding all its own terms. #Brexit
Tony Blair doesn't understand democracy..."I am 100% opposed to #Brexit. Up to the very end I am going to do everything I can do to stop it." 
Tories just won’t face up to any of the disastrous , damaging consequences of their policies, be they on welfare or on #Brexit ( or anything else) . They constantly pretend that such hurt and distress isn’t happening. We need to confront them with harsh reality again & again. 
#Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab & his comments on Dover-Calais. From Steve Bell.

Pretty sure this is some form of #brexit metaphor... 
It Took Six Months To Split Czechoslovakia. Why Should Brexit Take Six Years? A: Because Theresa May, the EU & the Globalists want to make #BrExit as difficult as possible to discourage the break up of the totally corrupt & anti democracy EU
Why Ant and Dec should be negotiating #Brexit (from tonight's @howardhour at 10pm on @SkyOne)
7) in fact we could go on, through the various "access to the single market is the same as membership" nonsense, the "they need us more than we need them" fantasies and the general naivety (or dishonesty) of the #Brexit leaders
6) David Davis MP, leading light in the conservative Brexit movement"Mr Davis, you used to be a minister for Europe.  You're a long standing #Brexit supporter.  Why were you promoting impossible bi-lateral deals after the ref.  Why didn't you know this was illegal?" 
5) one for Boris Johnson "Mr Johnson you published this utopian vision the day after the #Brexit result.  How on earth do you reconcile your "hard Brexit/f**k business" current position with this naive 'cake & eat it' fantasy?"

In 6 months we can have a #PeoplesVote, stop #Brexit, put the economy back on course, and leave the Tories shattered and torn apart by bitter mutual recriminations. We can do all of this, but only if Corbyn wants it to happen. #StopBrexit

Jacob Rees-Mogg - "What I’m saying is that people like me are sticking to the Conservative Party manifesto."If there’s an extension to customs union I’ll vote against it because it denies what the PM herself has promised. And I expect the PM to deliver on her promises." #Brexit 
Ok, one last time Father Dominic, The south of England is NEAR to the EU.. but the rest of the UK is FAR AWAY #DominicRaab #Brexit #EU

This Cornish lady voted leave but she now considers #brexit is a "cock up" and she is a #RemainerNow.Respect to her for reassessing in light of new facts. More and more people are coming to the same conclusion all the time. It's why we need a #PeoplesVote with #OptionToRemain.
Tony Blair - You either have a pointless #brexit or you have a painful #brexit & neither is a good idea.. my view is very simple.. before we go down the path of pointless or painful we should ask the British people again if they really want to proceed. #FBPE #CNBC #PeoplesVote
The British elites sleepwalking their country (and Ireland) into mayhem have just realised that they are "really reliant" on importing food and pharmaceuticals. I suppose an expensive private education doesn't buy common sense. #Brexit

The reality, as spelled out by the OBR, is that #Brexit uncertainty is already weakening public finances by £15 billion annually. No matter the Brexit, any Brexit will be a disaster. #ExitFromBrexit

Momentum, Labour members & now the majority of country want a #PeoplesVote The "but northern Labour seats" argument no longer holds waterLabour voters are going to have to reconcile that Corbyn & leadership are on same side as Tories in keeping #Brexit alive & always have been 
Opinion: Given his complete silence about the growing evidence of foreign intervention in #Brexit I am now beginning to think that Corbyn (or at least his closest aides) are in danger of leading the British people into further penury, isolation and subjugation
Absolutely. #Brexit has revealed the very worst about @BBCNews reporting & the journalists who fail to challenge lying politicians either because... a) journalists don't know their factsb) journalists aren't very goodc) they're passively ignoring the lies#PeoplesVote
Here we go again. The IRA had a whole room devoted to #Brexit propaganda. But you could start with the work last year of @J_amesp on  Oh and the Russian Embassy and RT work with Banks and Wiggy
Just to be clear. Gerrymandering means fixing the 'boundaries' of an electorate to game a result.  We know that the boundaries of dark money and data were completely broken in #Brexit
I'd love to see the faces of Eddie Marsan, Jolyon Maugham and AC Grayling if Theresa May's #Brexit fudge is opposed by Jeremy Corbyn and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but passes through parliament thanks to "moderates" like Lisa Nandy. There'd be something poetic about that. 
Northern Ireland Unionists (the majority) didn't survive 30yrs of mass murder to stay in UK, to simply hand that away because Ireland cannot deal with the utter nonsense spouting from their EU-puppet PM.Anyone suggesting UI is a realistic possibility over #Brexit is a lunatic.
It takes no heart to talk the talk. The ability to translate one’s words into action is what separates those who lead from those who follow.  Which will you be, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg? #Brexit

This has now gone too far. #Brexit is utter madness.The Government is behaving completely irrationally.The UK has taken leave of its senses. 
Wetherspoons shares slide 'as chairman concentrates on championing #Brexit'.Tragic.
The reason for holding a #PeoplesVote has nothing to do with how people voted in 2016. It is about having a say on the type of #Brexit the government plans. After years of division it finally gives both Leavers and Remainers something to unite behind. 
If it happens, #Brexit will hit young people the hardest. Tonight @OFOCBrexit volunteers ran a very successful event for young people living in Cambridgeshire, where we wrote to our MPs asking them to back a #PeoplesVote. Hear what they had to say! #OFOC #FBPE #yourchoicemyfuture

Appalled at how casually ppl throw about accusations/insinuations of treason in respect of #Brexit compromises. Have a word with yourselves and get some bloody perspective, not least so close to Armistice Day. You don't have to agree with them. But have some respect for the word
Pathetic, divisive comments. @CharlieFlanagan states a fact. SF using #Brexit to push for a UI isn't just opportunistic, but fails to protect NI or Ireland from #brexit.And using "unionist" as an insult says it all . UK, Ireland & NI need a deal that works for us all.

The Scottish Parliament has just backed a #PeoplesVote by voting convincingly in favour of a @scotlibdems amendment to a government motion on #Brexit. Particular thanks to @scottishlabour rebels who defied their whip to abstain and voted with us. #Remain #EU #ExitfromBrexit
The Scottish Parliament is the first in the UK to back a #PeoplesVote. It won't be the last. This will only get bigger. Every day, more and more people are coming to the conclusion that the public should have their say on the final #Brexit deal.
So the #SNP has publicly committed to support a second vote on #Brexit on the grounds that people should have a second opinion on it. Completely undermining their argument that a referendum is the decisive way to settle major constitutional questions. Go figure.
The current mess is not what Leave voters voted for and there is real anxiety about what the future holds for people in @Anna_Soubry's constituency. A good reason to let the people vote on the #Brexit deal once we finally find out what it is.#PeoplesVote
Conflating Brexit with Irish unity is unhelpful & misguided. #brexit

What the chuffing nora is a 'blind' #Brexit? Enough with all this obfusbollocks. Brexit means Brexit means fuck business, bad for the country, bad for everyone except the Brexeratti. Oppose Brexit because it's not in the best interests of the many, only the few. No more jobs lost

I remind you that #Brexit was sold on the back of a deal with "the exact same benefits as now". YOU DO NOT HAVE A MANDATE FOR NO DEAL. No responsible govt would put its country through #NoDealBrexit. If there's no deal, then you MUST come back to the people or #StopBrexit.
Will put your tweet on my website, can continually RT it there as well.  We were lied to by Edward Heath over EU.  Then John Major over Maastricht Treaty.  NOW @THERESA_MAY FOLLOWS THE SHAMEFUL TRADITION OF EU LIARS. @borisjohnson #borisjohnson #boris johnson  #Brexit
Labour will abolish tuition fees. Great! Students won't have to pay to attend universities that have lost their funding, their specialists and their ability to collaborate with other academic bodies in Europe - all because of #Brexit. Labour MUST support a #PeoplesVote too.
The fundamental facts around the Irish border haven’t changed since 2016. Was, is, and will continue to be the #Brexit deal sticking point.(ps: *Intransigence) 
Come and take part in what promises to be a lively discussion, as Dominic Grieve, MP and Lord Andrew Adonis address #Brexit in the Elmwood Hall this Friday morning! All welcome, but please register at: 
The findings of Dr Hübner’s report have outlined that Irish reunification would lead to a massive €23.5 billion increase in GDP across the island by 2025. #Brexit #UnityRef
Corrupt officials in Eastern Europe are engaged in EU citizenship scams on a large scale, despite the implications for security and welfare handouts.  #Brexit
The reunification of our country will lead to a massive economic windfall for the entire country according to “The cost of Non Reunification” Launch today. Compare that to the stark contrast of a bad or no deal Brexit - The answer is obvious! A border poll is essential #Brexit 
Perusing the barely visible border between  Ireland & Northern Ireland en route to Cross Border Crime conference in Newcastle. Essential that no hard border returns on Brexit. #brexit 
BREAKING: 'They’ve DECLARED WAR on the public!’ #Brexit vote demands from business bosses sparks furyMP Bob Seely “What a surprise, 1,400 lawyers trying to overturn 17 million voters. They want UK to be like EU, where elites get to override democracy”
LISTEN: @Keir_Starmer on @BBCr4today explains the risk of a blind #Brexit where we won't know what our future relationship with the EU will look like. #PeoplesVote
Democracy, like justice, must be seen to be done. The accumulating evidence of illegality, foreign interference, and the use of unregulated micro-targeted political ads in the #EUreferendum suggests that its close result is unsafe. To continue with #Brexit would be undemocratic. 
Hopes of #Brexit deal in November are fading, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has said. Finland's PM said: "There is 100% support from Finland to Ireland."   #New
Very concerning lack of #migrantvoices in #UKmedia reporting on #Brexit and #EUnationals. Seems little has changed from 2015 when our research showed that migrants were quoted in just 12% of articles about #migration. Read more here: 
Thank you for Your visit in Kesäranta @campaignforleo. #Finland and #Ireland have much in common and Ireland can count on Finland’s support in the #Brexit negotiations. 
I’m sick to death of the #Brexit sellout by @theresa_may and the @Conservatives disappointed at the lack of action by the #ERG AND @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and @BorisJohnson I’m not afraid of a GE let’s have it and get rid of her once and for all. I don’t fear a @jeremycorbyn PM.
This is my local coop.Spoke to the manager about the union fleg on our produce and told him that Scotland is a country not a region.And he Ken’s now that we’re boycotting the ‘Jack’ Shove yer #Brexit Scottish never British!#DissolveTheUnion Now
A leaked PR doc from No.10 reveals all is not running to plan on #Brexit... and that the government are keen to bury the fact that May’s deal would be much worse than our current deal inside the EU. What are they afraid of - a #PeoplesVote?
.@Keir_Starmer talks “blind” or “vague” #Brexit yet he argued against a “cliff edge” Brexit & for transition period to resolve details of trading etc after divorce deal. Keir couldn’t confirm how voting down deal would result in General Election. #bbcR4today
UK goods exports to the 11 fellow founding members of the Single Market have grown between 1993-2015 at just 1% pa. Over the same period, UK goods exports to the 111 countries with which it trades under #WTO rules have grown at 2.88% pa, nearly three times faster. #Brexit
Now @theresa_may wants the Vote on #Brexit deal on 27 Nov before #CJEU hears Scottish parliamentarians’ case on unilateral revocability of #Article50 because she’s afraid of consequences if MPs know it is #PeoplesVote also @UKEUchallenge a few days later.
Phone call with PM @theresa_may this morning to take stock of progress in #brexit talks and discuss way ahead.
Many people wish #Labour were frustrating #Brexit @Keir_Starmer @BBCr4today instead the leadership @jeremycorbyn has been helping to facilitate it.
Wrong @bbcnickrobinson being part of a customs union does NOT include free movement of people. Pls set the record straight. So important ppl are properly informed #Brexit
It never ceases to amaze me that the British get agitated when faced with the inevitable consequences of #Brexit. After all Leave means out 
In Helsinki today with @HMcEntee for meetings with Finnish PM @juhasipila on #Brexit and next year’s Finnish EU Presidency 
 Distort reality Blame foreigners for self-inflicted problems Stir up irrational fear of identity loss Demonise experts, academics, opposition media, the judiciary... Use false doctrine of the "will of the people"Did I miss any?#Brexit
#Brexit ain't going to work. Let's sack it, move on and get back to normality. It's what the majority now want.
Now us in the UK need to work out the god awful prob of #brexit
Come on UK...if the Democrats can win back lost ground from Trump & begin to retore sanity then we sure as hell can win back our Country from those seeking to impose a debased #Brexit upon us.Step up...sign up & fight to #StopBrexitNOTHING LEFT TO RESPECT #PeoplesVote #Remain
Did you vote leave? Are you from Plymouth or LLanneli or have friends that are? Did you believe that economic warnings were project fear?Well #Brexit reality! But it's not too late, we can #StopBrexit and more losses.Be a #RemainerNow & fight!
A sovereign UK must never become part of any #EU Army. #Brexit
Ultimately the willingness to blame Russian internet hypnotism for #Brexit is the left's unwillingness to confront their own role in why Brexit happened. 
Do they know how much they are despised?#Brexit 
I’ve watched US elections for decades, but because of the corruption, illegality and Billionaire Oligarch influence over #Trump #Russia #Brexit I’ve NEVER felt the fate of myself and my country has relied on my American friends as  #Vote2018
Unless Barnier is told Nada in no uncertain terms, Tories can forget about huge leave vote whenever it comes to putting crosses in boxes. It’s left now to ERG 51, the DUP & the odd Minister with principles, to firmly reject this crap & reject May’s sellout WA in the vote! #Brexit 
I will be putting my country first - by voting against a disastrous #Brexit deal that will damage our economy, future and place in the world for generations. It’s time for a @peoplesvote_uk to end this chaos.
Ahem, I’m gonna try explain the Irish border quandary again.It’s not about EU intransigeance. The facts have not changed and the ´tech’ to build a frictionless border doesn’t exist (yet.)   #C4Brexit #Brexit 
Tory/Labour: ‘The customs union’, vs ‘A customs union,’ doesn’t make any difference. It means the UK can’t have an independent trade policy, and it’s where we’re heading given the quandary of the Irish border. #C4Brexit #Brexit 
BREAKING: Shorter version: through Frank Mermoud and Arron Banks we have a DIRECT connection between #Brexit and Paul Manafort. (And therefore another connection to Putin via Deripaska) 
Excellent evening in Westminster with @Andrew_Adonis and @gavinesler in conversation around the big question: can #Brexit be stopped? The answer is yes, it can with a #PeoplesVote @EK_EuropeanMove
U2 in Dublin tonight - no ambiguity here #brexit 
15 Labour MP vote for #TheresaMay #brexit deal #newsnight is having a laugh any Labour MP who backs May #Brexit deal on Monday might as well get ready for a deselection vote in their constituency on Friday & be looking for a new job by Sunday.
People are losing their jobs because of #Brexit, some will have voted to Leave, many did not. None of them voted to lose their jobs, they voted because they believed things would be better. If you voted leave, become a #remainernow, stop #Brexit before others lose their jobs.
People's Vote march in #York this Saturday! Vote now in the York Press poll - Do you think there should be a People’s Vote on the #Brexit deal? 
Ever wondered why the #BBC is stocked full of card carrying Tory #Brexit’eers? Well #Capita run the Beebs HR department?!  #KickOutCapita
Britain’s arrogant attempts to hoodwink the EU have sacrificed all trust | Jonathan Lis /#EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote
MPs @ChukaUmunna @leicesterliz @wesstreeting @MikeGapes urged Theresa May to ease the “shameful” treatment of up to 3.8 million EU citizens in the UK by ensuring they do not have to pay to stay in the country after #Brexit.
Today alone, hundreds of jobs have been lost due to #Brexit.Shame on every single person who cried 'Project Fear'. You were wrong - it's already happening... and you've cost ordinary decent people their livelihoods.#PeoplesVote #RemainOption
We now know that there is no good version of #brexit - it's gone from sunlit uplands to not a "mad max" dystopian reality. The truth is that #Brexit will hurt everyone bar the über rich.

I for one would have no problem if Britain wished to become a colony of a United Ireland & receive some kind of special trade status within the EU as a result #Brexit
Well spoken Andrea Jenkyns - we are relying on MP's like u to deliver the result of the #Brexit EURef 
A sad loss of good jobs #Brexit as a result of self harm- we really do need to stop this madness 
#Brexit negotiations?Q: Why this insistence in keeping us in some sort of Customs Union?A: Because the EU are scared of competition from a free UK, we might amplify their incompetence.This is not rocket science.
We went to the north west for The Washington Post. This is what we heard from the #DerryGirls Against Borders and others about #Brexit

Very significant result from @PeoplesMomentum.Across all traditions in the party, a clear majority of voters, members & activists want #Labour MPs to vote against the Withdrawal Deal and then campaign to #Remain in a #PeoplesVote. Standing against #Brexit can unite the party. 
Great to support the motion - which was passed -backing a #GENow or #PeoplesVote at #bcclive today - #Brexit will damage our city and we need to give our citizens a #FinalSay
Repeat as necessary.....“It is not a deal. It is a withdrawal agreement - with a transition period.It is not a deal.We negotiate, from the weakest possible position, for several years from 30 March 2019, an inferior UK-EU relationship.It is not a deal.”#Brexit
Macron just called for a “real european army”. Nick Clegg once called that a dangerous fantasy.Can we hurry up and leave the EU? #Brexit
Interesting one by @PrivateEyeNews on another billionaire plugging a hard #Brexit 
When is #Labour going to get off its arse and fight #Brexit ??Jobs being lost all over the UK now and in the pipeline!Your six tests were failed months ago yet #Labour and #Corbyn cling to the wreckage of #Brexit! 
UK accuses EU of #Brexit bias as it refuses to endorse aid spending because the EU is favouring other EU countries over of the UK.What does the UK expect. It has decided to leave the club, it can't expect membership benefits. 
Hello #FBPE in Europe!  These are our UK MEPs that are trying to stop #brexit and the far-right.  Please can you retweet this across EU27?  Thank you! @AuroraBlogspot @janejane24 @RolandLeander
Nigel Farage: Ask people:Do you want to make your own laws?Do you want to control your own borders?Do you want to make your own trade deals?You get Big Majorities saying Yes!Country wants #BrexitBut very disenchanted with politics & politicians.#EU
It's  ALL going to be SO EASY said the Brexiteers!!!  Defra now saying any pets travelling after 30 March you need to take them to vet by end of November. (4 Months).Confirmed by #Eurotunnel tonight!#brexit is bonkers 
Ludicrous! The government accuses the EU of bias because it won't fund UK NGOs in the event of a no-deal. It is the government which has been using a no-deal as a bargaining card. When will Brexiters take responsibility for their actions! #Brexit #FBPE
WATCH: Dominic Grieve says #Brexit is turning us into a rule taker which shows why we need a #PeoplesVote.Email your MP to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal:  #WriteThisWrong
Tomorrow's @Independent cartoon... #TheresaMay #Brexit 
Just as I suspected & asked @theresa_may 2 weeks ago. She wants the Vote on #Brexit deal on 27 Nov before #CJEU hears Scottish parliamentarians’ case on unilateral revocability of #Article50 because she’s afraid of consequences if MPs know it is #PeoplesVote
.@LiamFox, who said a #Brexit deal would be “the easiest thing in human history”, now says it's “impossible” to say if we'll manage one. If he can change his mind as the facts become clear, shouldn’t the British public be allowed to as well? #EndTheChaos
Members from across @UKLabour know that #Brexit, especially the Tory Brexit, goes against our socialist values of internationalism and co-operation. We must #StopToryBrexit & I’m convinced of that now more than ever. @Labour4EU @Another_Europe @Remain_Labour @EuropeNotts
Spot on from @johnmcdonnellMP; this Government is failing over and over again#Brexit#JC4PM
An interesting remark from a recently-departed Chinese govt official at a dinner I was at last week- "if after #Brexit the UK just follows US lead on China in its trade approach and does not differentiate, why would we treat the UK as important? Will just focus on dealing w/US"
Only 7 per cent of Momentum members back #Brexit to “make things better” and just 17 per cent oppose a #peoplesvote. Quite extraordinary results that underline the feelings of the party and labour movement. See for yourself here: 
Thank you @LaylaMoran MP @LibDems for signing up the pledge to guarantee #citizensrights for #the5million regardless of the outcome of #Brexit negotiations. #thelastmile
Putin's creepy Tory Brexiter friends, like Robert Oulds of the Brextremist Bruges Group. What country are these people working for? #Brexit #PeoplesVote #BrexitBetraysBritain
BREAKING: Momentum has released the results of its Brexit consultation. What they show is that a majority of Momentum members back a fresh referendum on #Brexit if no election happens, with the largest group wanting one "in all circumstances".Just 17% oppose a public vote.
#Macron obviously now sees himself as taking over from #Merkel as the new anointed leader (the little Napolean?!) of Europe. He ignores NATO and wants an #EU Army and sees the US as a potential enemy! The #UK has achieved a narrow escape! #Brexit 
A pro-Brexit page on Facebook, #Brexit News, launched a poll to "prove" the #C4News poll showing a swing to Remain was #fakenews.After 14 hours & 76,000 votes, their poll shows a 51% majority for Remain. 
Good meeting w/ Prime Minister @PellegriniP_ in Bratislava on #Brexit state of play. Strong common commitment to work for orderly withdrawal, which must include all-weather backstop for IE/NI, and ambitious future relationship. We are not there yet. 
#Brexit: PM tells ministers she wants deal but 'not at any cost' 
What I learned at the debate at #Wonkfest18 today: the UK higher education community is not ready to face the consequences of #brexit, inward looking and caught between dispair, anger and cheap talk about 'turning challenges into opportunities'. 
WATCH: I live 20 minutes from the Northern Irish border, I understand exactly what's going to happen if this #Brexit goes ahead - let's demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "It is very important that the Govt is generous and treats properly everybody who has come here lawfully up until the day we leave.“But would my honourable friend also agree it’s important that once we have left, we take back control of our borders?" #Brexit 
Anyone who *still* thinks that there are any economic benefits to leaving the EU, or any #Brexit dividend whatsoever is, quite frankly, stupid.People who voted Leave were not necessarily stupid. People who still believe the lies are.
Every single person I know who voted #Brexit would still vote Brexit tomorrow. In fact, some of the people I know who voted #Remain are now so bored & frustrated with this process they too would now back Brexit because they just want it over and done with!
.⁦@johnmcdonnellMP⁩ spot on to compare May’s #Brexit proposition with Chamberlain’s piece of paper. Completely meaningless. A leap into a void, with no guarantees post March. #brexitshambles #peoplesvote
Britain was not divided by the #Brexit vote. It was already divided between those with control over their lives and those without, those who are represented in politics and those who aren’t. Brexit is the way to overcome those divisions, says Tim Black
Thank you @StephenMorganMP MP @UKLabour for signing up the pledge to guarantee #citizensrights for #the5million regardless of the outcome of #Brexit negotiations. #thelastmile
Within 10 years I reckon almost no-one will admit to having supported #Brexit. The careers of all the leading Brexit politicians will be in ruins, and with luck some of the worst will be languishing in prison.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Quite a lot af abusive tweets on my timeline from accounts that are either right-wing extremists or Putin sockpuppets (hard to tell the difference as they push the same toxic propaganda).Good. They're getting worried that #Brexit may not happen after all. #PeoplesVote
Caroline Lucas: We're discovering how complex & costly #brexit is, in a way we didn't know 2 years ago. There's no trade deal in the world that will replace what we have with the EU.. that's why we need to go back to the people so they can have a #FinalSay#PeoplesVote #C4Brexit
Emmanuel Macron calls for "a real European army" to protect the continent (and in reality to threaten countries that defy the EU elite):  #Brexit
The cost of #Brexit is continuing to spiral out of control.The @Conservatives plan to turn Kent into a car park, Operation Brock, is now costing the taxpayer an additional £10 million more than the figure they gave in the summer.#BrexitShambles
Remain Land and Leave Land: Lets put the heated discussion around #Brexit to the side for a second and appreciate how interesting the #geography of the region would be if the parts that wanted to leave would actually just disappear.
You know when remainers were accused of #ProjectFear because they said #brexit put the British Automotive supply chain jobs at risk?Well, it seems the UK automotive sector is now being deconstructed in front of our eyes.Project fear is now project reality.

WATCH: @BarryGardiner says #Brexit is economic self harm on #C4Brexit. Write to your MP to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
C4 poll shows 105 council areas that voted leave in 2016 would now vote remain. Biggest survey of its type shows remain growing at 54%. Note how little coverage on @BBC Giving editorial equivalence to mad, bad & sad figures who support #Brexit demeans the Corporation's values
If you look into the connections of #Farage and #Banks before the Brexit referendum, you find a web of wealthy financiers operating secretively from abroad and demonstrating no great allegiance to the UK taxpayer.They hate the EU. They love #Brexit .Now why would that be?

The EU is the Lamborghini of trade deals. Pure WTO, without the supplement of many additional deals, is a bicycle with 2 bent wheels. Swap a Lambo for a bent bicycle, that's a no-deal #Brexit. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
How many people who voted #Brexit have to lose their livelihood before it sinks in? 
Leave,EU & Banks Eldon Insurance guilty of serious breaches of privacy law. Govt must halt #Brexit to allow investigations into how exactly EU ref was subverted. The mandate is no longer secure. To proceed is to collude in the deliberate perversion of our democracy.

Hang on: didn't polls before #Brexit predict precisely the same? And then looked what happened. So: 100% meh  
The question should read, Do you agree with the Conservatives approach to Brexit,it was after all their idea to hold a Referendum to try keep their Waring factions together, and it is the Conservatives who are conducting negotiations. Jeremy Corbyn has no control over #Brexit!

This is Rupert Murdoch using the rhetoric of threats and intimidation because #Brexit isn't going his way. Yes we do need to regain our sovereignty... from Rupert Murdoch. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Any variety of #Brexit will harm the UK, and especially the poorest and most vulnerable. That’s why I will never ‘get behind’ it.Democracy is not a one-off, voters get opportunities to review and revisit as facts/outlooks change. That’s why we need a #PeoplesVote

Perhaps we need a few more road hauliers, SME'rs etc etc in parliament instead of tax avoidance boutique experts and a lot of low-brow Oxbridge PPE-ers, whose idea of #Brexit 'management' is the Charge of the Light Brigade?

Hardline Remainers say #Brexit is the product of a few posh men – they blame the incompetence of David Cameron or the machinations of Rees-Mogg. They refuse to face the harsh truth: that the majority do not share their worldview, says Tim Black
#Labour accepted to start the #Brexit process, not because it thought it was good for #Britain (it had campaigned to Remain in the referendum) but in order to respect the will of the people.  But now there’s growing evidence that it’s no longer the will of the people...
The French Sénat will debate the #Brexit bill today. This will give the government emergency powers to pass laws quickly by decree to - hopefully - mitigate the consequences of a hard Brexit for British in France and French in UK. "Reciprocity" key word; over to London.
Glad to see the North East has realised it will be hardest hit by the impacts of #Brexit  #stopbrexit
Downing Street now appears to be spinning that Dublin has conceded (which it hasn’t) and to be dressing the backstop as “a backstop to the backstop” (which it isn’t). Nothing has actually changed. #Brexit

After Channel 4 last night, it is plain @Nigel_Farage and #Brexit are frit, scared witless of a #peoplesvote with a #remain option. I say that because they should be worried, I voted leave and now want to vote remain . Leaving is pure madness .
I #Scotland & its inclusive multiNational Scots  We say NO to #Brexit & UK & YES to return to Independence & as outwarding looking Europeans.  I think the attempt to dissolve our #Scottishbrand & force us as 'British' & trample on our culture, our Nation are steps too far!
If you watched @Channel4 's '#Brexit: What The Nation Really Thinks', hosted by @krishgm & thought it was another biased programme you're right. The questions were certainly twisted but did you know that Channel 4 is a recipient of EU funding? Thanks to @kkeithp for the attached.
When you consider who @Channel4 has chosen to represent "what the nation really thinks about #Brexit", it becomes apparent that Channel 4 can't be trusted to convey the truth about anything. 
#BREAKING NEWS 51% of Scots now support #indyref because of #brexit.
These maps of the UK coming round to Remain are rather like medical diagrams showing the body's immune system fighting off a virulent, life-threatening virus.Not off the critical list yet, but vital signs getting stronger by the day.#C4Brexit #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
#C4Brexit Fact Check on #Brexit & Scotland's indyref. @Channel4's own @Survation poll has:YES: 51.4%NO: 48.6%
Barry Gardiner and David Gauke looked like rabbits caught in the headlights when the #C4Brexit poll result was read out. What's really astonishing is that they seemed genuinely shocked, suggesting they had been wholly unaware of the shift in public opinion.#PeoplesVote #Brexit
The problem with #brexit isn't that it may cave in but that we will most likely be under it and crushed by its weight of deceit and corruption.
Biggest poll on #Brexit since the referendum, showing a reversal of the mandate, doesn’t even make it on BBC even in “in other news”. If Boris Johnson had farted they’d have pundits analysing it for ten minutes.
Channel 4 News poll tonight finds 54% now support Remain, 46% back Leave. The trend of public opinion is increasingly against Brexit. This strengthens the case for a #PeoplesVote Everyone, including those critical of the EU, has a right to vote on the final #Brexit terms 
The thing that most pisses me off about #FBPE extremists is their complete refusal to view #Brexit from outside their pro-EU bubble. They have no desire to understand why people voted Leave or why Labour is obligated to unite both sides. They're like spoiled children. #C4Brexit
So the #C4Brexit #Survey says we got a 54/46 Remain/Leave split now. Sure it's only from 20,000 people but the arguments from @CarolineLucas were way better than those from @Nigel_FarageWe got this folks, keep the faith  #Brexit #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE #Remain
What every intelligent thinking Scot knew as soon as the result of the EU referendum was announced. #Brexit has destroyed the UK union! 
“#Brexit is teaching Britain its true place in the world...  a top 10 global economy (fifth, sixth or ninth )... Brexit ...an expensive way to learn...” Opinion via @FT#C4Brexit#PeoplesVote
#Brexit is teaching Britain its true place in the world 
While I respect Caroline Lucas, it's so much easier to oppose #Brexit when you're the only Green MP and your constituency voted overwhelmingly to Remain. 2/3s of Labour constituencies voted Leave. The Greens have nothing to lose. Labour have everything to lose. #C4Brexit
Labour shouldn’t step aside when economic harm threatens the UK!! For goodness sake, #Brexit is going to make people worse off and they know it - hence today’s #C4Brexit poll with 54% now wanting to remain in the EU!Why deprive the public a final say? We need a #PeoplesVote now
This is similar to what I'm picking up on the doorsteps. Many folk who voted No in 2014 have told me that while they may not be ready (yet) to vote Yes, they are now open to the possibility. There's genuine anger at how the UK Government has handled #Brexit and ignored Scotland. 
Nigel Farage on #c4brexit blaming the failure of #Brexit on remainers as its a "remainers brexit ".It wasn't the remainers who made outlandish promises to people.Nothing is ever Nigel's fault or responsibility.Spineless little toad.
Clear case put forward for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal on #C4Brexit with big shift towards remain. Write to your MP to demand a #PeoplesVote: 
#C4Brexit Can't we just forget #brexit and deport #NigelFarage and make @CarolineLucas Prime Minister !
The faces of the Tory Government Minister and Farage when the #C4Brexit poll revealed significant swing to a #Remain majority across UK were fascinating... Time for @peoplesvote_uk on #Brexit 
Just a reminder that the EU Referendum was held on 23rd June 2016. One poll by a bias media organisation, isn't going to change that.  #C4Brexit #Brexit
Sensational results of #C4Brexit survey just released, showing strong voter swing in all parts of the UK towards of Remaining in the European Union. #Brexit is no longer the will of the people. #PeoplesVote NOW! 
#Brexit •Southern Ireland - NO It's Ireland•Eire - Do you call Spain Espana when speaking English•Irish border - NO it's a British border on the island of IRE•We are your biggest trader - NO you are not•We bailed you out - NO you bailed out UK bank subsidiaries in IRE
Peter Bone MP - "I want what the PM said only in the Commons about a week ago or so."She said we would end the free movement of people, we won’t pay the EU billions of pounds each and every year, we will make our own laws in our own country, judged by our own judges." #Brexit 
Her face says it all #C4Brexit #Brexit 
.@CarolineLucas calls out #brexit "omnishambles". Impossible to resolve. We need a #PeoplesVote
I want to eliminate any doubt or ambiguity from your minds about my position on #Brexit:It is a total clusterfuck of galactically epic fucking proportions. I will never fucking support 'it', get behind 'it' or get over 'it'. You can fucking quote me on #hignfy or #MashReport
63% in #C4Brexit poll think people should be free to live & work in each other's countries.Nigel Farage, needless to say, is horrified. He's said he'll quit this country if #Brexit is cancelled. Whose country does he plan to live & work in?#PeoplesVote
#C4Brexit A big surprise - 63% agree with Freedom of Movement after #Brexit. Barty Gardiner says we should have an immigration policy driven by economic needs, ignoring the loss of free movement for ordinary people, and treating people as mere economic resources.#PeoplesVote
Is Sir John Curtice on TV? Yes. @JohnCurticeOnTV #Channel4 #brexit 
“Nigel Farage is back” Krishnan says on the #Channel4 #Brexit special. Did he ever go away ? He’s a constant malign presence on our screens.
Don't forget to tune into #channel4 at 8pm to find out how much of a racist you are for voting for #brexit #whatthenationreallythinks#C4Brexit #PeoplesVote
WATCH: Every day leave voters from all sectors of society are changing their minds on #brexit,  becoming #RemainerNow & wanting a #finalsay(This video was made by @Card5hark with clips from news programmes but also short films by @LLJourn & @EuanFilm)
#Brexit: What the Nation Really Thinks on @Channel4 at 8. With no Scottish, Welsh or N Irish representatives the 'nation' in question must be England. #EnglishBrexit #C4Brexit
This is from a former UK Labour Govt minister. Yet the dominant UK political class & media conversation is to ignore that #Brexit is a crisis of the British state & is making that crisis deeper & more fundamental. 
I don’t intend to engage in ‘tit for tat’ with  VB  but his letter today is evidence of how neuralgic #Brexit is for British-Irish relations. UK has every right to exit EU but it is in its own interests to do so in ways that minimise damage to its neighbours & its own security. 
Hi @YvetteCooperMP - we agree the govt is in a mess and we must not be blackmailed into #Brexit.But given that 71% of #Labour voters in your seat of Normanton, Pontefract & Castleford support a #PeoplesVote, are you now ready join them?Your support would make a big difference.
“Time to grow up and change our minds about #Brexit “- #farmers Weekly
Oppose #Brexit if that’s what you want to do. But please, please, don’t be gaslighted by the NeoCon War Lobby into blaming it all on a ‘Russian plot’. No evidence that Russia wanted Brexit & best & most persuasive articles for Remain were by @JohnWight1 for @RT_com & @SputnikInt

This #GuyFawkesNight remember remember to write to your MP and demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
When asked whether ring-fencing EU citizens’ rights and paying for settled status applications would help heal the hurt caused to @The3Million by #brexit , the Home Office Minister’s immediate response was ‘people voted for Brexit’. So EU citizens must suffer the consequences.
Consumer spend down, manufacturing output in reverse - all predicted, all true. Lies & cheating delivered #Brexit. Need new vote based on reality, time running out. #FBPE
"We want free movement in return for life-long right of return for EU citizens," says Jane Golding of @BritishInEurope at today's rally at Parliament Square. #TheLastMile #CitizensRights #Brexit #NoDeal

I have been a staunch EEA/Efta advocate for four years but with every moronic bleat about a people's vote that appears in my notifications, I become less hostile to the WTO option. #Brexit
The government is acting like a mafia gang preparing to push the British people off the no-deal cliff if the EU doesn't cave into its demands. The British people are the hostages.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
Shocking attitude on display again from @ukhomeoffice Minister Caroline Nokes - sneering, arrogant and failing to answer any of our questions on #Brexit #immigration #employment #EUcitizens - this is the lives of @The3Million we are talking about! @peoplesvote_uk @WalesForEurope
The #Brexit liars and cheats are exposed. The country is still about to be thrown over an economic precipice by the rabid Tories. And all this scruffy old man can think of banging on about is the bloody railways. FFS get a grip and lead the opposition, or step aside. 
Here I am in #thelastmile human chain demanding that the #citizensrights of @the3million EU citizens in the UK and the @BritishInEurope are guaranteed. #Brexit

Home Office Minister Caroline Nokes totally out of her depth in @YvetteCooperMP Urgent Question on rights of EU citizens living here in event of #Brexit. No answers just platitudes.
And if anyone wants to know why I will keep doing what I do for as long as it takes to make sure that not one of @The3Million of us is left behind because of #Brexit, then here is why in one photograph — and one lament. #TheLastMile #The5Million
When was the last time Remoaners made a positive case for the EU, for remaining, accepting the rush towards statehood?They don't HAVE a positive case.All they have is "#Brexit is Armageddon".Their argument doesn't stand on merit, it merely sinks in a quagmire of fearmongering.
Chairs of @The3Million @BritishInEurope are explaining to Minister @WalkerWorcester (under-secretary of @DExEUgov) why we're having #theLastMile lobby.  #The5Million needs their #citizensrights guaranteed regardless the #Brexit negotiations #SettledStatus is not good enough
Imagine the scenes if #Europe and #America Agreed that the #carribean,  #Africa & #Mecca   needed open borders and Diversity so were sending 200 million white people to live in these locations#PeoplesVote#Brexit#MAGA#DrainTheDeepState
Remember when the Brexiteers said #Brexit was very simple, a stroll in the park? Any settlement - if a settlement is possible - is worse than where we are today. #StopBrexit
Stopped by @The3Million @unisontweets #thelastmile lobby in @HouseofCommons to pledge support for EU #citizensrights no matter what the outcome of #Brexit 
So the U.K. can’t do trade deals until the EU/Ireland says it can - strange position the U.K. Gov had got itself into #Brexit
READ: "It's time to change our mind." Great to see @FarmersWeekly supporting a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
Looks like #Wales just swung for #Remain. Clearly, as people rethink this issue in ever greater numbers, we require a #FinalSay on #Brexit so we can #EndTheChaos!
Concerning. Govt now quietly adding extra conditions to the process EU nationals must go through to secure their residency rights after #Brexit. Will leave @The3Million who have made the UK their home wondering where they stand and what they can believe.
"We are not the kind of country that does go out and riot."If the government doesn't deliver on #Brexit @Nigel_Farage says he doesn't think there will be violence on the streets, but that the Tory party will be "destroyed". More on Brexit here:

The differing presentations of the same phone call between PM and Taoiseach is striking. #Brexit 
Statement by An Taoiseach following this morning’s phone call with PM Theresa May #Brexit 
The EU position has been consistent and clear. A legally operable backstop must form part of the withdrawal agreement and it must apply unless and until another solution is found. The focus must now be on achieving that outcome #brexit #focused #endinsight
Tony Blair - #Brexit is life-changing for Britain. The British people should be given a #FinalSay on whatever deal is negotiated. If they are allowed that say, then #Brexit can be averted... we're told ‘the people have spoken’ & to interrogate the question further is treachery 
The Govt’s chaotic approach to the #Brexit is making ‘no deal’ more likely by the day.Millions of EU citizens living in the UK and British citizens living in the EU can't just be left to cross their fingers and hope @theresa_may secures a deal that guarantees their rights.
7) it is not balance to bring on the Labour Leadership to face off against Tories on #Brexit, they belong on the same side of the debate. You need to bring in other voices.And you need to recognise cries of "Remoaner, we had a vote" for what they are, attempts to stifle debate
5) Frankly, it's long past time for the @BBCNews team to make amends, to remember your duty to inform, impartially, and to give the Remain movement a voice on your programs and in your coverage#Brexit is not inevitable, and people now know it
“These guys have landed us in this mess... Now they are running away from the mess they created… A bunch of clowns” @JonAshworth “Anyone who thought it would be simple did not ask the right questions” @GillianKeegan#Brexit #politicslive
3) despite this writing off of Remain (Nick Robinson said essentially "the debate is over, the only Q is the form of #Brexit"), despite pleading "but Brexit must happen", even despite attempts to reinforce the inevitability of Brexit, Remain has grown
Okay then @OwenJones84 so if leave campaign cheating didn't effect the result of #brexit vote then you won't be complaining when the tories resort to the same tactics in the next GE which if brexit is allowed to stand they assuredly will 
Taoiseach @campaignforleo says a #brexit backstop with a time limit wouldn't be worth the paper it was written on. | 
sometimes you have to make more than #onedecision #brexit #brexitanimation #PeoplesVote
Indeed, you read it correctly.@10DowningStreet has made plans for taking horses abroad in case of a no-deal #Brexit and yet nothing about the #citizensrights of #The5Million human beings (@The3Million + @BritishInEurope).Join #thelastmile lobby, tweet your concerns to your MP !
Good luck to you all today. Was looking forward to being there to support you but currently stranded in Edinburgh due to delayed flight. My @theSNP colleague @Stuart_McDonald will be along to speak instead of me #The5Million #Brexit #thelastmile
Significant and clear #Brexit message from @NFUStweets - pity @GOVUK is presently refusing to listen to anyone but their own extremists ….
The #Brexit tunnellers are tunnelling in pursuit of that elusive crock of gold - a deal. What are they trying to finesse? How are they trying to close a deal? Here's what I know after chats with both sides.  1/Thread
“Democratic government is not frozen in time”, say 1,500 of the UK's top lawyers today, calling for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit. The 1976 vote was held after negotiations - we knew what we were getting. In 2016 we had untestable claims instead. #EndTheChaos!
Q. Why are #Labour so keen on "respecting the result" of the CRIMINALLY FRAUDULENT #Brexit referendum?#Frauderendum
Former Tory Environment Minister Lord Deben says a trade deal with the USA would lead to "a huge decline in food safety”, “You have four times as much food-borne disease in the US,”#Brexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE
Brexit is now a fully fledged crime scene. If it transpires, at any point, that more illegal activity influenced the vote, then a #PeoplesVote must be guaranteed to the people. There should never be any outside interference in our democracy, nor dark money. #brexit
Invitation should have gone to @Feorlean to rep #Scotland, he's @scotgov #Brexit spokesperson. Nicola is @theSNP party leader & this is not a leaders debate, why invite her & not Mike in the first place? #C4 knew she'd have to decline, they all knew. #BadForm @Channel4 #SwitchOff
Dominic Grieve - I do want a #PeoplesVote... as we're now having to face up to the reality of what #brexit is going to entail which is entirely different to what we were discussing in 2016.#r4today #FBPE

#Brexit: Irish rule out time-limited backstop 
Over 70 business leaders have called for a #PeoplesVote. No wonder, when the #Brexit uncertainty damaging the economy now looks set to continue for years to come under the kind of miserable Brexit Theresa May is offering.

Look forward to being part of @channel4 debate on #Brexit tonightGood to see majority supporting at least one version of #PeoplesVote There’s no real “choice” between pain of no deal or fudge with no control over decisions - people must have their say
READ: Nearly every part of Birmingham wants a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
Ha ha ha! More bad news for #Brexit Britain. In a fiendishly cunning plan, we are going to make the British pay a huge price for visas. This will mean they will have to travel outside of the EU to spend their money. It won't damage the EU economy at all.
1. The notion we should have a "people's vote" on the #Brexit deal is intellectually bankrupt. There is no possible way it could be an informed decision especially given the timeframe. That's what the remaons are counting on. It's dishonest to the core.  (thread)
Is this the official @allianceparty position @naomi_long? As it's a gross insult to Leave voters and the wider Unionist community. There has been generosity of spirit on both sides. As there has many, many negatives. Frankly, a contemptible overtly anti-British Tweet. #BREXIT 
Was going to write a response to latest news stories re: #Brexit negos., to explain why a NI-specific #backstop will remain in place.But no need.The key points are here  in response to opening Qs from @hilarybennmp in @CommonsEUexit session 24.10.18.
READ: @GiselaStuart claims no leave voters have changed their mind - here are just a few of the many demanding a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
Write to your MP to demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. It takes just 30 seconds to let them know that you want a #PeoplesVote on this dog's dinner #Brexit: 
.@Tom_Slater_ says with the #LosersVote the left have lined up against the majority of working class ppl in the country, against the biggest democratic vote in our history. A "middle class spasm". #Brexit 
The more you find out about @Arron_Banks, the more utterly disgusting he turns out to be. And yet we are proceeding with an enormously damaging #Brexit as a result of the money - from deeply suspect sources - that Banks poured into LeaveEU's campaign.#PeoplesVote
READ: Top UK lawyers demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
Bizarre by @Channel4 @Channel4News SNP are UK's third biggest party despite only standing in Scotland.Scotland is the biggest Europhile part of the UK.Yet, no space for SNP on their show and yet another platform for Farage?!#Brexit #Indyref2
Yet more support for a #PeoplesVote referendum as 1,400 senior lawyers urge a #FinalSay vote on #Brexit saying it would be democratic to do so.With an option to #Remain the U.K. can decide to take the only rational route and #ExitfromBrexit
More than 1,500 of the UK’s top lawyers have urged Theresa May and MPs to back a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit, saying that “democratic government is not frozen in time”.
@Jacob_Rees_Mogg I was one of the first and possibly your biggest advocate on here at the beginning. The ERG has helped and aided the PM in her quest to betray #Brexit, by default or purposely you and your tory colleagues have sucessufully contained the Brexit voices from within. 
This #GuyFawkesNight, how about we burn #Brexit instead?
#Brexit: letter signed by more than 1,500 lawyers supports @peoplesvote_uk. Signatories include Helena Kennedy QC. @BBCNews quote @JonathanCoopr @DoughtyStPublic @DoughtyStIntl here:
Shocking account of the nasty, bullying side of Arron Banks and his attempts to intimidate anyone who questions him about his dubious connections and bankrolling of the #Brexit campaign:
I agree. For some time now I've been wondering what will happen to UK if #Brexit goes ahead. UK probably worse off without Scotland, and it will probably be heartbreaking to see them leave, but Scotland probably better off out of UK and in EU.
Since the UK vote on #Brexit the number of Danes asking for at vote on continued Danish membership of the EU has gone down. In June 2016 38% of the Danes wanted a #Dexit referendum. Today only 26% of Danes would like a referendum while 68% are against
More and more sectors of the economy are joining calls for a #PeoplesVote once we know #brexit terms now they see the harmful effects #Brexit will have. Great that 1,400 lawyers have joined that call.@Lawyers4PV/@Lawyers4EU are doing great work here.
#Brexit will take away part of my identity - please don't let it take away my #CitizensRights, too. Take part in today's @LastMileLobby18 & put pressure on MPs to ring-fence my rights & those of millions of other citizens caught up in this mess!
This is consistent with lots of other polls - @WelshLabour should not sit by and enable a Tory #Brexit. Chilling that such a clear majority of Tory supporters would risk peace in Northern Ireland for Brexit. Reinforces my view on @peoplesvote_uk
The Irish position remains consistent and v clear⁩ that a “time-limited backstop” or a backstop that could be ended by UK unilaterally would never be agreed to by IRE or EU. These ideas are not backstops at all + don’t deliver on previous UK commitments ⁦⁦#Brexit 
That's what the #Brexit high-command want - ditch all the problems of non-England and turn England into their Singapore-on-Thames tax-dodger nirvana. Or Cuba-on-Thames if you're Corbyn. Nobody serious about stopping #Brexit can be supporting either CONKIP or LABKIP (NB: You).
On my way to Brussels for discussions on all things #Brexit and to let our European friends know that Theresa May does not speak on behalf of the majority with her blind or bad deal Brexit. 
.@Channel4News shut @theSNP out from flagship #Brexit TV debate. Naturally Farage is on & I bet the LibDems are invited. @theSNP are the Govt of Scotland, the 3rd party at Westminster & support a #PeoplesVote. So what’s the justification? @krishgm? #FBPE
Good Morning Britain!Coming up on today’s show:- London Mayor Sadiq Khan joins us LIVE- Boris Johnson says the PM’s #Brexit plans ‘stink’- Oh and @piersmorgan is back!
Theresa May is no Wonder Woman. She cannot "see" Reason, "hear" People or "know" what is "best" for the UK. She is a tired, "unelected" deluded Narcissist who wears a Chain of Super Mendacity around her neck. No wonder #Brexit is such a mess.
There is a ton of overlap between the #Brexit debacle and the #TrumpRussia affair.Kudos @carolecadwalla for ripping the lid off of the dirty dealings on both sides of the pond in both votes by Cambridge Analytica.
Very interesting. Majority (55%) of British people now support at least one version of a @peoplesvote_uk #FinalSay on #Brexit - with strongest support for a question of #Remain vs Leave with a  “Deal” (tho see previous posts for my views on that!)
Ok but viewers will see this as a programme with party political representation. If not Nicola then @Feorlean has done a Stirling job as @scotgov #brexit negotiator? The Scottish point of view here is key, otherwise this is just an English debate (sorry Wales).
The monster raving losers partyRemainer MPs planning to launch NEW PARTY by CHRISTMAS in last-ditch bid to REVERSE #Brexit
A strong, centrist pro-EU, anti-#Brexit party with a lot of already-elected MPs in it who'd collapse the current government and revoke A50. Sign me up if it has the numbers to do it.
Well, well, well, and all of them produce Oil.Having looted one Trillion from #Scotland's Oil Revenues, that's 200,000 from each and every Scot.Westminster now wants to fund #Brexit from our Oil Wealth.

And herein the essence of #Brexit unexpectedly but beautifully encapsulated in the original lie of bendy #bananas. #FactsFirst#Banks  Let’s not lies become truth. #FBPE #WATON x
The only positive aspect I can see of #Brexit is the fact that all the EU citizens living in the UK and the UK citizens living in the EU are now an undivided family.We're fighting for the same goal.To guarantee #citizensrights regardless the outcome of #Brexit negotiations.
Back in the summer @MrDDyer caused a bit of a storm on liveTV with his fantastic summing up of #brexit and   @David_Cameron for getting us in this mess.He then told his story about being a #RemainerNow in the Sunday Mirror, which is now on our website.
Here’s @andrewismaxwell discussing Irish knowledge of #Brexit on @BBCPolitics He’ll be joining us at #Kilkenomics next w-end to continue the Brexit conversation along with @davidmcw @acatherwoodnews @stephenkinsella @Aidan_Regan @DearbhailDibs @robertshrimsley @MehreenKhn & more.
Please read this thread from @carolecadwalla. The #BBC needs to up its game #Brexit #FBPE
Nigel Farage - "We are going, if PM May gets this deal through Parliament, to be in a position where we have not taken back control, we are not able to make our own trade deals.“Financially, it won’t be £39bn we have given the EU, it will be something closer to £60bn." #Brexit 
Interesting that despite #brexit that the U.K. in the first six months of this year was second only to China in the amount of inward Investment received.Also the fact that more investment is waiting once we leave the E.U.Let’s get on with it.
Very happy to represent and serve these constituents, as Labour don’t want to. Hats off to Jess for being spot on, we’d far rather people decided and not @Theresa_May . Voters in every Labour-held constituency support #peoplesvote on #Brexit 
Cocky, smug and self assured on @BBC, too chicken shit scared to appear on @Channel4News. What does that tell you about Banks and the BBC? 'Bad boy of #Brexit'? No, just an arrogant, chicken shit individual who  is going to go down. 
David Chipperfield(award-winning architect) - #Brexit is demoralising... you wake up every morning wishing it was a bad dream... somehow you always had the feeling that things progressed & now you have the feeling #brexit is a dead end. #peoplesvote #FBPE
I don't think May would stop #Brexit even if the entire Leave campaign admitted criminality, lying and subterfuge. She's so intent on clinging to power come what may.
Arron Banks "...if I had my time again I think we would have been better to probably Remain and not unleash these demons"A cynical attempt by Arron Banks to deceive a public to whom he is unfamiliar that he is a reasonable & thoughtful kind of guy.#BrexitGate #Brexit
Given his massive contribution to #Brexit I think @Arron_banks deserves a knighthood rather than this tawdry media driven assault. This man put £££millions into helping free our Nation from EU servitude.
Sorry @johnmcdonnellMP, there is no form of #Brexit that can 'bring the country together'. That is why 74% of Labour voters in your constituency of Hayes & Harlington now support a #PeoplesVote. It's time for a change of policy.
Ignoring corruption is itself corrupt. Labour it has become very obvious that the various #Leave campaigns were corrupt and that #Brexit is not the will of the people.If we voted based on lies & fraud then we were conned.@UKLabour you must oppose.I want a #PeoplesVote
"#FBPE clowns, it's just an anti Corbyn movement"No, it isn't, it's a movement that opposes Brexiters in all parties - including John McDonnell & Jeremy CorbynAt least Rees Mogg is honest about his #Brexit supportLabour badly let down by leadership
Those classy Remainers again, wishing their own citizens dead... "where there’s death, there’s hope".  The delightful Labour MEP Richard Corbett. Is @UKLabour now ok with this sort of rhetoric? #Brexit

I fully expect over the coming months that more public #Brexiters will admit #Brexit has all been a huge mistake and try to distance themselves before the disaster unfolds. A certain Mr Aaron Banks has kindly started the ball rolling.
Brexiteer Peter Bone predicts cabinet resignations if the speculated deal Theresa May has reached is true.@ianpaynesport | @PeterBoneUK | #Brexit
So - #Brexit is official LAB party policy @johnmcdonnellMP @Keir_Starmer & @jeremycorbyn, yes?  That's good enough for me - I'll be voting for a remain party until further notice. Not LAB. Not a chance. 35 years, but I'm off now. Bye. #StopCorruptBrexit
May's Dodgy DossierDavid Davis: Blair tried to keep Iraq War legal warnings secret & his reputation "never recovered" from cover-up.Now time to publish legal advice Cabinet received.No Ifs, No Buts!I urge PM to do the right thing & publish.#Brexit #EU

Arron Banski as Putin's little helper #Brexit 
Here is #RemainerNow story from @femi_sorry about a chap that voted leave in protest. He met him up in Darlington.So many people voted leave as a cry of pain against the establishment. MPs need to address their concerns, none of which will be helped by destructive #Brexit 
Fantastic to see all these business leaders finally speaking out in #brexit.So many people who abstained or voted leave in 2016 would not have done so if they had been fully aware of the effect of reality of #brexit on jobs & the economy.#PeoplesVote
Been on twitter most of day following the reactions to the #NoPlatformForBanks story & seeing reactions from Labour & Tory front benches & others.I am so angry - I want to walk to London & stand outside the HoC day & night till this fraudulent treasonous #brexit is stopped! 
If the #Brexit campaigning had no impact then better not let #ArronBanks know he wasted £8m - an unbelievable and deluded response from @johnmcdonnellMP!
Kate Hoey MP - "The rest of the world is using WTO rules. What is so special about the European Union?"Particularly as its economy is shrinking and we are actually trading far more with the rest of the world and that is increasing every year." #Brexit 
Arron Banks - "This inquiry is about undermining Article 50 and it is undermining the #Brexit result. "It is a collection of very vicious Labour MPs that have grouped together with The Guardian and FT to try to undermine Brexit." 
Any politician who says #Brexit should go through even if electoral crime has occurred, is saying that they are happy to profit from that crime. Do we want to be ruled by crime and politicians who profit from it?#Brexitgate #Brexit #PeoplesVote
19) this is a plea to Labour members & MPs - do you really want to be in a Party where the leadership are so keen on #Brexit that they would say illegal campaigning doesn't matter because no-one paid attention?Because that's what Labour has come toEnd/
Dear Mr Rees-Mogg. You and your colleagues have, so far, been all talk. When can we expect some action to put someone in charge who truly believes in #brexit ?

Irish people don't refer to ourselves as 'peasant stock'. That's how English people refer to us. We have a term for projecting a derogatory identity on us: 'colonialism'.#Brexit

Rather than #ArronBanks bluster and evasion on #Marr, people might want to see the clear explanation by the Electoral Commission (@ElectoralCommUK) of why they suspect him of CRIMINAL wrongdoing in support of #Brexit: 
Serious question. Where the fuck is @jeremycorbyn ? With everything that's going on with regards to #Brexit and the Aaron Banks/Russian money scandal, one would at least expect a press release. Is he still stuck in his Chilean protest heyday, waving banners about Pinochet?
Arron Banks on #Marr"If I had my time again, we would have been better to Remain and not unleash these demons"So even the far-right establishment elite, the only people who ever really wanted #Brexit are now no longer in favour it... So why are we still doing it?  
For viewers of @Sun_Pol_Scot #peoplesvote debate with @PeteWishart & @KirstyS_Hughes important to know @theSNP conference voted to support a second #EU referendum. It’s @theSNP party policy. Here’s my thread on why that decision was right #Brexit @Scotland4pv
A second independence referendum would be a complete distraction says John McDonnell the Labour shadow chancellor....  Distraction from what?  The economic mayhem caused by #Brexit ? the decades of economic/industrial decline caused by being in the UK?  Good grief.
For balance, why is #AndrewMarr not investigating role of Soros in Referendum?    Political bias really bad, and the way he was cracking up the single market laughable.  EU on the skids.  @Arron_banks @borisjohnson #borisjohnson #Brexit @StandUp4Brexit
"This is about undermining Article 50, it’s about undermining #Brexit,” insists Arron Banks #Marr
“Would have been better probably to remain and not unleash these demons” says Arron Banks on #Marr - no words #Brexit
Not a glove landed on @Arron_banks - it is very clear he is the victim of an establishment witch hunt designed to undermine the democratic will of the ‘plebs’. #Brexit #Marr
@Arron_banks with two left feet as he dances around #AndrewMarr’s line of simple questioning.#ArronBanks can not name the company that actually generated £8m. Insult to everyone’s intelligence. All smoke & mirrors. #Brexit #LeaveEU @ElectoralCommUK #Marr
This car crash of an interview demonstrates that the decision to interview Banks was a stupid one. It’s about arcane movements & sources of monies in a shadowy business structure. Was never going to anything else. Leave it to the Police. #marr #Brexit #ArronBanks
Yvette Cooper says Labour's position on #Brexit is the correct one. If @JolyonMaugham is consistent, he will now accuse Cooper of being a hard-left ideologue. I won't hold my breath. #Ridge
No, she hasn't! The treacherous witch is simply calling complete surrender a 'deal'. This will simply mean they agree to say we've left, while in fact we #Remain  The #Brexit betrayal I predicted when the Tory elite chose the Maybot is now all too clear
#Marr HartleyBrewer makes ridiculous claim that it’s theEU that is forcing Britain to have another referendum on #Brexit1. It can’t 2. The demand for a public vote on the deal comes from British citizens, because Brexit is turning out to be very different from what was promised 
A hedge fund executive who produced a feature-length Brexit film encouraging Britons to vote leave in the 2016 EU referendum is charged with committing a fraud of more than £500,000.If convicted, he's another crook backing #Brexit. #PeoplesVote #FBPE
Thanks for posting this. Part of my contribution to #Brexit debate at Labour conference where I try to nail the lie that the choice will be May’s bum deal & no deal. #peoplesvote
We should turn Westminster into a museum and stuff the dinosaurs that reside within it. They're not fit for purpose.Introduce PR and build a modern circular parliament without taxpayer-subsidised bars.Drag this country into the 21st century and that includes stopping #Brexit.
Consider the outrage at Iraq dodgy dossier and look at the stench around Theresa May.1. #windrush and collapse of the home office.2. #brexit decision belongs to her. She’s subverted parliament and blocked vital criminal investigations.3. She continues to trick country. 
Don’t for one minute think #may’s horrible deal will see the end of #Brexit toxicity on the country. The easiest way to free ourselves is to #stopbrexit and celebrate the many advantages of EU membership.
Yvette Cooper on her frustrations with Govt's chaotic Brexit negotiations - "We shouldn't be forced into no-deal or bad deal" #Brexit #Ridge
Gisela Stuart - "I would say to Remainers, just as Leavers would have accepted the result, they should work together in the national interest."If the main political parties don’t abide by the rules, i.e. implementing that mandate, voters will turn their back on us." #Brexit 
Tony Blair is urging all MPs to vote down whatever #Brexit deal Theresa May presents to parliament and to push instead for another referendum, warning that if they fail to do so there will be a backlash from voters that will last a political lifetime. 
I don't think they'll go for a full “EU is our friend” uturn, but they'll run a lot of interference+Banks stories.If they turn and get May to do so too then Corbyn will be left holding the #Brexit bag.  May will hold an election with confidence after the #PeoplesVote.4/5
Theresa May will do as she's told by Murdoch & the usual suspects, & dimwits will do as they're told by the tabloids as usual.  If they turn then #Brexit is as good as over.I suspect Farage will be immune from tabloid prosecution in exchange for feeding incriminating info.3/5
The Cabinet cannot endorse @Theresa_May’s #Chequers-based Article 50 Withdrawal Agreement. It’s against the @Conservatives manifesto & every #Brexit pledge she has given.This  is a very bad deal.MPs must #ChuckChequers
It is, I fear, time to address some legal questions surrounding the referendum - and say a couple of things none of the two #Brexit sides want to hear (thread) 
“The right #Brexit deal”-in that statement from John McDonnell the reason why #Labour can expect no support from me.. How long for it to sink in that there is NO right deal?No deal better than we have? That the “will of the people” obtained via a corrupted ref is changing?
Why are #Brexiters up in arms about the UK entering a new #CU arrangement with the #EU. This is part of the negotiations, just like securing citizens rights and agreeing the outstanding liabilities. The ballot paper didn't not detail the technical aspects of #Brexit, get over it.
Why remainers don't want democracy.#Brexit 
HUGE:City watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority joins investigation into Arron Banks’s wealth and source of #brexit donations 
When are we going to have some weekend #Brexit FlashMobs?Central London needs one to bring it to a halt for half a day.Jeremy Corbyn needs one outside his house.A couple of thousand people should do it.#StopBrexit#PeoplesVote
Finally...forget the gagging...the Govt has sought to evade scrutiny & supress dissenting voices. It's time business shot down the #Brexit BS & the People were finally told the Truth the Whole Truth and Nothing but the Truth.Then we must have a #PeoplesVote & a #Remain option
And the man who got elected off the back of promising a #Brexit Referendum 
The Banks saga changes nothing - we still have to leave the EU. #Brexit #ArronBanks
I would remind everyone of this report. @UKLabour needs to oppose this hapless Government, they must oppose a directionless, ill-considered #Brexit. I believe they can only do that by ousting @jeremycorbyn who seems hell-bent on breaking up the EU.
Get used to this The Tory Gov will label everything British after #Brexit, regardless of wghere it came from .... In this case it's Chicken from Thailand Yep, that's what I said. 
I won’t believe any bit of paper the Prime Minister waves at us claiming a #Brexit “deal”. Not worth paper written on, nowhere near what promised, and she’s unlikely to survive much longer in No10 to deliver it. Desperate stuff. Time for @peoplesvote_uk
If anyone needs to understand the significance to #Brexit of what the NCA are investigating re #ArronBanks read this Daily Mail opinion piece from Peter Oborne, who’s no friend of Remainers.It’s time for a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay via @MailOnline
When the letter from ‘business leaders’ calling for a second referendum comes out tomorrow morning, look at the names carefully. Are they Leave voters changing their minds in good faith or the vocal remain establishment trying (again) to reverse a vote they lost? #brexit
The Tories claim Scotland's getting £950m extra cash. That's simply not the truth! It's actually a £1.9bn real terms reduction in the Scottish Budget. Let me illustrate how a Tory Budget works with Stewie from Family Guy! | #Scotref #Indyref #Budget2018 #Brexit 
Owen what the hell? You just insisted bots don’t exist and there’s been no influence at all across social media. Then you tweet this. You are VERY hard to take seriously. Cause #Brexit is serious. But just stuff for your blog. Or stuff 
#Brexit has really exposed the true characters of so-called "moderates". It's not a pretty sight. Maugham, Grayling, Marsan, Robinson, Barber. All thoroughly nasty pieces of work. 
Sky "Theresa May has secured concessions from the EU for the whole of the UK to stay in a customs union post #Brexit"I think you mean the EU has secured concessions from May.Creative  reporting of the facts, as ever.

The EU uses foreign cash to influence your opinion. Well, it’s foreign cash if you’re a net recipient of another country’s money. If you’re a net contributor then they’re basically using your own hard earned taxes on telling you what to think. Roll on #Brexit.

More than 70 business leaders have signed a letter to the Sunday Times calling for a public vote on the UK's Brexit deal. #PeoplesVote #Brexit
Great point by @alan_firth_ headline from @bbclaurak makes you think this is coming from some authorative Brexit source - it's not, it's purely her opinionLaura K is not reporting the news, she's trying to drive opinion"Nothing to detail #Brexit here"
As far as I am concerned the #Brexit vote should be void as fraudulent. But the most important reason to fight #Brexit is that it will hurt the poorest the hardest. I hope I won him over. It's obvious we still have a lot of work to win all Remainers over to back a #PeoplesVote
"Business for a People's Vote" calls for 2nd referendum on #Brexit. Please remind them the people have already voted. PS they talk of a "slump in investment". Business investment in 2018Q2 was 0.2% lower than a year earlier (ONS).  
During the 45 years or so that I have been following UK politics, I have seen nothing remotely like the torrent of lies that have poured from the #Brexit right. This is not ordinary political dishonesty, it is lying on a scale that threatens democracy as such.#PeoplesVote
READ: More than 70 business leaders demand a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal: 
Time has come  for the 17.4m to boycott EU products and services because the EU is trying to stop #Brexit.
Let there be no doubt: Media and Bankers committed political terrorism during and after the #Brexit vote. They sought fear to control policy. They belong in jail. We should change our laws to allow for the death penalty for economic and political terrorists. 
Great @OFOCBrexit event in #Darlington today  lovely to sit alongside @Femi_Sorry on the panel. It's really important we have these discussions about #Brexit at a time when the national political debate has been toxified by elites with corrupt agendas #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
Yet more support for a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit The momentum for a #FinalSay referendum with an option to #Remain so we can #ExitFromBrexit is becoming unstoppable.
Absolutely correct. Their opinion is THEIR OPINION.. nothing more.. What matters is #EUREF where 52% of U.K.  Citizens voted #Brexit
I love Cornwall: great place, great people, great pasties. It’s our national treasure.But Cornwall has been badly let down by the lies spun in the name of #Brexit.So I made this vid for @Cornwall4EU. Share it if you think Cornwall deserves a #peoplesvote.

In 2016 Boris Johnson waved a Cornish pasty around in Truro from the steps of the infamous #Brexit Bus.But this Eton Mess of a Brexit was sold on lies - and it spells bad news for #Cornwall and our pasties.#PeoplesVote
A fantastic day with our #brexitomter and #WriteThisWrong campaign in the #Nottingham Over 270 postcards sent, and a real shift in mood.Leavers and remainers alike are frustrated with the stink of corruption around #brexit.#peoplesvote@peoplesvote_uk
Genuine question for any #Brexiter out there.It's now clear Russia helped fund the #Brexit #Leave campaign. Do you think it did so: a) because it's beneficial for the UK to leave the EU.or b) because it's bad for the UK to leave the EU.
Russia supported #Brexit objects to our WTO schedules as do 20 other countries Argentina will  use WTO objections 2 get the Falklands which every leave voter knows they will do.   I would like to ask leavers what other blackmail will other countries subject us to
The potential is that Russian money was used illegally to influence a very tight #Brexit result in its final stages,as part of a broader anti west campaignHow could anyone of conscience,integrity or patriotism possibly say that this doesn't matter?This is how far we've fallen 
Never mind 'not one job' lost to #Brexit Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, you will be complicit in all the lives lost.And before any of your 'what can he do?' faithful get on my case, don't bother. You helped this to happen Mr Corbyn, this rests on your shoulders too.
It is completely wrong, wrong, wrong to give a huge public platform to people accused of criminality. And in the context of #Brexit it is a blatant political act by our national broadcaster @BBC @AndrewMarr9 @darrenpjones @MollyMEP
Why isn’t this the number 1 item on the news; why isn’t @JeremyCorbyn all over it like a rash; why isn’t @Theresa_May making statements & denials - and why hasn’t @MichelBarnier said we have to get this sorted before #Brexit continues? Any answers? #ofoc #fs #fbie #StopBrexit
The @ScotTories have however betrayed the whole of Scotland by supporting Westminster on #Brexit .  Scotland voted to remain in the EU.  The Tories have completely ignored us & are will do huge damage to our economy, industry and society 
Now that we're a mere 146 days from #Brexit.It's time to get the important stuff sorted.Biggest problem is...Do you invite any Remoaners to your #Brexit party? Don't want to leave them out, but man that'll dampen proceedings.
I'm thinking of writing a spin off series to "Auf Wiedersehen, Pet" in which a group of English construction workers can't land German work visas after #brexit and end up picking turnips on a Lancashire farm for minimum wage instead.Calling it "Oh Shit, Pet". @petertimmins3

How the #DUP & Tory pact#Brexit & current state of the political process was viewed in yesterday's New York Times
The best deal with the EU is the deal we currently have. And the Govt has failed to deliver the promised “deal”. The negotiations are about the Wdrawal Agreement we are set to #Leave with no future trade deal in place. No one voted for a blindfold #Brexit @peoplesvote_uk
Looks like the Tories are on the verge of getting a grubby deal with the European Union that will make us a rule taker. A @jeremycorbyn-led Labour Government trumps any #Brexit - our MPs must vote down any Tory deal!  
.@nealerichmond talking w authority & knowledge @BBCr4today as opposed @OwenPaterson who just can’t face up to #BrexitReality Only a Customs Union and Single Market can prevent return of a hard border in Ireland. It will also be the best #Brexit outcome for British business.

Well said @Keir_Starmer#Brexit is the biggest mess our country has faced for decades.But if the Shadow Cabinet endorses a #PeoplesVote, you can help lead us out of this.

Remainers latest ploy to stop #brexit is to crowd fund taking #Brexit to court: ''because cheaters don't keep their prize'' (referencing @Arron_banks investigation).These people are never going to stop-their only 'reason d'être' is stopping the democratic will of majority in UK.
Merkel's departure, Banks' investigation, and Cameron's shed. This week's #ScotlandInEurope bulletin is here, full of the latest #Brexit news and updates. 
The far right looked down on the #PeoplesVoteMarch, the far left ignored itTories push tax cuts for the well off, the leftist commentators said "it's a tax cut for the 95%"Now @Owenjones84 is gaslighting, saying worrying about possible criminal #Brexit activity is "ludicrous" 
Each week Leavers of Britain will be setting a task for our followers and members. It will appear like below, with a small manageable task for individuals or groups to accomplish each week that promotes the #Brexit Britain we want to live in. Keep an eye out! 
Ask yourself what @Owenjones84 is trying to achieve hereHe knows that this is about fake news inserted into Facebook feeds.  He knows that social media creates bubbles.  He knows in fact that he's talking rubbishBut Corbyn doesn't want to look at #Brexit Leave corruption so.. 
To our US followers, This woman is our equivalent of Kathy Griffin, and has #Brexit derangement syndrome.That is all.
If EU could simply "compromise" on the Irish Border issue, when offered fishing rights as a sweetener, how was there EVER a problem which couldn't be resolved? Every single day #Brexit looks the correct choice to me, the EU are charlatans.

Could have the grandeur of a new fishing industrial age if we get a Clean #Brexit with no Transition & #ChuckChequersWe would automatically repatriate all our waters & resources with fair shares worth £1.4bn to the south coast alone.
Alternatively @GiselaStuart you may want to read this article from soldier Richard & watch the video within it? As you will see he voted leave but changed his mind as #brexit is not worth the risk. He was also @peoplesvotemarch. Do you believe him?11/n
.@GiselaStuart you may also want to see this tweet from @juliantblack. As he says he voted leave but he chsanged his mind a long time ago once he saw #brexit was missold & he was at #PeoplesVoteMarch with 5 family members? Does this change your belief?9/n
How about you look at this picture @GiselaStuart this looks like a guy who describes himself as a "reformed brexiteer" and he very much appears to be on the #PeoplesVoteMarch. Do you believe him?He is a #RemainerNow in light of #Brexit reality!#PeoplesVote #FinalSay 7/n
Any right, law or entitlement given to you by the EU was done so with power taken from you that it will never give back.#Brexit
My wife is thinking of buying some boots from Germany. To return them from a EU country is 12.50 Euros, but 30 Euros from a non-EU country. Just another small sign of the way in which #Brexit will reduce choice and increase costs for ordinary people. #PeoplesVote #FBPE
“British #services exports are considered a reasonable sacrifice as the price of achieving #Brexit. The sacrifice is considered acceptable because it allows the true prize – keeping the #Conservative party together” argues @AndDT
If Corbyn continues to be silent on Arron Banks then these photos of his Director of Communications ex-public schoolboy Seumas Milne receiving a handshake from Putin in Sochi in October 2014 will start to look like signs of something very significant.#Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE
As I've told the BBC, the Banks donation affair is bigger than #Brexit. It's about public trust in our democracy. Let's hope the @NCA_UK find the source of his money, and then let's focus on reforming the system. @fairvoteuk @electoralreform @ElectoralCommUK @carolecadwalla
“I don’t like this idea that the Irish are super fans of the EU… every time the Irish have been asked to vote on the expansion of the EU, they said: No thanks.” Brendan O’Neill of @spikedonline who hails from Irish ‘peasant stock’#Brexit #politicslive 
“It’s just consternation, confusion…. we get all British TV, we get all British media, so we know Britain way more than Britain knows Ireland. It’s like a valve that flows in one direction.” @andrewismaxwell on Irish knowledge of #Brexit#politicslive 
So @GiselaStuart maybe you do not believe that #RemainerNow @Will_DryOFOC was at the #PeoplesVoteMarch. In fact he now works full time fighting #brexit with @OFOCBrexit & was one of the thousands of young people leading the march. Here he explains why2/n

Trading standards staff on the frontline - read my latest @endthechaosuk blog on a report on how #Brexit will impact trading, e-Commerce, product safety, animal health and agriculture, travel law and intellectual property.  
Plus the World’s largest ferry has already begun operating from Dublin direct to the continent. Unlike the UK, the Irish Government is not sitting around resting on its laurels waiting to learn what may or may not happen with #Brexit. Ireland is prepared:
At Warrenpoint Port where @DominicRaab is making his first border visit. Sinn Fein reps incl @ChrisHazzardSF aren’t happy at the secrecy that has shrouded this trip. “Dominic Raab is like a thief in the night”, he says #Brexit

Even before yesterday’s news about the investigation into #VoteLeave , the @LSEpoliticsblog concluded that fraud in the referendum means #Brexit is voidable and Article 50 can be revoked: 
Arlene Foster wrote this piece about NI, #Brexit & #backstop last week:My long letter in response is published in @impartialrep this week. Not easy to read in this image (apologies).But at least it comes with a calming photo of Tullydermot Waterfall.
This is a very serious allegation which will require comment from @theresa_may #brexit #arronbanks #FBPE #peoplesvote
Remember Me ? I was the one that gave you all #brexit and resigned the very next day.... Well you will all be happy to know, that I'm coming back .... Just rejoice at that news @BBCNews @bbclaurak @bbcnickrobinson #r4today
Never forget. This man asked people to vote on #Brexit. Without defining what Brexit meant. Without carrying out any projections of consequences. All in an (unsuccessful) attempt to settle an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all his mates and f***ed off into the sunset. 
It’s as if Ireland and France are remaining in the same Union adhering to the same set of rules and the UK is not? #brexit 
So @BBCr4today at last has @carolecadwalla on, to talk about her tireless investigations into the #Brexit vote. Too little too late. And the story is still not receiving the prominence it deserves.
The Irish attitude to #Brexit in a nutshell. "An editor of one Irish newspaper put it even more bluntly. “I don’t give a f*ck about Brexit, good luck to you. But just don’t f*ck us over. If that border goes up, I’m telling you there will be hell.”" 
Desperate statements from Leavers on Twitter "Banks didnt influence *me*, I made my own mind up on #Brexit"a) half the country still believe the £350 M lieb) potentially, Russian money was used illegally in an election,if that doesn't bother you what kind of "patriot" are you? 
When even Piers Morgan suggests the 2016 #Brexit vote might be void, you know something has changed.There is no reason for a single Labour MP to be complicit in allowing Brexit to happen. No more caution, time to unequivocally back a #PeoplesVote and campaign to #Remain
The tip of the iceberg? We have calculated that post #Brexit overseas #NHS staff recruitment costs could rise to £490 million: 
This is going to sound strange but bear with me...I’m starting to think many media loud Leavers secretly want #brexit cancelled.The economy won’t suffer so they won’t get the blame - but they will be able to live off & monetize the “betrayal myth” for years to come.
Wonderfully put.  We negotiate in our business lives all the time and are appalled at the incompetence of Theresa's govt.  Well said, @TheCity4Britain Distinctive daily #Brexit research & news:

Liberal Democrats want to overturn the biggest democratic mandate in history. Their donations have tried up and they face a funding crisis. Clear message hear is that opposing #Brexit is NOT popular 
UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) opens probe into major #Brexit campaigner Arron Banks and the  campaign group 
"Eight million pounds is a small price to pay for a military superpower for the break-up of the EU, a rival alliance"@DailyMailUK hits the nail on the #BrexitHead and it's high time a forensic criminal financial investigation took place.
Laura works for @BBCNews, an organisation that for two years has refused to countenance any opposition to #brexit at all. It's as if the 48% ( and growing ) never existed. The @BBC might not survive the enquiry that will follow this corruption.
The BBC's analysis of #Brexit has been shallow, faulty and limited during every step of the process. @BBCr4today has been one of the worst offenders and it's belligerent partisanship often makes it unlistenable to these days.
Curious about the Backstop? As  continues to tick on #Brexit - lots of mention on all things backstop incl. ‘all-weather, backstop to the backstop,’ etc. @EU_Commission TF50 handy info graphic explainer on the EU’s Backstop proposal worth having a look at again...
If it is true that Theresa May stopped the intelligence services from investigating Banks in 2016 because of sensitivity about the #Brexit referendum, the Prime Minister has serious questions to answer. 
Well, I got the important part right. As you know from my book, The Road to Ruin, global elites don't need conspiracies; being like-minded works just as well. But, if @TheEconomist urges a new #Brexit vote also, I'll be looking for the helicopters. 
Remain cheated for decades. Now we take back what is ours. #Brexit #ArronBanks
Watch @Andrew_Adonis's brilliant speech to a packed audience in Penzance, #Cornwall tonight.Main message: #Brexit is collapsing under the weight of its own contradictions & false promises. But there is a way out of this mess: a #PeoplesVote.

This is a government that sees democracy as a barely tolerable inconvenience. In 45 years of watching politics I've never seen a government so contemptuous of democracy. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE
Another of this appalling government's #Brexit attacks on democracy. It is absolutely clear that Theresa May regards democracy as something best avoided.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Russian trolls used Islamophobia to whip up support for #Brexit. And of course their message was backed up by Islamophobic propaganda in the Brexit billionaire press.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
So they admitted the claims they made were lies, they have stopped talking about any upside and now the main Leave donor is being investigated as to the legality of the source of the campaign money. How much more will it take to halt this fiasco? #PeoplesVote #Brexit #ArronBanks

Bob Moran on #Brexit #NoDealBrexit #ww1centenary - political cartoon gallery in London 
The best way divisions over #Brexit can be healed is to have a full & thorough independent inquiry into the funding of BOTH the Leave and Remain campaigns. A full audit. No one who supports transparency in UK politics could possibly object to this. Please RT if you agree.
All the signs are that Theresa May is going to try and bounce a load of #Brexit fudge through the Cabinet and Parliament on the basis that ‘any deal is better than no deal’. #PeoplesVote essential to give #FinalSayontheDeal with option to #ExitFromBrexit and #Remain
The moral of this story, it seems, is the same as #Brexit—you can’t have any Remainers in charge of any aspect of the process, because they will find a way to subvert it. 
Together with 9 of my Council colleagues, I have written to @birmingham_live expressing serious concern about the damage that #brexit will do to #Birmingham - setting out reasons why we need a #FinalSay #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk @Another_Europe @LabPeoplesVote
Lord Tebbit - "The Commission and Monsieur Barnier has no intention whatsoever of coming to any reasonable agreement with this country under the terms of the treaty."Therefore, he is mucking the place about while we are trying to do an honest job." #Brexit 
Followed the Arron Banks story on both @BBCNews and @Channel4News. There is simply no contest: C4 offered forensic and far more challenging coverage, not shying away from political sensitivities about the #Brexit referendum result.
I just wrote to my MP sharing the news (in case he missed it) that Banks is finally being Investigated. The #brexit ref result is more than unsafe - it's corrupt. I urge each and every one of you to do the same: #writethiswrong let's #stopbrexit
Spiked's @Tom_Slater_ says Chequers is a betrayal of the leave vote, a BRINO. #Brexit 
really, really would be interested in answers from Corbyn supporters on this.  Does Corbyn and his FB have to have a majority in HoP before they can comment on possible illegal Ref activity?Is he so scared of Northern Leavers he has to give #Brexit criminal activity a free pass? 
Raab has to row-back on claims of #Brexit deal by Nov. Leavers cannot stop spreading false news. Truth is a #PeoplesVote is gaining traction daily and they are worried
I think I speak for virtually all leavers when I say Tony Blair and John Major did a million times more to influence my #Brexit vote than Arron Banks or Vote Leave.
All coming out in the #Brexit boil wash now. Heath took us illegally into the Common Market and lied about the implications, Major bounced us into Maastricht and lied about the implications, now #TreasonMay seeks to seal our fate by keeping us tied to the EU in perpetuity.
I'm not sure there's any indication that the NCA won't be able to investigate thoroughly......the main problem is that the #brexit process ploughs on regardless.How about we #suspendA50 while we sort out the mess?
.@NCA_UK has launched investigation into @Arron_Banks and others over alleged criminal offences in the #Brexit referendum. Allegations of overspending and corruption are grounds to declare the #EUReferendum void, says law expert Dr Ewan McGaughey. Article:

Banks referred to the National Crime Agency to investigate if his money came from "other sources" & now Farage "upgraded"I know a lot of #Brexit supporters will just shrug this off, like you seem to shrug off everythingBut really, you need to take a good look at yourselves 
How implicated is the @BBCNews in the events surrounding @Arron_banks ? They pulled an episode of Panorama and hardly reported on the Cambridge Analytica case . Sweeping it all under the carpet so as not to upset #Brexit ? Surely not.
WATCH: James voted leave in 2016 but is now demanding a #PeoplesVote on the #brexit deal. @RemainerNowJoin James and write to your MP to #WriteThisWrong and demand a #PeoplesVote on the #brexit deal: 
Isn't there a principle that people shouldn't benefit from their crime? If we don't #StopBrexit, how will the crooks that paid for #Brexit be stopped from making £millions by betting against UK economy & currency?
The Tories risk endangering lives in the communities on the Irish border for their ideological #Brexit. They are clearly incapable of finding a solution. The people must have be given the final say, with an option to remain in the EU. #ExitFromBrexit
The guy's a liar..EU citizens don't have the Right to #Remain here in perpetuity as members of the EU. Our Govt has failed to exercise the 3mth rule which is part of EU Law.You're bloody useless at picking up on the #Brexit BS. These charlatans are let off the hook all the time 
My hot take on Aaron Banks. Brexiters should be furious at the scumbag for bringing the validity of their victory into disrepute.But they aren't, because they're just as happy as him to take victory illegitimately. #Brexit
BIG news re Russia’s role in #Brexit: Britain just opened a *criminal* investigation into financiers of Leave EU campaign, suspected of being part of a Kremlin influence operation. Tremendous work from indefatigable investigative journalist @carolecadwalla
Big lies, rabid nationalism, xenophobia, scapegoating of minorities, grandiosity, irrationalism, anti-intellectualism and the "Will of the People", are all key elements of fascism peddled incessantly by #Brexit press and politicians. Democracy needs a #PeoplesVote!#StopBrexit
Remain also had the advantage of spending £9m on a leaflet drop to all households persuading us to vote #Remain and used our money to pay for it!  Now that really is criminal. #Brexit
For those in America who might not be paying attention: Aaron Banks started the #Brexit thing with a well financed campaign. Apparently, the money came from... Russia? Why would Russia want Brexit?Same reason they want to destabilize the United States. Chaos means they win.

Finally, we get the truth from @thesnp - there is NO power grab from the Scottish Parliament after #Brexit The SNP should focus on facts The SNP should stop the grievance politics and work with everyone to get the best deal for Scotland and all of the UK.  
A mention in the East Lothian Courier @elcourier for the #Brexit survey at our street stall.  This was our first small sample survey and we’ll keep at it over the coming months. As we increase the sample size we can also measure any shift in opinion in #NorthBerwick.
Former #BBC reporter asks the question that current BBC reports hesitate to:  does the referral to the National Crime Agency (not just the Met - more serious) to investigate allegations of illegality by the #Leave campaign, mean that the #Brexit process should be put on hold? 
A few yrs ago, if asked what I believed 'made' the UK, I'd have said its diversity and inclusitivity, its willingness to progress, and its leadership qualities on a global stage. #Brexit and its supporters changed what it means to be British, not us. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Me and @Femi_Sorry will be in #Darlington on Saturday 3-5pm to talk #BrexitCome join us!@OFOCBrexit @NE4EU
This is the news we've been waiting for We've got to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible because if the #Brexit referendum was bought, if the law was broken, if foreign money was involved then the people deserve to know & deserve a #PeoplesVote
@jeremycorbyn you need to talk to her. The consequences of this go way beyond #brexit.
Key sentence from NCA on Arron Banks: ‘the potential for offences to have been committed other than under electoral law lead us to consider an NCA investigation appropriate in this instance.’Chink of light at end of #Brexit tunnel just got a bit brighter
Arron Banks has been referred to the National Crime Agency, this is serious, we already know Vote Leave have been referred to the Police, #Brexit must now be suspended pending the outcome of these inquiries, it cannot go ahead with possible criminal charges to come #PeoplesVote
For politicians who care about having a mandate, who care that  democracy is and is seen to be untainted, it is neither credible nor desirable to just sweep this away.  Time to take stock and stop the ticking clock. #Brexit.

Due to blatant lies and cheating during the 2016 EU Referendum campaign (and because we’re now better informed) - should there now be another vote to decide if we should actually stay in the European Union? #Brexit
Labour MP @helenhayes_ has called for #Brexit to be halted in the light of serious allegations of criminality affecting the integrity of the 2016 referendum. We completely support her call.All political parties need to recognise that trust in democracy is now at stake #StopBrexit
And *particular* praise for @carolecadwalla who has been utterly relentless in the face of huge pressure - investigative journalism at its *very* best. #AaronBanks #Brexit 
I don't care.It really is that simple.The govt used £9m of OUR bloody money to send propaganda leaflets to all of us, trying to con us into voting Remain, merely DAYS before purdah.This is irrelevant crap & mere fodder for industrial-strength whinging.148 days until #Brexit. 
Would now be a good time for the @UKLabour leadership to stop "respecting" the result of a fraudulent and probably illegal referendum campaign way back in 2016?@jeremycorbyn & co now have a good reason to actually oppose #brexit.
This is BIG. Please RT so everyone knows. Well done to @BenPBradshaw and all those who have relentlessly been fighting for the truth. Another reason why it’s absolutely crucial we have @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit #AaronBanks 
17.4 million people didnt vote for #Brexit because of Aaron Banks. This man is irrelevant and this is no reason to stop Brexit. the People knew what they voted for so lets get on with it.
As details continue to emerge on dark money and practices involved in the 2016 #Brexit referendum, it is clear that politicians must #LetThePeopleDecide with a clean vote on the real options to #EndTheChaos. More as we get it...
Prominent Leave supporter Arron Banks has been referred to National Crime Agency over "very serious allegations" about #Brexit campaign funding, explains @BBCNormanSMore on : 
Misleading press articles today on #Brexit & financial services.  Reminder: EU may grant and withdraw equivalence in some financial services autonomously. As with other 3rd countries, EU ready to have close regulatory dialogue with UK in full respect for autonomy of both parties.
The UK is ranked the 8th least corrupt country in the world. But Greece and Romania are 59th, Hungary 66th and Bulgaria 71st - worse than many Third World nations. No wonder EU funds keep going missing.  #Brexit
For all the silly people who think that #Brexit had nothing to do with hiding money from scrutiny.If UK hadn’t declared its Article 50 intention to leave the EU on the date it did - the UK would be subject to the Tax Avoidance Directive, instead it’s leaving 2 days before.
#Brexit will damage Scotland. 59% of Scots want a #PeoplesVote, 63% want to stay in EU. This is the background to today’s launch of @Scotland4PV #Scotland4PV

#Brexit FURY rises: Petition to STOP second referendum gains more than 100,000 signatures

Trinity College Dublin ‘devastated’ by #Brexit, as it highlights decline in Northern Ireland students; college publishes open letter in @FT urging ‘prudence, deliberation and foresight’ - @IrishTimes 
MPs must show their colours. May's government quite clear about #Brexit it wants.There must be NO barriers to movement of cross-border capital flows. But there must be strict, inhumane barriers to movement of labour. How many will support May's Brexit?
An Open Letter on Brexit from Trinity College Dublin in the @FT today:  #FutureofEurope #Brexit 
And to think, the plummeting value of Sterling post #Brexit vote was supposed to help UK manufacturing.Another Leave myth busted... 
Anyone heard from a #Leaver who's been able to explain how they'll benefit from #Brexit? All I get is taking back control, sovereignty, making laws, controlling immigration etc...all of which the UK already had whilst a member of the EU.

I do find it astonishing that this is presented as news. If what is agreed is standard 3rd country equivalence and not something better then this is not a triumph. It’s not financial passporting, and it comes with strict requirements. #Brexit 
British PM Theresa May has struck a tentative deal with the #EU that would continue to give #UK financial services companies access to European markets after #Brexit, The Times reports 
Great to see @Royal_Greenwich council supporting a #PeoplesVote. More and more people are demanding a #PeoplesVote on the #brexit deal. 
So, the Home Secretary, the Immigration Minister, the Permanent Secretary in charge of immigration and others make completely contradictory statements in evidence to parliamentary committees on what happens if a no deal. Beyond appalling. #Brexit #immigration
Scotland didn't vote for #Brexit and polling shows a majority back a #PeoplesVotePoliticians in Westminster have made a mess of negotiations.Join the campaign to give Scotland a voice in this process and demand a say on the Brexit deal!  
British Pound rallies on #Brexit optimism. Times of London reported a tentative deal that will give UK's fin service comps access to EU markets after Brexit. 
Are you listening @UKLabour? You appear to be ignoring an open goal. You seem to have abandoned party democracy. By holding out for #Brexit you are making sure you never get elected. Please reconsider full support for #PeoplesVote.

UK, EU agree tentative Brexit deal on financial services: The Times -- Deal would give UK financial services companies continued access to European markets after #Brexit 
If we don't win the House back next week ima need a Canadian to marry me.I'd ask an Aussie but fuck spiders and snakes.I'd ask a Brit but you got your own problems #Brexit I'd ask an Irishman but 
Hahahaha they are so absolutely fucked. British Home Affairs has absolutely no idea what their national security posture will look like after #brexit, and they only have five months to work it out. 
When watching the scenes in this clip of the baby at 25 weeks, consider that in Britain abortion is legal up to 24 weeks.I just don't understand how intelligent people could defend such a law when confronted with this. Can you @stellacreasy? #Brexit or not, Britain is lost. 
2 minute explanation by Dr Levatino of the abortion procedure between 14 and 24 weeks. Just to reiterate, abortion here in Britain is legal up to 24 weeks, but illegal in Northern Ireland.@bpas1968#NowforNI#prochoice#Brexit#brexitshambles
remarkable image: fast-track for Irish trucks into France while ours are still sitting for days in queues half-way across Kentwhile in the comments someone suggests that French supermarkets might threaten English shops' dominance in Ireland#brexit - no downside?
Can you give a couple of examples how your life will improve if #Brexit happens?
Sick to death of her. The abuse of the English language shows the contempt she has for REAL DEMOCRACY.Every word she utters every act to subvert #Brexit accountability resonates with Autocracy.26.5% gives no one the Right to claim the Will of the Ppl. 
As much as #Brexit has exposed the structural defects in our politics,  I strongly suspect it will do likewise with much else... and that's at least half the point of it.
I was responsible for #Brexit and my #Tory chums at the newspapers have managed to persuade the plebs that #Corbyn is to blame,ho ho ha ha, and still the silly fuckers vote for us, ho ho ha ha #ToryBritain pic.twitter.com/XxkEVwXUKz
I enjoyed speaking @Trinity_U this afternoon. There was tremendous interest there in the implications of #Brexit for Ireland. I highlighted the fact that the UK’s exit from EU would make Ireland a more attractive European location for US investment. 
Theresa May seals #Brexit deal on financial services - The Times 
#Brexit #UK PM May strikes Deal with #EU on financial services, Times reports.: GBP higher by 0.15%
UK is now a #bananaRepublic #dictatorship #Brexit Under #TheresaMay This is dangerous. Parliament should be sovereign. She will walk all over the British constitution in her stilettos to get her own way. Why? What is her motivation?
As opposed to all the #Brexit opposing MPs who have done so much to oppose Brexit. #ToryRebellion #RockingHorseShit
After #Brexit those top earners will abandon the UK, take their companies & jobs with them and not pay UK tax at all.  They won't have a choice if they want to continue to operate.This is one of many reasons why the Labour manifesto is completely uncosted while Brexit is in it.
Is the end in sight? #GBPUSD rallies as #Brexit Secretary Raab says a deal between #Britain and EU expected within 3 weeks. Sterling may rally if a deal can be agreed in November but markets will take a wait-and-see approach with further volatility expected.#FX #FOREX #Currency
.⁦@theresa_may⁩ refuses to guarantee medicine supply under 'no-deal' #BrexitSo people, me included, may literally die bcos of her incompetence over Brexit?Anyone want to bet Mrs May won’t be running out of the insulin she needs?But others will 
I'm not skeptical of a European Union, if it were democraticI'm against the undemocratic @EU_CommissionI love the Europe, but I loathe the European governmentIt is the people of Europe who are our friends, not some un-elected politicians in #Brussels#Brexit #EU (#UE) Now!
@GdnPolitics It is difficult to imagine @theresa_may surviving as Prime Minister if she chose to ignore a majority vote in the @HouseofCommons for any alternative to a #Brexit deal, including a '#PeoplesVote' #Referendum. However, I doubt there would be a majority for that.
The whole of the United Kingdom has been converted into a virtual reality Titanic sailing wilfully towards the iceberg namedBrexit.We watch on in stupefied horror.#brexit 
Not really! Left-wing #Remainers, Centrist-Remainers & Right-wing Remainers will never reconcile themselves with #Brexit because they fundamentally don't understand why working people voted, at the risk of jeopardising their own economic interests, #Leave and to #Brexit the #EU.
Just found this competition to #win a #Brexit Stockpile (believe it or not!). Help me win! Click on my link to help me out... 
Will English cease to be an official language of Europe should #Brexit take place?

#brexit is discussed everyday. Not one positive comprehensive assessment showing us the benefits only to the contrary. Does anyone else think #brexit might be a bad idea? 
From  review in  ST of Eternal Boy' bio of Kenneth Grahame 'what it celebrates is a quintessentially English..... refusal of the real, a quiescence that is almost mystical'. H'mm? #Brexit anyone??

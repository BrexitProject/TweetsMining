Jeremy Corbyn couldn't be clearer. Labour seeks a Workers' Brexit. If we don't get it, we'll vote against it.  
When asked for the biggest benefit of Brexit, this Leave voter managed to come up with…fish and chips  
Stop hating Labour for Brexit for a moment and check out this Labour Peer luving himself for killing off a highly progressive tax rise.  
This response by @KellyMarieLD is exactly the fighting sprit we need to limit the harm caused by May triggering Brexit.

Liberal moderates currently in all parties need to coalesce around @LibDems if May & her 'ultras' and their Brexit mess are to be defeated.  
We're being pushed into the most extreme and irreversible form of Brexit by people who neither believe in or want it. 
Theresa May wrote a Brexit letter and it has already become a meme

Obviously Big Gav is huge news but even I'm surprised that my exit from Bristol or #brexit as it's known has attracted such huge controversy 
To the various people supporting Labour’s approach to Brexit who are arguing with me: yes, I know your point of view….. I just disagree. 
Clear #BBC will conduct campaign over next 2 years to induce either bad Brexit deal or Ref reversal.Colours now openly nailed to #EU mast 
Theresa May has no mandate for the extreme Brexit she's pursing & we will fight it every step of the way.  
It's devastating being dragged into hard Tory #Brexit. Worse, it's happening thanks to a pissing contest between two bloated Etonian egos. 
Europe's top politicians just completely ruined Theresa May's attempted Brexit launch  
This is v good for anyone interested in Brexit. Great interview from @afneil. PM has no plan and he picked apart masterfully. Top journalism

#Brexit is an implicit rejection of Progressivism, which started with good intentions, but became a tyranny. The British despise tyranny.

And he's off! Sir Tim Barrow and the letter. #Article50 #brexit  
Love the Sunderland fisherman, asked on #bbcr4today if they're all talking about Brexit today: "No. We've got bigger fish to worry about". 
Celebrate Brexit today whilst simultaneously punching yourself in the face and patting yourself on the back. 
And the best Brexit deal will be a worse deal than Britain already has in the European Union. No getting away from that 
Brexit was an opportunity for London to demonstrate its commitment to a Union of equals. They chose to go full East India Company. 
Post Brexit, the average British family will be worse off by 50 shillings. 
You'd think they'd be celebrating today because they got what they wanted but no, they're still just being angry on Twitter. Weird.#brexit 
To those who have lied, abused & peddled hate to foist #Brexit on Britain, we will not forgive nor forget. You will be brought to account.

Genuinely puzzled by all those odd people who're so excited by Brexit. Seems to me like wanking over a telephone directory, basically dull 
Happy #Brexit Day everyone! Unless you voted Remain, like I did, because you're not a fucking idiot, in which case, this is the end #doom pic.twitter.com/JBPFIq8Cne 
Theresa May conveniently forgets that she supported Britain remaining in the EU.Here's a little reminder.#BrexitDay #Article50 #Brexit  
Brexit is a Westminster project. it's a disgrace how the British Gov has failed to include the Welsh, Scot and NI Govs as equal partners 
So many miserable faces on the media. BREXIT DAY! - It's a brave New World and a wonderful challenge we should relish. Time to pull together 
Whenever Theresa May says Brexit will be fine, remember she was a Remainer. The Prime Minister doesn't believe a word she says

Mrs May @theresa_may says it's time to put divisions aside and join with leavers in making a success of Brexit. It isn't going to happen.

Theresa May pledges to represent everyone in the Brexit negotiations. But in triggering Article 50, she's not even representing herself. 
Morning is always my favourite part of Article 50 Day, as children tiptoe nervously downstairs, eager to see what Papa Brexit has left them.

Brexit was an English vote for independence – you can’t begrudge the Scots the same & blocking it denies  democracy

I get that @ScotTories don't like 16/17 year olds & EU nationals. But shame on you @scottishlabour & @scotlibdems. #ScotRef #Brexit 
The greatest unquantifiable benefit of #Brexit will be Sovereignty. The re-establishment of the supremacy of our Parliament and our courts. 
29 March 1936. Adolf Hitler received 99% of the votes in a referendum to ratify Germany's illegal military reoccupation of the Rhineland.  
Can the Uk exit from #Brexit? Continue to hope so. Strongly believe #Scotland and #NorthernIreland referendum will change everything.

Yet again 'Britain' is being conflated with 'the UK' here - symptomatic of complete inattention to Northern Ireland throughout #Brexit mess.  
A day before Brexit is expected to formally begin, Scotland took another crucial step toward a departure of its own  
I campaigned to leave the EU, when it came to it. I think we'll do great future things post-Brexit. But departure is poignant, not joyful.+

What's best for the UK? Remaining in the EU. Therefore that will happen. #Brexit will be defeated. 
Thanks to our lying right-wing #Brexit billionaire press the British public is grossly misinformed on major issues  
We must hold the Tory government accountable for every single Brexit promise and not let up. They lied and split the country in 2. Shame. 
Happy Brexit Eve. Feeling poetical.  
The Brexit season is so commercialised nowadays. We must remember Brexit's true meaning: tension on earth and badwill to all men #BrexitEve 
Confront May. Ask her: Remainer before the referendum, gung-ho #Brexiter after: was she being dishonest then, or is she being dishonest now?

During the EU referendum campaign, Theresa May warned about the risks of Brexit and the likelihood of a Scottish independence referendum.  
A hard Brexit should not be imposed without Scotland being able to choose a different path, declared Nicola Sturgeon  
Imagine having a referendum without knowing what the future relationship between countries would look like.  
Scots elected a pro-Indy majority Scottish Parliament and they voted against Brexit. This has all occurred democratically. Tories in denial. 
Scots voted for SNP on basis that if Brexit occurred, there would be IndyRef2. If the Tories choose to ignore that, they ignore democracy. 
.@NicolaSturgeon: 'The mandate for a referendum is beyond question. It would be democratically indefensible to attempt to stand in the way.' 
Circumstances have changed since 2014. We have arrived at a second Scottish independence referendum through democratic means. Respect that. 
The Scottish parliament has just voted in favour of holding a second referendum on Independence. #IndyRef2 
The Scottish Parliament has voted Yes to a Scottish Referendum. Add your voice, sign the pedge now.  #ScotRef

Harsh reality is that Labour didn't stand against a hard Brexit when they had chance and their unelectability means federalism is a dream.

Imagine. Come end of September, pro-#EU leaders in power in NL, France, Germany. Far Right in retreat. #May realizes #Brexit wrong call. 
The reality is that Tories are trying to run out clock, bind Scotland to a hard Brexit that it didn't vote for, and deprive it of choice.

I'm 56 yr old Brit, too young to vote on entry, I patiently waited 40 yrs to vote Brexit. I loathe everything about anti democratic EU.

Everyone knows that if the SNP were allowed a second referendum and lost, they'd only devise some other ploy later on to call a third. No.

The 'stopping immigration' myth is probably the biggest bit of Brexit nonsense served up in the whole debate. #bbcqt

I think it's pretty arrogant of Sturgeon (who started as a non-elected FM) to ignore the result of a referendum with an 84% turnout.

BBCtv news leads on one pro Brexit MP defecting and nothing about thousands marching against Brexit so Tory MPs pressure is working 
#BBC NEWS still incessantly repeating the Carswell UKIP story and ignoring tens of thousands of people on #Brexit protest march. 
Due to the #EU we have: food stamps, terrorists, beheadings, rape gangs, NoGo areas on European soil#BrexitVote #AfD #FN #LePen#EU60 
Probably one of the best speeches against Brexit and pro-EU . I take my hat off to you Mr @gonzalezpons #brexit #EU  
Seems the much trumpeted @ScotTories revival is over no doubt due to @RuthDavidsonMSP screeching u turn on #Brexit & single market #ScotRef 
Theresa May, these people are *not* behind you and your Brexit plan. #UniteForEurope ###MarchForEurope 
Whether we end up in or out of the EU, the entire UK lost because of the hateful, deceitful Brexit campaign. That's why we marched.  
Still amazing. #CassetteBoy #brexit  
Tories got just 24% of the electorate in 2015. Then they ran away post Brexit May has no mandate from the British people to be in Downing St

In BBC News at One opening item on A50 date, *not one* mention of SNPGov/#ScotRef among range of Brexit challenges. Total #Britsteria. 
How do we survive Brexit without becoming a turnip-based economy? Our video, based on @IanDunt's book, tells all: 
The Govt has promised a #Brexit deal that will not damage our economy. They need to meet the tests they have set themselves. Ps RT:  
UK to trigger Brexit on March 29  by @mrseb 
ah I see the brexit article on wikipedia has been updated  
BREAKING : Britain Will Start Brexit Process on March 29  @3lectric5heep 
Pound falls after the U.K. confirms it'll trigger the Brexit process next week  
Folk rightly annoyed that the SNP weren't notified about Article 50 sooner. We were assured that we'd be kept properly informed about Brexit 
May claims she's working closely with ScotGov on Brexit, then leaves ScotGov's ministers to find out the Article 50 date from TV news. Eh?   
Listening to @BBCNews talking about the dangers of #Brexit you could imagine it was The European Broadcasting Company funded by the #EU@BBC 
Our @Stone_SkyNews confirms from his sources that April 6/7th "not going to happen" for EU27 Brexit response summit 
"You didn't give us notice on #IndyRef2"That's because, unlike Brexit, it's a matter for Scotland alone. 
PM's decision to trigger #Article50 & begin hard #Brexit will put her on the wrong side of history. People should have final say on the deal 
In ‘07 Tony Blair signed the Lisbon Treaty without a referendum. Now he wants to ignore the biggest mandate in British history.  
There's May & Ruth saying we should all be pulling together for Brexit and they can't be bothered informing devolved nations about it 
Can't wait for the 'EU are ruining our lovely Brexit by being meanies' phase to start. 
If @tom_watson & others could just stop fighting shadows & get on with stopping Theresa May dragging us to hard-Brexit. Cheers.#Article50 
Zut alors! Nicola’s double speak over Europe has got us all tongue-tied  #indyref2 #brexit

It was not some writ that a referendum is for life but an observation that perhaps an opportunity which might only occur once in a lifetime.

May is reportedly set to challenge Sturgeon to get a mandate for a second referendum at the 2021 Holyrood election.  
It's got to a point where barely anyone I know thinks Brexit can work. The government is working against the country's best interests. 
I'm English and I understand why Scotland want a second referendum. I frankly can't blame them. 
Hallelujah - Theresa May stands up for majority of Scotland by rejecting a divisive independence referendum.  
if you don't want a 2nd referendum, you shouldn't have voted for an SNP-Green majority. 
The SNP 'compromise"? We accept Brexit so long as we can stay in EU institutions.LOLZ. Utter garbage, #bbcqt

Here's Lord Heseltine classy response to Theresa May after being sacked for Brexit rebellion  
Theresa May tells Nicola Sturgeon: No new Scottish independence referendum for six years  
Calls for @RuthDavidsonMSP to explain her u-turn over whether UK Gvt constitutionally should block independence referendum. 
Excuse me Brian Taylor. The PM isn't blocking a referendum. Delay is sensible & responsible.Grow up. Raise your game.#pathetic 
'Now is not the time' is the new 'Brexit means Brexit'. And just as annoyingly anodyne. #ScotRef 
.@BristolPost interviews @timfarron re Metro Mayor election, saying it's between me & the Brexit backing Tory  
Blocking a referendum for which there is a democratic mandate is every bit as divisive as holding one. 
Theresa May - Scotland should not be allowed to have a referendum without knowing the details of the deal...?Irony much? 
The governments new #Brexit website got off to a bad start. It broke within minutes. Some symbolism going on here...   
Oh great! #bbcqt is on!Let me guess the agenda .@bbcquestiontime, more lies on the SNP & Brexit & still No mention of #ToryElectionFraud ! 
Perfect symbolism.The government have published their Brexit "Plan for Britain" website and it's already broken.  
"Hard Brexit" = the only sort that we voted for.Media shills who suggest there is a "soft Brexit" MEAN they want to stay in the EU. 
Can see possibility of Scotland's constitutional status being used as a bargaining chip by May and UK govt in Brexit negotiations with EU. 
It is a matter of constitutional reality that the power to hold a Referendum in any part of the UK resides with the UK Parliament. FACT. 
There's more people concerned with the choice of #GBBO presenter than they are with the Ts & Cs of #Brexit What a time to be alive

She sat on TV last year and said London should not stop an Independence referendum!She also backed Remain But now it's all different

Crimea' legit referendum versus Scotland's illegal one.

No they can't and yes they have. Post Brexit another 27 countries will have our young jumping through all sorts of hoops to work there.  
Every time she speaks, she alienates and divides again... She prob feels untouchable in her tabloid Brexit bubble.She should get out more.

An independence referendum is 'not fair', yet Scotland being dragged out of the EU somehow is. Got that folks?  
Take it for someone who worked on the first Scottish referendum: what Theresa May is doing is a big mistake  
May needs to explain why autumn 2018/spring '19 after exit deal done isn't ok; Libdems want a 2nd UK referendum then, Commons gets vote then  
Congratulations to HM the Queen for giving the Royal Assent to the Brexit Bill. It's now law, and we await the triggering of Article 50. 
SNP MSP @JoanMcAlpine on the UK government's refusal to grant Scotland another independence referendum before #brexit:

#Brexit rhetoric uses group psychology demands for commitment, loyalty & agreement to override fact based reasoning. #Remain #YesEU 
Let's hope May's refusal to appease SNP's Refo II opportunism will embolden her to stop appeasing "no compromise" Brexit headbangers too.

BreakingThe Queen has officially signed the Brexit Bill. 
Isn't it strange how an UNELECTED leader of the UK has put a Block on Scotland having a referendum? I think she just gave us Independence.

In sept 16, after Brexit, sturgeon said no indyref2 until clear and sustained evidence of support for Indy. What's changed Nicola?

You want people to vote blind! We need to know how things will pan out for UK after brexit. But you can't risk a positive outcome can you?

Nicola Sturgeon's independence referendum strategy be like.....  
Britain's Brexit bill receives royal approval, becomes law  
The Tories were warned in 2014, 2015, and 2016 that #brexit = #indyref2. They don't get to cry "No fair!" now. #ScotRef 
May's video message on Plan for Britain says Brexit vote was “an instruction to change the way our whole country works”. Blimey. 
Salmond on BBC talking nonsense and again assuming he speaks for all Scotland. Why not have a referendum to see if we want a referendum?! 
Pound at 2-week high against dollar after Bank of England policy maker backs a rate increase  
A reminder half the country already wanted a referendum within  next 2  yrs before proposed by the First Minister.  
The real reason Theresa May doesn't want #ScotRef now is the 181,000 EU citizens in Scotland who would vote Yes. Post-Brexit they can't vote 
When Theresa May says there can be no #ScotRef so Britain can get the best Brexit deal, she means she needs Scotland's resources to sell out 
Prime minister, where do you stand on an independence referendum for Scotland? Sorry, where? Where?  
Theresa May pours cold water on second Scottish referendum before Brexit  
Why would Westminster rule out a referendum before Brexit? Because it wouldn't be in Scotland's interests. Obviously. What other reason? 
Theresa May has told Nicola Sturgeon "now is not the time" for a second Scottish independence referendum  
Brexiteers' confusion:First they claim they knew exactly what they voted for Now denying #indyref2 until they know what Brexit means 
Bottom lineIf Brexit will lead to "sunlit uplands", why so scared of either Scottish voters *or* Westminster parliament voting on the deal? 
More brazen, two-faced hypocrisy from #TheresaMay re: #ScotRef & #Brexit  
Shut up and eat your Brexit Scotland....... anti democratic Tory smugness is just laughable. #ScotRef 
Fellow Remoaners, we have to get over Brexit – and help the Brexiteers out with the mess that they've created  
@scottishlabour stands with maj of Scots: against Indy + Indyref2. But if we MUST have a referendum it can't be stitched up by the FM or PM

Bravo to @peerlux for interpellating Belgian Prime Minister ab Belgium's official position on #Catalan #Referendum. 
Seeing this sorry, anti-brexit, liberal tart deliver the news that HM Queen had given royal assent for Art 50 was just wonderful.  
NEWS! Britain better prepared for Quexit than Brexit  
Also, fact that May has handled Brexit so badly & with no transparency or partnership clearly shows we don’t need to wait for THE BIG DEAL.  
To clarify: this is Theresa May today, about a new Scottish Independence referendum. Not last June, after lots of lying and disinformation.  
SNP conference starts tomorrow. About 8,000 party members are going & expecting to hear more about this referendum. Interesting times. 
The defeat of populism in the Netherlands is radiating through European markets  
I greatly fear Mrs May is in grave danger of turning a peaceful referendum into a war. No one is more divisive than her. Dictator. 
Interesting ... block thousands from voting in any referendum, yes, that clever scam will go unnoticed.  
Just imagine Scotland having a binding referendum in 2014 and the losers refusing to respect the result ever since then.  
.@NicolaSturgeon We had a referendum. There were flags, foam hands & everything. You lost. 
.@NicolaSturgeon says any move to block a referendum by Downing Street would be a 'democratic outrage'  
Criminal behaviour in marginal seats means Tories have no mandate to negotiate Brexit or even to have called referendum #toryelectionfraud 
May turns a negative for the SNP into a positive. My analysis of her referendum decision:  
No second Scottish referendum, Sturgeon. Now stop your ILLOGICAL whining & start fixing the TERRIBLE mess you're making in Scotland! 
It's a 'democratic outrage' the SNP can't hold a re-run of the once in a generation referendum that they lost just two and a half years ago. 
Now watch Labour nod along with the Tories as they spin round delaying #ScotRef till after the damage of Brexit is done. Better Together 2.0 
On anniversary of Russia's Crimea “referendum” we reaffirm commitment to Ukraine sovereignty, territorial integrity. 
On Theresa May's disastrous and dangerous denial of democratic process  #Brexit #ScotRef 
Awks! SNP now proposing membership of EEA or EFTA. In the 2014 referendum they explicitly ruled it out. Paras 44-48  
Don't think Sturgeon really expected to get a referendum from May, but when it does eventually happen this becomes weapons grade rhetoric:  
There are 183,000 EU nationals in Scotland. If #IndyRef2 is held after Brexit, it's entirely possible they will be prevented from voting. 
A referendum may only be held, therefore, not as a result of democratic process, but only when Theresa May wills it. 
In thinking she's dampened down an independence referendum Theresa May has only gone and lit the torch paper. 
THERESA MAY: UK should concentrate on getting best deal for all of usBREXIT MINISTER: Have we planned how to do that? Not on my watch. 
May: Scots shouldn't ‘make a crucial decision without the information they need to make that decision”But Theresa "Brexit is Brexit" 
Theresa May will "rue the day" she blocked Second independence referendum - @AlexSalmond 
Are you a journalist? Feeling down about brexit? Show the world you're in no way responsible with this "good ol' days" notebook & pen set.  
Ruth: now is not the time to have a second referendumNarrator: but it was 
FACT CHECK: People should have a choice when terms of Brexit known & before it's too late to change course. #ScotRef 
May lacks vision and imaginationFurthermore, she completely lacks negotiating skills - Brexit will be a car crash caused by her ineptitude 
Too many Unionists caught in pro-EU style death crouch: arguing the rights of having referendum, not arguing for preferred outcome. 
Prepare to shake your head & sigh a lot. No integration whatsoever."I voted #Brexit. Would I go back to UK? No"  
Scotland didn't vote for the Tory Govt or a hard Tory Brexit. A genuine 'partnership of equals' would not disregard the will of the people. 
May: Scots shouldn't ‘make a crucial decision without the information they need to make that decision”So that invalidates #Brexit#Remain 
Scottish Secretary David Mundell says UK Government won't enter into negotiations with Scottish government on second independence referendum 
That's why there should not be another referendum on leaving UK until after Brexit at the earliest. (5/5) 
Any request to hold a second independence referendum will be declined "at this time", Scottish secretary says  
Let us never forget that we're only in this mess because of the Tories' reckless Brexit gamble. (3/5) 
On Dutch election day, voters heard radio ads reminding them to head to the polls to avoid a Brexit or Trump remake.  
Scottish Labour will vote against Nicola Sturgeon's demands for a second referendum on Scotland leaving the UK. (1/5) 
David Mundell says indyref2 doesn't meet criteria for a fair referendum set out at last vote - a request under current plan will be declined  
My favourite thing about #indyref2 is Theresa May having to present all the arguments against the brexit while promoting the brexit.  
Chances are a Scottish passport will be much more valuable than an English one post Brexit so a move north seems sensible for Remain voters  
Theresa May, Ruth Davidson & David Mundell are constitutional vandals. Presiding over #Brexit & the slow breakup of the UK. #indyref2 
Huge own goal by British Government. Running scared  of referendum won't help Unionist cause 
Anyone who suggests Scottish Govt doesn't have a mandate for a future Independence referendum, here is the manifesto we were elected on  
Ruth Davidson standing with David Mundell to say Theresa May will block a new referendum. Here's what she said previously. #ScotRef 
Quite unbelievable. @DavidMundellDCT saying if Scottish Parliament votes to hold another referendum the UK Govt will reject Scotland's will 
I agree with Theresa May. We shouldn’t make big decisions before having all the evidence.#Brexit is postponed for a decade at least, yes? 
So @RuthDavidsonMSP and @DavidMundellDCT decide it's Westminster and not Scotland that should decide on timing or having a referendum at all 
David Mundell says referendum suggested by Sturgeon is "not fair" and Govt will reject Section 30 request  
So, apparently it's "unfair" to have #ScotRef when @scotgov wants it ... but NOT unfair to force #Brexit on pro-EU Scotland? 
Mrs May says wouldn't be fair to Scots to have referendum unless future relationship with the EU is clear. So June 23's poll wasn't fair? 
Scotland has knockout reason to reject May's BREXIT@acgrayling @nickreeves9876 @LordStras @trevdick @solange_lebourg @CloughOlive #IndyRef2 
A crystal clear difference between EU & UK - EU would never dream of blocking a referendum in a member nation, the UK would!! #scotref 
Here is my 7th Brexit Challenge paper on the obstacles facing the UK Government during #Brexit Negotiations  
Theresa May will back down over "now is not the time" for Scot referendum - @AlexSalmond 
Will obviously discuss this on @NotMetalPod tomorrow. If the episode title isn't "Brexit Light, Enter Night", I'll be astounded. 
One last point - if PM thinks we won't know terms of Brexit by autumn next year, she must think her own timetable will fail. 
I ain't no Machiavelli but it strikes me that the best way to lose an independence referendum is to try to stop one taking place. 
Theresa May actually said this today. I had to read it twice to make sure I wasn't missing anything #Brexit #irony  
Nicola Sturgeon tells May blocking Scottish independence referendum would be 'undemocratic' – live updates  
UKGov yesterday: "We don't know what Brexit will cost" Theresa May today: "Wrong to make decision when you don't know the facts." #ScotRef 
PM does not rule out referendum ever taking place in interview with @peston -but 'Now not the time' slams ball back into FM's court 
British PM May on Scottish independence vote with the most ironic statement ever. Does anyone remember Brexit?  
Remember this was @NicolaSturgeon on Monday to the idea of PM delaying a referendum vote until after Brexit. "Puncturing our lifeboat."  
Even stranger that May's statement suggests she accepts Scots could get to judge her Brexit negotiation. rest of UK might argue the same. 
Virtually every word could equally apply as an argument against the madness she is pursuing for her hard Brexit  
The latest installment of my video about how we got into this mess: where Trump and Brexit came from.  
Only Tory MP with his 798 majority trying to dictate to Scotland that we should accepy a hard #Brexit.... takes some haughty neck! 
Perhaps same reason Nicola Sturgeon felt it unnecessary to make her referendum announcement to Parliament ?  
First Minister says PM "fears the verdict of the Scottish people" and is acting undemocratically, in blocking referendum  
"We'll deport all the EU nationals before the second Scottish referendum so the unionist side will appear stronger!"  
Should SNP MPs walk out of WM if the Tories block Referendum?   Please retweet for larger number of responses 
Further to last tweet and to be fair to ScotGov they are not proposing a referendum until terms of Brexit are clear. Unlike in June 2016! 
3/3 If the Tories refuse to do so, they would effectively be blocking Scotland's right to choose when the Brexit terms clear... 
Getting called undemocratic because I signed a petition against having another Scottish referendum hahaha the irony is painful 
It's NOT 2014 anymore. Unionist promises haven't been delivered. The pro-Indy SNP have been re-elected. Brexit is happening. 
.@scotgov is not proposing #scotref now...but when the terms of Brexit clear and before it is too late to choose an alternative path. 1/4  
Fucking hell, Rab Wilson is furious about Theresa May refusing a 2nd Scottish referendum. pic.twitter.com/fk5bXhOMTE 
We can't have IndyRef 2 because it's a "crucial decision without the necessary information"...yet Brexit is deemed to be fine?  
EU citizens resident here must be given the right to vote in any post Brexit referendum. The right response to London gerrymandering. 
Alex Salmond point of order in Commons. Asks why PM has not come to Parliament to announce referendum latest. 
Scotland does not want to go back to the “division and uncertainty” of another referendum, Nicola Sturgeon told. 
This is wild. Tories basically saying their own brexit timetable is not reliable.  
Nicola Sturgeon was elected on the basis that a second referendum would occur under the circumstances we now find ourselves in. 
A very good rant from James: Calls Out The Leavers Who Are Dodging Tough Brexit Questions @LBC 
"Corbyn doesn't think it's the role of Labour to stop a referendum" says @GrayInGlasgow "he's absolutely right, let the people decide" 
Delaying until after Brexit disenfranchises approximately 181,000 EU nationals. Many of whom would choose independence. Naked gerrymandering 
After all Theresa May's talk of Sturgeon's "bluffing", look who pussed out in the end. The Tories are terrified of a second referendum. 
The Scottish Conservatives & Scottish Labour want to deprive the people of Scotland of their say in a democratic referendum. #VoteSNP May07 
"Now is not the time" for a second referendum on Scottish independence says UK PM Theresa May #IndyRef2 
Davis yesterday: We don't know what Brexit will costMay now: Wrong to make a decision when you don't know the facts  
Vedder & Metallica both charging over £90 for tickets. People are calling greed but this is the price we're paying for Brexit. Simple as. 
Pascal Lamy: it will take five or six years for the UK to do a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU 
Oh yes, Ms May, it WOULD be unfair to have a referendum on breaking up a union when the implications of doing so are unclear, wouldn't it? 
Holyrood does not need *any* consent to hold a referendum. It's just that Westminster can ignore the result. So hold one and let them try. 
Claiming that a second referendum is "not fair" whilst accepting Scotland being dragged out of the EU against its will is absolute bullshit. 
BREAKING: Theresa May has rejected Nicola Sturgeon’s request for a second independence referendum.  
Tories using EUref vote with no context as mandate for damaging Hard Brexit. Now denying Scotland an informed vote on our future. #ScotRef 
Theresa May is claiming that after Brexit has happened we won't know what it is. That's clearly utterly ridiculous & treating us like fools. 
Delaying till after #Brexit likely means EU nationals don't get a vote despite living in and being part of Scotland - deeply undemocratic. 
Effectively she is saying that even in two years - at the point of Brexit - we won't know what Brexit will look like. 
A delay to the #ScotRef gives May time to bargain away Scottish interests during #Brexit negotiations. THAT'S why it's "not a good time". 
Theresa May: Scots will be "without the necessary information" on Brexit by Autumn 2018-Spring 2019. That's either a lie or stupidity. 
FM said between autumn 2018 - spring 2019, that is not "now". If @ScotParl votes for a referendum will UK Govt reject Scotland's demands?  
May says it's "not the right time" for #ScotRef, but what she means is not the right time for her - we need it before #Brexit to counter it. 
Theresa May formally rejects Nicola Sturgeon's timetable for second independence referendum

At the height of his popularity, "Dutch Trump" Geert Wilders was projected to win 41 seats. Then came Brexit/Trump. Wilders took just 19. 
Any poor deluded soul who still thinks #Brexit can be a success  should listen to the minister in charge  here - devastating  
#Brexit was a vote FOR globalism, for free trade, for a strong UK army, for #NATO, and away from protectionism and weakness. Fuck Putin. 
It's true that @PutinRF wanted #Brexit but that's because he's a shit spy who then got casually doxed by Chris #Steele even in retirement pic.twitter.com/NAlMSC2QdZ 
Let me tell you Cambridge Analyticasky did not work in #Brexit or the UK elections. They tried. They failed. 
Also, #Brexit voters tended older, and while the #Putinbots were all over Twitter and Facebook, those voters do not do social media 
For the vast majority of #Brexit voters the most important issue was regaining national sovereignty, not immigration 
Further my liberal friends should really know it is a species of racism to call #Brexit anti-immigrant. Huge Muslim support for it 
If it helps, think of #Brexit as a vote without an Electoral College. It was a UK-wide vote, everybody's vote counted the same. 
"Except in the universe where Wales exists"#Brexit

I wrote a few weeks ago in @TheNewEuropean  that   #ToxicTrump could be bad news for #LePen ...and for  #Brexit  .#DonTheCon 
Davis must know this. He lied to the Brexit Select Committee. Wonder why?  
Brexit means the end of single market access for London—no back door into the EU for financial institutions. 
@mowbrayjackson In case we forget: "Eurosceptics slammed a CBI report that claimed that Brexit would cause a £100 billion 'shock' to the UK"

Those splittist rascals at the China Daily have this today on the fallout from Brexit  
@SAshworthHayes Stunning and ignorant David Davis "evidence" on #Brexit terms @euromove 
As they should. Brexit and Trump are shameful.  
As I pointed out in my Hindustan Times column last month, Trump and Brexit will be used against far-right populists across Europe.  
'It is an evening in which Netherlands, after Brexit, after US elections, said 'stop' to the wrong kind of populism'  
Queen prepares to sign Brexit bill into British history  
or maybe Dutch voters learned lessons from Trump and Brexit about being careful about their vote 
The Netherlands voted today in the first big electoral test for European populism since Brexit and Trump's election  
'as many as 3/4 now in favour of staying in EU, warts and all'. Key point: don't have to regard EU as perfect, just much better than #Brexit  
Gordon Brewer consistently pushing the same arguments that #Scotref should be after Brexit & there's no oil left. We've not even started yet 
This is an absolutely must-watch. The Brexit Secy David Davis shredding the case for Brexit.  2 mins of pure gold  
A must-watch for #Brexit enthusiasts   
Here's the video of the Benn/Davis exchange on No Deal Brexit - tariffs, health cards etc, that I was tweeting about  
We're the Brexit guinea pig. WTO tariffs.Politicians with 0 clue. Businesses relocating. EU workers in uncertainty.£ drop. NHS under threat.  
If far-right populism is fading,  as the #Wilders fiasco suggests, maybe the UK's Brexit shambles has helped make others see sense 
Essentially this is Bob Geldof's #Brexit plan #NolanLive 
What patriot would break our EU alliance and split the UK, so helping Putin's assault on the EU and democracy!Who are the patriots!#Brexit

Have I missed the lacerating criticism of the punditting elite for uptalking the Great Wilders Revolution? You know, like Trump & Brexit? 
The failure of Wilders is directly bcos of brexit. Realization. A blow to brexiteers. The people are speaking. When trump goes, brexit dies.  
Jeremy Corbyn has allowed Theresa May's Brexit Government to ruin the futures of our children  
This is truly shocking. Scottish fisheries to be given away to help #brexit looks like our party needs to stand up for #Remain 
Trump and Brexit may have been enough to take the popular out of "populism." 
Rutte: "This night is a night for the Netherlands. After Brexit, after the US elex, we said stop it, stop it, to the wrong type of populism" 
We were settled, then Brexit. Now all we do is talk about timetables for leaving. I will never forgive the Tories.

Dutch PM, who according to exit polls has easily defeated Wilders, references Brexit:  
No manifestoNo planNo ideaNo consensusNo credibilityNo way to run a government let alone Brexit shambles.No CONFIDENCE in any of them  
#Brexit:Two headlines which sum up the idiocy of these right-wingers. Yes, Britain has shown how to leave EU, but now it is utterly clueless  
When your budget collapses in 7 days, there's an #NHS crisis, you have no plan for a hard Brexit and all you can do is a seal impression...

Brexit isn't a game. It is a bunch of ill equipped politicians who are about to cause huge damage to our country. 
Tmrw at 11am a bit of history. Legislation authorising PM to start Brexit talks receives Royal Assent. We are almost out of EU 
A virtuoso performance of serial negativity.  Brexit: stupid and proud of it. 
It is woefully irresponsible of the #UKgovernment to pursue a hard #Brexit before a thorough economic analysis

Oh! I like this...... Brexit, "unthinking the thinkable"! Damn but I wish I thought of this.   
Dear UK,You know how our leaders have been crowing about how Britain can trade with Commonwealth countries after Brexit?They lied.Tom  
Nationalist/Populist position/candidate won Brexit & US, but then lost in Austria & Netherlands. And, Macron up large in polls over Le Pen.  
By comparison markets gave Trump only a 15% chance when he was down only 3-4 points. And Brexit only a 20% chance when it was TIED in polls.

BREAKING: Albrecht MEP: "Adequacy decision for UK post- #Brexit almost impossible to grant because of national security rules." #GDPR #dpi17 
.@AngusRobertson: If Tories refuse to negotiate a UK wide position on EU exit "we will have a referendum, and we will have our say." #PMQs 
Robertson: "People in Scotland will have a referendum and we will have our say" he says criticising the PM "wagging her finger"... 
'Does she not understand if she does not secure an agreement before triggering article 50 - people in Scotland will have a referendum' 
.@AngusRobertson "PM promised UK wide approach to Brexit before triggering Article 50 - when will she announce it?" #PMQs 
The Brexit Minister just admitted they haven't got a clue what they're doing so Corbyn's talking about schoolteachers. #PMQs 
So @AngusRobertson : "The lady is not for turning?" He calls it an "embarrassing screeching u-turn" on her Budget ... asks re Brexit 
I’ve been self-employed for 30 years. The NI rise was minor, yet Tories complain & it gets reversed. Meanwhile, Brexit sails ahead. Crazy! 
How can we be having a referendum because of #Brexit but we are not going to rejoin the EU? The SNP must take us for fools #indyref2 
same as brexit they were mislead by a campaign fuelled by racism, isolation, false promises 
So far #Scotref a choice btwn @scotgov which published a deep assmnt of Scot post Brexit & a UK Govt that in 9mnths hasn't assessed anything 
 Watch #PMQs after government scraps plan to increase National Insurance for self-employed  
It's the Jocky Horror Show. Efforts to delegitimise the referendum won't work:  @GeorgeMonbiot  [please share] 
Worry for economists: if HMT is too weak to push this thru, how will they fare with the REALLY tough reforms that’ll be needed post-Brexit? 
Since the Brexit vote, the British feel more European than ever | Jonathan Freedland

Staggering U-turn. And this is peanuts compared to what's going to happen when we get into the heart of the Brexit negotiations. 
Overheard in newsroom: "Good news for Barnier and his team: if you can roll over the govt on NICs then wait til the Brexit negotiations." 
How can a Government who can't even fiddle with a tax rate without panicking and u-turning deliver something as complex as Brexit? 
BREAKING: Philip Hammond drops plans to increase National Insurance rates for self-employed  
How quickly the govt folds when right wing press turns against it. Handy reminder that hard Brexit is more to do with them than public vote. 
I wouldn't trust David Davis to go to the shop to get me crisps. To trust this muddle-headed narcissistic nincompoop on Brexit is madness 
#indyref2 Nicola Sturgeon & Tim Farron worst two politicians out there ,2 referendum all the time both of them every day go away please 
Can we please hurry up and commit economic suicide? ask Brexit Tories 
Sounds like David Davis has taken an absolute kicking this morning at Brexit select committee.  Has no response to basic questions. 
Davis sums up all of Brexit:"When we are out, we can change laws. Much will depend on new regulatory regimes. For example, clinical trials" 
DELAY: EU could mess Theresa May around and not start Brexit negotiations until JUNE!  
Today the Brexit Secretary discussed disaster of "no deal". On Monday, Parliament rejected the opportunity to give itself a meaningful vote.  
Watching Davis at Brexit Select Committee it feels like we are sacrificing our economy and 10+ years of paralysis for absolutely nothing  
Davis says he "can't calculate" cost of no-deal Brexit. Leaked Treasury forecasts suggest it would cost 7.5% of GDP.  
a) Don't worry about Brexit: chicken feet! b) The @Daily_Express don't know that Ian Paisley Snr died in 2014 so didn't lead this debate 
No, you don't. That's why you have the numbers.#brexit  
Utter madness. Govt dragging us down path to Brutal Brexit with no idea of the cost of failure to get deal.  
The more you read about #Brexit, the more it looks like getting drunk and coming home from the pub having bought a giraffe. 
EXCLUSIVE: David Davis confirms that Britain's top team is already at the Brexit negotiating table  
Revealing question from Gove in Brexit committee. Asked Davis what freedoms post-Brexit he is most excited about. Answer came there none. 
And how about Remainers telling us whether they have calculated how much it would cost Britain if the EU crashes financially. #Brexit 
Ooh, my little moany one, my Brexit oneWhen you gonna give me some time, RemoanerOoh, you make my trade collapse, my marmite peak 
David Davis, the man we're trusting with Brexit negotiations, pictured trying to figure out how hands work  
WATCH | Brexit hero @Nigel_Farage talks about the anti-EU revolt of Wilders and Le Pen and slams mad Angela Merkel. Words of wisdom! 
.@frankturner wrote an album - then started again after Brexit and Trump  
Incredible that the Tories accuse the Scottish Govt of causing uncertainty for Scotland. Have a read of this thread.... #Brexit #ScotRef 
Anyone else a tad worried by how often David Davis has told the #brexit committee "I haven't considered that in detail"? 
It certainly does seem odd that @theresa_may can know that no Brexit deal would be better than a bad deal  
But post #Brexit, #Irish border becomes external border of the #EU. Not the same at all. #Davis trying to down play and disguise change. 
#CNOSUMMIT Jeremy Hunt confirms support for our EU nurses and is confident there will be an agreement through the Brexit process 
No due diligence, no risk analysis, no strategy, no credible plan. Good job these jokers aren't running anything important. #brexit  
Remember when media and unionists wanted every single I of indyref dotted, every T crossed? Brexit. Not so much.  
Just a reminder that the last Scottish independence referendum cost UK taxpayers £15.8m:  #scottishreferendum 
Until Brexit happened, I had no idea so many of my Facebook friends understood the complexities of negotiating international trade deals. 
David Davis admits he's done no assessment of the economic impact of a "No Brexit deal" crash out. No info on impact 4 trade, EHiC, tech etc

Sadiq Khan should be telling everyone London WILL be good enough (& better) after Brexit, not scaremongering. He's a MISERABLE London mayor! 
The UK has two years to negotiate Brexit and a trade deal. This is what it has (not) managed in the nine months since the referendum vote.  
Where next, after a #brexit without dignity, respect or accountability?, asks @nickdearden75 
My God, Brexit is in the hands of imbeciles.  
David Davis confirms that 9 months after the EU Referendum, the Govt has no clue as to the potential economic impact of Brexit. #negligence 
And this morning David Davis tells Brexit Select Committee no assessment of impact of leaving without a deal has been carried out. Absurd 
Farmers quietly remove all those UKIP/Brexit signs that have been rural eyesores over the past few years ...  
The Government has admitted it hasn't looked at the economic impact of not getting a #Brexit deal @DavidDavisMP 
Remember how the timestamp showed the Brexit white paper had been drafted in the small hours the night before?  
BREXIT: David Davis says government has not done economic assessment of no-deal with the EU as his magic unicorn told him "it'll be fine." 
Don't worry. David Davis knows instinctively what a good or bad Brexit deal looks like. "You don't need a piece of paper with numbers on it" 
Nobody should be surprised by this. There was no Brexit plan.  
#ScotRef Log, Day 3. We have entered the Brexit Nebula. It's murky and confusing. Sensors are unable to determine how long it goes on for.  
Scenes from the #Brexit offices after they Trigger Article 50

Here's a first look at this week's magazine cover: Brexit and the break-up of Britain. Subscribe here:  
David Davis has not *looked* at EHIC he says. EHIC impacts every single Brit who ever travels in the EU. Heretical irresponsibility. #Brexit 
The PM seems worryingly unbothered about securing the best deal if she's happy with no Brexit deal at all...  
Haven’t *looked* at EHIC!?!? WTF? That have they been doing the last 9 months? Or has DD not read his briefings? #Brexit  
The 'power' of #Brexit! UK #unemployment fell to 4.7% in January, matching the lowest level since 1975! 'Yes' 1975! 
Brexit Secretary @DavidDavisMP says there’s no economic assessment on impact of failing to reach a deal with EU. 
Even if you're a Leaver, you should value a Brexit committee that holds a sec of state to account. Raab, Lilley etc are cheerleaders for him 
#UPDATE EU president Donald Tusk says bloc will not bow to British "threats" over Brexit  
PM's Brexit speech: "I am equally clear that no deal for Britain is better than a bad deal for Britain"Also likes to 'look at the evidence'  
#Brexit is the ultimate expression of Tory Disaster Capitalism. Like vultures, their billionaire donors will gorge on the wreckage. 
Government admits it hasn't assessed what will happen if UK walks away with no Brexit deal  
Surely many NO as well as YES agree ScotParl should set date of referendum and are aghast at arrogant counterproductive ineptitude of UKGov 
#spanishpress El Mundo #ScotRef #Brexit 'Spain denies having concerns over Scotland' #May #Art50 
just a friendly reminder that if you vote based on your preferred football team in the referendum you are a fucking idiot 
They're flying blind; they always have been. And it shows fatuity of "Brexit means Brexit".  
“So many unemployed people voted for Brexit as they felt they were not getting the answers they needed from EU," Gabriele Zimmer #EU60  
Isn't the obvious rebuttal here: how many years will the UK economy take to recover from Brexit?  
Brexit Secretary David Davis says Government has not done an economic assessment of the impact of not reaching a deal with the EU on Brexit 
I trust the PM will explain that the UK Parliament will not grant a referendum while we seek to implement the results of the last on the EU.

Entirely predictable Brexit would lead to 2nd Scottish referendum - & that Brexiteers would as usual disown negative impact of their actions 
Britannia shakes: in the past 10 days, Brexit has caused the DUP to lose their veto in N Ireland and the SNP to demand another indy ref.

Theresa May in office but not control as referendum opens up 2nd divorce front  
Take back control? Parliament just gave it away - following ministers blindly off the Brexit cliff edge just as @CarolineLucas warned. 
I always forget what it actually said on the brexit ballot  
.@NicolaSturgeon called for a new referendum on #Scottishindependence today, and responses to it sounded familiar. 
Why, really, do MPs not want a meaningful vote at end of #brexit process? Scared of whips? Scared of tabloids? Scared Brexit will be a mess?

"Brexit increases the urgency for a referendum on Irish Unity and that needs to happen as soon as possible."- Michelle O'Neill #UnityRef 
This referendum is not about the well being of those who reside in Scotland,It's solely a device to ensure the Murrels retain their status.

Dear Brexiters,When your leaders said they'd spend £350m on the NHS after Brexit, they meant they'd abolish it.Regards,Tom#brexitbill

Honestly this "economic uncertainty" line from people - whether Tory or Labour - who have accepted the hardest Brexit possible is amazing. 
Brexit Bill passes through Commons without amendment.With Lords expected to concede defeat, the only thing left to do is trigger A50!   
MPs reject by 331 votes to 286 Lords amendment to Brexit bill requiring meaningful parliamentary vote on final deal  
MPs REJECT Lords amendment calling for veto on Brexit by 331 to 286. Great news! 
Article 50 leaves Commons probably for last time. Toxic combo of Tory hardliners & Labour subservience sees us facing an extreme #Brexit. 
Oh, the irony of Tories who said restoration of Parliamentary sovereignty was the reason for Brexit voting tonight to deny Parliament a say! 
Gov gets Article 50 trigger bill through commons UNAMENDED BY 331 to 286. Now to Lords. But it's over. Brexit talks start end March 
MPs vote by 331 to 286 to make sure their final vote on May's Brexit deal continues to be meaningless.

Brexit must be stopped, former Downing Street spin doctor Alastair Campbell says  
As with so much else, this isn't a result of Brexit. It is a result of the type of Brexit they are pursuing and the way they are pursuing it 
Even on June 24th, a 2nd independence referendum wasn't inevitable. May made it inevitable by how she pursued it  
Theresa May looks utterly rattled. She's losing grip on the union before even entering Brexit negotiations. You can almost hear EU sniggers. 
Dear PM it's not @NicolaSturgeon who will create uncertainty, it will be you, when you trigger #Article50 #Brexit… 
Astonishing, if not surprising, irony fail from Leave camp when they talk about #IndyRef2“Why would you want to leave the union…?” #Brexit 
Everyone will suffer: Scotland, rUK, rEU. No matter. This is Brexit 2.0. Meaner, more divisive, more exhausting, and utterly avoidable. 
Apparently Green's website says a 2nd referendum should be determined by public appetite. And by public they mean Sturgeon and SNP.  
Erm, no @theresa_may - it's not a referendum on Scottish independence that's so divisive. It's your own party's EU referendum:#indyref2

The key thing to remember with the SNP is that, if we hadn't vote for Brexit, they'd never have mentioned independence ever again. No sirree 
Sturgeon promised the 2014 referendum would be 'once in a generation'. Sign our petition and say no to #indyref2 
SNP only spent £90k on the pro-EU campaign.  Surprised if they haven't spent more on indyref2 already . Isn't Brexit #onlyanexcuse ? 
Theresa advises Nicola not to "play politics with the future of our country" by calling for referendum. INCREDIBLE! 
Lot of people repeating "Brexit has destroyed the Union" line. If we have a second ref, and people vote "No", won't it have saved the Union? 
As someone who goes No in the last referendum Brexit was a massive game changer. Looking forward to making better decisions in #indyref2

Scotland's first minister has called for a second independence referendum before Britain leaves the EU  
It gets worse for the SNP.Sturgeon doesn't even want to call a referendum as she knows she can't win it.Salmond is pulling the strings.  
Will be very sad if Scotland leaves UK. But I wouldn't blame the Scots, given the #Brexit chaos caused by malign and incompetent Tory govt.

Just an idea but how about a Scottish referendum on whether or not the Scots should hold a second referendum on independence? #compromise

A veto on the final Brexit deal is just an attempt by remain politicians to reverse the result of the EU Referendum #RespectTheResult 
I said very clearly that's not what I intended. I want informed choice when we have clarity on Brexit - based on PM's own timetable.  
I agree. Brexit is a triumph of English nationalism against Britain. Possibly a deadly victory.  
It's hard to believe a whole generation has passed since the last referendum for Scottish Independence. How time flies... 
I used to be against Scotland going solo. But following broken promises from Westminster, & poor Brexit deal offered, good luck to #indyref2

Hard Brexit hits reality. 2nd ref one of many consequences routinely dismissed as a fearmongering in campaign 
Every time a govt minister says "will of the people" they are emphasizing just how deeply this govt is permeated by fascist ideology#Brexit 
Scotland to have second referendum on independence #indyref2  
Can I officially start the twitter debate on the referendum? Right - 'what do YOu know u English/Scottish dog-sick Scum NOTHING without us' 
Scottish independence: Nicola Sturgeon to seek second referendum  
Nicola Sturgeon is seeking a new Scottish independence referendum  
Who can blame them? May's #Brexit vision = low pay, long hours, less holiday, lousy bosses. Freedom only 4 rich. 
BREAKING: Scotland will seek second referendum for independence from U.K. prior to Brexit 
Bit confused now. If Brexit's looking dire in eighteen months time do we get a referendum on whether to unite with independent Scotland? 
Sturgeon #Brexit statement• Will seek an #indyref2 poll• Wants vote autumn 2018/spring 2019Updates and reaction  
'I don't agree with the outcome of a referendum so I'm going to hold a referendum.' 
My latest column tries to think through all the variables and concludes Brexit probably will happen and will be really bad.  
The pound is unchanged by Nicola Sturgeon's push for a second Scottish referendum  
Sturgeon quotes Corbyn saying an independence referendum would be "absolutely fine" 
BOOST: Vodafone backs Brexit Britain with £2 billion investment, 2,000 new jobs created.  
Today @NicolaSturgeon just became one of my favorite people in history! Great speech and on point answers. Well done!  #brexit #ScotRef 
Edinburgh increasingly looks like it could be a big beneficiary of post-Brexit relocation plans by firms in the City. 
In retrospect, the decision to hold a Brexit referendum may have had some far reaching consequences. 
Sturgeon calls for second Scottish independence referendum between fall 2018 and spring 2019  
Sturgeon says U.K. GOvt sunk the ship with Brexit vote, now denying Scotland its lifeboat 
Nicola Sturgeon says if UK Govt try to block her holding indyref before Brexit like puncturing Scotlands lifeboat after Brexit sunk the ship 
No chance that May will agree to referendum during Brexit negotiations. 
In other news #indyref2 and #Brexit news Fianna Fáil have published proposals for a United Ireland:  
The Scottish people will be asked to comprehend the ramifications of a hard Brexit AND those of being independent. A very tall order. 
And what'll happen to peace in Northern Ireland? Who knows! Who cares! Brexit! Wheeeeee!  
Nicola Sturgeon has announced a 2nd Independence Poll for Scotland. It's time we had our referendum on Irish Unity too. #IndyRef2 #UnityRef

Scotland's leader seeks new independence referendum  
Do you support #referendum for an independent #Scotland?- RT for larger sample size - 
Another referendum.  
News: Sturgeon there should be 'an avoidance of 'Project Fear' as she states how Brexit will doom Scotland #indyref2 
What's plural for referendum? You can't keep having them (and destabilising the country therein) when you don't like results. A nonsense. 
UK govt grinds to a halt for Brexit negotiations. Scottish govt grinds to a halt for indyref preparations. Great. 
Hard Brexit + Endless Tory Govt versus Open, Progressive, Confident Scotland.   No wonder @NicolaSturgeon thinks Yes this time can win. 
If Scotland gets a 2nd ref and votes to leave the UK, then shouldn't the new UK also get a 2nd Brexit vote as it'll be a different nation?  
If she remained passive during hard Brexit, she'd be remembered as the nationalist leader who watched her nation be disrespected & sabotaged 
Nicola sturgeon is an absolute joke, what right does she have to hold a referendum any time the U.K. Does something she doesn't agree with? 
 #BREAKING - Scotland's first minister to request new independence referendum  
Am pro-Union as I believe we're #StrongerTogether but this govt so blind re hard Brexit I don't blame Scots who want Indy. 
@NicolaSturgeon keeping manifesto pledge for independence referendum if "significant & material change" #brexit is that change. #scotref 
Whether you agree with @NicolaSturgeon or not it's impossible to deny her performances & commitment on #Brexit is head & shoulders above PM 
Brexit means Scexit 
Me: I never want to endure another referendum as long as I live.Scotland:  
I want someone to look at me the way Sturgeon looks at a second Scottish independence referendum. #ScotRef #IndyRef2 
Queen set to approve #Brexit Bill at breakfast tomorrow.We have been waiting for too long...Bring it on! 
Scotland choosing its own future in fresh indy referendum is an inevitable outcome of arrogant, colonial London Government. 
Nicola Sturgeon: "I believe in a referendum the Scottish people will opt for independence" #indyref2 
I'm a (passionate) No supporter who would now vote Yes. The Brexit omnishambles is a dealbreaker. I'm European first and foremost. #indyref2 
Another Scotland referendum because Nicola Sturgeon hates being 'ruled' from London. Yeah. Being owned by Brussels will be so much better. 
“Scotland will have a choice at the end of the Brexit process - before it’s too late to decide on our own path”: @NicolaSturgeon #ScotRef 
I was elected on a manifesto commitment to oppose a second independence referendum every step of the way. And I will. 
Scotland First Minister @NicolaSturgeon seeks permission for #IndyRef2 in 2018 or 2019  #Brexit  
2 Leavers rightly say it'd be crazy for Scotland to vote to quit UK. It was crazy for UK to vote to quit EU & that didn't stop Brexit 
Sturgeon wants Holyorood to vote on a referendum without any idea whatsoever of what the plan is for an indy Scotland.Ridiculous. 
Theresa May has made no effort to hide her contempt for Scotland. She has frozen the Scottish voice completely out of Brexit Negotiations 
Nicola Sturgeon does bold, smart thing & gets ahead of rising Brexit tide with declaration of indyref2. Measured speech. Massive impact

This is not a result of Brexit. It is a result of hard Brexit & the frenzied arrogant idiocy w which it has been pursued. 
Think this is actually more significant in terms of the dynamics of indyref2 than Brexit  
Nicola Sturgeon: ScotGov has worked "really hard" to find agreement over Brexit. UKgov "has not moved even an inch" towards compromise.  
Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says they must have a plan for Scotland for way forward after Brexit is triggered 
Do you support a second Scottish independence referendum?  
Sturgeon says "wish we weren't here". Truth is she does. This is just a game for her. She wants a referendum & independence at any cost.

This week Theresa May is likely to fire the starting gun for negotiations over Brexit  
Seriously, Labour people, the options aren’t just ‘accept Theresa May’s hard #Brexit’ or ‘oppose the will of the people’. That’s *not* it. 
People are free to agree with independence or not, but it's entirely legitimate for Sturgeon to call a second referendum.

Hearing Sturgeon will give PM an ultimatum - give Scotland a different Brexit deal or she'll call for section 30, the indyref process 
As we await Sturgeon's important statement, you can still get 3/1 on the First Minister citing "hard Toree Brexit" fewer than 10 times. 
From last week's Faculty of Advocates Brexit event, quite clear that unless the UK put Scotland on the table now, we're off it altogether.

Everything Nick Clegg has said about Brexit keep coming true. Which makes his latest warning even more important  
She did not put them there to make them 'own Brexit'. She did it because she is instinctively reactionary. What happens now is on her. 
UK looks to supercharge EU trade deals post-Brexit  
Two sorts of people voted to #Leave. Those who believed the lies and those who told the lies. #LeaveLies #Brexit #meaningfulvote @thetimes 
The media should ask the rest of the EU why they have not yet reassured all UK citizens living on the continent they can do so after Brexit. 
Under what circumstances would we need another referendum then? Or should UK have carte blanche to do anything to Scotland against her will  
Brexit is a smart decision. Time to re-engage with old friends! The Commonwealth has higher GDP and actually has growth! #CommonwealthDay

Only "significant intervention" Nicola Sturgeon could make today would be to accept that Scotland doesn't need or want another referendum 
The author says that if Nicola Sturgeon calls for another divisive referendum, then it is clear that her only interest is breaking up the UK  
Voting for the Brexit Bill: . Today I will be voting to ensure the Brexit Bill passes the Commons again unamended. 
65 million willing the govt to make Brexit happen - including babes in arms... a true populist tyrant's lie.

But at no stage have you given reasons for why brexit would be a good idea, only "will of the people" stuff. Not good enough.  
Seems that EU institutions & other 27 MS have used the 9 months since #Brexit vote to prepare, giving them now a bigger + over UK than then?

Brexit is like a bad chemo session: it's killing a lot more than it cures, including Parliament, but what the hell?  
If we could have a referendum on the final terms of #brexit the Scottish one might have proved unnecessary. 
Don't believe this "we're leaving" nonsense. It is perfectly feasible for the UK to reject Brexit.

Kezia Dugdale left in dark and humiliated as Jeremy Corbyn says he is fine with another independence referendum.  
A total of 5,476 UK registered companies use 336,421 separate “passports” to do business in the EU27. All are at risk with Brexit.  
If Erdogan wins the upcoming constitutional referendum, he will be Turkey's most powerful leader since Ataturk.  
The UK's universities will be disproportionately affected by Brexit.  
In summary, that's absolutely no benefits from Brexit. None, not one.  
These groups will be among the first affected by Brexit.  
Erdogan is burning all bridges w/Europe to win referendum..After the referendum? Who knows. Certainly Erdogan seems like he could care less

August 2016, Corbyn rules out a 2nd EU referendum, saying: "You have to respect the decision people made". Apparently Scotland is different. 
Most Scots opposed to second referendum. One thing for Labour not to block, another to say "absolutely fine". 
.@IanMurrayMP @petermccue1 You don't represent the majority of Scots Ian. Indy is a better prospect than failing post-brexit UK! 
Meanwhile, at the core of Brexit, authoritarianism, ignorance & abject failure to see beyond your own front room  
Labour Lords 80-90% sure Brexit Bill will be passed by peers by midnight on Monday, enabling Theresa May to trigger Art 50 on Tuesday!   
Is this some sort of joke? Get your head out of the 1980s & try addressing the impending catastrophe that'll make us all poorer #brexit  
Labour's new "Yes and also No" policy on Scottish referendum is simply bad faith.  and 
It would be 'radical' to oppose #Brexit, like 70% of Labour voters, instead of chasing UKIP voters.Pathetic.   
If there is another Scottish referendum, Labour will vigorously oppose independence because it would lead to turbo-charged austerity. 
Jeremy wants Scotland to stay part of Britain but thinks it would be wrong for Westminster to block a referendum if Holyrood voted for it. 
Brexit bill 'likely to be passed by Lords on Monday'  
Want another referendum? Absolutely fine with me, lads! #ScotRef 
Labour sources tell Sky News they are "80-90% sure" that Article 50 Bill will be passed by the House of Lords by midnight Monday #Brexit  
I'm at this. It won't stop Brexit.But it rubs May's lying face in the shit, after claiming Britain is coming together for Brexit   
"This election is not like the others. A referendum between on the one hand #France, and on the other its dilution" #ChâteaurouxMLP #LePen 
Corbyn accepts the right of the Scottish Parliament to call a referendum - that doesn't mean he backs independence. It's fairly simple. 
#Brexit is to the UK what Trump is to America: toxic and destructive. Trump might take 4 years to stop; Brexit can be stopped right now. 
We had our referendum on independence, it was meant to be definitive and respected by all.Holding another one is not 'fine'.

Also: Only 24% of voters think the Tories are representing Scotland's interests in Brexit. 59% don't. Before the serious stuff begins. 
'Brexit' polls badly, so ministers have been told to avoid saying it  
Encouraging Ipsos MORI independence poll. Unsurprising given Tory attitude to Scotland and PM's hard Brexit obsession.  
People who were 12 in 2014 will be able to vote in a 2018 referendum. That's not insignificant.

Amazing what just two simple acts of will could do to transform this country and its prospects overnight: forget Brexit, depose Corbyn.

Party politics irrelevant in Westminster: it's a fight now between the Brexit zealots and those who're willing to stand up for our country.

unquestionable that brexit has had the effect of increasing support in the UK for the EU (and across Europe too).

In a parallel universe, the Chancellor says zilch about #Brexit, relies on very dodgy forecasts, and fails to reform tax system. #Budgetfail 
That £60bn Brexit buffer never turned up in the end - or have I missed something? 
Why did neither Hammond nor Corbyn mention the big elephant in the room ? Conspiracy of silence on the most important issue ?  Brexit. 
Let’s be clear: reason big corporations are getting the breaks is because of Brexit. The little guys are screwed. 
As I wrote on @CapX yesterday, May doing almost nothing to address the forgotten communities who voted for #Brexit  
A budget announcement with no mention of Brexit. Like announcing what's for dinner on the Titanic & not mentioning the iceberg. 
IS NO-ONE GOING TO MENTION BREXIT? Were the past few months all a dream? Is this an incredibly elaborate practical joke? 
Brexit not mentioned once. Fact we're leaving the EU crops up here and there, like something you forgot to put on a shopping list. 
Budget like a bed-time story about a world in which Brexit is not taking place. Hard to find a single mention of what's about to happen. 
Budget summary; Brexit means GDP down cumulative 1.3%, borrowing up £100Bn, Self-employed paying for it with tax rises, austerity continues. 
By cutting growth forecasts even the Tories know that #brexit is a storm of our own making & we are sailing into it in a skiff #budget2017 
Brexit means... what? Asks the OBR, again?

Some money for science in #Budget2017. 1000 PhD students is good. Overall, we're not seeing enough to compensate for Brexit 
Did the Chancellor just deliver #Budget2017 without specifically mentioning #Brexit, at all? 
An hour of budget statement and Chancellor didn't even use the word Brexit. Extraordinary. Largest economic headwinds and he ignores it. 
Anybody told Hammond about Brexit? 
#PhilipHammond on #budget:"We're putting the next generation first to safeguard their future and ours"; Then listen to them and ditch Brexit 
I thought Tories were all about supporting entrepreneurs and cutting taxes? Try telling that to self-employed being asked to pay for #Brexit 
Who knows if the OBR's growth forecasts are right - but if they're hit by Brexit we'll see huge upgrades in borrowing at awkward moments. 
Had Theresa May even thought about need to revisit Scotland Act after Brexit?No answer on consulting with Scottish Parliament & people #PMQs 
Hammond speaks as if we've left the EU. Our economy has not yet felt the impact of a hard Tory Brexit. His head is in the sand. #Budget2017 
The cost of Brexit in this Budget is clear - borrowing is now forecast about £100bn higher than in the last budget, pre-referendum 
UK will borrow £100bn more over the next 6 years because of Govt's hard Brexit plans

It's very simple. If the House of Commons rejects the Lords' amendment for a "meaningful" vote on the final Brexit deal, democracy is dead.

It is the duty of the journalist to speak truth to power. Far too many journalists delinquent in that duty. Uncontested Brexit is the result 
Brexit is our future, the Lords is not  
Instead, her party has surrendered to the hard Brexit agenda of intellectual giants like IDS, Patel, Bone, Dorries, Rees-Mogg, Leadsom etc.  
Fairly bonkers that Hezza seems far more principled & effective on Brexit than the leader of the actual opposition  
There it is. Brexit may indeed turn out to be a bad thing, but we can see now that Indy's negative impact in Scotland is about 25x as bad.

No pleasure to catch up on Brexit news. There is an iron line relabelled 'will of the people'. No questions, no dissent is tolerated. 
#Denmark warns EU against negativity over #Brexit, threatens exit; says hard approach will leave EU behind. Is Denmark preparing for #Dexit? 
Lord Heseltine opposes govt's destructive rush for Brexit & gets sacked. Corbyn votes with the Tories & stays put.  
Tories taking opposition to their mad Brexit plans well......  
The Elite were beaten in the Referendum cos they ignored the British people; so they clearly plan to.....ignore them again! 
Brexit has also buried the Labour Party as well unfortunately. It's no longer trusted by the 16.3 million Remain voters 
Ken Clarke isolated, Michael Hesseltine sacked and the PM in hock to the hard right. Brexit has buried the One Nation Tory Party. 
They call us remoaners, and then call for civil war because Lords voted for parliamentary sovereignty on Brexit.Clever bunch, aren't they?

Lord Heseltine - 'The referendum result is the most disastrous peace-time result we have seen in this country'. #r4today 
Have you no shame @Anna_Soubry ? Referencing your constituents (who voted Leave) after belittling them for voting for #Brexit. Unbelievable.  
Amazing how many Brexidiots still thinks there is a £350m a week dividend from Brexit. 
where on the EU referendum ballot paper did it say we'd hand over dictatorial powers to PM if we voted to leave 
Brexit is now ALL about Tory party politics and a strategy to maintain power. It has nothing to do with the democratic will of the people. 
Hearing rumours PM wants whip removed from Tory rebels who vote against govt over Brexit.

Remarkable that despite Erdogan crushing the opposition, polls show him behind in referendum on imperial presidency.  
The only person to walk out of Theresa May's gov' is scathing about his former colleagues & May's Brexit strategy.  
Fascinating. Details very technical - but doesn't exactly bode well for negotiations on post-Brexit "customs agreement"...  
The #HouseofLords has seamlessly gone from being a place of much needed scrutiny to a chamber of subversion #Brexit #Abolishit 
If May overturns the Lords' amendments she & her #Brexit cabal will haven proven beyond any last doubt the scurrilous nature of their aims. 
Peers are only representing their own business interests by trying to scupper Brexit. Hesletine is a traitor. Self interest, nothing else.

So we are finally going to get a proper debate on Brexit. Nearly a year after the Brexit vote. No rush. 
Not a stunt.People have a clear choice. We voted for our principles & democracy-Lab & tories both for hard brexit & to not give people a say  
"Will of the people" is an awful and inaccurate phrase. Brexit won. 63% of people didn't vote for it. There is no one will of the people. 
The SNP didn't half subject us to a huge relentless disinformation campaign in the lead up to the 2014 referendum.  
Labour and Tories voted against giving the people say on the final brexit deal. It is an old fashioned anti-democratic stitch up.

Rather than Brexit I'd prefer a United States of Europe so we can control our borders, rival Russia & USA, share resources, improve lives. 
So all that talk of wanting to help EU citizens in limbo due to brexit and being trusted to do so then..*coughs such BS coughs* #brexithaos

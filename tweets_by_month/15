I now understand why UK media has upped the anti Buhari news coverage. UK wants to trade with Africa post #Brexit, but Buhari is anti trade.

My summary of key UK positions and impact on the #Brexit negotiations 
Downing Street launched a website setting out its post-#Brexit plans and it immediately broke
UK govt must be worried about #Brexit. They’re deploying the royals. 
I'm chairing an @LibDemConf fringe on #Brexit & Brits in the EU 27. With @acarmichaelmp @BremainInSpain @NewEuropeans
Elizabeth Warren: 'This not the moment we asked for. But it is the moment we are called to. This our test.' Fight #Brexit. It can be beaten.
German Finance Minister: in EU's interest to have strong financial centre in London after #Brexit. Voice of reason. 
Hmm. I wonder how the UK government would have reacted had Brussels told them they couldn't have a #Brexit referendum?
May has been thoroughly out-manoeuvred and out-classed by Sturgeon.So what hope does the UK have in #brexit negotiations with 27 nations?
#ScotRef will go ahead on ScotGov timetable. If WM were to block, then EU could suspend #Brexit negotiations until rUK/Scot issue resolved.

Mrs May would rather Scotland was silent as she drags us into #Brexit chaos. Here's the applause I got in the European Parliament yesterday. 
The Tories were warned in 2014, 2015, and 2016 that #brexit = #indyref2. They don't get to cry "No fair!" now. #ScotRef
#Gold up 2.3%, biggest gain since #Brexit, after #Fed signals a modest pace of #rate hikes. Weak #dollar helping.$DXY@FoxBusiness
Theresa May has stated these words about #ScotRef.Breathtaking hypocrisy. #Brexit 
...Lest we forget... #brexit 
We were all asked to make a decision over #brexit without the necessary information. It suited @theresa_may then. What's so different now?
The Queen of Fascism won't allow the Scots a vote on Indy2, the Brits on #Brexit & the MPs on anything of substance, but we buy elections.
It's starting to dawn on people that those in charge of #Brexit are clueless. We're like passengers on a careering bus driven by chimps. :0
On Theresa May's disastrous and dangerous denial of democratic process  #Brexit #ScotRef
Prepare to shake your head & sigh a lot. No integration whatsoever."I voted #Brexit. Would I go back to UK? No" 
May: Scots shouldn't ‘make a crucial decision without the information they need to make that decision”So that invalidates #Brexit#Remain
Fix it please @BBCNews - they are not "the two women" - they are the First Minister of Scotland and Prime Minister of UK #Brexit
Theresa May, Ruth Davidson & David Mundell are constitutional vandals. Presiding over #Brexit & the slow breakup of the UK. #indyref2
I agree with Theresa May. We shouldn’t make big decisions before having all the evidence.#Brexit is postponed for a decade at least, yes?
So, apparently it's "unfair" to have #ScotRef when @scotgov wants it ... but NOT unfair to force #Brexit on pro-EU Scotland?
Here is my 7th Brexit Challenge paper on the obstacles facing the UK Government during #Brexit Negotiations 
Theresa May actually said this today. I had to read it twice to make sure I wasn't missing anything #Brexit #irony 
UK: The Prime Minister has announced she will block a second referendum on Scottish independence until after Brexit. #indyref2 #Brexit
Delaying till after #Brexit likely means EU nationals don't get a vote despite living in and being part of Scotland - deeply undemocratic.
Fine for the UK to vote in #EUref without knowing what #Brexit means but not for Scots to have #ScotRef - surround sound, Ultra HD hypocrisy
A delay to the #ScotRef gives May time to bargain away Scottish interests during #Brexit negotiations. THAT'S why it's "not a good time".
Eat Your Cereal Scotland. #brexit #ScotRef

And we're off. BREAKING: ##Brexit begins - Queen fires starting gun as she signs Article 50 bill into law  
Of the Tory Remainer MPs now converted to Leavers, how many are cowards and how many were lying before June 23 about being pro-EU?#Brexit

What do the Dutch election results show? That Dutch voters are not a bigoted or gullible as British ones. #Brexit #A50.
It makes perfect sense, don't it?! #brexit #scotref
Scottish farmers to see massive drop in exports to EU countries after #brexit. What are you doing @RuthDavidsonMSP to support our farmers?
So the Tories have no plan for #Brexit. Nothing to worry about, nothing to see, move along. Essential viewing. No EU border in Ireland. 
Dutch election may indicate that in Europe there is growing realisation that #Brexit means chaotic isolationism & will have no imitators
So basically @theresa_may wants to trade away the right to catch the fish for a right to sell said fish My head is spinning #brexit #Tories
So the Tories stole the election that gave us #Brexit #r4today
Waking up without a shock like after #Brexit and #Trump. We love it. #DutchElections #blijfbijons
There's nothing like watching UK's future thrown down toilet then learning people doing it committed electoral fraud to gain office. #Brexit
When the #Brexit referendum was announced, £1 bought 1.43€. As of March 16, 2017 at 09:00AM, £1 buys 1.1437€.
David Davis shows all too starkly why it was so disastrous not to have proper scrutiny built into the Article 50 bill. #Brexit
Have a look at this and tell us a single advantage #brexit, apart from keeping all those nasty foreigners out. 
Remain voters often say to us that they think the fight to stop #Brexit is lost. Our purpose is to prove to them that it is far from over.
The level of incompetence is staggering. Imagine these Tory clowns sitting in Brussels negotiating on our behalf. Laughing stock. #brexit 
This is why we must fight Tory decision to leave single market. This was not on ballot paper and will seriously damage rural areas #Brexit 
Man with no plan – Tory #Brexit Minister admits Westminster Government hasn’t even assessed economic impact of leaving EU without a deal

#Brexit was a vote FOR globalism, for free trade, for a strong UK army, for #NATO, and away from protectionism and weakness. Fuck Putin.
So the Netherlands have rejected #Brexit #trumpialism hoping France and Germany defeat Alt Reich next. Like World War Two  in reverse
@SAshworthHayes Stunning and ignorant David Davis "evidence" on #Brexit terms @euromove
'as many as 3/4 now in favour of staying in EU, warts and all'. Key point: don't have to regard EU as perfect, just much better than #Brexit 
A must-watch for #Brexit enthusiasts  
Astonishingly careless - man in charge of #brexit hasn't even tried to find out how badly it will bankrupt us all. 
Essentially this is Bob Geldof's #Brexit plan #NolanLive
Through its lies & campaigns to mislead the public the #Brexit billionaire press is helping Putin's hybrid war against our democracy.#YesEU
This is truly shocking. Scottish fisheries to be given away to help #brexit looks like our party needs to stand up for #Remain

Possibly the key domestic news story of the day. And not even mentioned on @BBCNews. Unbelievable.  #Brexit 
A practical example of the pitfalls of #Brexit that no-one told us about: (via @POLITICOEurope)
Yet @bbcnews failed to report it in ten o clock news. #brexit 
It is woefully irresponsible of the #UKgovernment to pursue a hard #Brexit before a thorough economic analysis 
Must be very embarrassing for the Prime Minister to have this resurface. You really mustn't share it. #brexit #brexitshambles
WATCH: British dairy & livestock farmers face tariffs of 30-40% if UK leaves EU without trade deal, confirms #Brexit secretary David Davis. 
The truth is that an effective #Brexit will do more to destroy the #EU than any European election result.
A major blow to the #brexit vision of the end of the EU, suddenly #brexit Britain looks very isolated. 
Dutch election: PM Rutte's party wins most seats in election - exit poll. Victory for common sense, unlike #brexit.

Daily Express is forced to retract entire article claiming #Brexit has some benefits : 
Our MPs-looking after our #Brexit interests. Who needs plans & forecasts when it comes to the future of the country?
Erm...surely knowing how many customs officers you have is fairly handy (not a "disproportionate cost") if exiting a customs union?! #brexit 
The Prime Minister plans to demand £9bn of UK assets from the EU. Britain is a net contributor & has a strong hand in negotiations #Brexit
The man in charge of Brexit falls apart when asked a simple question about it. We’re screwed.  #Brexit
Would it have changed any MPs’ minds if they’d heard David Davis admit to total ignorance about #Brexit consequences before they voted?
So, today we learned that parliament voted for Article 50 despite the #Brexit team having done almost no research at all. Great.
Nice! The #Bremain  48% Britons  are calling on the Dutch not to make same mistake! #DutchElections #Brexit 
London use to be a great world City,post #Brexit and #ScotRef its place in the world will diminish.#Edinburgh will be a great E'pean capital

My question to the PM today on how she is risking break up of Britain with her reckless approach to #Brexit #pmqs

How can we be having a referendum because of #Brexit but we are not going to rejoin the EU? The SNP must take us for fools #indyref2
The more you read about #Brexit, the more it looks like getting drunk and coming home from the pub having bought a giraffe.
UK membership of the EU isn't legally binding as the electorate were never asked to join! We joined the EEC! UK should get a refund! #brexit 
But post #Brexit, #Irish border becomes external border of the #EU. Not the same at all. #Davis trying to down play and disguise change.
No due diligence, no risk analysis, no strategy, no credible plan. Good job these jokers aren't running anything important. #brexit 
Our NHS & public services are literally kept going by people born abroad. If #Brexit goes ahead all that will be lost like tears in the rain

Brits made 13million visits to  in 2015. No. 1 destination. Every one covered by EHIC. How as David Davis not even looked at EHIC? #Brexit
David Davis has not *looked* at EHIC he says. EHIC impacts every single Brit who ever travels in the EU. Heretical irresponsibility. #Brexit
UK unemployment has fallen to its lowest in 41 years to a level last seen in 1975! Strong position from which to trigger Article 50 #Brexit
The 'power' of #Brexit! UK #unemployment fell to 4.7% in January, matching the lowest level since 1975! 'Yes' 1975!

2.  I am sickened by the hate and vile bile spewed because Scotland dared to challenges its democratic right to sovereignty post #Brexit
Scotland First Minister @NicolaSturgeon seeks permission for #IndyRef2 in 2018 or 2019  #Brexit 
This feels like history for Scotland & UK. @NicolaSturgeon calls for Section 30 for #indyref2 in autumn 2018 or spring 2019. #brexit
FM says if she rules out 2nd indyref then she alone would be deciding Scotland's future, not the people of Scotland. #Brexit
Civil service doesn't have personnel to cope with #Brexit. That given, adding #indyref2 would be an impossible task to manage.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms Scotland will hold another Independence referendum likely autumn 2018/spring 2019. #Indyref2 #Brexit

Seriously, Labour people, the options aren’t just ‘accept Theresa May’s hard #Brexit’ or ‘oppose the will of the people’. That’s *not* it.

Common sense. This week should see #Brexit triggered. We ARE leaving 
Apparently #Brexit is going to turn out fine. Because the EU is Mordor and Donald Trump is Gandalf. Or something.Reassuring. 
Is this some sort of joke? Get your head out of the 1980s & try addressing the impending catastrophe that'll make us all poorer #brexit 
It would be 'radical' to oppose #Brexit, like 70% of Labour voters, instead of chasing UKIP voters.Pathetic.  
Labour sources tell Sky News they are "80-90% sure" that Article 50 Bill will be passed by the House of Lords by midnight Monday #Brexit 
Seriously. I voted Remain, but does voting for #Brexit make you immune to the hypocrisy of this git? #resist

The march on the 25th is cross party. Many @Conservatives oppose #Brexit as do many @UKLabour members who don't agree with #Corbyn.
Of course the impending job-losses at Vauxhall have nothing whatsoever to do with #Brexit....

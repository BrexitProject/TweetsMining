The best summing up of the UK's decision to #Brexit, from John Oliver: on the money and hilarious: 
#Merkel anxious #Brexit #Leave decision is a sign the European Union is no longer “governable” (by #Germany)
#ENGICE An appalling performance from #Eng players who only look good with technically more gifted immigrants in the Premiership. #Brexit

The best thing about #ENGICE is that it enables people to joke about #Brexit for the first time. Brief respite from uncontrollable weeping.
Little Ms. #Brexit swoon-ed & fell for Mr Iceland. And a rain-sodden Islandwelcomed Baby Bréxitsson.

Leeds taxi driver sd half a dozen clients confessed they'd voted #Brexit but didn't realise Leave meant we'd leave. So yes mean no, yes?
Last Week Tonight with JohnOliver - Brexit Aftermath  #Brexit #Bregret
I hope some clever pollster plots the 'curve of regret' of #VoteLeave supporters week by week, as the #Brexit strategy becomes clear.
First #Brexit. Now a loss to Iceland in #EURO2016. All England seems to be "in" anymore is trouble. #comeuppance
Last Thursday millions voted to get England back. Tonight all their wishes were granted #EURO2016 #Brexit
This has been a tough spell what with #Brexit and all . This is the first time I've smiled since Thursday.  Thank you #England #ISL
We're out of Europe quicker than #Brexit
I guess England took the #Brexit thing pretty seriously
Just like #brexit I don’t think people have any idea how a Trump presidency would tank global markets.  
Time to give Boris the top job. England manager that is. Can't be any worse #Brexit #RoyOut #EURO2016 #ENGICE 
UK's own economic (& social) policy failures have divided the country - #Brexit just makes them harder to address 
@sanambna gets to the core of #Brexit: We need a unified voice 
Congratulations to England on becoming the first team in history to leave Europe twice in one week! #ENGICE #Brexit
Speechless....not an expert but that #brexit is embarrassing....Ctl + Alt + Del...this is all you need....#restart #mentality #complacency
Oh well, at least Twitter will talk about something other than #Brexit tomorrow #everycloud
"Trump blows response to #Brexit vote" 
Looks like England decided to #Brexit the Euro cup 
That's settled then. We're definitely moving to Iceland (if they'll have us)  #Brexit
Embarrassing. Glad we don't pay them an extortionate amount of money whilst our economy tanks.. Oh wait.. #ENGICE #Brexit
Rooney just proved that it is possible to exit Europe without invoking article 50 :-) #ENGICE #Brexit

You know what happens when England votes to #Brexit? You also lose to #Iceland #EURO2016. The fallout is on so many levels :)
Iceland 2 Poundland 1 #ENGICE #Brexit
What's missing in the whole #Brexit debate is a sense of compassion for those who will fare badly.
I haven't been this embarrassed or horrified by an English result since...... Thursday #brexit
#brexit now England out of #EURO2016 - Dont worry, #juniordoctors we can help you escape!
Only England could manage to exit Europe twice in a week #Brexit #eurocup #football #EngVIce
Private Eye were prescient as ever #ENGISL #Brexit 
The outpouring of joy (and schadenfreude) about #ISL beating #ENG shows how #Brexit has brought the continent together. #silverlining
Expect to see #ENG player interviews tomorrow explaining they didn't realise that playing so badly would ACTUALLY mean we'd go out. #Brexit
England out of Europe again: England humiliated as Iceland knock them out of #Euro2016 #Brexit  #Eng #ISL #EngISL
How long until Britons start a petition to replay the game against Iceland? #Brexit #EURO2016
Not as devastating as #Brexit but pretty awful. C'mon Wales!
If you think #Brexit was bad on global markets, if Trump is elected, I'm afraid of a worldwide economic collapse based on fear of him.
Breaking: #Brussels has just accepted tonight's football as trigger for #Art50. BoJo just called Rooney to thank him. #Brexit easy, in'it?!
The petition to replay #ENGISL has already gathered over 2 million signatures #brexit

It seems the England team thought the #Brexit vote was a team talk.
We are definitely out of Europe!! That'll show those 'foreigners' - No one loses like the English!! #EURO2016 #Brexit
If Roy had checked the county-by-county referendum results he would have known Wilshere wanted to be out of Europe. #Brexit #EURO2016

Only England managed to exit Euro twice in the week. #EURO2016 #Brexit
So those England fans singing 'we're not in Europe anymore' after #Brexit were actually singing about the football? #EURO2016 very prophetic

Hello #Brexit! What you thought of that England game. That's what the Premier League would be like without immigrants. #ENGICE
It’s hard to argue that #Brexit hasn’t caused a market crash. That said, we’re 8 years away from 2008. In other words, we’re due.
That's a quick #Brexit

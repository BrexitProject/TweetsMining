Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary serves to under-score the UK's new post-Brexit role on the world stage.A bastard laughing-stock.
What's Cameron's legacy?? racist BREXIT divided swarming superyacht taxevading Panama hacking debt doubling+a pig
Wetherspoons boss says politicians have done too much “doom-mongering” over Brexit
In order for a post-Brexit UK to have a trade deal with *just* Germany, France or Poland, those countries would also have to leave the EU.
am in Dublin, folks here winning work that was going to uk pre #brexit.  #bojo appointed, all laughed. Uk becoming a joke.
This is just Post-Brexit Britain's way of showing the world they still have the best sense of humour #BorisJohnson
What does new Minister for Brexit David Davis think about free movement? Let’s take a look at what he has said…
UK new Brexit minister doesn't know EU states can't make their own, independent trade deals with non-EU members
USA: We bid... one TrumpUK: See your Trump and raise you a Brexit. USA: Trump AND Gingrich. UK: Boris as FOREIGN SECRETARY! USA: Fold
The appt of Johnson, Fox and Davis is a clever move by PM. If they deliver on Brexit she wins, if they fail 'you got us into this mess'.
Can't see ANYTHING GOING WRONG with an overlapping three-ringed circus headed by Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox. :-/ #Brexit #TMPM
Trump, Brexit, Pokemon Go, Boris Johnson. Oh lord, what horrors will you bring us tomorrow?
No wonder Brexit was such a mess... Boris Johnson is British for Gary Busey
New UK prime minister names Boris Johnson foreign secretary, euroskeptic David Davis to lead Brexit talks.
Scotland's First Minister is courting City firms as #brexit looms
Brexit leader Boris Johnson appointed UK foreign minister
I can't believe the acid I took on referendum day hasn't worn off yet.
Theresa May has people looking for a building to house a team who will work on #Brexit
Do read this programme by David Davis, Britain's new EU negotiator, on Brexit. Total fantasy.
David Davis brexit minister sounds good to me...  Also was Farages choice as chief negotiator.
Does @Ukip's only MP think everything else, health, education, pensions, jobs etc is all 'blah blah'? #EuRef #Brexit

This #reshuffle is the shittest game of Cluedo, ever.*spoiler*Boris did it, in the referendum with the racist.
Cameron forced to resign. Osborne booted out. Brexit winning. Boris no longer Mayor. Shawcross in authority. Geldof and co gutted.Pinch me
The truly dangerous cabinet appt by Theresa May is not Boris; it's David Davis as Minister for Brexit. Here's why

Brexit: Why Projections Were Wrong
If you think the Referendum was flawed, and you want a voice, a Labour Party led by @OwenSmith_MP will be that voice.
The question for the EU now is, do they want tariff-free access to the world's fifth or sixth largest economy (the UK), or not? #Brexit
No 10: Cabinet appointments show PM May is committed to Brexit
@DavidAllenGreen minister for Brexit takes his boss to Court next week...in Europe. Funny old World  #TheresaMayPM
A 'Secretary of State for Brexit', plus B. Johnson as Secretary of State. How many more ways are there of saying 'I always wanted Brexit?'
Well done @DavidDavisMP  Brexit Minister
Great Britain... Have we gone completely bonkers?!? #Brexit #BorisJohnsonForeignSecretary
Norman Lamb: "Boris remarks during referendum about Obama should disqualify him from any cabinet position, let alone foreign secretary."
Amazing. The new Brexit minister doesn’t know that the EU has exclusive competence over trade deals.
For those who claim Slasher was a success I give you loss of AAA GDP/capita up 1.2% since 2008 real wages -7% & austerity caused brexit vote
.With @Nigel_Farage's support for the #Brexit Team of  @DavidDavisMP and @LiamFoxMP, that passes the credibility test.
Britain's relationship with the EU may not look very different pre- and post-Brexit. And no one will care.
Let's hope new Brexit Minister David Davis doesn't get upset and tempestuously resign his job and seat on a whim or anything rash like that.
So how quickly will the EU be able to negotiate a deal with the UK, Brexit boss?
If you believe the Referendum was not what democracy should be, a Labour Party led by @OwenSmith_MP will do better.
"Brexit Secretary" for god's sake, call it 'brexitary'. everything's going terribly wrong, just give us 'brexitary'. let us have this
Theresa May has announced David Davis as her Brexit Minister
#BorisJohnson - Foreign Secy#DavidDavis - Brexit Secy#LiamFox - Intl. Trade SecyPM May means "Brexit is Brexit" #reshuffle
George Osborne threw himself on a hand-grenade for Remain, even though he argued against a referendum.  Stuck with Cameron till the end.
Pleased that David Davis, Secretary of State for Brexit, featured in this important list of mine from 2 years ago
Official @theresa_may reason for shortage of cabinet women so far: Brexit trumps gender; & she doesn't rate the female Brexiteers
Three Brexiteers - Boris (Foreign Sec), David Davis (Brexit) and Liam Fox (Trade) - appointed to sort out the problems they have created!
Pirating anime is like voting for the Brexit: your one vote actually *does* matter even if it doesn't look like it on a micro level.
NEVER forget: the man who supported and implemented the racist and xenophobic tone of the Brexit campaign is now foreign minister. #FAIL
This is new Brexit minister's current law suit at European Court against UK for non-compliance with EU law:
3 excellent appointments @LiamFoxMP @BorisJohnson @DavidDavisMP confident #Brexit safe in their hands #reshuffle
No10: appointment of @BorisJohnson, David Davis, @LiamFoxMP shows Prime Minister is committed to #Brexit & intends to unite the Tory party
New Home Secretary on new Foreign Secretary (during EU referendum debates)
Remember, most of PLP saying Corbyn will lose seats in north to UKIP. Smith's 2nd referendum will do that quicker than anything else.
Enjoyed discussing future of our Party & country post-referendum with women members in London. Need real leadership
Voor Nexiters die willen nadenken: "Nothing simple about regaining WTO status post-Brexit" Dit is serieus, mensen
EU Parliament liberal leader (who will have big say in Parliament's Brexit dealings) and Belgian ex-PM on Boris
Something which leaves you intrigued: David Cameron won a decisive mandate to govern for 5 full years. Why should he be blamed for #Brexit??
Appointing @BorisJohnson to Foreign Office, @DavidDavisMP for Brexit & @LiamFoxMP to Int'l trade are very leave positive
So Boris, David Davis and Liam Fox basically told - you championed Brexit  - you deal with it.
#BorisJohnson on Africa "The problem is not that we were once in charge, but that we are not in charge anymore" #colonialism #racism #Brexit
So: new Brexit Minister is currently suing UK government in respect of UK's non-compliance with EU law, at European Court of Justice.
Read David Davis on Brexit & weep. Says firms shld ditch EU regulations, follow regs of their main export markets
The appointment of @DavidDavisMP & @LiamFoxMP to Brexit and International Trade roles are inspired choices. I feel more optimistic now.
David Davis back in gov for Brexit. I ran his 42 days campaign, he's a no nonsense, straight talker. Look forward welcoming him to Brussels.
UK's new foreign policy troika: Boris Johnson at Foreign Office, David Davis in charge of Brexit, Liam Fox as new international trade sec
Also excellent @BorisJohnson as Foreign Sec as role will be responsible for oversight of key #Brexit negotiations.
Now Theresa May is Prime Minister, this is what's going to happen with Brexit
Theresa May faces huge challenges on Brexit and the economy
I wrote for Express online about six weeks ago that David Davis would be ideal to lead Brexit negotiations. Think I was first to do so :-)
David Davis: Trade deals. Tax cuts. And taking time before triggering Article 50. A Brexit economic strategy for UK.
So David Davis is Brexit minister. Like Boris appointment, brave choice - he's very brainy, but very marmite
The new Secretary for Brexit wrote this on that excellent website @ConHome 2 days ago..
Brexit really does mean Brexit
New minister for Brexit David Davis is suing Home Secretary for breaching EU law. Advocate-General opinion next week
In appointing Johnson, May has: (a) made a grand unifying gesture; (b) demonstrated her commitment to Brexit; (c) torpedoed Brexit.
Brexit minister @DavidDavisMP currently has a case against UK government before European Court of Justice, to impose EU law on UK.Awkward.
David Davis head of the new Department for 'Brexit' (poor Jeremy Corbyn - a new department to find someone to shadow)
Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox - 3 "outers" in charge of speaking to the wider world. In case you had any doubts, Brexit IS Brexit.
David Davis Is 'Minister For Brexit In May Government
David Davis becomes the new Minister for Brexit. Sound.
Here’s the man in charge of Brexit: David Davis
I was lucky enough to speak with the incredibly honest @neilhimself: on his books, Brexit, and TV adaptations
May is trying to hermetically seal herself off from Brexit. Might be astute politically but means giving very important positions to idiots.
Wonderful. So @theresa_may really, really, means it: Brexit means Brexit  Thank God.
David Davis wrote 2,000-word piece on his Brexit strategy two days ago:
In her first hour as PM Theresa May has put the "does Brexit really mean Brexit?" issue to bed.
David Davis to head up the new Brexit department
By her appointments so far it's already clear that Theresa May means "Brexit is Brexit"...
David Davis is Secretary of State for Brexit. Massive job. Pre-Cameroons balanced with post-Cameroons. Cameroons out
BREAKING: David Davis has been appointed as Brexit Secretary in Theresa May's Cabinet.
Apparently if you put lies onto a bus that help confuse electorate to vote Brexit, #TheresaMay thinks your deserve to be in her #Cabinet
David Davis will be the man in charge of delivering Brexit for Britain. He has just been appointed to the new role by #TheresaMayPM
Yesterday I presented a bill to Parl. to secure EU nationals right to stay in UK post Brexit, you can watch here:
Live footage of #BorisJohnson arriving at the #Brexit negotiations:
So which ministers are going to run Brexit department?  All else is blah blah ....
My thought exactly. Brexiter in big job, but not *the* Brexit job. Will keep him busy and abroad. Harder to plot.
Britain's top diplomat. #Brexit, #Syria, #ISIS. What could possibly go wrong? #BorisJohnson
Liam Fox will lead up a new Department for International Trade - essential if Brexit is to be successful. #TheresaMayPM
.@DavidDavisMP is our Minister for #Brexit.This is good, this is really good.
@PHammondMPCongrats,'Brexit means Brexit'#Biafra: Please support #BiafraExit from #terrorist & murderous Nigeria.
My guess: Johnson/FCO won't have big role in Brexit negotiations. Will be led by PM (EUCO) and Brexit dept
If "the old knuckle duster", David Davis is Minister for Brexit to negotiate with the #EU, it could be an inspired choice. A toughey!
If Liam Fox is made Brexit minister I vote we just fire Trident at ourselves.
Combination of Grayling & Johnson in charge of Brexit suggests our new PM 1. has a dark sense of humour and/or 2. is sabotaging the project.
David Davis is minister for #BRExit #Reshuffle
On the other hand... Given BoJo is at heart a Remainer but led Leave (the duplicitous shit) and F-Sec may have Brexit duties. Interesting...
Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary an inspired move. No influence over Brexit but will make a brilliant after-dinner speaker in the Congo.
The Foreign Office has just been reduced to a peripheral role. Foreign policy will now be run from number 10 and the Brexit Office.
Nah, it’s tactical as fuck. May ensuring  Vote Leavers will get the blame for further Brexit disasters.
Actually, Boris To FCO not so mad. Brexit dept will do heavy lifting, no 10 takes over foreign policy in a crisis. What's left is showbiz
Amber Rudd, remember her from the EU Referendum debates? Charming woman.... Not. Becomes Home Secretary.
Boris Johnson to FCO is a perfect move. In place to receive all the blame for every Brexit disappointment and failed negotiation
A Brexit Lesson:You can lie, turn the world upside down, ignore any consequences of your actions & be rewarded with the world #BorisJohnson
Whiny Remain bitches will yearn for all eternity for Brexit to fail

Must say I am really pleased for Boris Johnson - he showed real bottle to come out for Brexit and helped the campaign enormously.

Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson enters the Brexit negotiations
Boris is Foreign Secretary, dear god, as if Brexit hasn't alarmed our overseas allies enough
So @BorisJohnson will be in charge of the delicate diplomacy around the world, though not Brexit negotiations - so US, Turkey, Russia etc...
Will the Secretary of State for Brexit be made First Secretary of State, and therefore superior to Boris Johnson?
Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary will want to promote post-Brexit Britain as globally engaged, not retreating from international stage
Europe reacts to the appointment of Boris Johnson as Brexit UK's Foreign Secretary
So, #GeorgeOsborne has been sacked! #Brexit has done some good then! His #ProjectFear will be his political epitaph. Richly deserved.
God good, Boris Johnson is Foreign Secretary. After captaining Brexit. Not sure whether hilarious or terrifying.
Brexit Buffoon is foreign secretary ? Dear God .

Boris as the new Foreign Secretary makes sense. It means the ministers in charge of the Brexit department will not be battling with the FCO.

I no longer have faith in what any politician says. I'm only interested in what they do. Let's get #Brexit started.
After voting for Brexit to get rid of "unelected leaders" in Brussels, Britons now get 4 yrs of PM May, no election.
71% of Londoners and 65% of Scots are concerned about how Brexit will impact their jobs.
May should call a general election and parties should offer their post-Brexit plans - voters should decide what direction we should take.
Thanks again to all Britons who voted for Brexit. You showed courage and reason. Europe owes you more than words can describe.
Prime Minister-in-waiting, Theresa May, says "Brexit means Brexit" – and that "serious change" must come from it.

Long-shot best case: UK & EU treat #Brexit as a shared near-death experience that leads EU to reform & UK to stay.
Maybe she could quit every day for the next 251 days till it's back to pre-her-Brexit-fuckery levels.
Case for general election this year now overwhelming. Tory manifesto in tatters. Country divided post referendum. May has no mandate.
Our new study finds a small spike in xenophobic tweets post #Brexit - and a huge spike in pro-immigration tweets.
Nope. I think May's stance on Brexit, migration & economic fairness will play well with 2016-17 electorate

Leadsom campaigned to leave the EU; May was in the "remain" camp, but has said as prime minister she would carry out the Brexit.
Leadsom withdraws, May will be PM > The Brexit black comedy and Scotland’s golden opportunity
So we’re going for a Brexit that only 52% voted for, led by a PM that nobody voted for, who doesn’t even believe in it anyway. Well done us.
Less than 3 weeks after the EU referendum, article 50 still not invoked, Remainer takes over as PM, & without a vote. #takebackcontrol
May is new PM.So: no Article 50 notification this year.Which means: Brexit unlikely before 2019.
#Leadsom #Brexit the first fortnight(ish)

Brexit < Netflix.
- A Brexit campaign built on lies- An unelected leader for PM- A labour party tearing itself apart British politics is a joke right now.
These Brexiteers just keep leaving the scene, don't they? It's almost as if Brexit isn't going to be what they cracked it up as.
Rest of #EU can now start to plan. #TheresaMay is a known quantity from Ministerial meetings #Brexit
Could Theresa May's Brexit strategy be to do nothing and wait for the other 27 to self-destruct? That might actually work.
So 'take back control' means all #Brexit architects quit, a PM elected by nobody, years of economic and legal chaos, and no-one accountable.
Your new PM. In charge of Brexit.
Latest #Brexit shocker: U.K. gets new PM without public vote  pic.twitter.com/cIFozI1t1G
May repeated 'brexit means brexit' this morning - Leadsom's campaign supporters will make sure that happens
So to recap. David Cameron resigned as PM cos he was against Brexit, replaced by Theresa May, unopposed, also against Brexit.
(3/3) I do not consent to be governed by an unelected PM with no mandate to negotiate Brexit. We need a general election now.
Theresa May. A remainer to negotiate #BrexitGreat. Just Great.
Farage, Johnson, Gove, Leadsom: all down.The Curse of Brexit is the political version of Curse of Lord Gnome.

A new brand of leadership = 'Leavership'.Every single Poster Girl + Boy for Brexit has exited, left the sinking ship #leavership #brexit

.@BorisJohnson You lot created this mess. You demanded a referendum few people wanted, misled the public and then walked away. Shame on you.

Post #Brexit, let's get trading with the rest of the world... cc @brenthoberman @gd_innes @duncanclark
Big @andrealeadsom beast @BorisJohnson welcomes new PM and is delighted she has made clear "Brexit means Brexit"
What a bunch of broken reeds and empty vessels the Brexit politicians have proved almost immediately to be.
Taking back control post-Brexit: having a woman elected with 35,453 votes in Maidenhead run a country of 64 m as PM
Seriously though, not one prominent Brexit politician remains in the public eye. Are we sure it actually happened?
"I voted Brexit because I don't wanted to be dictated to by a body of unelected officials" Enter Remainer Theresa May, our new Unelected PM.
3/3 I’ve no doubt Theresa will make an excellent Prime Minister and I'm encouraged that she's made it clear that Brexit means Brexit.
Go find a lawyer and watch their face as they realise Chris Grayling may now be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Just waiting for May to announce a referendum to ignore the previous referendum and allow Cameron to stay on as PM. It's now beyond parody.
Boris Johnson supports Theresa May now. A Brexiteer who secretly wanted to Remain wanting a Remain PM who now supports Brexit. I'm dizzy.
Tories cant deliver own leadership contest or preferred referendum result but will run UK till 2020 with support fm 24% of electorate. Grim
So there we are. A referendum that was about the people choosing our leaders has led to a new PM being decided by one very silly interview
No satire can keep up with British politics right now. Carry On Up Your Brexit.
There's a gaping hole in political market for #compassionateconservative who believes in Brexit Britain which @SuzanneEvans1 seems made for
Post Brexit politics: Resigned, resigned, pushed, ignored, A big bunch resigned, withdrawn. &I still can't see Labour winning the next GE.
from @BorisJohnson - May will provide the authority and leadership necessary; encouraged that Brexit means Brexit
We need a General Election ASAP. Not because of #Brexit. I’m just not spending the next four years in a dress.

Complete failure as Home Secretary. We want full Brexit not a stitch up. #NoWayMay #ToryLeadership #Brexit #Leadsom
For a country that just voted to quit the EU, British politics has never been more continental European than it is at the moment #brexit
So all the main brexit campaigners:-1.  Lied 2.  Have quitA generation stymied by rich, blinkered bigots - from media & politics.
This is the funniest Brexit meme I've seen so far.And I don't even like cats
It’s 9,000km away, but #Brexit has hit #Japan hard  #economics
And: Cameron's strategy worked. All those who campaigned for #Brexit now lying dead on the battleground. Nobody wanted the responsibility.
Last of the Leavers quits. Andrea Leadsom says biz need certainty after er... Her Brexit vote unleashes uncertainty
This is the only politician we can trust. We've been stitched up right since. Brexit given to Tory Vote Leave.
May will NOT deliver #Brexit  Tory elite takes big step towards dictatorship and slippery slope to civil war with hatchet job on  #Leadsom
Just looking around to see how many #Leave campaign leaders have stuck around post-#Brexit result
It really is extraordinary that every single main rabble rouser for Brexit has quit. What a fucking shower.
Who voted for this PM?We are now going to have a PM who is not accountable for Brexit.
Brexit inevitably meant major political upheaval. There's something efficient about how Conservatives got through their upheaval in 3 weeks.
To say I'm disappointed is a gross understatement! It is now time to move forward & get behind our new Prime Minister Theresa May & #Brexit
Every little thing she did was Brexit Everything she did just made me vom Now she makes a speedy wimpy exit Give it up for Andrea Leadsom
As predicted, we've been well and truly screwed over by Tory MP's & MSM, not even a vote for a Brexit leader; just disgusting #Consequences
Johnson, Gove, Leadsom campaigned for Brexit, fell apart when they got it. Disgraceful campaign, led by people not fit to lead country.
Tis the curse of #Brexit I tell you.Dave... Osbo .. Boris... Farage ... Gove... Leadsom .. #ToryLeadership
Leadsom quits and Brexit’s grisly clown car of insane, opportunistic cowards adds one more passenger.

Genuine Q, Brexit voters: does the speed with which so many leading Brexiters have imploded give you even the slightest pause for thought?
Leadsom to resign: That wld be all of them then. BREXIT leaders say follow us & then leave themselves!  What was that about sinking ships??
Andrea Leadsom says Theresa May is ideally placed to implement 'Brexit' and a nine-week leadership campaign is "highly undesirable"
Andrea Leadsom quits Tory leadership race. From Brexit to Legsit?! :)
It's incredible how Brexit has led to all of its leaders leaving.
Conservatives who thought Leadsom would be leader, here's how to join #UKIP - the only way to ensure Brexit!
Every single MP who argued for Brexit has now thrown in the towel and abdicated any responsibility for negotiating it.
Just to recap:-Boris > quit-Farage > quit-Gove > eliminated-Leadsom > quit#Brexit #EUref
Andrea Leadsom quits Conservative leadership race, saying "Theresa May is ideally placed to implement Brexit"
Would you beleive it. Not one brexit Left. Cut & Run...
Leadsom says business needs certainty (before she goes). A few days ago she said Brexit was going to be a breeze.
Leadsom: Theresa May 'ideally placed to implement Brexit on best possible terms' for people. Why run then?
Much as I hate the idea of Brexit, is it too much to expect one politician who actually believes in it not to run away from this mess?
"Business needs certainty" says someone who campaigned for pointless chaos of Brexit. #leadsom
Love how every single Leave politician leaves everything they've ever started before they finish it. Brexit by name, Brexit by nature.
Does anyone who supported Brexit actually want to be Prime Minister - or are they all fleeing the mess they created?
To ALL Tories who are now denied democracy in their own party & want to fight for #Brexit COME ON OVER to #UKIP. You're more than welcome
So #Brexit. We're out of Europe. EVERY single one of your leaders RAN away. And now it's Remainers left to clear up your mess. WELL DONE!
.@BorisJohnson, @Nigel_Farage, @Gove2016 and now @andrealeadsom. The #Leave campaign responsible for #Brexit have now truly abandoned ship.
And, with that, the last Brexit leader departs from the public arena, muttering about how hard it is to do politics in real life. #Leadsom
With Leadsom out of the Conservative leadership race, there are no #Brexit leaders left to sort out this mess. Irresponsible, all of them.
Going...going ...gone ? first Boris, then Gove, now Leadsome? Brexiteers win the EU referendum but fail to take the Tory leadership
#Brexit voted #Leave to take back control and have now ended up with an unelected, #Remain Prime Minister.
IT IS NOW UP TO ALL OF US WHO VOTED TO FREE OUR NATION, TO HOLD THOSE TO ACCOUNT FOR A REAL BREXIT! MAKE OUR VOICE HEARD! GIVE NO QUARTER!

Remember "Brexit means Brexit".
@andrealeadsom please don't let this media nonsense stop you from running The UK needs you to deliver the #Brexit we voted for #dontgoandrea
Leadsom quits meaning after #Brexit UK will have a PM who campaigned to "remain". You Brits make me laugh.

Is there anyone who wanted Brexit still in politics?
No Brexit leader has managed more than a week of scrutiny
Theresa May's campaign for Tory leadership summed up in a gif. #Leadsom #May #Brexit
utterly extraordinary how after the Leave team collapsed, the Remain team are not just binning off the idea of Brexit outright
#THERESAMAY ALL WHO VOTED FOR #BREXIT WILL BE WATCHING YOU! DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE OUR RESOLVE OR ABILITY! DO NOT DOUBLE CROSS US! #BBC #SKY
Theresa May a Prime Minister voted for by "Nobody" well done Brexit you got your democracy
Between the Iowa caucus and the conventions we've managed to: call a referendum, hold the referendum and now very possibly pick a new PM.
The Dalai Lama is right. Their stay should be temporary, they should go back & build their own country. #Brexit #EU
Prime Minister May would be best news Brussels had since June 23. Desperate for a Brexit interlocutor that EU27 can trust and respect.
Utterly extraordinary how Brexit team in Govt has consumed itself and left the Remain team with the job of implementing Brexit.

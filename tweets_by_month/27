It's actually more nauseating to watch the media let him do it. #Brexit 
However you voted, leave or remain if you are not concerned by the current state of politics you are a fool.The right wing are driving #brexit at any cost and this may suit you now, but soon that same disregard will fall on you. We are handing our country to zealots.#FBPE
And this is before #Brexit......Cross-Channel passengers delayed by tougher security checks - BBC News 
Brexit is not about handing power back to the british people. This is evidenced by the total disregard for parliament.It is about handing power to the few.Dont be fooled our country is in the grip of a silent coup#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
Why the hell should we care what Mark Littlewood thinks about #Brexit?? He says that it must not be reversed and that Tony Blair was wrong to suggest it should be. The word of a great former PM is more relevant than some non-entity who works for an unimportant Think Tank  #bbcaq
OPINION: #SkripalCase 'great piece of political theatre' to distract from #Brexit 
Richard Burgess, BBC Head of News, cannot explain why it did not cover thousands of people campaigning for a Peoples Vote on #Brexit, but did cover a Farage stunt 
"We are in very dangerous times" - Bob Geldof on the growth of nationalism across Europe and the EU's major miscalculation on #Brexit #latelate
"I actually wish Tony Blair and others... would turn their energies to making sure that we got the best #Brexit possible, rather than trying to reverse a democratic decision which had more votes in favour of it than any vote in UK history" - @MarkJLittlewood #bbcaq
Dear @bbcnews, Please can your presenters not say ‘we WILL leave the EU  next March.’You need to respect parliamentary & civic democracy, which leaves open the possibility that we won’t #Brexit.As a compromise, do as @huwbbc did the other night & say ‘we’re set to leave’.
Chucking dead meat in a dirty river is a perfect description of most  #brexit arguments.
Wrong @BBCr4Feedback, the newsworthy element #brexit and fishing isn't that it upsets @ScotTories MPs who were exposed as Westminster Tory fodder. It matters to the Scottish fishing communities they've betrayed & that's what you should cover.
I’d missed this by @JohnJCrace on Thursday  Not only it funny, but it is also correct and tragic too.#Brexit
This is the country which Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson, Michael Gove & other Brexiteers made. A land where intolerance & ignorance have full vent. This is from last night's @BBCNewsnight #Brexit special from Nottingham. 
Sorry but #Corbyn might have gone to loads of places but that was to keep #Labour members onside and no other reason - he never showed even a tenth of the passion he showed during the GE campaign and I don't believe he even voted #Remain, I really don't#Brexit 
The sky won’t fall in. Lowering the threshold for success. #Brexit
On attempts to reverse #Brexit: "If a referendum involving that many votes is going to mean anything, and if we are going to live in a democracy, it's important that you carry out the will of the people, even if you are grotesquely disappointed" - @MarkJLittlewood #bbcaq
BREXIT: No wonder Tories are keeping a low profile over the latest Cambridge Analytica evidence /#EU #Brexit 
Another failure to address the real issues of #Brexit - platitudes and mantras at the ready though in NI as they were in Scotland , Wales and Northern England during her disastrous “ one year to go” tour.

Very interesting indeed!I'm sure I can't be alone in wondering if Mueller has any UK citizens among the persons of interest to his investigation.And whether Mueller's Russia probe have implications for #Brexit ? 
Theresa May has learned absolutely nothing from her General Election campaign last year - her little fly around yesterday in the name of #brexit was as heavily stage managed as ever! Here you can see she had a choice between meeting people or meeting cows for instance... 
Germany is in exactly the same "restricted trade situation"as we are yet they do a lot better with trading outside the EU than we do so it's not down to membership of the EU: they just make better stuff than we do. #brexit is bonkers 
We are the 73%. Labour voters don't want #Brexit and it's certainly not inevitable. Join our campaign and let's turn this around. 
This is our PM ladies and gentlemen.. She swore on oath to protect this country.... I rest my case  #Brexit #Toxic
That was an act of terrorism; hate crime is attacking and/or abusing people because of their nationality, race, religion, sexuality etc and it rocketed after the #Brexit vote - I'm sorry the truth upsets you 
Very clear thoughts by @henrikenderlein on #Brexit. Depth and breadth of British self-inflicted wounds are just amazing. 
It's so unusual to get any mention of the pro EU protests on #BBCR4 that my wife came running in to tell me. Well done Roger Bolton on 'Feedback' for properly questioning the censoring of #Brexit protests from #BBC's news stream. @Andrew_Adonis #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Once again I'd like to thank Bob Geldof for helping LEAVE win the referendum.   His vulgar performance on the Thames helped swing it . #Brexit #LateLateShow
To judge by the large branch of @BootsUK I went into today, the company is preparing its customers for the #Brexit retail experience: gaps on the shelves and long queues at the understaffed checkouts.

1 New trade deals - UK wants to roll over same as we had with EU2 SIngle Mkt - we want "frictionless trade as possible" with EU3 EU Laws - UK plans to keep EU regulationsWhich leaves Freedom of Movment - immigration - which for 20months we were told #Brexit "was never about".
The nation was mis-sold #Brexit with promises that can't be delivered. @Theresa_May refuses to say if Brexit 'is worth it'. But she does say that #Britain will be 'different'. So, this is no longer just about Brexit. This is about what kind of country we want Britain to become.
It was the historic moment when @Theresa_May signed the #Article50 letter and finally set #Brexit in motion.And now, with just one year to go, the Prime Minister has sought to enshrine the memory in the form of a portrait:

Tell your brother the timeline. Boris falls out with Cameron 3 months before the #Referendum. #EU propose a tax avoidance directive 1 month before. The directive becomes law Jan 19. Hence why Hogg &Co are eager for a hard brexit. Is your brother aware of what #Brexit really is?

1. Sorry....what was that she was saying about taking back Control of our Borders....if we can't trust her to get that fact right is it any surprise more & more of us can't trust the rest of the Tory #Brexit BS
The Labour Party has been lost to the far left. An ugly hate-filled hard left. Time for moderates in @UKLabour & the @LibDems to talk. To oppose #BrexitTo create a new progressive and compassionate political party.
Of course it's in breach;But rest assured BBC will always give itself a clean bill of health whatever the evidence..#indyref #Brexit or #CambridgeAnalytica
my takeOnLatest #Brexit #TheresaMay #Putin situ  @CLewandowski_ @realDonaldTrump @GovMikeHuckabee @colette_dowell @ForeignPolicy @ManUtd
This is the problem. #Brexit supporters are basically fighting a war with Germany that doesn't exist. They are successful because they have invested in industry and have economies of scale. UK has been ripping the guts out of industry and under-funding infrastructure for years.
Another brilliant exposé of the total non-coverage of last weekend's #MarchesAgainstBrexit all over the Country.People want a #FinalSayForAll on the #Brexit #WithdrawalAgreement.Of no interest to a BBC worried about annoying the Government and losing its licence fee - no?
Nearly a year since @stevesymondsAI & I wrote this article. Proving status difficult before, then & more so in years to come for #children of #EUCitizens. #citizenship #Brexit 
She's brilliant. Gives us an insight into how disenfranchised young people feel over #Brexit. You know, according to YouGov poll data, 75% of 18-24s voted to remain in the EU, whilst 16-18 yr olds had no vote!
Just think of how much good Our NHS could do with the £150,000 that the #A50Challenge  idiots are going to p**s away on lawyers in a truly hare-brained attempt to stop #Brexit
2010 Equality Act now means some people have got jobs that shouldn't with the best candidates losing out. Obviously, this is unfair but the problem goes further. Doesn't it denigrate the countries workforce, eventually making us less competitive globally? #TurningRight #Brexit 
Her recent comments on @BBCNews show @Theresa_May KNOWS #Brexit is not 'worth it', except perhaps (like @JeremyCorbyn?) for temporarily holding her grim party (aka mob of wealthy Tory Leavers) together? (and saving face?) #CountryBeforeParty #StopBrexit #HistoryWillNotForgive
British fishermen tired of taking 'scraps' from Brussels are counting down the days to #Brexit, and escaping the ill-founded and tyrannical rule of the EU's CFP.

#Brexit is making the ‘union’ more fragile than ever. Future outside the EU should lead to pressing ‘reset’ on UK, too - time to redesign Britain as a collective of independent countries working closely together - a ‘new union’ of sovereign British nations. 
ComRes poll for Express shows that only 29 % are optimistic that their household will be better off after #Brexit while 44% are pessimistic  -  but Express didn't publicise that bit! Why not? Afraid that people are no longer swallowing the #LeaveLies ?

The plan for life after #Brexit should have been in place before the 2016 #EURef.The fact it wasn't,is a clear dereliction of duty on the part of the Tory Gov.
Excellent account of #Brexit promises that the #government has quietly dropped - no doubt hoping that #Leave voters won’t notice they’ve been lied to:
On Good Friday 20 years ago, the peace agreement was signed in Northern Ireland. Any decisions that can put it at risk would be unforgivable. #Brexit 
Government saying they will not enforce border checks after #Brexit is utter madness.  Turning a blind eye to all goods entering the UK would simply not work. This is a startling admission and another broken promise by Brexiters.
On Good Friday we must not forget the horrors that led to the Northern Ireland/Ireland Agreement 20 years ago. Beggars belief that #Brexit supporters want to endanger that

This poll suggests that the “status quo acceptance” the Good Friday Agreement created among the “soft middle” nationalist community has been blown away by #brexit.Irish unification now “baked in” - just a question of time now.Brexit has finished the UK. 
How has #Article50 half-way day been for you?I hope May ignoring #CambridgeAnalytica #Brexitgate, condoning use of military psy-ops on voters & endorsing breaking electoral rules/data protection law, then rubbing salt in by lying about a #Brexit dividend encourages you to FIGHT.

May: 'we won't be sending vast sums of money to the #EU'.The amount we send is so small it's difficult to find on a pie chart of Government expenditure. But the economic benefits & citizen rights we get are massive. #bbcnews #Brexit

The UK’s car crash of a Brexit government is planning to leave our allies in the European Union on 29th March 2019. With one year to go, let’s review their progress.#Brexit #1yrArticle50 #FinalSay
“It is nothing short of disgraceful that we have no more clarity today than we did on referendum day or on the day Article 50 was triggered”: @NicolaSturgeon #Brexit

The #Brexit that is being implemented is not the one that was sold. According to the Government’s own figures, we will be worse off in every situation after #Brexit. @theresa_may must show a backbone and grant the public a meaningful vote on the deal.
 @NicolaSturgeon: A year out from Brexit, we still don’t have any answers to basic questions about #Brexit - that’s deeply concerning. 
“There are many people in Scotland, like I do, despair at the direction the Prime Minister is taking the country in at the moment”: @NicolaSturgeon on @BBCNews #Brexit
“The UK government wants to centralise powers at Westminster, we simply cannot allow devolved powers to Scotland nor Wales to be stripped away”: @NicolaSturgeon on @BBCNews #Brexit

I won't comment this time, you decide. Consider how well you think #Brexit is going and then watch this clip of the BBC's Assistant Political Editor's assessment of Theresa May's handling of Brexit. Give your own score of how objective and impartial he is... 
One of #Brexit's ironies is that those areas with the highest #Leave vote will suffer most harm from #Brexit. I hope political parties are being responsible & explaining the real risks to them. #CarManufacturing cld go. #Sunderland #NorthEastHour#1yrArticle50 #CountdownToBrexit

Why are #Brexit supporters so implacably opposed about a referendum on the deal? If it is going to be such a great deal surely everybody would want vote for it. Are Brexiteers actually worried that there won’t be a great deal on offer?
And that, dear hockey community, was the official reason that #Brexit happened.#import

Had a lively, emotive debate on @bbcasiannetwork with Tory, Labour & UKIP politicians this morning. I put across the case that only the @LibDems are the party of 'remain' & want to give a final #voteonthedeal & a voice to the people who reject this divisive #Brexit. #FinalSay
Tony Blair knows full well that if we were to offer a 2nd referendum on the final deal that the EU would have no incentive to offer us any deal at all.IMHO Tony Blair is [by far] the most loathsome politician of my 51 years.#Brexit & #LeaveEU

You were super-great Madeleina. Farridge's excuse regarding failure to do his job in representing UK on Common Fisheries Policy clearly stupid; they cannot 'have no power' and be part of a EU superstate at the same time. The 'scales' are falling from the public's eyes on #Brexit.
UK citizens living in the EU could well feel #Brexit will leave them out in the cold.Home Secretary Amber Rudd has told a parliamentary committee:"It will be up to EU countries to make their own decisions on what they will do with UK citizens."

Ironic reallyThe "Blairites" were accused 8 yrs ago of offering "austerity lite",which was why, apparently, they couldn't beat the ToriesLabour's gone through a "new kind of politics" revolution only to end up with the Corbynites offering "#Brexit lite", with the same outcome 
8 years before I was born the British public were given their say on whether they wanted to be members of what they thought was merely a trading block. So I am very grateful that @Conservatives gave us a #FinalSay after 41 years of experience. We voted for #Brexit end of!

Theresa May giving it large today about all the brilliant things that #Brexit will bring us. Which day exactly did she change her mind on this? Couldn’t have been the day Cameron resigned and there was a vacancy for PM, could it? 
#EuSuperNurse has just joined the battle against #Brexit!! Is it worth it? #StopBrexitSaveBritain #EuSuperHeroDay
Parliament's Northern Ireland Affairs Committee recently published a report in which they concluded there is no technical solution available to create an “invisible” border. If we want to protect the Good Friday Agreement, we must keep an open mind about #Brexit.
#FinalSay "When will we know what we voted for?"When the poorest become militantly desperateWe long for an NHS Areas on EU regeneration funding become ignored dustbowlsThe precious Pound falls through the floorWe become a racially divisive slave to corporate America#Brexit
Reminder: Right-wing Brexiters want to scrap the #NHS. A recession caused by a no-deal Brexit plus a trade-deal with the USA would be ideal for achieving that goal, opening up a huge new realm for profiteering and slashing the tax bills of the rich.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit

It's going well #brexit #1yrArticle50 Anyone know what the plan is apart from Brexit means Brexit? #AskingForAFriend
Our Prime Minister has basically said that she doesn't care whether or not the Brexit vote was legitimate or democratic - she intends to implement #Brexit anyway. Even if it is the result only of corruption and lies. How can she be allowed to get away with this? 
EXCLUSIVE: Commenting on our EU military news this morning, @DianeJamesMEP tells #Brexit Facts4EU "I utterly condemn the EU's attempts to arm itself and subvert the efforts of NATO". Full story: 
The number of cars made in Britain fell in February as domestic demand slumped by "double digit figures", industry figures suggest. #Brexit-related uncertainty is weighing on consumer spending decisions.
She's right sadly Clearly not every #Brexit supporter is racist but the vast majority of racists back Brexit - it's given the green light to bigots to be loud & proud about their hate & this is backed up by the fact hate crime has rocketed since June 2016#1yrArticle50 #LBC
Listening to @mrjamesob is a shot in the arm for reality after a #Brexit phone in on #5Live. Thank goodness for James,  still doing his best to push back against the tide of disinformation and dishonesty promoted on much of the rest of the media - most disappointingly the #BBC

The OBR report accompanying the Spring Statement predicted UK GDP growth to be 1.5% or below for the next 5 years, the worst performance since the WWII. This is far slower than had been predicted pre-referendum. #Brexit is harming our economy and this will only worsen.

A short thread: We don’t have “one year to stop #Brexit”. We have much less than that. A necessary condition for stopping Brexit is strong, eloquent, cogent opposition to it in Parliament, in roughly six months when the in-principle deal comes back to be ratified.
Balls, cherries or cakes. What's the biggest #Brexit cliché of all? 
1.2m UK citizens who live in the EU and have been there for 15+ years will have their right to reside anywhere in the EU negotiated as part of #Brexit. They will have no say. They were excluded from voting in the EU ref. - Great British Democracy?
I think on some level you *know* politicians are corrupt but the #CambridgeAnalytica thing is just so beyond corrupt it's plain criminal. And based on this, the people who would STILL push ahead with #brexit are either criminals or stupid. That is all.
Want to know how #Brexit will affect the 1.3mn @britishineurope? Read @gavinquinney 's personal take here:  And by his own admission, he's one of the luckier ones. #1yrArticle50

.@EmilyThornberry loose talk can cost jobs when you suggest Labour might vote for the deal.  Your key test for backing #Brexit, requires the UK to get the ‘exact same benefits as we currently have as members of the single market and customs union’ if we Brexit.  It won't be met.

What's forgotten in this mind-numbing row is that the Remain campaign was not Stronger In. It was 10 Downing Street which mobilised every resource, called in all its favours (Obama, WTO), got corporates to plant stories and abused purdah. So fuck off about "fairness". #Brexit

Will we know if the Leave campaign broke the law? Yes, probably.Will we know if that was enough to change the result? No, and we should not try.We need to know: was the law - that’s in place to organise a free and fair vote - respected? If not, then a re-run. Simple. #Brexit
In summary, the reason voters came to believe #Brexit lies was not:1. Politicians telling them lies;2. Newspapers telling them lies;3. Campaign posters telling them lies; or4. Lies in memes targetted at them or circulated by trolls.It was something else. Something unknowable

The Tories obsession with holding their party together, taking us out of the Single Market & Customs Union is crippling our economy. Unilever’s relocation to the Netherlands demonstrates how vulnerable the UK is with #Brexit. The EU protects British firms, jobs and tax revenues.

Wow...This is amazing - the 11 major #Brexit promises the govt guarnateed before - & what govt has agreed now...Apparentally "we all knew what we voted for" but simultaneously Brexit now looks very different to that the Govt promssed just months ago.

1. Utter madness. Offering the Ppl a Binding #FinalSayForAll on the deal with a #Remain option doesn't Thwart the Will nor disrespect the Ref it merely Confirms if the Ppl still want #Brexit or now to #StopBrexitSaveBritain. It's the only way any #Brexit can be morally legitimate

I wonder whether Brexit Tories want #Brexit at any price including the price of democracy @LibDems @edwarddavey
Conservative voters agree with ex-PM Major that the people, not party whips, should have a vote on final #Brexit deal, with 42.8% to 33.6% in favour of such a vote, according to poll of Tory voters held by Survation. Surely @theresa_may has to listen to her supporters!
Strange silence in UK after #EUCO guidelines on future relationship post #Brexit. Why?1) No difference seen between PM’s Mansion speech concept of mutual recognition and EU-FTA? 2) Or concepts way too different?3) Not the right moment to talk?EU awaiting UK response...
How odd that the Tories are telling Scotland that we can't have powers over immigration, could have sworn they were telling us the opposite before the #Brexit referendum... 
The EU tolerated Britain’s inflated self-belief while it was a member, but now it's leaving, British exceptionalism seems to reside only in Brexiters’ heads. The #Brexit talks will come down to plain old national interest — and Britain is outnumbered.
Why is #Brexit taking sooo long? 
Unless a transition deal for aviation is signed, flights to the EU after March 2019 will be at risk. Prices will inevitably rise post #Brexit but the gvt. must clarify consumer rights and strike an aviation deal as soon as possible or consumers will face post-#Brexit disruption.

I couldn't agree more (and I'm ex staff, as was my father back in the 1950s and 1960s). I think the BBC is one of the most important institions we have, but it really has let itself down very badly over #Brexit.

I’m a @BBC man married to a former BBC woman - it’s a national treasure - BUT what is going on at @BBCNews - no mention of the blatant #Brexitgate cheating by the Leave campaign or the @UKParliament select committee hearing on the website. Just “why is #Brexit taking sooo long”
Home Secretary admits to me a whopping extra £395 million has been given by Treasury to Home Office to cope with #Brexit for next year - that’s now approaching nearly half a £billion before we’ve even left, when police budgets massively under pressure. Shocking. @Open_Britain
Wylie: "if someone cheats in the Olympics, the contestant is disqualified". If the #Brexit vote is proved to have been tampered with, we should not sit by and let it happen. 
5,000 UK finance jobs may be moved by #Brexit, half earlier forecast: Reuters 
The government have announced £150m for #CreativeIndustries as part of their #IndustrialStrategy. However, the false economy elephant in the room is that it is estimated that the UK economy will lose between £100bn-£200bn by 2030 because of #Brexit.

600+ days since the #Brexit vote and it is abundantly clear that leaving the EU will deliver zero benefits but cost a fortune for decades to come. It was never the right thing to do, no matter how many people voted for it. Time for the PM to admit it and to #StopBrexit now.
You've had an MEP on Question Time 34 times. 32 of those occasions have been @Nigel_Farage. Whatever your argument, perhaps you can see why this might be construed as anti-EU bias. #brexit

Britain‘s complete and utter delusion about its power in the post WW2 world led to the humiliation of Suez. Britain‘s complete and utter delusion about its power today has led to the humiliation that is #Brexit. Both arising from false sense of greatness and exceptionalism
I concur with this view of @Andrew_Adonis Whilst the revelations about Leave campaign will add to to pressure for rethink, they are not a silver bullet. #brexit will primarily be defeated by the growing evidence of why it is so damaging for UK. 
Well thank you bbc for this #brexit explainer for 9yr olds. We've been informed now! And by the way: negotiating "so we don't end up worse-off economically" and during  transition "the UK could still be governed by some EU laws"? Nice try. 
Unbelievable. #r4today parliament report mentioning Wyles' evidence re #CambridgeAnalytica as buying Trump a victory but nothing about #brexit fraud. Clearly it has nothing to do with us then.Today has become a shameless Tory and brexit mouthpiece. 
The revival of the UK car industry has been built on three pillars. International investment (Nissan, Toyota, Tata), the single market & attracting talent from across the world. #Brexit undermines each one. 
Can't believe it! After Chris Wylie's devastating testimony yesterday in which we learned our democracy is hanging by a thread, #BBC website is going with "Mark Zuckerberg's snub to MPs" & "Why is #Brexit taking so long?" #BrexitPropaganda #BrexitGate #CambridgeAnalyitica Scandal

Even though U.K. is exiting the EU with #Brexit, EU nations expelled Russian diplomats, in a remarkable display of unity with a fellow European nation. I wish Africa had this level of unity and love for each other. Sad that Nigeria & SA didn’t sign the ACFTA. Wither African unity
My takeaway on the #Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica story. Britain's unwritten constitution relies on trust. Bannon, Mercer, Farage, Johnson, Gove et al have broken that trust. No law enforcement has the capacity to restore it. We need the rule of law in a written constitution

Excuse the colourful language...but for god's sake when will remaining #Brexit supporters realise that there is a river of filth running through every aspect of the leave campaign?This? This is just the latest - there'll be some other dodgy revelation next week 
What a very great pity that Tony Blair's past is marred by the Iraq War. For all that he says about #Brexit is crucially important and extremely well explained.  #Newsnight
LabCon want to remove our right to freedom of movement in the EU/EEA. There was no referendum vote for this and there has been no parliamentary debate on it. A massive theft of rights is being treated as a mere side effect.This is #Brexit robbery! #StopBrexit #FBPE #ABTV
The Sun has apologised for its grossly misleading claim that retail prices would be massively lower after #Brexit (graphic 1), but has @Jacob_Rees_Mogg apologised for tweeting the Sun's false claims? (graphic 2)#StopBrexit #FBPE
More great work by @peterjukes,  @Byline_Media & @frontlineclub to amplify @carolecadwalla‘s work with whistleblowers - exposing activities of Cambridge Analytica behind the scenes of the Trump and Brexit campaigns.For tonight’s revelations on #brexit, here are my tweetnotes... 
YouGov running a poll abt effectiveness of protest marches. Govt can dismiss them. #BBC can dismiss them. But neither can dismiss #votes.Local Elections May 3rd. Perfect opportunity to protest.Don't vote Tory!Cast an anti-#Brexit vote #LibDems #GreenEU-nats can vote too #ABTV
Vote #UKIP on the 3rd May to show the Tories what we think of their #Brexit betrayal, their lack of action on rape gangs and their suppression of free speech.  Locally we will be your voice, we have no whips. 
How powerful is #CambridgeAnalytics? They may have swung #Brexit and the Trump election. Big deal. Can they make @sinnfeinireland win North Down? Or the @workersparty win...anything?
Crucial: rejection of a bad #brexit deal cannot mean crashing out without a deal, says #Labour ‘s @Keir_Starmer . It must mean back to the drawing board with #Parliament , not #TheresaMay ,  in control. 
Having listened to May's statement on the supposed Russian involvement in the poisoning of #SergeiSkripal I can conclude the British government has absolutely no evidence to back this and is using this charade to get itself out of the political mess it is in regarding #Brexit
Sam is a sensible journalist. Something like that would not have been tweeted unless there was something to it… #Brexit 
So Wylie was working as an anonymous source for @guardian - while simultaneously trying to suborn both a Canadian party and #Brexit?Please tell me you have a problem with this @profcarroll @carolecadwalla :( - cc @gchq @damiancollins @IanCLucas @commonscms #CambridgeAnalytica
Electoral Commission figures show the Remain campaign spent £19 million. The Leave campaign spent £13 million. The government spent £9 million of taxpayers’ money on Remain campaign literature. £3 million of this was spent on online ads and “digital promotion”. #Brexit
Here’s #remainernow Hugh being interviewed by French Journalists near @No10Vigil about his change of mind on #brexit & activities he is getting up to in fighting for a #voteonthedeal #FinalSay & growing #bregretter movementHopefully they will broadcast this soon. FYI @BBCNews
What did @GovUK expect ?  Did it do any assessment of the implications of #Brexit or just assume (wrongly) it had a right to everything , inside or outside the club?  ....UK opposes Brexit threat to role in EU's Galileo scheme - BBC News 
Tony Blair urges MPs to rise up and be their own Leaders, defy their whip and give the voters a say on the final #Brexit deal. Slams Corbyn in the process.
We owe a big debt of gratitude to @carolecadwalla, and the other determined investigators.#CambridgeAnalytica#TedCruz#brexit#trump#VoteLeave#Ukraine
If vote leave really did cheat and the #brexit vote is allowed to stand then the UK has  ceased to be a democracy
Wow. This "Jeremy Corbyn's antisemitic" story seems to have knocked #CambridgeAnalytica and the #Brexit voter fraud stories right out of the #BBCNews headlines.We'll knock me down with a feather.
So, @UKLabour has lost the Labour Jewish vote, and much of the Remain vote, and because of #Corbyn the party has lost the support and vote of many centrist voters. Not looking good. #Brexit #EnoughIsEnough
"The fightback starts here....."Is it finally sinking in yet @UKLabour supporters?The Tories are running the #Brexit clock downAnd all the talk of Starmer's "6 tests" won't amount to a hill of beansIf you want to halt Brexit, vote with your feet. Leave & force the change
The #Brexit agenda of both Labour and Tories is much closer to that laid out by Goebbels after the German referendum of 1933, than to British parliamentary democracy. #StopBrexit #FBPE #ABTV

Overwhelmingly positive response from public as @SODEMAction #Brexit march to @euromove London rally @EK_EuropeanMove @Labour4EU
We will continue paying into the EU budget until 2064. Great work @daviddavismp, we now have to pay, but have no seat at the table. The #Brexit that the gvt. is pursuing is not the one that was sold. @theresa_may must stop taking us on this irresponsible and damaging path.
Honestly, the #Brexit mafia think that by simply repeating a lie ad infinitum it will eventually be believed. 'People are coming together', 'People are tired of debating the referendum result', 'Everyone wants us to just get on with it.' No, no and fuck no. #FinalSayForAll
If the most credible person you can wheel out to start the denials is Boris Johnson then you've lost the argument before it's even begun. #CambridgeAnalytica #LeaveEU #Brexit
Yet again the BBC is fawning over this war criminal who will be trotting out the same rubbish he's been spouting about #Brexit.  BBC, even you're overstepping the mark. He's not elected, he loves the limelight, stop it. 
DUP also spent more than £32k with Aggregate IQ during #Brexit (and more w/them during 2017 Stormont elex). When I asked DUP’s Jeffrey Donaldson last week where he found tiny Canadian company AIQ, he said ‘I cannot recall’
Unilever relocating its HQ to the Netherlands is a worrying sign for the UK economy. This may not be a vote of no confidence in the UK economy due to #Brexit but there is no question that #Brexit is making every company with their HQ here rethink their location.

Pls don't listen to those who cry: "Why is this coming out now!" I wrote about the use of #BigData a year ago in the @TheNewEuropean re: #VoteLeave; @carolecadwalla started writing  about their shenanigans 2 years ago... and a lot others, too. #Brexit
The OECD recently published its own forecasts showing that the UK is set to be the worst performing of the world’s leading advanced and emerging economies in both 2018 and 2019.  If #Brexit means wrecking the economy, then everybody has the right to reconsider.
One of the biggest shocks the #Westminster elite got on June 23 2016 was when the great people of #Wales #voted to #leave the corrupt #EuropeanUnion - and a new opinion poll shows that they still back #Brexit!  #BBC #LBC #SKY #UK @Conservatives @UKLabour
I'm not asking to have referendums over and over, I'm asking for a vote on the final #Brexit outcome when everyone knows what we're getting - what's wrong with that?

I am fucking loving the sound of this. We all know it. You know how we know? Because Boris Johnson is a desperate maniac along with other brexiters who would have not considered it wrong. You know the man, you know the answer. He's guilty as sin. #Brexit is a sham. #Void
Yep...well aware of this & the fact they are still able to CON voters into thinking their version of #Brexit is going to lead to a Utopian future & not the reality which is that it will become a Tory Brexit over time if we don't get a #FinalSayForAll with a #Remain option. #ABTV
There were no data analytics or Russian bots when I made my mind up to leave. What swung it was watching Blair and Brown conniving to ensure the public would not get a direct say in the Lisbon treaty. They didn't give a shit about democracy then and nothing has changed. #Brexit
#Brexit is the will of Cambridge Analytica 
“We have met with business leaders. What is required is clarity and certainty on #brexit We need to hear from the British gov. not more procrastination” @MaryLouMcDonald
"I'm passionate about Remaining, The Gov have put £1.5billion of tax payers’ money aside to ‘prepare’ for #Brexit, but it has already cost at least £400million in this financial year, and is only going to keep costing the country more." #ExitFromBrexit @5WrightStuff #wrightstuff
Funds raised by the Leave Camp were from donations made voluntarily. Money spent on Remain propaganda by Govt and other UK authorities was taxpayer money, and the taxpayer was not consulted before this was spent for Remain.And now Remainers say Leave overspent?#Brexit 
"Organisers of a major anti-#Brexit march say politicans need to sit up and take note after huge crowds gathered in #Leeds" from today's @yorkshirepost.Are you listening @hilarybennmp @alexsobel @wfabianmf @AlecShelbrooke @RachelReevesMP @RichardBurgon @StuartAndrew @TracyBrabin?
From the London 2012 Olympics to #Brexit. How did this nation fall so far, so fast?The optimism, pride, creativity & celebration of culture & multiculturalism woven in to that marvellous opening ceremony should have been a launchpad.Instead we made it a diving board...
If you have any doubt that @BBCNews is running scared. Every other broadcaster is finding-in its own way-how to address the other side of #Brexit. Ex: @adamboultonSKY talked to young Remainers. The BBC is guilty of dereliction.  The Director General should clarify.#Newsnight
My interview on @SkyNews with @skynewsniall on Brexit: I want to take back control of our taxes to remove VAT from domestic fuel, hygiene products and green products. We are not allowed to take it off at the moment under EU rules:  #Brexit 
The biggest lie in the referendum was this, how many people voted #brexit for more money for the underfunded NHS. #bbcdp
‘Fabulous new trade deals with non-EU countries’’ is a central plank of the #Brexit case. But these ‘gains’ could just be 0.2-0.7% of GDP and will be dwarfed by the losses from a looser relationship with the EU.  And none of these deals are likely to be in place until after 2020.
A clip of @JonathanPlaid on @SkyNews discussing #Brexit this morning. Watch the full interview on our Facebook page. 
How come every time there is a whiff of a Tory scandal the Labour leader ends up as the headline news? Is it naive to believe that this is just a coincidence? #CambridgeAnalytica #Corbyn #Brexit
A detailed clarification-from @TheSun :"An article, ‘Vote for bargains’ (27 Feb) described the potential savings on a number of goods if EU tariffs were removed after #Brexit. Unfortunately.."#Brexiters are in trouble.text-h/t- @JohnRentoul#VoteLeave
I think this should read that #Leave voters in England care more about #Brexit than the `precious Union' of @theresa_may 's imagination.  They would be happy to see N I and Scotland break away.
Keeping in mind the majority of LBC listeners are Pro-Brexit, this is no surprise. Brexiters would sacrifice their own families, for #Brexit 
Just a minor correction: Contrary to the government's claim the #citizensrights of @The3Million and @BritishInEurope have not been secured. They continue to be left #inLimbo and will be worse off with ANY deal currently proposed.#Brexit #FBPE #NoToSettled Status #RoadToBrexit
Pressure grows on PM over #Brexit Cambridge Analytica scandal, as Downing Street is accused of outing the whistleblower, Shahmir Sanni, as gay in an official statement. His family in Pakistan may well now be in serious danger.#DirtyTricks
In a further wake-up call for @theresa_may, according to a Survation poll, even her supporters who backed her in the 2017 General Election favour a vote on the final deal. She must oblige and not lead us towards a catastrophic hard #Brexit.
U.K. #Brexit negotiators are developing a plan to solve the Irish border issue by keeping the whole of the U.K. aligned with a subset of the #EU’s single market rules, according to British officials.
#Brexit is an undefined dream, supported by a minority of far right ministers and not understood by the electorate. It's opposed by the majority of the government and the opposition. Treasury analysis shows it's economically destructive. So why are they continuing?
LabCon are driving the country towards #Brexit while showing total contempt for the pro-EU half of the country. They won't listen to us.They deny us a #FinalSay. Well let's use the local elections to give them a kick in the brexits they can't ignore!#StopBrexit #ABTV #WATON
In another attempt to defy the Referendum result by the back door, Labour Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer says Labour will table a motion in Parliament that in reality will have the potential to block #Brexit.
Vote Leave alleged to have cheated. An urgent and quick investigation must happen. This calls into question the whole #brexit process. The clock is ticking. #ExitFromBrexit
Jacob Rees-Mogg shared this and look what the Sun had to say about it today  #jacobreesmogg #thesun #brexit 
The Union is crumbling. There are no Unionist leaders who can explain  how a Union can exist; who can articulate the retention of a Union? #Brexit 
There have been a lot of Remainers who have claimed they will not vote Labour because of it's #Brexit position. They also claim to represent everyone who voted Remain.I voted Remain and have to say they DO NOT speak for me.
Here are the official @ElectoralCommUK figures. Make of it what you will.Please share as widely as possible #BrexitFraud #brexit #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered
One of the very many stupidities of #brexit- Every day -Theresa May "battling" to keep things like Galileo, a soft Irish border, access to the Single Market, tariff free trading, a functioning economy etc etc etc etc  - all things we're throwing away by flouncing out of the EU! 
1) I'm from NI & your name is mud here wingnut.2) #Brexit is no threat to NI peace, except by the enabling of SF/IRA & their divisive politics by Remoaners, like yourself.3) You're not fighting #Brexit, you're merely doing the wrong thing for the UK....again. 
Good find, Otto. So @IsabelOakeshott you said on Marr there was no link between Cambridge Analytica and Leave. But before the referendum you wrote there was. So you’re telling porkies?  @carolecadwalla #brexit #CambridgeAnalytica
It’s Monday.And the noose is tightening around #Brexit. No sane person would consider the current state of affairs a sound basis for such monumental constitutional change.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Growing fear about #Brexit from businesses and bankers. It’s crazy to jeopardise the U.K. economy & therefore all our livelihoods for some half baked ideology that Britain would be better off outside the EU @Labour4EU @labour4europe @EuroLabour
"At times it felt as if they (the Leader's office) were working against the rest of the Party and had conflicting objectives."Alan Johnson - 27th June 2016What was true then over the #EURef is still true today. The Leader's office still has conflicting objectives. #Brexit 
The present leader of @UKLabour is dragging his party along by its hair; kicking and shouting in protest that it doesn't want to go where @jeremycorbyn is intent on taking it. The majority of the #LabourParty are Pro-EU. The leadership is Anti-EU. Things won't end well. #Brexit 
Right, now they are “rather silly”. This feeble response admits Cummings’ key point: that Vote Leave had written permission from the Electoral Commission to donate to Be Leave. Making Sunday’s Observer splash “a lie”.Disgraceful, and not journalism. #Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica
If @Keir_Starmer or any other #Remain MP thinks"there is nothing s/he or anyone else can do to stop #brexit"they are in the wrong job !Resign as an MP now !Let someone with a backbone come in and take your worthless spacePS - party is not worth saving if it ignores country pic.twitter.com/uG1o8GPp3j

Rather than blame @OwenSmith_MP, Corbyn's supporters should ask why the Labour leader has so dogmatically stuck to a #Brexit policy which will harm the many, and why he denies the people a #FinalSay. #StopBrexit #ABTV
‘I couldn’t support the Tories over Brexit any longer.’@Kishan_Devani former Deputy Chair of the London Conservatives, tells us why he recently left the @Conservatives & joined the @LibDems his concern were that Tories were fixated on an ideological hard #Brexit at any cost 
UK Prime Minister's adviser outed #Brexit 'corruption' whistleblower, putting him & his family in #Pakistan in potential danger. Reckless & ruthless revenge? Homophobic?
Seems to me that @theresa_may's devotion to #Brexit contains as much sense as that of the 17th century Church's devotion to the geocentric model of the universe. In both cases Galileo suffers.
“Some cricketers in a match not involving Britain cheat” leads @BBCNews at 10, not “Evidence shows #Brexit campaign led by two Ministers was fraudulent”
Even as a cricket fan I'm bemused as to how on earth a ball tampering incident, in an #SAvAUS test match, can lead the @BBCNews . Nothing else to report on #brexit or #CambridgeAnalytica ? Everyone else has found a story!
Here we go again. Something else pretty major the British have forgotten about due to #Brexit - #Galileo  Williamson can “hit the roof” as much as he likes, but either he was told and didn’t act, or his officials were lax. Neither is a good look.
When we learnt the #Brexit vote was won by lying on a scale not seen since Nazi Germany it would have been fair to nullify it. Same when we learnt people no longer want it & that it will cost us £2bn a week.Now we know they CHEATED too it's an absolute NO BRAINER#stopbrexit
If Vote Leave cheated in the #brexit #referendum , what can be done?@InFactsOrg
And if Leave had lost the referendum by 2% would you now be demonstrating in the streets for their right to hold a second #brexit referendum? 
On #BBC coverage of #Brexit in general, and Brexit protest marches in particular.  Dedicated to all who joined a #MarchForEurope!  #StopBrexit #Remain #FBPE #ABTV #WATON
If all those calling for a second referendum are so confident they will win they must also pledge that to rescind #Brexit the vote must be at least 60% in favour otherwise there will be anarchy.
"The UK defence department is having “early discussions” on whether Britain could launch its own satellite system to break its dependence on the US system and its possible exclusion from the Galileo military application." This is the kind of madness that #Brexit is breeding.
Fitting that @Nigel_Farage and @Jacob_Rees_Mogg should empty dead haddock into the River Thames last week. Pre-EU the river was biologically dead. Courtesy EU regulation it is now home to 125 fish species. More dead fish with #brexit Britain 
I can't keep up with all the reasons for #Brexit. There seems to be a new one every week. It doesn't really make sense. Could it be the EU is unpopular because it has failed the people? No, no it's the electorate who are wrong.
Even with more money, endorsements from celebrities, endorsements from the most powerful man in world & fear tactics from the remain side - it is sheer courage, self-belief & determination, that the #British people voted for #Brexit. Let's celebrate that. 
More evidence has come to light suggesting the #Brexit #referendum was won by cheating:

It's enough that our Govt subverts the Parliamentary process by seeking Exec Control over it, denying scrutiny & accountability & stating that #Brexit can't be reversed but the whole process was tainted by lies & deceit...this is just more confirmation.#FinalSayForAll + #Remain
In light of Theresa May’s approach to going ahead with #Brexit regardless of the consequences - are the @Conservatives letting down the UK?Please RT after you vote for a larger sample.
2/3 of Labour MPs represent leave seats. If you read this article you could be forgiven for thinking the journalist has never heard of something called democracy. Leave won. #Brexit is happening. Time to be positive.  
No Owen, it's time to stop 'scapegoating' the common man, who is fed up of relentless mass immigration. If it was your council house gone, your son's school place lost, your hospital bed taken, and your daughter gang-raped, you'd blame them too. #OwenJones #Brexit 
To my mind @Andrew_Adonis Is being dangerously overconfident. This is a battle in which the other side are powerful and willing to use every dirty trick in the book to gain their #BrexitTaxHaven.We have to fight with all our strength every inch of the way!#StopBrexit #Brexit 
Okay, I’ve now changed my mind. As I said before, most #Labour members are decent folks. But if you still support #Corbyn after his spike in anti-Semitism, his mishandling of the #SalisburyAttack and his Frontbench’s #Brexit confusion, then you're either thick or sinister. Sorry.
Remainers treat Leavers with respect. We honestly and openly tell them they are wrong. The #Brexit leaders on the other hand treat them with contempt, flattering and lying to them, using them as tools so they, the Brexit leaders, can get themselves a #BrexitTaxHaven.#StopBrexit
It seems more and more apparent that we are have been at war with Russia for some time. They have likely influenced both the #Brexit result and the 2016 Presidential election, and probably more. They wanted Le Pen in office but France was ready for Russia. #ProtectOurVotes
UK: The reason why most polls now have Remain narrowly ahead is not because more voters have switched from Leave to Remain than have made the journey in the opposite direction (poll of polls by ICM, Opinium, Survation, NatCen Social Research). #Brexit 
Just had the urge to close out Sunday with the simple statement that #Brexit is the most idiotic policy ever pursued by a British government. In May’s own words, no British PM could ever accept it.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
BBC is so terrified of #Brexit and of offending the government, it won't cover anything remotely investigative or challenging. Great shame now applies to #Panorama for dropping the @vote_leave story and BBC support at an all time low.
Great reporting by @mattbraga on the #Brexit bombshell.  What we know about Aggregate IQ, Cambridge Analytica and Brexit.  @traciemac_Bmore

Irish people North & South also opted to endorse the Good Friday Agreement in free & fair votes. Our votes must be respected #brexit 
"I do not see an iota of evidence that anything Cambridge Analytica may or may not have done had any impact whatsoever on the #Brexit vote. I mean, I just feel that you’re chasing unicorns." 
Essential #Brexit point: Govt has respected Referendum vote by triggering A50 & starting negotiations. But if terms on offer don't match Leave campaign promises that we'll be better off, surely Parliament has duty to do what's best for our ppl in light of new info
(3) But we all know you don't really believe #Brexit will be beneficial to the #UK or you wouldn't advise investors to put their money elsewhere:
Top tip for CorbynitesYou don't get to play the "Lib Dems tory enabler" card any more, not since Labour started enabling Tory hard #Brexit which will make 2010 austerity look like a public spending spree in comparison
This is what they can’t bloody understand. Or just won’t hear. People don’t need Facebook or #CambridgeAnalytica or suggestions on the side of campaign buses #Brexit 
Never let it be said .@Conservatives are democratic or care one jot for #Democracy..@theresa_may is presiding over an unprecedented erosion of parliamentary sovereignty (power transfer to Exec) +*tyranny of the (narrow) majority*(no dissent), crushing UK values, all for #Brexit

Some damning evidence has emerged on the self-described #CambridgeAnalytica “whistleblower”, Chris Wylie. He told @Guardian he repented in 2014 - but made a failed pitch to #Brexit in 2016, citing Kosinki’s data scrape as he did so. cc @damiancollins @commonscms

We must leave the EU, transition must not lead to us going back in. A defeat or reversal of #Brexit "would be the most almighty smash to the national psyche that could be imagined."- Jacob Rees-Mogg 
The #Brexit crooks who corrupted the democratic process are hoping that the spotlight that's been shone on them will quickly move on.Let's make sure that doesn't happen - it's democracy itself that's at stake here. Can we get #Brexitgate trending?Please RT
Matthew Parris sees it. Behind #Brexit there are no sunlit uplands or open seas, but narrow bigoted nativism - an island suffering from catastrophic insularity, in which democracy doesn't really matter. 
Something’s rotten at the heart of our democracy.  Urgently need to update electoral law & party funding rules to make fit for digital age.  Electoral Commission & Information Commissioner need more power, resources & real teeth.  This issue goes far wider than #Brexit 
So when a Tory politician says - as he did on Pienaar’s Politics this morning - that we should forget what happened during referendum and ‘make #brexit work’, presenter should say ‘hold on’ not just move on

It's not about who won brexit, it's about breaking the law on campaign spending limits which undermines the democratic process and raises serious questions about the validity of the #Brexit referendum. 
.@tom_watson failed to rule out a second #Brexit referendum today, whereas @OwenSmith_MP was sacked by @jeremycorbyn on Friday for suggesting one.1. @UKLabour persistently manipulate you on Brexit.2. Will Tom be sacked for going against #Labour policy?#LabourFail
. @Keir_Starmer's stance on #Brexit is that because of a slim majority in 2016 we should dumbly drive the bus off the cliff, even though we have the means to change course.  Pathetic, spineless & cowardly! For all our sakes resign Keir! #StopBrexit #FBPE
Translation: while the government, the BBC, almost every politician & most of the media knew the right thing was to vote remain (and connived to achieve it), a handle of people I disapprove of argued for #Leave. We therefore must vote again, until we get the right answer. #Brexit 
This image was not photoshopped to make #marr look like a Tory stooge.  #BBCBIAS #CambridgeAnalytica #BrexitWhistleblower #brexit 
A #Coup against #Corbyn is well and truly underway. The ground has been carefully watered with the #Blairites fake anti-Semitism news, the #russia affair, and the hyper anti #brexit campaign. All carefully timed for the elections in a few weeks time. My weekly column coming up
The BBC packs QT audience with an unrepresentative percentage of  pro #Brexit young people. Presenters shut down #Remainers. The news fails to report thousands protesting against #Brexit.Just what is going on in the UK, manipulation of the press is something fascist states do.
With regard to any amendments to EU legislation, I suspect only cross party ones have any hope of commanding support across the House of Commons and being carried. It is vital we all put the national interest first on this huge #Brexit issue. /4
"This call for a second referendum is a complete red herring. The only reason you would want a second referendum is to revert the result." #Brexit 
Since the June 2016 #brexit vote, what has been your thoughts and actions in the 21 months of brexit negotiations - would be great for retweets
Walking the dogs with a French lady who we meet regularly. She tells us that all the Brits in her village have now put their houses up for sale because of the uncertainty over #Brexit and what their future rights will be. So sad, lives and dreams turned upside down for nothing.
Thoughtful and insightful interview with @Keir_Starmer which highlights the huge difficulties posed by #Brexit. Sadly, it’s hard to imagine such an honest and intelligent approach from the likes of Davis, Fox & Johnson....
No one likes a cheat so when they get caught out there are consequences #balltampering #resign #SteveSmith. As the truth emerges about #Leave dodgy funding, abuse of social media, fake claims & phoney promises, let’s make sure the voters they cheated hold them to account #Brexit
A thread on the #fakenews now provided by #Channel4News and the #Guardian. How the #Left and #Remainer institutions manipulate the truth to suit their own agenda, especially over #Trump and #Brexit. 1/10
 Give it up, Caroline Lucas! Remain lost because YOU couldn’t convince or scare people into the view that the EU is what they & Britain desperately need. ...because it isn’t! Remain had a fair go. Stop boring me with this!  #Marr #Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica
#Marr ...Caroline Lucas on new Vote Leave funding allegations: "These revelations demonstrate that there is something rotten at the heart of our democracy."Marr continues to say that he can't see the connection with #Brexit , even though new story is specifically about Brexit.
Poor Isobel Oakshot desperately trying to shut down @carolecadwalla on #marr over the #CambridgeAnalytica story. She knows her #Leave & #Tory mates are in the soup. Carole’s conclusion that electoral spending law needs looked at 100% right #Brexit #FBPE
I wish people would stop pinning their hopes on the Labour Party regarding #Brexit. They have been showing us all since the referendum who they are and where they stand. Maya Angelou said "When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time."
This week the @BBC missed more obvious #Brexit angles on big stories. We wrote about them here. #BBCbias
#CambridgeAnalytica has its dirty fingers in a lot of pies. #BREXIT to weaken Europe by disuniting it, USA to hand our election to a greedy moron, and Canada... Don't know enough yet to know what they're up to in Canada, but SOMEthing. 
All the evidence proves that #Brexit is a dangerous absurdity. All the evidence proves the vote was won using lies and dirty tricks. It's is now monumentally idiotic that @UKLabour does not formally oppose it.
#Brexit Facts 1) strengthens neoliberalism against socialism 2) damages working people & living standards 3) attacks Northern Ireland peace & open border 4) strengthens right’s nationalism against left’s internationalism. Why I’m still fighting #Brexit & supported @OwenSmith_MP
Labour are worried about @Renew_Britain taking their votes & they should be worried - Labour is letting us all down on #Brexit 
This website illustrates how the referendum vote was potentially won by  cheating. Since the referendum the Leave side repeatedly use 'democracy' as the reason to carry the result through. Now it's time to 'take back control of our democracy' & demand a fair vote on #Brexit #FBPE
"FROM MAY TO SURRENDER" – A BBC sitcom starring Theresa May. Read our entertaining Sunday #Brexit piece here:

Without #Brexit this absolutely could not happen. May orders £4bn Brexit boost to save ailing NHS
This week I’ve proved that I’m incapable of defending the realm, that I’m an antisemite and that I’m determined to see #Brexit happen. Let’s see if even one patriotic, anti-racist Remain Labour MP resigns the whip. No, thought not.
Who gives a f***Any chance of proper coverage of real news like #HOOP, or anti #brexit protests?.

A French EU Citizen who has lived, worked and paid into the UK system their entire working life, would be entitled to an UK State Pension of less than a third of what they would receive in France for the same contributions.Who was #Brexit really for, and what is it hiding?
The entire weight of Whitehall, No10, No11 and the political elite was thrown against the Leave campaign and they lost - yet they still keep coming #Brexit 
The UK High Comission in Pakistan actively helps British Citizens in the country against forced marriages and life threats.The UK Government in London just placed one and his family in grave danger. All to try and take away the attention from how crooked #Brexit is.

Vote Leave was the *official* #Brexit campaign, run by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove.Right before the election, Vote Leave donated a total of £675,315 in 4 donations over 8 days to BeLeave, a political org set up by two 21-something yo’s who worked for Vote Leave. 2/

On the Corbyn-Owen Smith stuff: Corbyn could have ignored Smith’s Guardian piece. If he had, by today it’d have been forgotten.As it is Corbyn has reminded some people of how bad his position is on Brexit. Surely ambiguity would have been a better strategy?#Brexit
. @itvnews - Thousands join one of the biggest anti-Brexit rallies in the North.  Meanwhile I can find nothing on the rallies on the @BBCNews website.The BBC is now little better than a government mouthpiece like Russia Today. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Around this time next year will the clocks in UK be going forward an hour....or back about 46 years? #Brexit
Time for Theresa May to call a halt to #brexit and do a full independent investigation. If the referendum was won by nefarious means we need that cleared up before we plunge off the Brexit cliff. #Brexishambles
I feel so guilty for voting for #Brexit. It was a mistake. If I could take it back I would. We (leavers) were lied too. @carolecadwalla @Channel4News revelations this week have made me sick to the core. #brexit needs to be CANCELLED. #StopBrexit
The government cheated with their £9m propaganda leaflet to every household.  Lies and then more lies spouted from their mouths, especially Osborne.  Let it drop.  The people know best.  They voted out.  Be told. #Brexit. 
PatrickStewart makes a case for recondering #brexit now we’re beginning to see its costs and problems

Labour seeks cross-party consensus on Irish border #Brexit deal. @Keir_Starmer: “The point has now come where it is so serious that we have to enshrine this in law”
The @Conservatives should be prepared for their worst ever results across London on May 3 - as the people of London will no doubt reject this divisive, nasty politics driven by an ideological driven Hard #Brexit. Good luck @Conservatives as you'll need all the luck you can get!
Tonight's @Channel4News revelations about illegal Leave campaign ads and #CambridgeAnalytica confirm that dragging Britain from the EU is about nothing less than a coup.To back or even accept #Brexit now makes you an accomplice to the greatest attack on UK democracy since WWII.
Americans don't realize that #TrumpRussia & #Brexit are two sides of the same coin - a Russian-sponsored operation to sow chaos, hurt democracy & advance Putin's agenda.Fortunately, it's not possible to do this without leaving a paper trail. #FollowTheMoneyh/t @carolecadwalla
Channel 4 News just led on very strong story about Vote Leave and BeLeave coordinating their campaigns. If they did, they broke the law, making the outcome of the #Brexit ref highly questionable. The British people must not be cheated.
Look at the Bannon/Mercer influence on the EU referendum. No wonder @realDonaldTrump called himself 'Mr #Brexit'

When Theresa May has completed negotiations with EU, Corbyn will assess what exactly she has negotiated/what agreement with EU is on offer: only then will he take final position on it. That's the approach of a sensible Leader. Consider all the facts first. In due course.#Brexit

Can I remind you that George Osborne created an austerity that is still so devastating that it made millions prey to the siren call of xenophobia or that he didn't oppose whilst in govt the call for the EU referendum. He is the cause of #brexit and should admit so. 
Clear to every Irish nationalist/republican that Corbyn is just another Brexiteer who doesn't really understand or care about how a hard #Brexit will repartition Ireland.

No. See my report @patribotics which I just RTed on this TL.I have sources, senior sources with links to UK intelligence who say in terms MI6 think the #Brexit vote was swayed by Russian bots. I accept their ruling. I also say, they need to give that evidence to the public

Not surprised that @OwenSmith_MP got the sack.  @jeremycorbyn has done everything he can to help the Tories push through a hard #Brexit. Back the #Libdems in you want an #ExitFromBrexit
Hello, MPs!It's time you all made a DECISION. Most of you are opposed to #Brexit. There are over four hundred of you who want to #RemainInTheEU. Well, it's time you DID something. Ignore your party whips, decide how to use Parliamentary procedures to #StopBrexit, and...
Nobody takes down the useful idiots of Brexit like a Tory insider. And Matthew Paris is forensic in outlining the danger of these currents of nativism and jingoism in today’s #brexit Britain. 
66 million EU citizens live in the UK and enjoy the RIGHT to study, work and live anywhere in the EU. It has enriched and improved the lives of so many for decades. On #Brexit day 63 million will lose those rights forever and for no good reason at all. #Leavers why did you do it?
Ben Bradshaw  - Owen Smith it's one of the few politicians that understands the disastrous implications of #brexit on NI. Brexit is much more important than who's in & who's out... when it comes to the vote in the autumn it's inconceivable labour will vote for the deal.#FBPE
I voted #Remain , however, I have blocked many FBPE (Follow Back Pro Europe) Tweeters who followed me because it is clear to me their agenda is more about unfairly trying 2 use #Brexit to damage Labour than about Remain. Remain or Leave #IStandWithJeremyCorbyn#SaturdayMorning
#Brexit has a lot of causes, but the failure over decades of @BBCNews to properly report EU affairs a major factor. Their political reporters just Westminster-focussed, no EU knowledge, lazily failed to get beyond ‘it’s complicated, it’s over there, it’s out of sight’ mentality.
Here is a reminder to all Remainers: the debate whether it was a good or a bad idea for Britain to leave the EU ended on the day the EU Referendum voted n favour of leaving. From the next day attempts to block #Brexit amounted to treason and subverting the democratic vote.
Looking through twitter at the support for #Corbyn, it's clear he has a cult following. They can see no wrong in his support for #Brexit, at any cost, despite the damage it will inflict on millions of hardworking folks. I don't understand how they square the circle. #StopBrexit
Today, March 24th, Scotland could have been celebrating Independence Day  But no. Here we are stuck in a #Brexit mad UK being pulled out of the only Union that ever actually cared about Scotland - despite 62% of voters wanting to remain in it.#ScotRef #indyref2
Last week #Brexit was definitely because of Russia. This week it is definitely because of Cambridge Analytica. Don't know about next week yet, but I'm sure we'll think of something. #IAmEuropean #FBPE
At the end of the day it's morally repugnant that a serial rebeler of 40 years standing like Corbyn would sack someone for putting forward an idea deeply popular with the Labour membershipHe's an authoritarian, it's his way or no way, whatever the members think#brexit
"Not a single job lost." #Brexit 
This is the moment even loyal moderate Labour #Remain voters need to place a tactical vote against party policy on #Brexit...it can't undermine the Parl balance but it wld send a clear message. Votes can't be taken for granted by pro #Brexit parties.#FinalSayForAll #ABTV
I voted LAB for 40 years. No more, unless LAB oppose #Brexit. Corbyn and Rees-Mogg are the same to me re #Brexit. LAB need a new leader and a new policy.#PoliticallyHomeless
I too joined @UKLabour to weaken @Conservatives call for a hard #Brexit. Ditched them in January and joined @LibDems as it became clear @jeremycorbyn is an isolationist and Eurosceptic. #Remain 
Clearly our views aren't 'Central' Brexit views.  We condemn May's capitulation and incompetence. Never mind, we'll stand by what we believe in and will continue to produce original facts & news for a true, clean #Brexit here: 
Disgusting attempt by May’s political secretary & other hard-line Brexiteers to discredit whistleblower for telling tomorrow’s Observer how Leave campaign cheated in #Brexit Referendum, including, unbelievably, outing him to his family in Pakistan. 
Diane Abbott called for a vote on the final #Brexit deal four months ago. She was not sacked. Owen Smith said exactly the same thing yesterday and Corbyn fired him. 
Remember, we're the only meat-based marketing board who called it right on #Brexit.#TrustTripe
Supporters of the European Union will take to the streets of #Ipswich today as part of a nationwide day of action against #Brexit.#FBPE #StopBrexit #GreatNorthernMarch
I didn't vote for #Brexit but right now, if there was a second referendum, I would. Geographically, 'Europe' is an amazing place. I'm now convinced, however, that the @EU_Commission itself, whilst run by the boozed-up old fart @JunckerEU, stinks of corruption and 'backhanders'.
Excellent @OwenSmith_MP interview @BBCr4today on honesty about gigantic economic and security threat of #Brexit and grave danger to peace & progress in Northern Ireland of hard border unless remains in #CustomsUnion #SingleMarket
Give nature a voice in #Brexit discussions says @CartoonRalph  But it's true of all nature - we need to speak up for it.
On the day of multiple #StopBrexit #FBPE rallies all over UK & day after @OwenSmith_MP sacking - a reminder of @uklabour policy on #brexit passed unanimously  by our 2016 conference. 
Planned to have a few weeks off from Twitter but #Corbyn sacking #OwenSmith has riled me Why is it Jeremy has a zero tolerance approach not to #Russia, Antisemitism or bullying but #Brexit, by sacking ministers & imposing 3 line whips? Why are #Labour members being ignored?
I doubt the public would be surprised to find out #Conservatives were involved in any kind of #election #cheating do you @SamCoatesTimes? @vote_leave @darrengrimes_ #brexit 
One of the most extraordinary stories I have ever heard, as told by Brittany Kaiser to me and @paullewis - “Former Cambridge Analytica exec says she wants lies to stop”  #CambridgeAnalytica #FriendsHack #Brexit

#Jezza has finally nailed his colours to the mast. There is no ‘long game’ on #Brexit, Corbyn wants out even if most @UKLabour voters don’t.So I’ve just joined the @LibDems. #FinalSay
Lift your gaze from Corbyn's domestic policies and consider his foreign policy stances. On NATO, Syria, Ukraine, Venezuela & Iran Corbyn has taken positions about as favourable to the Kremlin as a Labour leader could manage. The same goes for #Brexit.#StopBrexit
To deny the Ppl a #FinalSayForAll when the #Brexit deal is known by the Autumn, on the basis of the non-Binding opinion of only 37% of the electorate proves this is no longer about the Will of the Ppl merely the imposition of political will on the Ppl. It is not DEMOCRACY.
Tonight @JeremyCorbyn fired @OwenSmith_MP after he called for a another referendum on the final #Brexit deal. But Corbyn is out of touch: almost 80% of Labour party members want a second referendum on the Brexit deal. RT @Jon_Danzig's report. Link: 
By sacking @OwenSmith_MP & standing against the people’s right to have the final say on what’s shaping up to be a terrible deal (which is actually Labour conference policy!), many people will see @jeremycorbyn sharing responsibility for the decade of #Brexit austerity to come 
CONFIRMED:#CambridgeAnalytica worked for #Brexit campaign LeaveEU.CA misled the public & UK Parliament about this.#CambridgeAnalyticaFiles #CambridgeAnalytics #CambridgeAnalyticaUSA
Anyone out there who still believes Corbyn is playing some clever long game on #Brexit & will swing behind a referendum & #Remain at the last minute? Your choice is clear: Vote Labour/Tories for a catastrophic BrexitVote @libdems for #finalsay referendum & an #ExitFromBrexit
Both our main political parties risking self-immolation as they jointly take country into decline and marginalisaton. Corbyns cowardice over #Brexit as rank as Blair’s over Iraq. May in thrall to #Rees-mogg #Farage and Johnson. History will be savage.
DIANE ABBOTT was quizzed by a BBC host about why she still has her job.This was after @ukLabour’s shadow Northern Ireland Secretary @OwenSmith_MP was sacked from his role over his demand for Britons to be given another say on #Brexit, just like Diane did 
Follow-up on #Brexit -- #Bolton :VoteLeave was the official campaign org. Bolton was there with Hannan when the Brexit vote results came in.LeaveEU is Nigel Farage's org.H&F professed to hate each other, but they colluded. They coordinated through Cambridge Analytica.
I'm glad @OwenSmith_MP will continue to speak out, albeit from backbenches, on concerns about #Brexit impact on the #GFA & economic impact of #Brexit.Voters within & beyond @UKLabour & most party members expect us to stop hard Brexit
OwenSmith is right about the damage #Brexit is doing to the #GoodFridayAgreement & the entire economy of these Islands.  Anyone who believes otherwise is just not looking at the facts...Jeremy Corbyn sacks Owen Smith over referendum call - BBC News
Dear @jeremycorbyn, I have just cancelled my direct debit to @UKLabour because it does not reflect my views, nor views of the majority of members on #Brexit. You say you are for the many not the few, but that is wrong: you represent the few in your party on #Brexit, not the many.
What you should know about Trump's new NatSec Advisor John #Bolton.For American readers:* VoteLeave is a pro-#Brexit campaign.* VoteLeave worked with #CambridgeAnalytica.* VoteLeave is under investigation by UK's Electoral Commission for dark money & dark ads.
Ask any Brexiter claiming that voting to leave the EU included implicit mandates regarding the Single Market, the Customs Union, EEA, EFTA, FoM, ECJ, Euratom, etc. this simple question: “Can Norway, Switzerland, or Iceland leave the EU?” I’ve had no luck so far. #Brexit 
If your kids are eating from food banks maybe #Brexit is not top of you agenda.
The message is now clear to the Labour front bench. 'Oppose #brexit and you oppose me' - Corbyn. At least Labour have finally clarified their position. Now is the time for Labour moderates to find some courage and speak up. #FBPE #StopBrexit
I'm a Remainer but #IStandWithJeremyCorbyn on Brexit.   Backing Corbyn is the only way a hard Tory #Brexit can be prevented.  Tantrums and hashtags will not stop a hard Tory Brexit.
Sorry but although I may have some sympathy for the sentiments expressed by Owen Smith, I have no doubt what his motive is. #Russiagate opened a window of opportunity for the centrist dad wingnut division - this is about #Corbyn, not #Brexit. It's patently obvious.
I'm a #remainer, but Owen Smith wasn't sacked because of his stance on #brexit. He was sacked because as a #cabinet member, he breached the code when he publicly went against his party. That is what you sign up to when you move from the back-bench.#OwenSmith #Labour
Any #labour remain supporters still think Jeremy will deliver anything but a hard Brexit? He's let the tories away with murder and continues to do so #Brexit 
Sorry to hear this as absolutely right to speak out on these issues - concerns about the Good Friday Agreement and economic impact of #Brexit are deeply felt and widely held. Pleased to hear Owen will continue to speak up for them 
I am now officially anti-Corbyn  I used to be a #corbyn supporter and I am still a socialist but #brexit will cause immense damage to the #UnitedKingdom and its clear that he doesn't care. #Labour #JC4PM #PCPEU #FBPE #ABTV I still agree with most of his domestic policies though.
Come on now Labour Remainers, what more proof do you need that not only is Corbyn allowing Brexit to happen, he wants it to happen?  If you vote for Labour you can’t just blame the Tories for Brexit, you’re complicit as well. #Brexit 
If Owen Smith were Labour leader we could be almost certain that #Brexit would be stopped. But instead we've got Corbyn, the great big Brexity roadblock on the road out of Brexinsanity. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Imagine being sacked from @UKLabour for holding a differing opinion on #Brexit?Labour who change position weekly. Miss one memo, you're off piste. This smells like a bone toss to media, to avoid too much coverage of Jezza's latest antisemitism.
Owen Smith sacked for calling for the British people to have a democratic #FinalSay on #BrexitLike Rees-Mogg & the Tory press barons Corbyn wants to impose Brexit on the British people regardless of their wishes. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Genuinely sad to see this. Thank you for all you've done as Shadow NI Secretary, and for speaking up clearly on #Brexit, an issue which has profound implications for us all, but nowhere moreso than here in NI. Keep being a voice of sanity in the midst of this #Brecklessness.
.@jeremycorbyn is caught red handed in a new social media issue, commenting on an anti semitic picture. He said today that it is freedom of expression.His own Shadow minister expresses his views on #Brexit and #Corbyn sacks him tonight.Seems a bit one sided to me. 
Perhaps inevitable after his support for single market from the front bench this week. Kudos for standing up for what he knows is right #Brexit #FBPE
The country should be grateful for the courage of Owen Smith @OwenSmith_MP The public is still split on these #brexit issues. We need a #finalsay on what is shaping up to be a bad deal for Britain. #brexitreality #stopbrexit #StopBrexit2018
Not sure what Corbyn is trying to achieve by sacking Owen Smith for siding with the majority of Labour's supporters on #Brexit. Unless his boss PM May told him too after consulting with her far right pay masters.
No one can say that @UKLabour is an Anti-Brexit party now. @BrexitBin well and truly vindicated, not that he wasn't before. #Brexit #ABTV
What are you afraid of, @jeremycorbyn? @OwenSmith_MP was absolutely right that the public should get to rubber stamp, or reject, #Brexit. After all, it SCREWS THE MANY, FOR THE FEW.#StopBrexit
Viewed from Ireland - #Brexit is a bit like seeing your neighbour standing naked in front of his house, screaming at the bins.

Tomorrow I will be on @StAlbans4Europe (a branch of @euromove) market stall in #StAlbans again. Come and talk us about how you think #Brexit negotiations are going and people having a say on the deal. Young people should know they deserve a choice @YEM_UK @OFOCBrexit
“I will not let this country sleepwalk into a future which involves even more London rule” @LeanneWood outlines why Wales must have a say on the final #Brexit deal #Plaid18
Fishing may be a small part of Britain's economy. But fishing is vital to our island nation's very makeup. In the negotiations, British Fishing must not be sold out in exchange for anything else, however more lucrative. #Brexit 
i think people should understand especially Remainers that Anna Soubry believes in a Britain where austerity trolls the streets and blights the lives of the poor, vulnerable and struggling middle class.  She is no liberal and no friend to remain-she is what helped cause #brexit 
Yet again Labour cannot be trusted on #Brexit as they are prepared to ignore the will of the people. Playing with fire as Northern working class communities and marginals will show at next GE.
Many airlines are opting to pick an EU destination, such as Brussels instead of UK airports, as #Brexit uncertainty over aviation in the UK continues to rise. This will negatively affect the growth of long-haul flights out of regional airports, such as Birmingham and Manchester.
.@JunckerEU on March #EUCO results: on #trade we shall defend our interests through dialogue but with determination; on #Brexit important steps forward, our work continues; important Summit with #Turkey in Varna on Monday.
See this is the problem with this whole story. Except for @carolecadwalla and a few small new orgs or individuals like @openDemocracy @Byline_Media @J_amesp and Adam and Peter - no one has BOTHERED to investigate the covert political campaigning behind the #Brexit vote 
I have sent this to all the main parties with a request to halt #Brexit until we understand the full extent of the influence of #CambridgeAnalytics and Leave .EU. on the democratic processGuess what?Haven't heard a peep. @conservatives @UKLabour @LibDems
Great scoop by @petergeoghegan and @AdamRamsay "A major shareholder in the company that created #CambridgeAnalytics Analytica is directly connected to a senior pro-#Brexit Northern Irish unionist... himself linked to some of Vladimir Putin’s associates" 
Silly headline aside, this is a nice explainer. Everything hangs on grassroot efforts over the next few months - we need all hands to the deck. What are YOU doing to help?#FBPE #FinalSay #Brexit #Voteonthedeal #FinalSayForAll
I have noticed in my discussions with the British that even Remainers are now starting to say “well if they treat us like that we better hit the road and go”. #Brexit @MichelBarnier @guyverhofstadt @SkyNews @Esther_de_Lange
You've heard of the #CambridgeAnalytics scandal, right?&You've heard of the secret dodgy #DUP financing #Brexit scandal, also?Well, it looks like these two scandals are about to publicly collide.....(h/t @PeterKGeoghegan)
Furious Scottish fisherman warns that ministers will “never be forgiven” if they allow the EU to remain in control of UK waters after Brexit:  #Brexit
Owen Smith calls for referendum on final Brexit deal.If Owen Smith were Labour leader #Brexit would almost certainly be scrapped. Instead we have Corbyn making life easier for the Tory Brextremists.#StopBrexit #FBPE #ABTV
Pretty pathetic that @BBCScotlandNews @STVNews @heraldscotland @scotsman @Daily_Record are completely ignoring the large scale Hands Off Our Parliament #HOOP grassroots protest currently happening at Holyrood.  #Omerta #Brexit #ContinuityBill
As a Labour Party member I had an email asking me to campaign for @UKLabour with shadow Brexit minister @Keir_Starmer on Saturday. However, I will be on #GreatNorthernMarch protesting against the looming economic disaster #Brexit - so should he. #StopBrexitSaveBritain #Labour
No you're not! It's all lies. The best deal is #Remain & you know it. We've seen your own analysis that #Brexit leaves 99% of us poorer.You have no mandate for this. You promised us sunlit uplands, the exact same benefits as now - even that we'd be better off. Lies, all of it. 
Great to see another Labour MP calling for a #FinalSay on #Brexit. Thank you @GeraintDaviesMP

Looking forward to being in #Exeter tomorrow for the @Devon4Europe rally with @BenPBradshaw, @juliegirling, @MollyMEP and others. Come and join us! #Brexit #FinalSay 
I had a dream last night where Maybot & Co. were praying for a legal ruling that meant #Brexit had to be abandoned - so they could stop it but say "it's not us - it's the law!"...@JolyonMaugham @A50Challenge
Interesting analysis showing  more support for remain than leave and a steady trend of an increase in those thinking that #Brexit is a mistake. Also, interesting to see that those who didn’t vote in the referendum would mainly vote to remain now. 
On this week's cover: Editorial — #Brexit and the #NHS @UKandEU
#Brexit Chuka Umunna flash git, Mr smug still out doing rounds trying to derail Brexit. He never bloody stops the idiot. The man who bottled it when he had his chance to become Labour leader. Anyone listening to Remoaner bore Chuka answer no one. Go away you bore were leaving EU 
Are people in Britain that naive not to see that Theresa May is covering her arse over the humiliating result of the #Brexit talks and the growing paedophile scandal that threatens to drag in her ministers with this blatant provocation in #Salisbury ?
It was great to meet with @thatginamiller & discuss #Brexit & the work she is doing to hold the @Conservatives government to account on #Brexit. 
Here’s a piece I wrote for the Guardian on #Brexit 
Alexander Nix was filmed explaining that his company deliberately serves up false and negative messages to make people distrust or hate others.With #Brexit the net result was that they broke our society, along the hairline fractures made by the gutter press.Now: chaos.
There will be anti- #Brexit rallies across the country tomorrow: 
Young person makes an intelligent point about the positive potential of Brexit #SNP remainer warns him of the threat to his drunken trips around Europe engaging wiv da youf innit? #Brexit #qt #youngconservatives
Decision: EU27 has adopted guidelines for the future EU-UK relations after #Brexit
From the lack of government reaction to the #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered revelations one has to deduce unseen and profound corruption within the government and our judiciary. The only reason for this behaviour is to oversee a huge miscarriage of justice in relation to #Brexit
Leeds young lady tells #BBCQT panel, we've left, get on with it, no more in spite of #Brexit (22/03/2018) 
Just wondering if we'll lose this after #BREXIT like we will lose data roaming charges in Europe and lots of other protections.
Great gathering of @LDBusEntNet on #Brexit minus 365. @thatginamiller @PimlicoPlumbers @GleedsGlobal @innocent. See @LibDems as party of business.
Passionate young Leeds guy tells #BBCQT panel, young people know what they voted for with #Brexit & is sick of the lies, that all young people wanted to Remain, this is not the case where he is from (22/03/2018) 
It may be you that ends up getting a message since you have chosen to ignore your Remain membership, youth, and tactical voters. You’re very quiet on the #CambridgeAnalytica #SCL #Brexit issue?  Why?  You have an open goal & missed it.#StopBrexit#StopBrexitSaveBritain
#Brexit hypocrisy in a nutshell"We want a global Britain" actually means"We want to *only* buy our stuff, but we want everyone else to buy our stuff""We want stuff to be cheaper, but we also don't want to lose any British jobs" 
"You can't have free trade without free movement of people" reports #BBCWorldService as 27 African states meet in Kigali to sign a deal for Continental Free Trade Area (just as UK makes grave error of leaving European Union).#LBC #R4Today #Brexit #CFTA
Compelling case by @OwenSmith_MP for voters to have final say on #Brexit deal @derekvaughan
It’s Friday.And May now calling for ‘energy and ambition’ and ‘a new dynamic’ in #Brexit talks.Yes, @theresa_may, ram it into reverse with energy and ambition. You know it’s best for the country.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Blue #passport fiasco tells us everything we need to know about @Conservatives commitment to #FreeTrade after #Brexit. #GlobalMarkets Britain is a fraud. Lasts only until first serious test.
Good to see @OwenSmith_MP make the case for the British people to have a say on the outcome of #Brexit negotiations. If the proposal isn’t what the public want, they have the right to say no. Labour should give people this option. 
The gvts. negotiating stance on #Brexit lacks realism. We’re so far away from the EU with our cherry-picking approach. We need a strong leader who won’t be dominated by a right-wing elitist clique looking to turn the UK into a low regulation economy, only for the rich.
If posed the question at the end of #Brexit negotiations on trade, would you prefer a #SoftBrexit or crash out with a #HardBrexit ?
Brilliant! What a Great lad warms my heart to hear young people sticking up for #Brexit just as my kids and all their mates did, but our MSM only focus on the young for remain ...
A silly story. The country voted for #Brexit because they wanted a global Britain competing on the world stage, not because they want us to rig procurement rules in British companies favour. As long as they all competed fairly, this isn’t an issue.
The Daily Mail had a Brexit passport meltdown – the only 9 responses you need #dailymail #brexit #passports
Good morning. Updated running order of today’s #EUCO: 9hEUCO on trade (EU28 with PM May) Then EUCO on #Brexit (EU27) Then Euro SummitFollowed by a press conference on yesterday and today’s discussions by @eucopresident and @JunckerEU.
Now might be a good time to remind our PM and her Tory headbangers of Churchill’s rules on what they are there for. They should be protecting their country, not their jobs, party or face saving.  #Brexit is madness and can be stopped.#ExitFromBrexit @LibDems
Brexit: catch-up day - while this blog has pushed the Efta/EEA option for 4 years- despite rejection by the IEA - Jenkins of the Guardian finally catches up. And Dunt notices that a right wing think tank is pushing Unilateral Tariff Reduction...  #Brexit. 
Cambridge Analytica adamantly denied working on #Brexit, but that's because they worked on Brexit through their subsidiary, AggregateIQ. 
What on earth is Michael Portillo talking about? He must be deaf or completely out of touch, saying people are talking *less* about a further referendum? It's gaining momentum, dude! #bbctw #Brexit
The @LibDems offer hope to people who believe in progressive politics, who oppose #Brexit & who want a good local councillor. Another tip top result. 
Why are #Brexiter's in Gateshead upset about losing the #Passport contract. They voted 58% for #Brexit  and shortly will have to complete with the whole world, not just #EU counties. Welcome to the real world. You wanted it, you've got it !
First day of spring #euco has finished. Next stop: #Brexit #euco tomorrow at 9h. Good night.
#bbcqt audience are a credit to there age group. the future looks good for an independant post #brexit Britain. 
His reaction is  wrong. You should look to the polls, and not to your own circle for finding out how young people think. It is the same as saying smoking is not bad because my grandfather smoked and is 95. Look to the statistics please. There is still 2,5 year to stop #Brexit
#bbcqt The idea that we will easily replace lost #trade with Europe by new trade deals with rest of the world is sadly misplaced. In fact, #brexit harms our existing trade deals and makes it more difficult to get better ones: 
Trade war brewing with China and USA which will impact global trade. Cold war brewing with UK and Russia which could threaten our energy security.Is it really the right time to isolate ourselves from Europe?Of course it isn't.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
.@JamesCleverly pushing back on Shami Chakrabarti’s wild insinuations on #Brexit on #BBCQT tonight.James pointed out that the @Conservatives will move “heaven and earth” to protect relationship between the UK and Ireland and protect the peace agreement.
Riding through the City today, thinking, not of the bankers relocating to #Paris; #Dublin; #Frankfurt-but of the local office staff; shops; drivers; markets; small businesses etc.  depending on their custom. Who will be  left behind.#Brexitpic.twitter.com/sMT40fZ9hf
I am SICK of people using Northern Ireland & our peace for their political agenda's in terms of #Brexit. Especially those who haven't a damn clue about us. STOP IT!! #bbcqt
EU countries may disagree over what action to take over the #SalisburyAttack but they are united in wanting to keep a close security relationship with the U.K. post #brexit 1
The idiot from the SNP on #BBCQT is literally trying to claim that young people won't be able to jump on a plane and go to Europe for the weekend post #Brexit. What an absolute fool.
This young guy has bypassed the BBC filters, telling the nation him & all his pals voted for #Brexit.Give him love, he's the lad tonight. #bbcqt
BREXIT PAINS: UK household bills have jumped by £2.6bn since Brexit vote /#EU #Brexit 
So we have a British PM seeking support from the EU27 with regard to Russian aggression whilst undertaking an insane #Brexit breakup which will leave us very alone & with less influence at the heart of a progressive Europe, unlikely to regain the close pre-EU networks it had.
The Generation who brought us #Brexit are the wisest people in the country.. so get over it .. we are OUT #Bluehand #BBCQT
In June 2016 we had the luxury of Barack Obama in the White House. Millions of people felt they could take a risk with #Brexit. No more. This is the most nationalist and dangerous US administration imaginable. There could not be a worse time to leave the EU. 
On the #bluepassports saga, remember:- we don’t need #brexit for them to be blue - the government could have kept production at home, not abroad, within EU rules, as France does. See: 
Boris Johnson had undeclared meeting with Alexander Nix of Cambridge Analytica in December 2016 to "learn about, and improve links with, Team Trump".Nice to know these Etonian professional liars are always ready to give each other a helping hand. #Brexit 
Yes Norway better than any alternative #Brexit. But worse than remaining member. Ruletaker not maker. As big member our influence far more than Norway's would be.  Only way forward is #FinalSayForAll referendum with remain option
Joseph Goebbels, Theresa May & The Daily Mail, all claiming the authority of the "Will of the People" - a device of dictators and demagogues, a fake democratic concept used to justify the concentration of unchecked power in the hands of the leader(s).#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
.@MollyMEP has written to @ElectoralCommUK to ask a question that must surely be on many people's minds:Just how dodgy do the methods used to to contest an election - or referendum - need to be before its result is declared illegitimate?#Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica
"The rally will also feature music from Madeleina Kay, an English writer, activist and musician known as #EUSuperGirl because she appears dressed in costume as part of a statement that the UK needs a super hero to save it from #Brexit."Yep, it sure does!
The #BBC are allowing a pro-#EU and anti-#Brexit organisation to harass audience members on their way into the BBC Question Time venue for this evening's episode. It reminds me of the way the far left attacked #UKIP supporters going into meetings.#BBCQT
I don't see the problem.. little England wants to trade (WTO) with as many independent countries as possible after #Brexit ...they'll just have to BUY our stuff instead of taking it.
Enjoyed the #iq2debate tonight on whether to #StopBrexit - we saw a 15% swing to stay in the EU and reform from within!  Big support for a people's vote on the #Brexit deal 
The following is a perfect expression of the government's political stance on #Brexit: "The nation and the government in Germany are one thing. The will of the people is the will of the government and vice versa."- From a speech by Goebbels in 1933. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Kudos to #C4news for getting inside Cambridge Analytica and showing the world some of their dirty secrets.But disappointing that they haven't explored the major role the company played in #Brexit, as @carolecadwalla revealed in May of last year.
I’ve just had enough of #Brexit #Trump #corbyn #russia #CambridgeAnalytica #russians #tories #theresamay #nigelfarage #deadfish #england #greed #selfishness #corruption #allofit
62% voted ‘for’ the Stop #Brexit motion BEFORE the debate. @intelligence2 #iq2debate. @ChukaUmunna @thatginamiller @IsabelOakeshott @DrGerardLyons @bbcnickrobinson
Of course, the company awarded the contract to produce the new #Brexit passports are being bought by a company 25% owned by the French Government. *sigh*
I think it is wrong that only MPs are going to get a say on the #Brexit deal. The people must have a vote too #iq2debate
It is a political choice that Labour is making to #Brexit despite the clear signs that the vote is illegitimate. That will create a whole new wave of Austerity and make no mistake Labour will be complicit!So bug off with your #LE2018 campaigning we see you Brexit Enablers #abtv
I know it's usually Farage, The Bus, Russia, old people, poor people, uneducated people, racists, foreign billionaires, rich tax avoiders, the fascist Daily Mail and the bias BBC that caused #Brexit but this time it's definitely Cambridge Analytica.
Listening to @BBCr4today this morning it was sometimes like #Brexit wasn't even happening! Unfortunately it is, and the BBC has a responsibility to report it.
Great to be interviewed by @SODEMAction outside of parliament earlier today about why I left the @Conservatives & joined the @LibDems due to their fixation with a hard #brexit, lurch to the right & complete disregard to the overwhelming support for a vote on the final deal. 
If you voted for #Brexit and you hold shares in British company De La Rue I have to inform you that your shares fell by 5.9% today after they lost the contract to print your new blue passports. The work will now go to a French company. Taking back control? #BrexitShambles
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "It’s not about rocking the boat. It’s about standing up for important communities across the country."One of the reasons this is so important as a Conservative and unionist is that it’s a unionist issue." #Brexit 
The #Government ‘s latest #Brexit strategy is that ANY deal will do !@philipstephens@financialtimes via
Poverty & inequality rising in Scotland is a consequence of 8 years of austerity & flawed social security policies. Without @ScotGovFairer mitigation policies would be much worse. #Brexit promises economic misery. Sometimes in life you need to become #indy
Jimmy Buchan (Amity Fish Company) - "#Brexit is too big an opportunity to let go. If they do, they will never be forgiven. They will go down in history as the people who have failed a nation." 
Economist Andrea Hossó - "Britain is a big power, Britain is a serious business power and I do not see why being outside of the EU would be such an enormous blow." #Brexit 
The way this gvts. #Brexit negotiations are going, the only option for the UK is a Canada-style agreement. However, this would be completely unsuitable for our economy, as it won’t include the comprehensive coverage of services, which is key to the UK.

What was happening with #Brexit on @BBCr4today this morning?! Big stories on standing united against Russia and EU plans to tax US tech giants didn't mention us leaving once!
Keep at it, #Brexit! You're just doing a wonderful, wonderful job. Utterly flawless. Taking back so much control I can barely contain myself. 
At spring #EUCO, together with other EU leaders, to discuss #EUtrade, external relations and #Brexit.

This has appeared near my home in Spain. How misguied, frightened and intolerant have we become as a once United Kingdom and now divided people? #brexit is toxic and I will never accept it. #FBPE   The “people” do not have one will or one voice.

This map shows how #CambridgeAnalytica lies at the heart of a network of operatives pushing #climate science denial in the name of #Brexit and Trump: 
Sadly because Corbyn supports #Brexit, Labour has completely failed to tear Brexit apart along the fault-line between its conflicting nationalist-protectionist and libertarian-globalist sides. #StopBrexit #FBPE #ABTV
Delighted that @MoreUnitedUk have secured @UKParliament debate today on implications for @NHSEngland of #Brexit. @MidwivesRCM reporting a net loss of 183 EU midwives between Oct 2016 & Sept 2017. At that rate there will be no EU midwives left in the UK within a decade!

This is a map of our current international trade deal prospects. It shows the value of Liam Fox in particular. The countries committed to trade with us after #Brexit are in red and those who would consider trading with us are in yellow. A job well done... #StopBrexitSaveBritain
I take no pleasure in this sentence. But let it be a warning to unscrupulous employers who put their staff at risk & to politicians who want to use #Brexit to weaken health & safety laws.

But Tim - British-made passports would cost millions more!  This cannot augur well for a #Brexit future
EU approves Bayer’s $62.5billion takeover of GMO & pesticide giant Monsanto  #Brexit
What are the links between Cambridge Analytica and #Brexit campaign group ? 
This blue passports saga sums up everything dishonest about Brexit in its jingoistic symbolism instead of real patriotism. May wants future trade agt with EU to ‘ensure fair & open competition’ so #Brexit would not help Brit firm. In any case, they’ll still be printed in Hants.
We have been betrayed by #CambridgeAnalytica aided and abetted by #Facebook: the result is #Trump ‘elected’ president and and #Brexit ‘won’ 
Swindled...anti #Brexit billboards across the UK.
When 21 months after the #Brexit referendum the main achievement so far has been the decision to change the colour of the UK passports to blue.Which will be produced by a Franco-Dutch company. 
By birth I’m English, and really wanted Scotland to stay in the UK at the last #IndyRef as it did. Then... #Brexit and now I feel ashamed, angry, unpatriotic. I’m relieved I can claim an Irish passport and now fully support Scottish independence 
"#Brexit & Trump are pulling the #EU together.When you enter a club, you exit with the rules. The UK wanted to be in the club with a lot of opt-outs. Now it wants to be out with a lot of opt-ins.That's not acceptable"-former PM of Finland @BloombergTV
Theresa May in February: “It is absolutely right that after we leave the European Union, we return to deciding the colour of passports that we want, not that the EU wants.”Today: Contract for blue passports awarded to Franco-Dutch firm.  #Brexit
Know it's been posted loads before but #brexit #passport shambles calls for another airing of this...
This is fairly typical of the bile we get from Leavers for having completely legally exercised our EU treaty rights and for fighting to stop #Brexit and protect citizens' rights. So much anger and so many unfair stereotypes...@Suewilson91 @BremainInSpain #StopBrexit
This is pure hatred by the political class against  Britain.     A country cannot survive treason from within, and that is exactly what we have -  be it no meaningful #Brexit or having a foreign power print your state documents - disgusting! 
#TransitionDeal :Postponing the cliff edge by 21 months does nothing to solve the key #brexit problems faced by #business@InFactsOrg

Congratulations to the French firm who’ve just won the bid to make our new blue passports. #brexit #fuckssake #brilliant

 WATCH: Only the Conservative party is committed to getting our fishermen out of the CFP. The SNP want to drag us back to the EU which would leave our fishermen shackled to this hated policy which has been disastrous for coastal communities #Brexit #fishing #TakeBackControl 
#Brexit will make life more costly and complicated for us. @theresa_may’s ‘cherry-picking’ approach is unrealistic. She must grasp this fact and realise that we will be worse of in every situation post-#Brexit and grant the public a vote on the deal.
Britain’s post #Brexit 'blue' passport set to be made in the EU by Franco-Dutch firm. Not quite the Take Back Passport Control brexiteers had in mind, surely?  #BrexitReality
Never forget. This man created #Brexit chaos because of an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all of his mates (and f***ed off) 
I'm SO proud to work for our small, impoverished team, breaking #Brexit news you don't get on the well-funded BBC. How is it our #Brexit Facts4EU guys broke the "free movement for 4.3m Croatians" story?  Can you help to keep us fighting for a clean Brexit?
EU and UK leaders accused of not protecting citizens’ rights in #Brexit deal 
"UK GOVERNMENT QUIETLY OPENS DOOR TO 4.3m CROATIANS" - New & Exclusive from #Brexit Facts4EU.  Why didn't you hear about this from the BBC? Read: 
#Bregret - Feeling sad and disillusioned over your decision#Bremoan - react to a #Remainer pointing out your foolishness#Bremorse - feeling of guilt over a wrong committed against another#Brexit - an act of monumental self harm
The polling companies stopped asking how we would vote in a second referendum in DECEMBER. after 11/12 polls showed a #Remain majority and the last but one showed a TEN POINT LEAD. Now why would that be?#FBPE#StopBrexit#CambridgeAnalytica#Russia#LeaveLies#Brexit
Farage & Co symbolically throw dead haddock in Thames. Shouldn't it have been the NHS, public services, businesses, jobs, worker rights, pollution and food standards...? #Brexit
Read this thread and RT. This is what #Brexit is. If you voted #Brexit hang your head in shame. It wasn't #ProjectFear. It is #ProjectReality and it stinks.
Must read on the human cost of #Brexit 
We now know that every #brexit scenario makes us all poorer and risks the destruction of the NHS. Here's an idea! #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Just met at #Euston. I yelled "stop #brexit". Think he's deaf. 
After #Brexit , everyone can take back control and cut up there E111 card ( European Health Insurance Card ). And remember to make yourself a sandwich before you join the queue at the airport. Hands up if you DIDN’T see that on a bus . #indyref2

Very glad the #ContinuityBillhas  been passed by the Scottish Parliament at HolyroodGlad because some folkamid all the lies/deceit of #Brexitare being rationaland showing care and forethoughtThank you to all the #MSPs who voted for the Bill#Scotland
I think #Brexit is aimed at obtaining a kind of UK tax haven. I think the normalisation of lies & disinformation surrounding Brexit, & ideological devices such as "The Will of the People" are the means for creating a less brutal version of Putin's managed democracy.#StopBrexit

Corbyn says we have to do business with Putin. This is correct. But we must do so while fully aware that Mussolini style fascist Putin sees our democracy as an existential threat and wants to weaken and destroy it.We are dealing with an enemy.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit

Blue #Brexit  passport with be produced by a Dutch company in the #EU. You couldn't make this up. The contract will be awarded by #Brexit Ministers. Comedy knows no barriers. 
Glum Tory faces on the benches as @ScotParl passes the EU #continuitybill, hours after the Welsh Assembly does likewise. Both Scotland and Wales have voted to protect devolution in the event of agreement not being reached with the UK Govt over the UK withdrawal bill. #Brexit 
Yep. You could keep the UK in the Single Market and the Customs Union. Ireland Border solved, @alexstubb! #Brexit 
An absolute stand-out example of planning, organisation, negotiation, consensus building, tenacity & sheer hard graft from @Feorlean & team. Well done Michael, Scotland owes you one! #ContinuityBill #brexit 
The links between #SCL, #CambridgeAnalytica and the #tories are all coming out today, despite #TheresaMay's denial. I look forward to the government being held to account *struggling to keep straight face*.#CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered #PMQs #Brexit #ToriesOut2018
Proud to have spoken tonight for #ContinuityBill. The UK EU Withdrawal Bill seeks to undermine devolution. The @ScotParl is the only place where Scottish interests are put first and must be defended. We should make no apology for safeguarding it and Scotland during #Brexit
At this crucial and historic moment for the UK, who would you prefer to be in charge of #brexit?
So the “Scottish” Tory Members of the Scottish Parliament do not want our Parliament protected by the #ContinuityBill Why are they in there? Why are we paying them to represent their constituents who overwhelmingly voted against #Brexit then betraying them by supporting it.
This evening I voted for the #continuitybill in the Scottish Parliament. I regret that we may need it, just as I regret the whole #Brexit process. However, it is the duty of every MSP to do all that they can to protect our Parliament. Those who voted against, failed in that duty.
Britain's Scottish Conservatives isolated in vote on Scottish Continuity Bill, not a good look for them on devolution #Brexit 
This is the most extreme attack on Parliamentary Sovereignty since 1945, and quite possibly for much longer. We are no longer merely fighting against #Brexit we are fighting against an attempt to impose the fascistic system of plebiscitary dictatorship on the UK.
While the revelations about #CambridgeAnalytica cast more light on the chicanery & deceit of the Trump-Brexit right, we should remember that the primary whipping up of the visceral emotions of fear, hate & grandiosity was done by the right-wing press.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Thanks for coming to Dublin @nick_clegg and for a good discussion on #Brexit and Irish-British relations.

Australian High Commissioner Alexander Downer - "You've always done pretty well as a country, you'll work your way through #Brexit and there's no need to be too pessimistic." 
I wonder what would happen if all the people who oppose #Brexit started throwing things in the river Thames.
Nigel Farage - "We need a PM that says, I’m sorry, fishing is the acid test for #Brexit, the ultimate image of our sovereignty, and we are going to take them back."Mrs May, you’ve talked tough on Russia, please talk tough on this at the European summit tomorrow." #Brexit 
I guess it could be argued that Brexit is corrupt to the core?Orchestrated by Old Etonions, foreigners, and traitors?That’s not very patriotic.#CambridgeAnalytica#CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered#StopBrexit#StopBrexitSaveBritain#BrexitFraud#Brexit#BrexitLies
EVERYONE did NOT have a vote in the #Brexit refSadly you are misinformed.A gerrymandered electorate, an advisory non binding ref.....it's a travesty May is pushing an extremely hard brexit. Wholly undemocratic. Plain wrong. #Remain
#Brexit loonies throw edible fish into the Thames while many Londoners use #foodbanks. Men of the people? My foot!
 WATCH: I do not support this transition deal on fishing. I cannot and will not support any final deal that doesn’t deliver for our fishermen. There is still a huge #Brexit prize to be won for the industry and only the Conservatives are committed to getting out of the CFP  
Specialists from across the Library have collaborated on this - an in-depth analysis of the latest draft #WithdrawalAgreement. Get the details here  #Brexit 
One thing I took away from Brussels today - transition is only possible as part of the withdrawal agreement, which the EU27 will only sign off if the backstop on Northern Ireland is included. Solidarity is more than rhetoric. #brexit 
I’m so sorry to lose you and your family, Germany’s gain is UK’s loss.  #Brexit is madness and must and can be stopped #ExitFromBrexit
It's been confirmed that, subject to a transitional deal, Roaming Regs will stop applying to the UK after #Brexit. As a consequence, UK providers will no longer be subject to the obligation not to charge for the use in the EU of roaming services.  Roaming charges could be back!

Good exchange of views this afternoon with @nick_clegg, @Andrew_Adonis and Michael Heseltine on #Brexit and other matters 
The gvt. is being unacceptably complacent in regards to aviation. #Brexit does not guarantee full market access for UK airlines to the EU & vice-versa, after 2021.This uncertainty threatens Britain’s flight connections to global markets, particularly at regional airports.
Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is unable to answer my question on the #IrishBorder. Legitimate questions deserve proper answers not the same old Tory rhetoric #Brexit 
3/...this has annoyed a few people because it goes to the heart of what the EU is, especially for Ireland. If the EU does not back Ireland on such an existential question - and yes folks, #Brexit is existential - then why should Ireland stay in the EU? Or any other small member?

The EU's Common Fisheries Policy forces UK fishermen to discard half the fish they catch (equivalent to roughly one billion fish portions):  #Brexit
A lackey: Hey guys, guess what? We've got crates of dead fish. Let's donate them to a kitchen that serves the homeless.Brexiteer: I got a better idea. Let's throw them into the Thames to prove we have absolutely no concern whatsoever about the UK's poor.#Brexit #foodpoverty

Today at #PMQs I asked the Prime Minister what changed between this week and last week on her Government's #brexit fishing stance. It beggars belief that the Tories still expect folk to take them at their word on anything.

Do you think that the @BBCNews suppresses information on the strong opposition to #Brexit ?Please RT for a large poll base.
Anyone who has listened to #CambridgeAnalytica whistleblower @chrisinsilico will see all these nautical skirmishes on the Thames as a clear cut 'Build the Wall' style propaganda victory. They frame the debate about #Brexit in emotional, metaphorical terms.

So...The fish protest has involved a pointless waste of useful food.It has involved a few journos and MPs and *one* random person with a placard.The plan's fallen apart because of UK regulations, so they're just sailing pointlessly in circles.#brexit in a nutshell!
#Brexit: Protesters are planning to dump fish into the Thames this morning in a show of disappointment at the deal agreed between the UK and EU on fisheries. 
What’s interesting about this whole #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered thing is the determination of almost all the media to focus on Facebook & data etc & studiously ignore what actually happened next: ie #Brexit #Trump Like shouting at the dog while the bitten child bleeds to death.
In #CambridgeAnalytica, SCL, AIQ, #Brexit and Trump, we see a wealthy elite spending millions to weaponise people's fears in order to benefit themselves and harm the very people they exploited
nobody voted for a transition deal.a transition deal means that 10,000 migrants come to the uk every week. this number will be funded and increased by the eu during transition. it isnt about a deal its about ramming as many migrants into the uk as they can before #brexit 
'We are not going to get a better deal from Brussels on fisheries. Fishing is the acid test of #Brexit' says @Nigel_Farage. He says the government doesn't have the 'courage' to net a better fishing quota deal from the EU.

The government has been defeated in the House of Lords over its plans for nuclear co-operation after Brexit as peers voted to insist the UK should not withdraw from  Euratom, until a replacement deal is in place.  #Euratom #Brexit #nuclear
I’m making this observation as an outsider, but the whole #CambridgeAnalytica and #Facebook controversy certainly seems to provide ammunition to the anti-#Brexit crowd in calling for a new referendum.
Brexit: getting absolutely nowhere - if we can't get past the basics on border controls, there is no hope us. Any idea of sensible planning goes out of the window. And the debate is getting absolutely nowhere...  #Brexit.

How on earth can David Davis show his face around Westminster or even in any place in Britain when he betrayed his country and negotiated the sort of transition deal for which people in the old days would have had a meeting with the hangman. #Brexit

My open editorial on the effect of #Brexit's on #trademark ,#design law and #geograhical indications in the UK has been published today by @CIGIonline. Yesterday's withdrawal agreement prominently left GIs as an ongoing issue. #textinwhite
1. Time for a #Brexit history lesson. Us old school leavers bumped into the remain canard that "three million jobs" depend on the EU time and again over many years. So well worn were the arguments that Remain scarcely dare deploy that line during the referendum.
My question on the need for the Government belatedly to investigate the role of Cambridge Analytica & Facebook in the #Brexit referendum and alleged Kremlin links. 
This will backfire on all MPs at the May local elections I believe, time for #UKIP, #ForBritain all the other #Brexit parties to take councils & maybe MPs 
I asked a written parliamentary question last autumn on #CambridgeAnalytica using #personaldata data in #brexit #referendum Answer put the ball back into court of national data protection authorities. Stronger EU-wide rules will be in place from 25 May:

.@pablocasado_ "We'll take advantage of the #Brexit negotiation to urgently resolve irritating problems with #Gibraltar such as airport use, tax evasion, smuggling & environmental crimes. This has been highlighted today by @AlfonsoDastisQ in @Congreso_Es." That will go down well.
Great Britain is leading the way by investigating Facebook & Cambridge Analytica's misuse of personal data for use in the #Brexit & 2016 US presidential campaigns.When will Congress get serious about this as well? Mark Zuckerberg should have testified to Congress months ago. 
SCOTLAND  NEVER  WANTED  TO  LEAVE#Brexit 
#Brexit: “It’s not too late to stop it - I think a lot of people have changed their minds since the referendum. We are campaigning on Saturday for people to have a final say.” from @MerseyFocus #GreatNorthernMarch #Leeds #StopBrexit
Many still havent grasped real danger #CambridgeAnalytics program exposed.Its not "just" about Trump & #Brexit - this is about the end of democracy.Competing secretive data firms mining deep seated apocolyptic fears based on lies will simply destroy any democratic culture. 
Whatever your views on individual journalists or the BBC as a whole you can’t deny that @BBCPhilipSim has risen & continues to rise to the challenge of making accessible (and at times even interesting ) the complexities of @ScotParl #Brexit process to a wider audience.  Thanks. 
The government sticks to its Mafia style threat to push the hostages over the cliff if Parliament defies it on #Brexit. The only ones to benefit would be Putin & disaster capitalists. This is a government of crooks & traitors! #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
We are proud to be campaigning for a People’s Poll on the #Brexit deal, with an option to remain in the EU. Join us and add your voice to ours  #FinalSay
We will be worse off in every situation after #Brexit. The leave campaign was built on false promises and lies. @theresa_may surely cannot pursue something that she knows will harm the UK. She must grant the public a vote on the deal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit.
More "estimates" of impacts of #Brexit from #IFS based on questionable assumptions. This time: food prices.
Why is the Govt going ahead when #CambridgeAnalytics leak shows Farage/Bannon link to it. Surely #Brexit must be halted until we know how far our democracy was undermined?Or doesn't the Govt care?
This is from April last year. It’s as if @NicolaSturgeon was trying to warn us way back then that the Tories were going to sell out Scottish fishermen. Ruth Davidson accused her of “scaremongering”  #Brexit 
We’ve come together with 18 other cancer charities, calling on Government to prioritise the interests of people affected by cancer in the second phase of #Brexit negotiations. Read our joint letter here: 
Incredible to watch SNP attack Scottish Tories for "selling out" the fishing industry by NOT delivering the hard #Brexit to which the SNP is implacably OPPOSED! Breathtaking for a party which backs the CFP to be scoring points over NOT leaving it. SNP: truly the brass neck party.
Cambridge Analytica (and the crooks for whom they worked on #Brexit) have also helped stir up frightening levels of fear and loathing in this country. Major civil conflict had never seemed a real possibility to me before that vile and irresponsible campaign.
All this talk of #Brexit achievements, but the Elephant in the room remains. There's no solution to the Irish border problem, if the UK is outside of the SM and CU, as Mrs May has said it must be. The reality is, #Brexit is dead in the water, unless May u-turns. #StopBrexit
Well this is embarrassing. I guess David is realising his bosses don’t give a fig for sectors based in his Banff and Buchan constituency. Welcome to the club. Shame the realisation happened after filing the newspaper column... #brexit 
The top 8 frauds to watch out for in 2018 include; bogus  #Brexit investments, fake  #WorldCup2018 tickets,  first-time buyers emails being hacked and fraudsters taking advantage of the  #RoyalWedding! 
IF #Brexit goes ahead, one thing is certain:Those who felt left behind will be left further behind.#StopBrexit
Is it becoming clearer yet why the Tories think @theSNP will "ruin" their brexit deal if Westminster don't get their hands on Scottish powers like fishing & agriculture?Yep, it's because the SNP will refuse to sell out the fishermen & farmers.#Brexit #HandsOffOurParliament
People accuse the #bbc of bias on brexit , but I just watched a news programme featuring two families with differing views of #brexit. One family reckons brexit will cost them their livelihood, whilst the other said it would ruin their children’s livelihood.
As an independent country within the EU Scotland would be able to negotiate our own terms on #fishing, unlike the current situation where terms are dictated by a UKGovt who, assisted by idiots like you, make Scottish fishermen "expendable" #TransitionDeal #fisheries #Brexit 
More emerging on DUP funding and links to Cambridge Analytica.Also, did their £425 000 Leave campaign money come from Russia?And why is May allowing them to keep the source secret?#Brexit#CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered
To be absolutely clear the message being put out by by Ross and Lamont is:I have no power in my partyI can’t represent you as a communityI am intentionally powerlessI am functionally useless #Brexit 
Should we be at all surprised that a UK Government who overwhelmingly wanted us to remain EU members, have 'negotiated' a deal whereby we overwhelmingly remain members of the EU?At the next GE, send these anti-democratic traitors a message. #Brexit
Unfortunately #brexit has been made easier for May and her merry band of ministers, because #jcorbyn and his pathetic archaic ideology has given Brexit a shoe - in - #Labour ar3% behind the worst gov in history! Won’t have my vote #remain #centralist #ABTV
#Brexit As Jacob Rees Mogg calls for the UK to take control of its fish, David Davis flounders, Michael Gove feels out of plaice, Liam Fox still looks like a prawn, and Boris blurts out more cod latin. May looks more like a kipper every day.
It’s time to put #Brexit on hold.#CambridgeAnalytica#Facebook#AlexanderNix#Nix#EUReferendum#StopBrexit#StopBrexitSaveBritain#Remain#Bannon#Mercer (See: @carolecadwalla @conspirator0 @profcarroll @J_amesp ).
".@theresa_may you started your premiership by telling us what Brexit meant.  (Brexit, from what we recall.)  Well, whatever #Brexit really means, the EU document you’re signing up the country to isn’t it." Read Brexit Facts4EU: 
Another one bites the dust.  Another #Brexit promise demolished. This time by the Institute for Fiscal Studies - any drop in food prices linked to scrapping tariffs will have been more than offset by price rises driven by the fall in the value of the £ since Brexit.

#brexit Can we just get on with Brexit please.  Bloody usual bores out everyday TV & Radio trying to run country down. Talking doom & gloom  Armageddon. 17 million voted leave we’re leaving. Just get on with it FFS. Stop putting them on TV and Radio everyday boring.  
Often accused by those backing PCPEU that as #FBPE I'm anti Corbyn, which is BS btw. I'm anti Corbyn's support for #Brexit & denial of a Binding #FinalSayForAll with a #Remain option.My question is,why do many add the 'PEU' when seemingly not wanting to #StopBrexitSaveBritain?
Bertie Armstrong before yesterday - We demand exit from the CFP on day one of #brexitBertie Armstrong yesterday - We demand exit from the CFP at the end of the implementation period in 2020What a leader!Tories are laughing at Scottish fishermen yet you vote for them.
Today's @thetimes cartoon. #Brexit. #TransitionDeal 
The gvts. #Brexit strategy will have a huge negative impact. The long-term gains from new trade deals with non-EU countries, a central plank of the pro-Brexit case, could be just 0.2%-0.7% of GDP. That would be dwarfed by the losses from a looser relationship with the EU.
Why does the @BBC news only mention #CambridgeAnalytica manipulation in favour of #Trump but not its involvement in the pro #brexit Vote Leave campaign?
"Fantastic. We could not have asked for more", Danish fisherman say in reaction to continued Danish access to UK waters as part of the Brexit transition agreement #brexit #eudk
'Nobody influenced the way we think,' declare gullible bigots hoodwinked into voting against their own interest. #Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica #AggregateIQ
This should be tattooed on the forehead of every one of the UK's 650 MPs since they appear to be suffering collective amnesia. #Brexit 
Look at the Fisher folk sell out -Scotland.  That’s our future NHS sold, Industries decimated all for a Brexit we didn’t vote for #Brexit
Good to hear @John2Win being seriously grilled on @BBCr4today about @RuthDavidsonMSP broken promises to fishermen. He didn’t have any answers. #brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #FBPE
For the Kippers and those Brexiteers who are losing the plot THIS is what @Jacob_Rees_Mogg has said...“I don’t like this transition deal... BUT, it is acceptable if the end deal is good”Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed!! #Brexit

The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijackedAs media focus on honey traps and Trump don’t overlook the involvement of #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered in the #Brexit referendum
Given what we know about #Brexit, a coordinated response would kill it off easily. The reason it's still alive & kicking is because of the lack of coordination in remain's response. If we end up leaving it'll be because remain response was weakened by lack of coordination.
From day 1, the whole #Brexit negotiation has been a farce. It should have been Barnier summoned to number10, put in a darkened room with @Nigel_Farage, made to pay his bar bill, and given this handwritten note: #LeaveEU #Leadership

Nothing more satisfying than seeing the vile 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', throwing his toys out the pram .. Suck it up, buttercup  #Brexit pic.twitter.com/T0vTCowEAf
Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore have both said Cambridge Analytica was involved in the referendum campaign.#CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered#Stopbrexit #Brexit 
Even worse tho @jonlis1 Is that the same #brexit leaders who've seen UK govt forced to capitulate on almost everything to get transition deal - are still convinced EU can be made to give UK a wonderful final deal.Like a gambler on losing streak who "plans" on beating the bank. 
And the great work of @carolecadwalla and @J_amesp who have been banging on about this since I had about 3 followers It has always been there, why have our media been so reticent to look?It can only be because they have known that #Brexit was corrupted
Freedom of Information Act in operation: Ryanair's Michael O'Leary expressed concerns about #Brexit to the Taoiseach but Department of Taoiseach does not want to say what they are. Refused release on grounds of "deliberative process" and "international relations" - @IrishTimes
There are reams of evidence about what No Deal #Brexit means - it would be a disasterSo on @BBCNewsnight @maitlis says to Rees-Mogg "would you personally be OK with no deal""Yes, I would" he says and so she says "well you can't say fairer than that"What is the point of this?
@BBCNewsnight@maitlis gently asking Jacob Rees Mogg what he would and wouldn't accept from #Brexit and whether he personally thought no deal was better than a bad deal like he's some spoiled child to be indulgedMeanwhile C4 news are breaking Cambridge Analytica story
Rees-Mogg struggling with the Brexit deal whilst the Scottish Tories are already beginning to fear for their futures, bet they still do their nodding dogs impersonation when it comes to voting it through though #newsnight #brexit #ToryNoddingDogs
#newsnight reporting #Brexit date as March 2019 as if there was no doubt about it. But there is (and they know it): 
God almighty Jacob Rees-Mogg again!!!@BBCNewsnight WTAF?Simple question "nothing you promised is happening, everything is collapsing, what do you have to say for yourself?""What is a 'proper #brexit'?  What does that cost us?"
This is an issue for Britain as well, because #CambridgeAnalytica is implicated in using similar unethical tactics in manipulating voters for #Brexit, working for Farage's . /1 of 2
Theresa May gives away fishing rights to Scottish waters once again ... Whilst warning Scots that 'Scottish Independence would ruin our #Brexit deal'#scotref #indyref2
Sounds like a red herring to me.#ReesMogg#Fishing#Brexit#StopBrexit#StopBrexitSaveBritain
It is now 3 months since I have left the @Conservatives & joined the @LibDems & @vincecable. As I said the @Conservatives are going back to the days of Enoch Powell, when they talk about a hard #brexit that is willing to destroy the very fabric of modern day #british society.
East Anglia’s fishing industry reacts with disappointment to the “catastrophic” news that the UK will continue to be stuck with EU fishing quotas until 2021:  #Brexit
Now the truth is out about Cambridge Analytica and their manipulation of the referendum result, it's time to put the brakes on #Brexit. It wasn't the will of the people. A brave PM would make a stand. A weak PM would do nothing.
To the 0.5% of #Brexit Leave voters who are shaken by this story, well, yes, you should be - you were manipulated, it's time to wake up & smell the coffeeto the 99.5% of Leave voters who will shrug it off, well, you shrug everything else off so why am I surprised? 
Following excellent investigative work by @Channel4News & @carolecadwalla only reason the Government might not launch inquiry into activities of Cambridge Analytica & their influence on #Brexit vote is that some of them already know what they'd find & don't want it to come out. 
The Cambridge Analytica guy says you don't win elections with facts, it's all about emotions. He's right. We Remainers should take good note of that. It doesn't matter how many economic facts we present if we don't reach emotions. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
The Channel 4 Cambridge Analytica report shows one thing very clearly, that the Trump-Bannon-Breitbart-Farage far right are prepared to abuse, pervert and ultimately destroy our democracy in order to gain power.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE

I want to know two things:1) What role did Cambridge Analytica play in #Brexit Ref? (Grounds for #FinalSay Ref?)2) What are Cambridge Analytica doing for the #Tories? (See Daily Mail article about .@Conservatives being in talks with CA to hire them.)
DUP paid almost £33,000 to Cambridge Analytica-linked firm AggregrateIQ for its #Brexit campaign for the EU referendum #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered
Now here's a curious thing..All those #Brexit folk who never miss an oppotunity to expound on the latest conspiracy are completely leaving the #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered alone.Even as proof of the conspiracy is actualy recorded on camera & shown on channel 4.Curious no?
#TheresaMay ‘s  #brexit #TransitionDeal is a Pyrrhic victory - and bears no resemblance to #Brexiters promises or demands (via @InFactsOrg )
Nigel Farage - "I don't trust the motives, actually, of any of these MPs who say - we respect the result of the referendum, but."What they really mean is - we don't respect it one little bit. We'll do all we can to water down, delay or stop #Brexit from happening." 
Labour’s Stephen Kinnock said that if Cambridge Analytica were proved to have been “in flagrant breach of our electoral rules, that would place a pretty huge question mark over the referendum result”. #CambridgeAnalyticaUncovered #channel4news #Brexit
Nigel Evans MP - "There’s huge potential. The vast majority of growth is now taking place outside of the EU. Even the IMF themselves say the vast majority of growth is not now going to be in the EU but outside." #Brexit

Govt's mask slips as @DExEUgov Callanan reveals plan if MPs reject #Brexit deal: “we hope that Parliament will not reject, we will negotiate the best possible outcome but if in such circumstances there would be an instruction to move ahead without a deal”

"From the shadows, hijacking democracy": After a 4-month undercover investigation, Channel 4 releases a devastating expose of Cambridge Analytica #TrumpRussia #Brexit #Mercers 
Look. Whether you want #Brexit or not is irrelevant.Because of demographics and changing contexts, in 20 years the government and opposition claim to be "respecting the referendum result" will be seen as a manipulative deceit on a par with Tony Blair's WMD dossier.
Brexiters rant about great trade deals once we free ourselves from 27 other countries. But what they don't understand is that good deals require bargaining power, of which the EU has far more than the UK. Freedom without power is impotence. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
Minister in Lords says Parliament has no real say on #Brexit any more. If there is a bad deal on offer, Parl will have to vote to leave with no deal at all. Minister says Parl has been Instructed by the ppl to Leave on any terms. This surely undermines our Parl democracy
Another important milestone reached on the road to the final #Brexit deal – one that’s good for the UK and the EU. 
Brexiters demanded, and Michael Gove agreed, that the government must secure the UK’s control of its waters from #Brexit day. Today, it was confirmed they haven’t done that.

Hey @STVNews noticed you slipped in that Scottish fishermen were blaming both the @scotgov & UK Government for their betrayal. Pray tell how that works the @scotgov has not been allowed any say in #Brexit negotiations!
Hey @Daily_Express I don’t want to stay in the #EU by sleight of hand. I’m openly campaigning to stay because that’s what my constituents & country voted for! Why don’t u tell your readers the truth for a change? @theSNP #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope #brexit #FBPE
For advocates of #Irexit or #Eirexit by referendum alone, today’s #Brexit surrender proves:You can’t Leave the EU with a Remain government.Only a National Government will ever be a Leave government.For a National Government, you need to join/support/vote for a National Party. 
There’s a sound of the can being kicked down the road in the #Brexit transition deal today. The Ireland border issue could still bring the whole deal - transition and the rest of a Brexit deal tumbling down if no agreed solution found
If #Brexit goes ahead the country will be nothing more than an ugly squabbling stinkpit for generations. People will leave in droves.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
#Brexit is reducing our influence & global standing on the world stage, exemplified by recent voting defeats at the UN. The Gvt.s ‘global Britain’ slogan is meaningless, underpinned by no clear political, strategic or funding analysis & is just a superficial rebranding exercise.
Is it time to cancel #Brexit?
Selmayrgate serves as a reminder that in the EU, all the big decisions are made behind closed doors by unelected and unaccountable officials  #Brexit
Because Ted Heath traded Scotland’s fisheries to get Britain in to the EU, and today his successor has traded them to get Britain out - in a #Brexit that violates the will of 62% of the Scottish people. 
‘We’ve sold out our fisheries AGAIN' @Nigel_Farage rages as fishing rights have been traded off #brexit
Absolutely, @acgrayling, I completely agree with you. This whole #brexit fiasco has made me - and so many millions of people like me - strengthen my identity with Europe.  The mood IS altering in this country. Bring on the second referendum! #stayorgo

All the @Conservatives and @theresa_may have done with the transition period is to kick the ball down the road till 2021. If you think for a second that ‘we the people’ are going to allow you to betray the vote taken by 17.5million people in 2016 think again! #Brexit
.@theresa_may had 5 tests for #Brexit; one was to protect jobs & security; another was to keep Britain outward-looking. A broken border and rotting food at Calais fail those tests. A hard #Brexit will cripple business

Progress is made in #Brexit negotiations.EP will have final say.Discrimination against EU citizens during transition period & obstacles to free movement for UK nationals resident in EU are removed. EP will scrutinize & adapt the procedure for our citizens 
Great news. @theresa_may has delivered on #Brexit again despite @UKLabour's best efforts to screw it up!
Do you have confidence in this government producing the #Brexit that you voted for ?
UK and EU decide to postpone #brexit because 'it's way more complicated than first suggested' and 'basically it might not be as good an idea as we thought'
Regular reminder that @Nigel_Farage only bothered to turn up at 1 out of 42 EU fisheries committee meetings.He never cared a damm about UK fishermen or #Fishing, he just used you for his political ends....& to cover up for the #brexit disaster - he is trying to use you again. 
OMG !  How does Nicola Sturgeon now dare criticise the UK government for selling out the fishing industry when she's been driving for us to stay in the EU ?Unbelievable !#Brexit
"What happened in the #EUref is that people voted for departure. They were unable to vote on destination because it was not made clear." @CarolineLucas #Brexit 
Despite British Prime Minister Theresa May’s utterance that no Brititish Prime Minister would ever agree to Brexit backstop for the north legally keeping us in custom union & single market - she did exactly that in Dec & furthermore confirmed that today #Brexit #specialstatus
Correct. This Government never has been serious about #BREXIT 
Welcome progress in #Brexit negotiations. The EP will scrutinise & have the final say.The UK's attempt to discriminate against EU citizens in the transition has been defeated. The EU must allow free movement for UK nationals resident in the EU after Brexit 
Well that didn't take long... #Brexit
This agreement with the EU in no way matches what I hoped to achieve for fishing. It will mean our fishing waters continue to be controlled by Brussels for much longer than expected.  We must have complete control of our waters after Brexit.#Brexit #fishing
June 2016:“Let’s take back control!”March 2018:*gives away all control*#Brexit #transition
#Brexit will harm the UK and millions of innocent citizens if we allow it to go ahead. Which is why we're going to #StopBrexit2018
Scottish Rural Secretary @FergusEwingMSP on the #Brexit transition deal: 'Ruth Davidson and Michael Gove should apologise for fishing sell-out'. 
India has already made clear it will use its bargaining muscle to make #Brexit Britain accept more immigration from India in return for a trade deal. Leavers say we will have more freedom to negotiate deals after Brexit. But freedom without power is impotence.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Had several conversations with Scottish fishermen about #Brexit last year. All of them laughed at my point of view that UKG would use their coastal waters as a bargaining chip. They called me a Nat muppet & liar.To them, after today's #fish grab, I say who's the muppet liars
Good to see @simoncoveney again before my meeting with @DavidDavisMP this morning. Full support for Ireland. Backstop solution must apply unless and until another solution is found #Brexit 
So @DavidDavisMP announces that UK Government will sign away our place around the table without knowing what comes next. It's the height of irresponsibility to contemplate ‘exit day’ passing with no EU trade deal in place, fooling people with a false sense of security #Brexit
Scottish Twitter today is really confusing today. A group of people who are against #Brexit are taking the piss out of people trying to implement Brexit for not implementing enough Brexit quickly enough. While still being against Brexit.
The most striking first impression of the EU transition draft is that UK ‘s many promises to the most strident #Brexit interest groups (Fishing, DUP etc) have all been abandoned in order to secure the agreement.  Illustrates @GovUK’s weakness at home and abroad.
I was so against #Indyref last time. Now I implore Scotland to save themselves from this mess. Godspeed, my friends. #Scotland #BREXIT 
Whether it's sabotage or incompetence, May's government has folded pocket aces at every stage of the #Brexit 'negotiations'. This latest capitulation must now trigger a leadership challenge. We need a Brexiteer at the helm. #LeaveEU #Mogg4PM
"The United Kingdom will be able to ratify new trade deals - Brexit Secretary David Davis says businesses will not be affected during #Brexit transition 
Re today's #Brexit deal..... So the English have just thrown the DUP under a bus in order to save the City of London - who would ever have thought they'd do a thing like that to their most loyal subjects???
Naysayers a year ago: May will never get Article 50 passed. She does!4 months ago: She'll never clear Stage 1 of negotiations: She does!After Xmas: Theresa May will never sort out a transition deal: Nearly done! Well done @theresa_may #Brexit 
So the very @GovUK Minister who told me that differentiation for parts of the UK was “impossible” now accepts that it might have to happen after all.  Continued SM membership for Scotland therefore perfectly feasible after #Brexit  and @ScotGov will continue to advocate it.
Having sold out the Scottish fishing industry once before, the Tories are doing it again, just as many of us warned they would. You cannot trust the Tories on fishing. Not then, not now and not in future. #SellOut #Brexit 
It looks as though most of Theresa May's Red Lines have just turned Green. Just Northern Ireland to go... #Brexit
Anyone else feel that this has all been stage managed from the beginning ?#Brexit #Brexiteers #LeaveEU

Brexit Secretary David Davis said that the agreement represented a"significant step" on ensuring a time-limited implementation period after Brexit which would deliver the certainty demanded by business. #Brexit
The farce with the #Brexit negotiations continues. David Davis and his team instead if walking out and forcing Michael Barnier to beg London for any deal are negotiating a perverse arrangement for the UK to have no say yet abide by EU laws and rules. What the hell is that?
The reaction to the events in Salisbury from our European allies has been much warmer than President Trump, who has gone out of his way not to support Britain against Russia. #Brexit leaves us reliant on the irrational Trump and threatens our security cooperation with the EU.
The UK and EU, will Brexit actually change anything? £Billions spent on this #Brexit shambles could have been spent on our wonderful #NHS. We MUST have a 2nd ref. Electorate is sick of all this nonsense.
Uncomfortable reading for Remain voters. #Brexit#NHS

#CFP has been a disaster for British fishermen who voted for Brexit in huge numbers. #Brexit means full repatriation of our fisheries; anything less will have consequences in fishing constituencies. UK Govt must not give in to the EU’s bullying tactics. 
Boris Johnson has the sheer gall to call the Russians liars.... #brexit he is a typical Arrogant Tory 
"It would be "utterly self-defeating" for the UK's aerospace industry to divert away from the EU's regulatory framework after #Brexit, a parliamentary committee has found."
Your @WelshLabour Govt is to launch a consultation with children and young people to ensure they have a say about the #Brexit process. It will ensure their views are represented in the @WelshLabour Govt’s decisions about #Wales’ future once the UK leaves the EU. @huw4ogmore

This is a pretty good statement by #EU foreign ministers, showing why it's worth having partners rather than being alone. Interesting to see whether @theresa_may raises #SkripalCase at #EUCO this week - or will it be totally crowded out by #Brexit? 
Pathetic hypocrisy! #Brexit is Putin's wet dream, and Theresa May and the rest of the Tory Brextremist crew are betraying Britain by helping that dream come true. If you want to be tough on Putin stop Brexit!#BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #FBPE
The “#Brexit dividend” doesn’t exist.  In fact #Brexit will cost all of us a lot of money.  The reality will be further Tory austerity because of Rees -Mogg and his pals’ imperialistic delusions.  Still millionaires will feel it less harshly than the rest of us. 
They naïvely think #Brexit is about regaining Control whereas we'll lose Control & Influence over EU policies, we'll lose Rights..& the Govt is grabbing control over Parliament.These charlatans aren't interested in the Will of the Ppl merely in imposing their will on the Ppl 
There is a lot of hype about David Davis, the #Brexit Secretary, being in Brussels today for talks. But, speaking to EU27 ministers and senior figures at EU insititutions, it’s clear who is leading negotiations for the UK side: Ollie Robbins, the PM’s #Brexit advisor.
 Press conference today at 12:45pm (Brussels time) following latest round of #Brexit negotiations  watch live here: 
Here's news about the campaign to highlight that #Brexit promised a big fat burger and is turning out to be an almost empty bun  Look out for the billboards and please retweet
In 1933, Germany left League of Nations. In 1934, Hitler passed the Nuremberg Race laws depriving Jews of citizenship. In 2018 Tory MP Sir Christopher Chope has put forward a private members bill to deprive #EU nationals of all benefits. …  #fbpe #brexit 
The Tories have more than doubled cuts on the poorest since re-election in 2015 and #Brexit would deepen austerity. Give the People the #FinalSay
Your daily reminder that #Brexit is built on a tissue of lies that are unravelling. The British people were sold a false prospectus. We must have a #FinalSay with an option to #ExitFromBrexit and #Remain. Anything else would be undemocratic and a danger to the national interest.
#Brexiters, you voted to take away the rights of four million people to live in their own homes. Don't deny it, don't defend it. That is what #Brexit means. We have to ask for permission to live in our own homes. You did it to us.
After a brutal winter, parts of the NHS are close to breaking point. Leaving the EU would only deepen the staffing and financial crisis. To be the party that (again) saves the #NHS, Labour must stand against #Brexit. Thank you @BenPBradshaw for securing this vital debate 
Oh dear. Seems the @ScotTories have quite a bit to learn about parliamentary tactics #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
.@BBCPolitics Remember how excited you all got about fishing during #Brexit referendum? Remember those pictures of Farage and Hoey and the flotilla on Thames? I hope you are going to report on govt reneging on promise to ‘take back control of our waters’SW fishers demand truth
On early flight to Brussels for meeting with @MichelBarnier this morning - important day in #brexit negotiations in build up to EU Council on Thurs/Fri - no backsliding on Irish Border issue remains clear focus to facilitate progress on other issues.

Monday's front pages: The Sun and Mail never fail to put the boot in to Facebook. Curious that they're both so reluctant to go all out on the Cambridge Analytica story #Brexit 
Given all the Russia related mud slinging this story about the #Brexit Select Committee majority report is not getting enough coverage. I’m proud to be one of the “high priests of #Remain”  #FBPE 
Frankly I’ll believe it when I see it either a decent deal for fisheries from a UK Govt or in the event there isn’t a @ScotTories rebellion. #brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
Your "behavioural change communication" is psychological manipulation pure & simple. What you've done to this country by meddling in #Brexit is despicable. I hope you're made to feel the full force of the law and that ultimately your pet disaster capitalism project is overturned.
The European Union is one giant protectionist racket:  #Brexit
This is a very interesting episode of @RemainiacsCast -albeit pretty worrying given what @jayrayner1 says about #brexit likely effect on the food industry. If unlike @michaelgove you think it’s vital we listen to experts, tune in & then highlight the issues to others.#StopBrexit

We must leave the CFP and we must be able to decide who comes in to our waters to fish, and how much they catch. A failure to deliver would mean this historic opportunity that Brexit represents to revitalise our coastal communities would simply be thrown away #Brexit @ScotTories
We cannot allow our country to fall into the hands of the small minded nationalists.We are European Citizens, we are the many and we will be heard.Fight for what we know is right.Fight against Brexit and those who would harm our great country.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
The only way to stop #Brexit is for  to have a political crisis, i.e. May to lose her majority, an election, some major upheaval.Then  would be amenable to extending Article 50.Forget Parliament voting down a deal, or a 2nd ref. Those are not happening.
Can anyone explain why the Brexiters  may be influenced by the alt right and Russia?And shouldn’t this be fully thrashed out in relation to how the UK proceeds?Isn’t it time for an Official Review to analyse the validity of the EU referendum in this regard?Suspend #Brexit!
Nigel Farage - "75% of the £40bn so-called leaving bill will be paid in the first 3-5 years. After that we will go on paying a sum of money for access to their markets."Given the amount of German motor cars, I expect they should be paying us for access to our market." #Brexit

The so-called Brexit Select Committee is made of 7 MPs who voted Leave and _14_ that voted Remain. Fourteen!Is Parliament, supposedly the seat of British democracy, even serious on enacting a democratic decision of the British people?#Brexit 
Theresa #May's ministers repeatedly warned that #Brexit would put #Britain at #Risk from #Russia. Surprise, surprise !
More #Brexit promises unravelling, this time for fishing communities. In spite of grandstanding it seems that government has no intention of ‘taking back control of our waters’. Unilateral action was never possible when so much of the catch is sold into EU market#BrexitReality
#Brexit is the Rule of Feeling as opposed to the Rule of Law. I think even non-legal folk can understand how dangerous that is. 
Three UK industries account for HALF of all UK R&D £22bn spending.  LifeSciences. Automotive.  Aerospace.  Problem is they’re also the 3 most challenged by #Brexit.  Excellent piece by @phillipinman @BusinessDesk

No Mr Benn, the majority report is written by Remoaners.  The minority report is written by @Jacob_Rees_Mogg and those who love democracy and freedom.Our #Brexit team will comment more fully tomorrow here: 
When the full story of attempted #Brexit is finally told, with all the illegal roubles, social media black ops, and right wing nutjobs exposed, there will be a fat chapter telling about the nobbling of @BBCnews. There are too many examples now for them not to be complicit.
One of many exhibits which will lead soon to the Cambridge Analytica #Brexit connection - and it’s huge 
Hilary Benn, chairman of the Committee on Exiting the EU (#Brexit): "We know of no international border, other than the internal borders of the EU, that operates without checks and physical infrastructure. This is deeply concerning."
"What happened to young people" to make them unwilling to accept #Brexit? asks angry, aggressive man who knew Margaret Thatcher.Young person answers him calmly and rationally.What happened was that they saw through the nonsense pushed by people like him.#bbctbq
No @jeremycorbyn - please learn from @nick_clegg. Making pledges you can't keep is toxic. There is only one way out of this, change policy on #Brexit and support full EU membership. The only way to stop job losses in the North East. Please share. 
Good to see MPs recalling @CamAnalytica after brilliant @carolecadwalla scoop in today’s Observer & BBC finally reporting this very important #Brexit related story. 
Vladimir Chizhov, Russian ambassador to EU, says he was looking forward to closer relations with UK after Brexit, when we would no longer be constrained by EU sanctionsCheck out the Russian connection with #Brexit here: 
The Russian bullshit has managed to successfully cover up #Brexit, and the latest paedophile scandal in #Telford and hundreds of children raped. Well done UK's MSM for playing the game of being stooges for UK state, instead of free press you claim you are. #marr #marrshow
Cambridge Analytica also rigged #Brexit vote thru FacebookTheresa May's ministers repeatedly warned that Brexit would put Britain at risk from Russia - Business Insider #TrumpRussia
Very impressed to see Cambridge Lib Dems campaigning against #Brexit outside the Guildhall in yesterday's freezing weather! #StopBrexit campaigners are certainly not put off by a few snowflakes!
The #brexit elite (rees mogg, ids, johnson, fox etc.) have an overwhelming need for UK to be out of the EU before the true impacts of leaving are understood#stopbrexit before transition, after will be too late#waton#fbpe#may3
“Pity our poor country, misled by fantasists and unable to do what needs to be done. But that is the hallmark of all countries in irreversible decline”. >>We agree with most of this. Except it need tot be irreversible if we act now by stopping #Brexit.  
Gibraltar is not immediately covered by #brexit transitions deal, Spain’s Fgn ministry confirms. My latest. 
A brilliant site for Brexiteers I can highly recommend. The #RoadToBrexit will be blocked by EU falsehoods and deception at every turn. Smash through them with help from @Facts4euOrg  #Brexit
#Brexit Cambridge Analytica are a UK co, Bannon was their Chief Exec, the expert hired to create the data harvesting app was Russian but employed at Cambridge Uni. The whole business stinks and the only decent media coverage is from @carolecadwalla @guardian
More starting to say it as it is but goodness why has it taken so long to get here when it was blindingly obvious any form of #Brexit must leave us Poorer, Weaker with Fewer Rights and less Control.Binding #FinalSayForAll on the Deal with a #Remain option.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
There are just 6 Brexiters out of 21 on the #Brexit Committee. Us Brexiters may be in the minority on the committee, but we need to ensure we speak up for the 17 million people who voted to Leave.  
Well I never. Brexit Committee in Commons concludes extending Article 50 period might be necessary. Took them a while, but better late than never! #brexit 
In UK — British airline @VirginAtlantic just announced losses of 28.4 million for the last year. Contributors to loss: • Weak pound because of #Brexit • Grounding of Boeing 787s due to Rolls-Royce engine issues• Hurricane disruption at their destinations Caribbean and US. 
The involvement of Cambridge Analytica in the #Brexit referendum is being investigated by @ElectoralCommUK and @ICOnews Read more about its boss Alexander Nix and his boasting about involvement in the  campaign
If @jeremycorbyn is making this pledge, the only way to hold it is for him to campaign for and whip his MPs to #stopbrexit and then have that backed up by a #FinalSayForAll - if he continues with any #brexit the evidence shows the North East will be badly effected in all cases! 
And so it should, #brexit is a farce that will leave the UK with "No Control" whatsoever, and the whole country will be much much worse off.Even many hardened leavers are now seeing this is the case and weakening their stance. The only sensible option is to withdraw A50 now 
Is *anyone* surprised to hear that Mercer/Bannon’s Cambridge Analytica — who worked on BOTH Trump’s campaign and #Brexit — has ties w/#Russiathat they FAILED to disclose to British Parliament just last month8/#TrumpRussia
This is the lead political correspondent for the leading Sunday Newspaper in Britain. Apparently, he's dismissed already the idea that Cambridge Analytica played any role in #Brexit. Screenshot it. 
You know why., Tim. Cambridge Analytica leads to Brexit. Bannon (who part owned it) mates with @Nigel_Farage These newspapers don't want to derail #Brexit, and will cover up this story (only just starting) at almost any cost 
#Brexit Referendum was stolen with dirty money, stolen data and the lies  facilitated by Facebook.Our sovereignty has been stolen in a coup d’etat.  @theresa_may this cannot stand.

The idea that the UK can 'leave' the EU is nonsense. The EU will remain the economic superpower next door. It will continue to wield enormous influence over Britain, but by leaving it we surrender our currently very large power in its decision making. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit.
What will happen to #CambridgeAnalyticaFiles? Where will that accumulated data from the "non-data breach" go? How much of it has already been sold to some other entity?Details are staggering. Two decisive votes were involved: #Brexit & US POTUS election 2016.Both upsets. 5/ 
Lovely to spend the evening yesterday with @LiamFox and @consabroad discussing the many successes of @tradegovuk and looking ahead to post #Brexit opportunities 
It wasn't just the 2016 presidential election that #CambridgeAnalytica manipulated. In Britain, the Mercer-funded company is facing Parliamentary and regulatory investigations into allegations that it performed illegal work on the “#Brexit” campaign.

Latest #brexit absurdity if we aren't going to enforce border controls in Ireland but Ireland is obliged to maintain them doesn't that mean we are handing over control of our borders to the EU?
Brexit 'should be delayed' to give UK more time for a better deal, MPs set to urgeSeems clear that government is woefully unprepared but this will not go down well with EU side who want #Brexit done and dusted to move on to other issues on their agenda
So Mrs May wants to remove any restrictions on people and goods entering or leaving the UK by having an open border in Ireland and Dover. So the only restriction in movement #Brexit delivers is for UK citizens. They're taking away our rights for no good reason.#Brexit is bollox
The Independent is doing John Major's bidding again. By touting 1400 poll as 'proof' that London Tory Voters favour a Second #Brexit Referendum. The Press is bought & paid for. No longer giving people information, instead they're brainwashers for the EU.
Listening to @BBCRadio4Today in parliament.The language used to describe Remainers is ABSURD."Arch Remainer @Andrew_Adonis"And voting down the bill is an attempt to "Scupper", "frustrate" and "filibuster" #Brexit

‘I didn’t vote for what it appears we’re going to get now.’Everyone, however they voted in 2016, needs the opportunity to take stock of where #Brexit has got to & is heading, and to choose #ExitFromBrexit through a #Brexitdeal vote if they conclude now: #itsnotworthit

The government of #Gibraltar has warned that it could rescind the #citizensrights and protections enjoyed by EU nationals living and working in the territory if Madrid uses its veto to exclude the Rock from any #Brexit deal between the EU and the UK. 
There are only two alternatives: either this is a deliberate attack  by HMG on the integrity of Brexit or HMG has lost control of its civil service. @BrugesGroup’s Robert Oulds gives Theresa May 36 hours to provide an explanation.#Brexit #EU @bbclaurak
In October there will be a meaningful parliamentary vote on the govt’s #brexit deal. On April 23rd there will be a debate on ensuring that vote includes an option to #remain if the deal does not match #brexit promises.I’ve just written to my MP about it  why not do the same? 
Here is a 3 tweet thread from very active #remainernow Josh (see ). It’s on why a number of people voted leave and how, in order to ensure more come out as #remainernow it must be made clear that #brexit is the opposite of the answer to their concerns.

PM told hard Irish border can only be avoided if UK stays aligned with EU rules, i.e. UK must remain in CU & SM with an open border with the EU in Ireland and Calais too. FOM will already continue during transition.So #Brexit is toast. Stop it and save billions.
NI Sec of State Karen Bradley tells a #stpatricksday breakfast in #DC that British people voted to leave the EU,they did not vote to leave Europe and the UK is a committed European country.She stressed there will be no border on the island of Ireland or in the Irish Sea. #Brexit

The bottom line is that a No Deal #Brexit will result in massive problems with Customs checks for exports from Britain, and the UK borders being far more open to abuse than they were with EU membership. It's lose lose lose all the way for Brexit Britain.

Corbyn suggests the #Skripal attack could have been carried out by the Russian mafia. This irresponsible & unfounded suggestion is exactly the kind of muddying of the waters that the Kremlin wants. On foreign policy including #Brexit Corbyn is Putin's loyal friend.#StopBrexit
When your child is the only girl in class with a foreign parent,the only girl who didn't get invited to a bday party and when she asks the bday girl why she wasn't invited and the answer is "because my mum says we don't want people like you in our house".The ugly face of #Brexit
Excellent answer from @LORDMARKPRICE on @BBCr4today earlier.Q: You say you would vote Remain again so will you try and stop #Brexit?A: I spent 30 years in the democratic John Lewis Partnership. If there is a vote you abide by the decision and make a success of it.

The way to get the world out of poverty is get high EU tariffs with emerging market economies down, which we will be able to do once we leave the EU. #Brexit
I haven’t voted for anything that will make us poorer. When we leave the EU, we will be growing well as long as we follow the right domestic policies. It is nonsense to say that the economy will be hit. #Brexit
If the will of the people had swung behind #Brexit , every recent opinion poll wouldn't have the country still split down the middle, 21 months on from the referendum.Surely even hard line #Brexiters can see that. Or do they just not care about their fellow citizens?

Steve Baker, who is now a #Brexit minister, called for the EU to be "wholly torn down". That would impoverish the people of Europe and massively benefit Putin. Why after the #Skripal attack, is he allowed to remain in government?#BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #FBPE

After #Brexit, Britain will pursue a commercial policy very similar the EU's: we have very similar interests, especially with Trump policies that show little regard for smaller trading partners. Leaving the Customs Union is thus a political decision, and a bad one at that.

Remember when staunch #Brexit backers presented a hamper of British goods to Michel Barnier?What could be more British than PG Tips and Marmite?Except that they're both made by Unilever, who are closing their UK headquarters after 88 years.Nothing to do with Brexit of course. 
The UK’s economic growth of 1.7% in 2017 is the slowest rate of increase since 2012. This is compared to the EU growing by 2.5%. #Brexit is harming the economy. @theresa_may must grant the public a vote on the deal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit.

1) Quick Corbyn threadSo, Corbyn said this about the #Brexit dividend "funds returned from Brussels to .... fund the NHS" 
#Putin’s strategy is divide and conquer, systematically encouraging division in the international community to enable the expansion of Russian power. A real response would be to stop playing into his hands with #Brexit.

There's a definite swing in the attitudes of #Brexiters. They now blame the downsides of #Brexit on the #Remain camp and the EU. They won't accept the consequences of their own actions. They say they knew what they were voting for, so they need to grow up and own the downsides.
European Parliament overwhelmingly voted today to put the final nail in the coffin of the Tories’ plan for creating tax-haven Britain post #Brexit.No cooperation on tax, no trade deal. 
‘For decades, London has been a playground for corrupt oligarchs, gangsters and plutocrats’@NewStatesman right to call for freezing of assets held by Mr Putin’s allies and associates and noting how #Brexit vote has strengthened Putin and weakened the UK
I thought #Brexit was meant to take back control? In order to maintain market access for industrial goods, we will have to apply almost identical trading rules. Is #Brexit really worth it?
I didn’t know Virgin Media did documentaries about #Brexit? 
A few of the Brexiters’ promises during the referendum, such as £350 million a week to the NHS would of course be welcomed. However, the problem is that none of them are true and none of these have been followed through. We will be worse of in every situation post-#Brexit.

Resounding speeches from trio of Tories in Lords - Hailsham, Patten, Cormack - in favour of Parliament ‘taking back control’ through a ‘meaningful vote’ on #Brexit withdrawal/transition/framework future rels agreement & follow-up, stopping govt crashing out with no deal
If the ‘Transition Agreement’ means we’re in the EU in every sense after March 2019 - except having a seat at the table and a voice... why wouldn’t we keep our voice and influence by extending our m’ship until the final deal is done in Dec 2020? #Brexit
Have to say that after all this, feel the most enormous foreboding about a #Labour government on present lines. Similar to #Brexit worries.

.@theSNP maintain double digit poll lead. Support for independence up since  2014 #IndyRef. 48% of respondents would vote Yes if a referendum held tomorrow. Clear majority support for independence with under 55s The #Brexit penny is dropping. 
As if #Brexit wasn’t bad enough - Take it from a former British EU negotiator—May will regret destroying trust in these negotiations  via @prospect_uk
The UK economy is already being damaged by #Brexit. The impacts will only worsen. The public must be granted a chance to vote on the deal with an option to #ExitFromBrexit.
Always read the small print - it's how we might get a Brexit deal referendumA little-known and little-noticed provision in the European Withdrawal Bill could be the key to triggering a referendum on any #Brexit deal, writes  @Andrew_Adonis#FBPE
Another service we’ll lose. The CE mark is one of EUs best kept secrets. The Leavers failed to tell us that when they lied to the Brits. We can and must stop #Brexit #givusasayMrsMay #ExitFromBrexit
We have a window of two years to achieve reforms. #Brexit was not followed by Nexit, Dexit or Frexit, but that doesn’t mean it’s not going to happen in the future; if we are in the incapacity to reform the EU. That is our common responsibility #FutureofEurope
A great rolled-up thread on liar and traitor Nigel Farage."Here is a thread on Nigel #Farage. His lies, his fans, his friends, his campaigns worldwide... and a few questions. (1/41)2/ For a start, #B […]" @Hayleeee1848 #StopBrexit #FBPE #brexit
Now the true implications of #Brexit are clear, the public must have a chance to vote on the deal with an option to #ExitFromBrexit. Weakened environmental standards, lower animal welfare standards, our NHS for sale and workers rights are all under threat with this government.

Really sorry to see #StephenHawking. A true national treasure. He fought to the end to highlight how dreadful #Brexit will be for British science. He's so right!
There we go, Tomkins, Green and co, fighting tooth and nail to remove powers from Scotland and reduce its ability to look after Scottish people.Give it a watch on @TrulyScottishtv#ContinuityBill #Brexit
Gist of Scottish Tory arguments: No matter how bad #Brexit will be for Scotland the ‘integrity of the United Kingdom must not be put at risk’. For Tories, Scotland is expendable and can be sacrificed.  #ContinuityBill
Good morning, @andrealeadsom On LBC you asserted that the British people voted OVERWHELMINGLY for #Brexit.When you go out and about to meet the people, you might wish to know that only one in four actually did.#StopBrexit
Getting rid of #RT is part of the #Europhile  'elite' preparations for a revote on #Brexit - all rather convenient for some. And, given the May regime's refusal to abide by international law on alleged chemical attacks, increasingly suspicious. #falseflag
Stephen Hawking a man of great intellect understood that #Brexit was bad for the UK. He also fought for the NHS which fought for him. Our biggest tribute to him should be to remove the Govt that is underfunding the NHS and blundering through #Brexit.
If there is no #brexit deal, brexit is so so so far from what was promised from Boris et al Art 50 must be revoked.#Waton #exitfrombrexit #stopbrexit #finalsay #remain Petition:If no agreement to leave the European Union is reached, Art 50 be withdrawn
Is this the same #Brexit that was going to save us £350 million a week?! BREXIT IS A CON AND MUST BE STOPPED NOW! #Stopbrexit#StopBrexitSaveBritain

"YOUR EU PARLIAMENT, YOUR UNELECTED LEADERS, AND YOUR BREXIT" - Essential reading on yesterday's events, from the #Brexit Facts4EU team: 
This  History will not look kindly on MPs who fail to act in the best interests of their constituents & fail to oppose this! How much more evidence do MPs need that (a) #brexit is bad for Britain (b) it’s not wanted by the majority of the U.K. before they step up?#stopbrexit
RIP my old buddy #StephenHawkingTaught me all I know about the universe, and had a few things to say against #Brexit too. The world will be an even stupider place without you sir, God bless x#StopBrexit #FBPE #Remain
The money no longer sent to the EU will be used to fund things previously funded by the EU. Looks like the only #brexit dividend to be expected is an 8% drop in GDP and fewer nurses and doctors. 
Another service we’ll lose. The CE mark is one of EUs best kept secrets. The Leavers failed to tell us that when they lied to the Brits. We can and must stop #Brexit #givusasayMrsMay #ExitFromBrexit 
It won’t be impossible to co-ordinate foreign policy with #EU after #Brexit, on #Russia or other issues. But it will be harder: we won’t be in the room, or in the corridors where informal chats happen. #Trump is a lost cause, I fear. See 
Nigel faragski putins #brexit pride and joy 
Over three quarters of the UK does not want #Brexit, Frans. The British government is acting unconstitutionally, forcing us to leave when we want to #RemainInTheEU. Your solidarity is very much appreciated!
The #Brexit scam leaves this country weakened, isolated and virtually powerless in the wake of a resurgent and revengeful Russian regime.   Nailed by @anneapplebaum
"Britain will be paying #Brexit 'divorce bill' until 2064, Treasury watchdog says "And by 2064, most of the folks who voted for it and championing it now... will be dead. #FinalSayForAll
If we really want to #annoy #Russia, we should cancel #Brexit 
I've seen a lot in my political years but I can honestly say I've never been more afraid for the future of the UK & our democracy....What is wrong with our politicians that they can't see that by winning #Brexit we lose all our values! Why can't Labour see what they're party to?
#Brexit irony nr. 382Brexit's been handled so badly that British under30s - usually a group mostly uninterested in things EU - are now some of most pro european young in EU & almost guarantees a "join the EU" movement will succeed in a few years - that is if we still leave.
Our @Nigel_Farage as vladimir Putins very own #brexit mouthpiece LORD HAW HAWSKI 
If they get away with this it will be beyond all doubt that the Tories no longer can claim any democratic credibility...this is becoming an electoral dictatorship...they & their #Brexit must be stopped if we are ever to get back to being a country worthy of its former reputation.
This chart comparing UK contributions to EU (light blue) with 'divorce settlement' after #Brexit (dark blue) & money planned to pay for items formerly funded by the EU (yellow) shows its #AllPainNoGain#BrexitReality
The tide has turned. I'm listening to the pub bores slagging off #brexit
Tories vote to cut free school meals in England; the only minority they have ever represented are the well off and privileged. They will do unspeakable damage under #Brexit. And at some point a clear majority of Scots will realise its time for Scotland to go her own way.
Giles & Mary on Gogglebox.....Brexit is like putting sugar in a petrol tank just completely stalled the country.  Well said. What a superb metaphor. #Brexit #Gogglebox #Remain
What he said: "You'll regret leaving the EU"What he meant: "We wish to make sure you regret leaving the EU"#JunckerLove#Brexit 
One thing comes out of the so-called poisoning scandal in #Salbury clearly: having totally messed up the #Brexit talks Theresa May's government is now creating distractions to cover up its grotesque incompetence.
Cost of #Brexit : No wonder people ask #IsItWorthIt ...!
At a time when the British press has embarrassed itself with the most appalling lies and distortions about #Brexit , #Trump , #Russia , #Yemen , #Ukraine , #Afghanistan , paedophile gangs and corruption in politics hacks are given #PressAwards Talk about a feast during a plague.
The rise of Juncker's top aide Martin Selmayr shows why the EU's days are numbered:  #Brexit
Something the UK govt & Brexiters fail to understand, at the expense of us all. #Brexit 
Strong public support for UK over #Salisbury. Amid principled arguments abt #Brexit this reminds us that the values which underpin and unite the European democracies 
Scrap #Brexit Scrap Austerity Scrap the Conservatives Scrap The Daily Mail Scrap Katie Hopkins Scrap Nigel Farage Scrap Tommy Robinson Make Britain Great Again.
Thing is #Brexit isn't just about weakening our economy, it's also about having Rights removed, about separating ourselves from our closest neighbours & friends, all of whom share a common set of values & a cultural inheritance & it's about binning 40 yrs of diplomacy 4 nothing?!

"We voted two years ago to leave this sclerotic union. Any document that includes ECJ oversight and doesn’t take back control of our fishing waters is unacceptable." #Brexit 
Diane James MEP - "The UK does not wish to be a vassal state. And we really take exception to being told that we should continue having the jurisdiction of the ECJ." #Brexit 
Gerard Batten MEP - "When the British people voted to leave, they voted to take back control. No more money to the EU, no more EU laws imposed upon us, no more open borders. #Brexit must mean exit." 
BLOG: John Middleton @doctorblooz, President of the @FPH, on why he is supporting the cross-party ‘do no harm’ amendment to the #EUWithdrawalBill due to be debated in the @UKHouseofLords -  #Brexit #DoNoHarm
Let's recap:- #brexit has alienated our european friends.- whoever owns the USA now, it's safe to say it's no longer our staunch supporter.- Russia is openly taunting us, making an example of us, and there's nothing we can really do, alone. -And nobody is talking about this.
Young people were the only ones wise enough to vote against the madness of #Brexit. The EU and its member states should therefore allow the UK to participate in @EUErasmusPlus after Brexit.
Britain doesn’t fear leaving the EU. It is the EU that fears Britain succeeding when we leave. My latest speech on #Brexit
Interesting how May & Tillerson 'know factually' that it was Russia within an hour of a double agent being killed but we can't get truthful answer on Las Vegas, Parklands, 911, MH307, Steele, #BREXIT, WMD, acid attacks, car attacks, knife attacks, Rotherham, Telford ...
.@theresa_may’s speech the other week on #Brexit showed an astonishing lack of realism. We aren’t able to ‘pick and choose’ what EU regulations we want to adhere to. She is wasting time with unrealistic speeches and must act soon to agree a deal. 
Do you know someone who voted leave being told that #brexit would be easy & make UK no worse off. Well maybe it’s worth telling them to read both this headline & article underlying it. Tell them it’s ok to change their mind and be a #remainernow#finalsay
We'll soon be writing on this subject yet again.  @theresa_may , when we leave the EU we must not leave our troops behind, shackled to EU structures, with UK paying into EU common defence instead of @NATO.Read the most original daily #Brexit news: 
#Brexit won't take place, I expect Theresa May to make a speech in next days for unity with Europe (a return in EU ranks) in light of "Russian aggression".Tories never wanted to leave the #EU, most of them continue to falsely say that it was a Putin's plot.Tories = #NWO
Remind us: where exactly in the referendum campaign were we told *this*? What on earth are we saddling our younger generations with? More reason to give us a #Voteonthedeal please. #Brexit #DivorceBill #OBR
It’s time for businesses to step-up and expose the truth of what #Brexit will do to our economy. 
Is it me, or is Vince Cable doing his best to dress like a Russian spy today ?#Brexit & #LeaveEU
Nice work team Sheffield!  I hear we got 70 sign ups for @YEM_UK today! #Sheffield youngsters mobilising against #BrexitThanks to @natalieben for coming at no notice and rounding up a gang of green supporters! #StopBrexit
1. There is a strong contingent of academia on Twitter so wrapped up in their citizen-of-nowhere bubble that they believe almost any #Brexit scare story with zero application of critical faculties. Only too happy to slander the British public as racist and ignorant.
#BREXIT is going to have a dramatic impact on many parts of the economy. Financial services has long been one of our high revenue, high tax paying industries. A negative impact here will matter to everyone in the UK. @thatginamiller @markboleat in debate this morning
#SpringStatement none-event. #economy bumping on bottom. #Brexit undermining #Growth now slowest in G20. No tax windfall to spend. Have to accept #tax increases to pay for #NHS and social care, police and schools. 1p increase in income tax. Scrap post 2015 cuts in CGT and  IHT.
We had a visit from the charming @TRobinsonNewEra who told us the promised money for the NHS had been given to 10,000 Syrians we ‘let in’ instead. Should we unite behind #Brexit with people like Tommy? I don’t think so! Time to #StopBrexitSaveBritain #SODEMaction #FBPE
Dear #Brexit fans.Trump is not interested in Russian inspired nerve gas attacks in the UK. The EU very definitely is.Please note very carefully who our friends are.#StopBrexit
Today's @Independent cartoon #TheresaMay #SalisburySpy #RussianDonations #Brexit 
Worth stressing that the so-called 'divorce bill' consists of payments the UK would have had to make ANYWAY had we remained a member of the EU. It is not therefore a 'cost' of #Brexit... #SpringStatement
"Scotland is shackled to a sinking ship" says @IanBlackfordMP The Chancellor must tell the House as a matter of urgency how the economy will withstand a hard #Brexit. #SpringStatement
.@IanBlackfordMP for @theSNP lists the economic realities; Tory mismgmt means UK now has slowest growth of any advanced economy: wages are squeezed & productivity & GDP growth forecasts slashed even before #Brexit #impactassessments#SpringStatement
When a government sees an impending threat to the people in its care, it fails in its duty if does nothing to remove that threat. My speech in Plenary this morning #Brexit 
During a key debate in EP today I explained that the current British position, dictated by the DUP, is political lunacy, that would harm unionist workers, students, businesses and farmers as much as their republican counterparts. #Brexit 
OBR estimates that the UK's financial settlement on leaving the EU will be £37.1 billion - most of it will fall due in the five years after #Brexit, smaller amounts will have to be paid for decades to cover pension liabilities
The most important message to get out there - is that we the people - can stop #Brexit. Remember that die hard Leavers are a minority and they cannot be allowed to trash the UK for generations. It's not over by a long shot so keep shouting and dont accept this Brexshit.
Punishing Putin while continuing with #Brexit is like fining someone £200 while gifting them £2 million. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Skripal
Which is why @UKLabour should be opposing #Brexit at every opportunity @shamichakrabar1 - join @Labour4EU to #StopBrexitNow
As the govt has confirmed that #Brexit will be damaging, surely those that don't want to #Brexit should be given an option to opt out of it. Job losses should only apply to #Leavers and #Leavers should only be able to see British doctors, dentists, pharmacists etc. Seems fair
As Hammond 'Fudges' his way through the Spring Statement .. Here's the reality of what's actually happening .. #Brexit #SpringStatement
Over £1.5 billion of #Brexit preparation funding for 2018-19 has been allocated (announced at Autumn Budget 2017). #SpringStatement
It's all well and good that the Chancellor rejects the 'doom and gloom' from opposition parties. The truth is that his party's #brexit plans are a real threat to our businesses, public services and local economies. #SpringStatement
#Brexit summed up in one picture. 
Well worth a watch of @AlynSmith’s fantastic speech from this morning’s #Brexit debate 
And the reason for UK's poor performance compared to the other 19 largest world economies is #Brexit says OECD and we haven't even left yet!We need to #ExitFromBrexit so we can compete across the globe.
With a broken #Brexit, a divided party, a failed #austerity policy (and no alternative in sight) AND a #Labour lead in the polls, Mrs #May and the #Tories can only fall back on that last resort of tyrants: the 'foreign foe' ploy to rally party & disguise disaster. How #Convenient
President Juncker just said that we are all going to regret #Brexit!  Let's all RETWEET this video to show him that we still back Brexit  
.@theresa_may has consistently failed to provide clarity throughout these #Brexit negotiations. She is simply piling confusion on top of complication. This is weakening our standing in negotiations and harming the economy as uncertainty over #Brexit is discouraging investment.
EU may retain fishing rights in UK waters in return for a trade deal. Now what was it about the UK holding all the cards in the negotiations! #LeaveLies #Brexit #StopBrexit
Multiple sources now reporting UK govt has provionally agreed to prolong Britain’s membership of both single market & customs union for two years after April 2019, when UK officially leaves EU. Possibility of later extending this #Brexit transition phase still being discussed.
Almost all the #Tories too embarrassed to show up for #European Parliament debate on #brexit 
“The 27 member states stand firm and united when it comes to #Ireland. For us this is not an Irish issue, it is a European issue. It is all for one, one for all. That is what it means to be part of this union.” #Brexit 
#Brexit: There can be no hard border between #Ireland and Northern Ireland. We stand by the Irish citizens. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar @campaignforleo and @FineGael can count on our full support.
Taking back control was a lie. Brexit means losing control. Losing rights. Losing opportunities. #brexit 
If we really want to punish Putin and Russia, then we should stop #Brexit and stay in the EU. That would send a much stronger message than any sanctions
.@JunckerEU in #EPlenary:  March #EUCO: United on global Trade, Fair on Social rights, Open to our Neighbourhood, Strong on the economy. #Brexit: time to turn commitments into agreements, no Irish issue, it is a European issue, that is what it means to be part of this Union. 
Last Tues, the High Court refused judicial review on releasing govt's #Brexit impact studies. By Thurs @CommonsEUexit published a summary of the info we sought. This battle was won by political pressure. We played our part – with your help. THANK YOU! 
.@MichelBarnier on the Irish border: The EU is ready to replace the 'backstop option' in the draft withdrawal agreement if the UK comes up with a better solution... a durable #Brexit agreement needs to include a solution to Irish border #EPlenary
Scottish Tories table over 100 amendments in an attempt to weaken the Scottish Parliament and hand powers to Westminster #ContinuityBill #Brexit #ScotRef
There is no point 'punishing' Russia for terrorism on British soil when by pushing on with #Brexit the government is handing Putin a victory vastly greater than any the pain any 'punishment' might inflict. #BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #FBPE
My speech in the @Europarl_EN on the resolution on the future relationship between EU-UK. #Brexit is a clear example of ideology triumphing over reason and is the epitome of bad government.#BrexitReality #StopBrexit
The controversy around the EU Commission’s draft withdrawal agreement is the result of @theresa_may’s cowardly failure to make choices of her own. In the absence of concrete proposals from the UK to resolve the difficult #Brexit questions, the Europeans forced the issue.
Brexit MPs & MEPs are now conceding that the warnings they dismissed as Project Fear were accurate, we WILL get poorer.The very basis of the #Brexit case has radically changed for the worse.  The people therefore deserve to vote on it.#FinalSay
European Parliament debates Brexit.  But where are the tories ? @POLITICOEurope @eurolabour #Brexit 
EuroParl Brexit debate. @MollyMEP is right to say Brexit is the triumph of ideology over reason. As such, it is the epitome of bad government @Labour4EU @RCorbettMEP @labour4europe #brexit #IsItWorthIt
There are no Tories in chamber to debate #Brexit negotiations and they are not using the opportunity to speak. Are they scared, embarrassed, irresponsible?I can’t remember the last time I heard a Tory make a convincing defence of Brexit. We have only useful idiots of far right.
Genuine question to Corbyn supporters.If he had never existed, what difference would that have made to fighting hard #Brexit?What would we have lost if he hadn't been around in the 20 months since the referendum?
The EU reported its fastest economic growth in 10 years in 2017, compared to the UK’s growth slowing. #Brexit and announcing we are coming out of the customs union is harming the UK economy, with our growth outstripped by Germany, France, Italy and even tiny Latvia.
On #citizensrights I think we are very near to a satisfying solution. By guaranteeing the existing rights of EU citizen living in Britain & UK nationals on the continent alike. No citizen will be the victim of #Brexit #EPlenary #FutureOfEurope
In our proposal such an association agreement w/Britain will be based on 4 pillars:1) Trade & economics2) Internal security3) Defense & foreign policy4) Thematic cooperationOne overall governance, one political oversight #Brexit #FutureOfEurope #EPlenary
We use the European Treaty. More precisely art.8 & 217 that foresee the possibility to establish in our neighbourhood so called "Association agreements", deep & special partnerships w/ the countries w/ whom we share a common territory, a common history #Brexit #EPlenary
So, the principled electorate won't vote for @LibDems because of unforgivable betrayal on tuition fees in coalition, but they will continue to vote for #Labour and #Tories despite their unforgivable betrayal of, & dereliction of duty to, this country on #Brexit. Sounds rational.
The best way of defying Russian Government would be to not go ahead with #Brexit. Breaking up a powerful bloc that extends to their borders is a key aim of #Russian foreign policy. Daily Mail thinks it's about the World Cup!
V strong statement by @EU_Commission President ,J.C. Junker @Europarl_EN on #Brexit .No hard border in Ireland _’Its not an Irish issue, it’s an EU issue’.  & no cherry picking !UK must come up with realistic proposals!! Some UK members not too happy!!
.@JunckerEU #EPlenary #Brexit “As we build our future together, we must continue to make each other stronger by working together towards a more united, stronger and more democratic Union. We need to focus on our European future – not on the past, and not on Brexit.”

The European Parliament plays a crucial role in the ongoing #Brexit negotiations. Watch our video to find out how and tune in for the plenary debate on EU-UK future relations today at 9am CET. 
I know it's obvious, but if #Brexit were going to be a huge success, multinational companies would be moving employees INTO the UK, in preparation for the expected bonanza rather than OUT of the UK?But no Brexiters have an answer why this is happening. Nothing.

The loss to Britain in its rebate on account of unkept EU promises to CAP reform adds up to about £42 billion (2005-2019 x 3bn)Can we ask the British Govt to deduct this sum before making any 'exit' payment to the EU, can we?#Brexit 
2005 Blair gave away part of our rebate in exchange for promises of reform to EU's CAP.EU never made the reforms.Britain lost ~£3 billion every year since. Will Blair give Britain back the loss that's mounted so far? Can he get his chums in the EU to do so?#EUFail#Brexit 
You do realise folks that the propaganda has been cranked up to ELEVEN because #Brexit is a clusterfuck of epic proportions? #NerveAgentGate pic.twitter.com/wqQ4fc1gSU
#Brexit is the UK having eaten so much cake in the last 40 years it has caused itself diabetes and now wonders why it can’t have any more.
In the 1930s quislings like these collaborated with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and were found to be on the wrong side of history - just as this pair will be.#Brexit #FBPE#ModernDayLordHawHaw
This is superb from @ChukaUmunna & @Anna_Soubry great to see such x-party Co-operation. They are right, if #brexit continues on this trajectory @UKLabour & @Conservatives will not be forgiven.Plenty of #remainernow undertones in here as well.

Only 12% of our economy is trade with the EU and only 8% of firms sell directly to the EU’s Single Market, but 100% of the economy is subject to EU regulation. #Brexit
So. Theresa May is going full Thatcher-esque warmonger on Russia. You could be forgiven for thinking that this is a transparent diversion from her and her party's disastrous polling and catastrophic handling of #Brexit. Its a Falklands rerun against a proper world power.
No Govt in Northern Ireland, constitutional crisis threatening with Scotland, cold war with Russia resumed, A+E waiting times the worst ever. Who in their right minds would choose to pursue now a #Brexit that will leave us poorer, less secure and with fewer friends in the world.

Delighted to now be sharing an office with @euromove @_Britain4Europe @Scientists4EU @HealthierIn @InFactsOrgThe movement is coming together! If #Brexit doesn't deliver everything that was promised, then people have every right to change their minds.
When the @BBCNews man rightly said just now Russia views UK as weak, he didn’t use the word that explains why #Brexit - Allies not exactly rushing out in support
So currently the UK is under attack in a trade war by the US, and a real war by Russia. Aren’t Russia and the US the only 2 countries in the world supporting #Brexit? #BrexitShambles
A free press is not one in which 80% by circulation peddles the same ERG-Farageist-Breitbart propaganda. What we have is not a free press, but one dominated by a far-right faction. And without a free press, the UK is no longer a functioning democracy. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
A new phase in the fight against #brexit has started. We are delighted to be a part of this step change in the campaign. 
As crunch time for #Brexit approaches, we had a fruitful discussion with @theresa_may -JM
Get real @theresa_may. You can’t pick and choose what parts of the EU you want without EU obligations. #Brexit will make us worse off in every situation. The public must be granted a vote on the deal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit.

Polling shows a gradual but small shift from #Leave to #Remain since the referendum That we might exit the EU with a majority against, let alone the supermajority in favour required in most countries, is an affront to democracy.#StopBrexit #Brexit
There is no "Brexit dividend", only a massive #Brexit cost. 
"This is not about Leave or Remain. It's about making a democratic choice according to our constitution" @eloisetodd and @BestForBritain are bringing a legal challenge for a second referendum before #brexit. Support the case here 
Vince spot on when he argues those voting for #Brexit robbed the young of their future. UK company shares ranked least popular asset class in the world says Bank of America survey of fund managers. Less investment = less opportunities. No wonder young people furious re: Brexit

Thanks to the 15,201 who signed the @libdems petition calling on @theresa_may 'not to sell Britain out' after #Brexit. She must protect our environmental & animal welfare standards, workers rights & ensure that our NHS isn't opened up to privatisation in any future trade deal. 
1/ Xenophobia is not racism. It stems from frightened & insecure people clinging to the group/nation & so being hostile to outsiders, claiming privileged status for insiders, and fearing enemies within.It is being ruthlessly exploited by the #Brexit elite.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Our self-imposed ‘red lines’ have boxed the government into a corner. They are so tilted to ultra Brexit opinion, even the cabinet cannot agree them. 125,000 jobs with Japanese companies are at risk post-#Brexit.
Big thanks to @OleRyborg for my #Brexit mackerel from Denmark! (“We’re all in the same boat” it says) 
Ministerial panic at the prospect of defeat over #Brexit and key domestic policies has created the most inactive parliament for at least two decades.
German trade with the UK fell 2% last year, whilst its exporters reported trade with the rest of the world grew 5%. An explosion in post #Brexit red tape blamed. One in 12 German companies planning to move investment out of UK to other EU countries.
"The Beeb is bound by impartiality rules."You are having a laugh???@BBC is totally biased against #Brexit,@realDonaldTrump etc.@Ofcom should keep them in line but they are just a toothless watchdog who do nothing.
Why both wings of the Tory Party are pretending to back Theresa May on #Brexit. My latest blog for @carnegieeurope
Some of us believe in a Global Britain. To brand all those who supported #Brexit as white, old, and racist is cheap and wrong. 
An obnoxious slur against the 17.4m who voted #Brexit. If #VinceCable wants to see racism then he should take a look in the mirror at the anti-white racist staring back. Time to retire Vince.
Those who want to stop #Brexit have to understand that another referendum where 50 plus 1 wins won't work. It would have to be a majority of well over 60% before it would have any legitimacy & stifle leaves demand to honour the first referendum.
[REPOST] #Brexit strongly linked to xenophobia, scientists conclude. ‘I think the Leave campaign gave a new, acceptable way to express xenophobia’. These findings were true regardless of voter age, gender or education. 
I feel that pointing out the UK's chief #Brexit negotiator hasn't attended any Brussels negotiations this year is a legitimate criticism, but then keeping David Davis as far away from the process as possible seems like a sound strategic decision, so... 
Thanks - and you are right.  Defending Scotland ‘s democracy, maintaining its links with Europe and listening to people’s #Brexit views  is what I have been tasked to do and that is what I will go on doing as long as @ScotGovFM wants me to.
Wow. So we HAVEN’T seen all of the #Brexit impact assessments. What is it that has been withheld? How bad a picture does it paint? Hopefully the @GoodLawProject @JolyonMaugham case is still going ahead, as we surely have a right to know. #FinalSay #FBPE

LETS BE CLEAR-there we have it. The European Union Act 2011 complicates matters over #Brexit-Now a legal battle is inevitable-Important to vote down that part of the #EUWithdrawalBill going thru Parliament that is trying to undo & circumvent the 2011 Act.
When will the technocrats at @hmtreasury understand that the flawed economics of austerity has bred, and will breed further political discontent? For which UK economy is paying a high price? #brexit
New study on “Red Tape” Cost of #Brexit: £27bn for UK firms, £31bn for EU27 firms. Around 70% in just 5 sectors. Could be cut to £17bn UK + £14 EU in a customs union. Bigger firms can partly mitigate costs; small companies will be least able to do so…
Ollie Olanipekun speaks to @adamboultonSKY about the #Swindled ad campaign. It’s not too late to fix Brexit as we don't want to end up with the flat burger after #Brexit..Ideally a #FinalSay would be great.. our future is at stake as it's the young who are going to inherit brexit
Defections to Lib Dem’s, once they start, could totally change the dynamics in parliament. This will be  another one of the many challenges to #Brexit ever happening. I remain quietly confident that #Brexit will fall off the rails soon enough. 
OK ... I'll ask the question ?  Have you changed your mind on #Brexit ?
But @ GovUK wishing in place a frictionless border ( whilst maintaining its red lines) will apparently make this reality - like all #Brexit reality - vanish....Post-Brexit border checks 'may triple queues' to port - BBC News 
So #VinceCable claims the #Brexit vote was driven by nostalgia for a world where faces were white. Perhaps he would like to explain how leaving a #political union of predominantly white #European Nations has anything to do with his insulting assumption?
Standing up for what #Scotland voted for & protecting devolution is NOT 'grandstanding', it's the day job, the day job that #SNP are barraged to get on with by UK & Scottish unionists. #Brexit is England's mess & we'll do whatever we can to protect ourselves from the worst of it.
The commonwealth is an extraordinary partnership of 53 diverse countries spanning Africa, Asia, the America’s, Europe and the Pacific. Post #Brexit we have the opportunity to strengthen our Commonwealth ties and take a leading role in liberalising global trade #CommonwealthDay 
Thankfully @Feorlean is the least likely person in @theSNP to get back in his box. He has a mandate to strive to keep Scotland in the #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion & to defend the devolved settlement & will continue to do so #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
The @BBC must not be afraid to report on #Brexit. This is the most important issue of our generation and the people must be informed. 
One would have expected public opinion to rally behind the result of the 2016 referendum and support getting on with #brexit. It hasn't! It's shifting slowly the other way, as #BrexitReality sinks in, towards reconsidering and remaining in EU.
It is a sad fact that 52 schools in Sutton are facing cuts. The Govt must focus on the things that matter. Chaotic disastrous #Brexit is eating up all Govt time and money. 
You can shove your commonwealth day up your @rseMainly a group of nations brits overran, suppressed the indiginous people & milkedMany are no longer run by their native peope or have become tax havensSo your understanding is about as good as your understanding of #brexit.

In less than 2 months, I will propose the new long term #EUBudget post #Brexit. The 3 lessons I draw from the debates w/ politicians, experts and citizens & my visits to 21 out of 27 #EU capitals: 
The Brexiters who were shouting about how buccaneering global Britain doesn't need the sclerotic EU & how we hold all the cards are now whining piteously about being bullied by Brussels. How bloody pathetic can you get! #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
A pro-immigration MP was murdered by a racist in the run-up to a #Brexit vote that rejected free movement. But there’s outrage because @vincecable politely suggests that nostalgia for a more monocultural UK might have been a factor? Our political culture is an absurd farce.
David Davis, Boris Johnson and Oliver Robbins, the most senior civil servant negotiating Brexit, have not even visited Northern Ireland since talks began on preventing a hard border. Extraordinary #Brexit 
#Brexit was a key factor in the UK’s economic growth for 2017 being revised downwards The slowdown in household spending, with shoppers facing higher prices, is due to the sharp rise in inflation following the pound’s plunge after the referendum.
Thought EU Members couldn't do this? Well, that's according to the Brexit propaganda machine. NOTHING BUT LIES...#FBPE WATON #ABTV #BREXIT

Good #Brexit news to start your week.  "BOOMING BREXIT BRITAIN" - 11.5% rise in exports.  More good news here: 
A very happy #CommonwealthDay - With the advent of #Brexit, never has there been a better time to embrace the goodwill and opportunity afforded to all 53 members, through our membership of this fantastic organisation. 
Another brilliant @spectator #Brexit article. The EU has rebuffed us again, so now time for some British backbone. With polls showing 2/3rds of us think the EU has acted like a bully, giving in would be a terrible mistake. 
The referendum was not only a comment on EU membership, it was a test ... For so long we have suspected that our 'leaders' hold us in contempt & the vote for #Brexit was our first confrontational step towards exposing government as the sham that we all know it has become.  
First up - Russia/spy thing: 2nd uk govt interfering in Scots income tax for army 3rd - UK loss of status for armed forces #brexit 4th - ken Dodd died5th - mark Mcdonald6th - helicopter crash in NY etc#bbcgms Unionist sectarian march in Glasgow? Nope

Vince Cable complains that #Brexit was the choice of 'Old' people. Presumably our democratic rights end when we're 50 in the UK?Should we call for an 50 yr old age limit on MP's Vince, or does your ageism not extend to your own front door? #SillyOldSod
#Brexit and #Scotland. Things the English don't seem to know.1. Scotland got its Parliament after an overwhelming "yes" vote in a referendum in 1997.
No to Europe, yes to Saudi Arabia.   #Brexit 
We passed our match-funding target in day 1. We're now at just over £37k. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. #DavidDavis #Brexit

The economy of the North East will suffer massive damage as a result of #Brexit with its GDP being hit by 11% even with a comprehensive trade deal. The no-deal wanted by the Tory extremists would mean a 16% hit.  #BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #FBPE
The only person that should be apologising is you Mr @BrandonLewis - for leading a party that is hell-bent on taking us down the road of a destructive #Brexit. 
#Brexit: Second referendum required before Britain can leave #EU, legal challenge claims @JolyonMaugham @WomaninHavana 
VERY worried that 2/3 of UK people think the EU is bullying us - by keeping to the rules that everyone agreed and were set out from the start of #Brexit??  Big challenges in getting this sorted must be met urgently. BUT HOW? #StopBrexit
Far from being alarmist, the #Brexit impact analysis is wildly optimistic on non-EU #trade.  Britain will take a big hit, especially if it leaves #CustomsUnion (via @InFactsOrg )
@vincecable is absolutely spot on. I know it’s not that comforting that your core support is over 70 & that people who voted #brexit are ill-informed/deluded and you’re following them down a ruinous path but I do feel it is you Mr Lewis that should be apologising to the nation!
We have all learned over the weekend: Hackers have stolen text on #Brexit from @GermanyDiplo . Wonder why. All public on this issue. If there is one secret, it is that there is none :-) We mean what we say on brexit and we say what we mean.
Don't get the outrage over the #VinceCable comments Let's be honest, most people who voted for #Brexit were over 60 and a lot of them are nostalgic racists - you only need to listen to the rubbish they come out with on #BBCQT and see how excited they get over blue passports
When nationalism rears its head in an established nation it usually means 2 things:1.  A power grab by a segment of the elite.2. The curtailment of individual freedoms. That's #Brexit.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Ah! Those wonderful nostalgic @LibDems party conferences, where all the faces are white! #Brexit #Cable
Brexit is very dangerous for time-sensitive organs for transplantation trying to cross the border. #NHS #Brexit
Look at my face, Vince. #Brexit has nothing to do with whether you're white or not. It's about democracy and freedom - something your party doesn't seem to understand. 
I don’t know what truth there is in it, but anything which remotely resembles “registering to cross the border” is a clear breach of the Common Travel Area, never mind the complete reverse of the promises of those who continue, against all evidence, to advocate #Brexit.
Prue Leith has a son who works for the Legatum Institute. Prue herself also has involvement with Legatum. Legatum specialise in Disaster Capitalism and are presently advising our Government. @BorisJohnson & @montie amongst other Tories are involved. #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE
Older Leave voters nostalgic for white Britain, says Vince Cable, cuing outrage from #Brexit fans.Evidence actually indicates no strong correlation between age & racism.But there does seem to be one between racism & voting Leave.(Of course, not all Leave voters are racist.) 
France jumps ahead of UK in signing trade deals with India, whilst not leaving the benefits of the EU. Haven't seen too many brexiters commenting on this story!The only rational course for the UK is a #FinalSay referendum on #Brexit deal vs #Remain to secure an #ExitFromBrexit
I voted for #Brexit for many reasons. Too many for a simple tweet! But I have no issue with being one of the 35% of Brits of Asian origin who voted to leave. Very simplistically, I would rather drive and steer my own vehicle than be a passenger in someone else’s.
Astute speech by @vincecable today who says the Leave vote was driven by the nostalgia of the older generation and that #Brexit is a fraud.Support the @LibDems call to give the public a vote on any deal with the chance to say no.
#BREXIT TIDE "Ther's this campaign that I think you'll likeWe ditch this Brexit madness and deal with INEQUALITYStop this UNFAIR #Westminster centric rule,Put funding into Regions, #OurNHS and schools!"Slightly Brexitified cover of Vance Joy's "RipTide" 
Really enjoyed the @LibDems conference in Southport this weekend. We are the only party fighting #Brexit and standing up for young people, the environment and the NHS.  Skip to 44 minutes here to find my speech .
Superb to see @vincecable picking up the gauntlet. #brexit is nonsense and needs brave politicians willing to take on the extremes of left and right and say so.Far too many MPs hiding under desks hoping to avoid taking a view.
I could never fight for "European ideals" because ultimately no such thing exists. The EU is a remote technocracy with no pedigree, heritage or legitimacy and nothing about it would inspire me to die in a ditch for it. It's just another government that nobody asked for. #Brexit
Is UK the1st western country whose ruling party accepts money from, & whose politcians regularly appear on the propaganda channel, of a country which is attacking its citizens with nerve gas?Still we must continue #Brexit which is also Russian policy to destroy western unity,
The wibble from remainers about voters having the right to change their minds is grotesque. The only reason they want another referendum is so that they can make damn sure we never get a say in it ever again. #Brexit
EU Trumped!Nigel Farage:The response from EU is, of course, one of uproar.Hang on a second.#EU have already introduced their own tariffs on aluminium & steel.So it’s OK when they do it, but it’s not OK when he does it.Total rank hypocrisy!#Brexit
#Brexit was about sovereignty (49%) rather than immigration (33%). But think about what he's actually saying - your Gran is an evil person if she doesn't want diversity thrust upon her. She has no right to her own culture, history or heritage. 
Excellent article by @acgrayling comprehensively explaining why there’s no rational case for there not being a referendum on the #Brexit Deal vs #Remain Problem is Tory Government & their Labour leadership allies aren’t acting rationally at present.
Tim Martin - "If we leave under WTO rules… that will reduce prices in the shops, improve standards of living and the purchasing power for the British public...also saving £10 billion quid a year." #Brexit 
The vast majority of Brits believe that the EU is trying to bully the UK in the #Brexit negotiations.The EU continue to use the negotiations as a political PR exercise designed to scare others from following the UK out of the door. 
SODEM Parliament protest 12/03/18..... all the Commonwealth flatware up  in the square. Every commonwealth leader is coming here. We need to  amass an urgent EU celebration here over the weekend. Call to Arms.....please join us! From 11am, even if only for short while! #Brexit

That's why I've donated a sum (£10) to @FinalSayForAll and continue to support all anti #Brexit campaigns. You can too. Even a small amount will help - you can donate as little as £1. #BrexitIsPersonal
Govt's whole approach to a #Brexit that can only leave us Poorer, Weaker with Fewer Rights and less Control whilst denying the Ppl a Binding #FinalSay on the deal with a #Remain option is sinister.You're only interested in imposing your Will on the Ppl not the Will of the Ppl.
This excellent thread explaining exactly why Corbyn is pandering to our worst & most destructive instincts re #BrexitBy focusing on "British jobs for British workers" to justify his Euroscepticism he's advocating free movement of goods & capital but not people

.@DerekMackaySNP has written to the Chancellor urging him to use the Spring Statement to provide greater clarity for people and business over the #Brexit process, including the future of EU funding, and address the threat facing our economy as a result. 
So  - respecting the result of EURef is *suporting* #Brexit ?Without wishing to be discourteous Jane - that's the most ridiculous statement across my t/line in the past hourI suggest you direct your energies into challenging the Tories & the effect of their horrific policies . 
So, as everyone knew would happen, the SEC "unity" motion, which was actually a mechanism to block members from voting for a pro-Single Market #Brexit policy at #ScotLab18, has passed comfortably. Welcome to Leonard's Labour. Members views not required.
Oh, the whinging and the whining from the UK government over #Brexit. Now would be a good time to remember about “club rules”. In declaring itself a Republic, & subsequent refusal to recognise the King as Head of State, Ireland was excluded from the Commonwealth immediately. 1/6
Whilst public opinion on leaving the EU has remained largely unchanged, a new poll shows 67 per cent of people believe that “the EU is trying to bully the UK” in its approach to the talks #ThankEUGoodbye #Brexit
Far too many in the #FBPE camp want to use the next General election as a single issue campaign. Voting @LibDems as some kind of #remain protest will only help the Tories, it is a folly as bad as the #brexit we would all like to see stopped.
Like so many self-righteous institutions, the #EU has been exposed as a grubby, cronyism-ridden, corrupt old boys' club.Bang-on-target piece at @Telegraph by its #Brexit Editor @DiaChakravarty.
You really do have to question the sanity of many of our politicians, they commission a study into the effect of #Brexit across areas of the economy, Result = Brexit is extremely bad for allDecision = it's the Will of the people so let's keep heading towards the cliff edge,
Seems this is topical again.Are Rees-Mogg and Brexit the UK arm of this?This is a far right take over.  Steve Bannon has practically said so. #Brexit#StopBrexit#StopBrexitSaveBritain
.@vincecable is right to highlight Corbyn’s hypocrisy. #Brexit will be a disaster for our economy and jobs - this will disproportionately impact the ‘poor’. This is one reason why the @LibDems are calling for an #ExitFromBrexit.
All too predictable. But with worrying implications: no legal certainty on transition until just before #brexit, and harder for Parliament to have “meaningful vote” with real choice. 
Sadly, #Brexit is the first set of trade negotiations where a country is targeting a worse deal than the current status quo. 
May's plan to register 3 million EU nationals ahead of #Brexit risks failure due to under investment & government fears of a backlash by the Daily Mail, a senior former Home Office official has told Business Insider.#StopBrexit #FBPE

Could the Tory eurosceptics be hoist by their own petard?A referendum lock they insisted on to prevent more power being passed to Brussels could now be used to mandate a #FinalSay referendum on #BrexitGreat work by the legal team and campaigners @BestForBritain
Please report if you see this account. This weekend we’ve had a barrage of abuse from these people on all social media platforms. It is a huge waste of time and we want to make sure that we get back to what’s important which is stopping #Brexit. 
If you want the reason why #brexit is still going ahead this is it: Despite all the Govt brexit impact studies showing  poorer UK - 42% of Brits still think Britain will be better off post brexit. This Misinformation, delusion & wishful thinking will seek out scapegoats soon. 
Great thread on why it is so important that the north unites & mobilises against #Brexit  
Scotland will soon be an independent country, and a member of the #EU. Scottish "nationalism" is based in the opposite values and goals than those which inspired #Brexit. Scotland is for diversity and tolerance. #IndRef2 #Scotland #Europe.
Yet another account set up by our persistent troll team Rolanda Reid, Antonia Joos, Alexandra Brach & Sarah Jayne Glass. We’re flattered that they give us so much attention but we do wish they’d focus their minds on fighting #Brexit instead.

Ha!The PM wants her Govt to be remembered for MORE than #BrexitLet me HELP you out Theresa !#Homelessness#Foodbanks#InWorkPoverty#NHSCrisis#PublicServicesCrisisAnd ALL those other #BurningInjustices REMEMBER !! (which you've done NOTHING about.)#WestminsterHr
Another great interview with @StevenEdginton on the abuse Brexiteers have come to expect“Young people who are pro-Brexit expect abuse, whether online or when out campaigning...Why not work together to make a success of #Brexit & grab its opportunities?”
When we get any sort of a deal we demand a vote. #Brexit is crazy. New poll finds clear majority want UK to stay inside the single market  via @BIUK_Politics
The reason members were blocked from voting on the #SingleMarket is because #Corbyn knows he'd lose the vote, which is exactly why he refuses to give #Labour members a say on #Brexit at all - it's a disgrace and he's misled and betrayed members who voted for him#ScotLab18
Extreme remainers paraphrased; 'I am extremely angry at those brainless people who voted brexit. They owe me my status quo, despite me never lifting a finger as the Tories took their jobs and pulled the social welfare safety net from under them' #Brexit
It’s true to say the #EU could face a slow break-up if we can ensure the pressure is maintained on the UK government to deliver the #BREXIT the majority of people voted for. Let’s hope both happen. 
Who else in the UK is feeling politically homeless, powerless, aghast, dismayed, angry, terrified for the future of the UK and for our children, determined to fight, embarrassed, saddened and mortified because of #Brexit #BrexitShambles #Remain
Brussels on the Brink: EU’s Hostile Front Against UK Faces Collapse as Italy Election Winners Back #Brexit 
It is very unlikely #Leave would have gained a majority without the hate & lies in the #Brexit press. So you @jeremycorbyn are legitimising and using that tide of right-wing xenophobic hate & lies to push your version of #Brexit.Such a stench of hypocrisy!#StopBrexit #FBPE
“Young people who are pro-Brexit expect abuse, whether online or when out campaigning.“Since the referendum, #Brexit is still seen as racist and evil, and supporting it paints you with that brush.” 
“You’re good at maths aren’t you, Diane? Is ‘few’ more than ‘many’? I’m confused”“I haven’t got a clue, Jeremy. Why?”“Cos I’m colluding with a FEW EU bureaucrats against the MANY millions of Britons who voted #Brexit”“Yeah, you’re for the few, not the many, Jeremy” 
While @JeremyCorbyn moves on implementing a xenophobic UKIP project with #Brexit Now is a good time to remind him what Labour members and voters want.And that he promised to give members more say in policy.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#StopBrexit#FinalSay
Since #brexit £10 is now only worth £7.80 .... fantastic news #morons
Many years ago we were sold PPI with loans we were applying for. Didn't really know what it was but we were assured by the salespeople that it was a good idea. It wasn't,  and we got our money back.In 2016 we were sold #Brexit Who do we see for our refund?
No wonder the majority of MP’s were against #Brexit. What conceivable benefit is there to the electorate in this piece of grubby EU legislation? 
#Remainer: name me a benefit of #Brexit.  Any benefit.#Brexitter: it's about the principle.So there aren't any benefits.  But plenty of costs ...#StopBrexit #DavidDavis #Remain #Brexitshambles #EU #FBPE #ABTV #WATON #rEUnion
May be I am wrong, but I but it seems, the general debate about #Brexit became slightly more interested in facts now. So look at this: Clear and simple charts illustratingsome basic facts. Nothing completly unheard of, but a good compilation of relevant information: 
This government are negotiating a #Brexit that will satisfy a few hard core Tory leavers looking to profit from the misery to come -  #DisasterCapitalism They are doing this with no mandate. May gambled her small majority and lost. #StopBrexit before it's too late.
The EU Customs Union aka ‘Big Business Protection Racket’ drives up the costs of many imports but it affects food the most.Let’s compare the EU & US MFN Agrifood tariffs.#Brexit #FBPE @UKLabour
"Nobody explained to British people what #Brexit meant". A selection of charts from our scholars. 
Dear brexists can you please tell me  a vaguely plausible fairytale about the benefits of leaving the European Union #brexit
Migrant workers Do Not drive down wages. Another Leave Lie debunked. This is getting pathetic. End #brexit now. 
Corbyn says his party would fight to "put jobs and living standards first" as the UK leaves the European UnionThis is just as much a cynical lie as anything peddled by Fox, Johnson & Davis. The only jobs first #Brexit is no Brexit. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Corbyn wants a "new and strong" relationship with the single market.Well that's settled, red cake is better than blue cake! And for this fantasy cake Corbyn will rob Britons, especially the young, of EU Freedom of Movement. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
Dear @DailyMailUK, if the world ever runs out of toilet paper at least we'll have you to burn. You elect Boris Johnson and have the gall to criticize our Prime Minister? Go f&$k yourself, signed Canada. #cdnpoli #cdnmedia #brexit
"One of the totems of taking back control surely should be that Britain can again control its own territorial fishing waters. That is an absolutely vital thing that the Government need to do." #Brexit 
5) sorry, but needs saying again.  Please watch and ask yourself how repeating Vote Leave themes on immigrants & EU "control" helps the fight against hard #Brexit in any way, shape or form?Why this speech, and not the speech on massive Brexit impacts?
3) if you read the post below there is only one possible course of action for any Labour leader who professes to care about his voters, and that is to fight to soften or stop #Brexit, and to tell the truth about its likely impacts
Ah! Here’s a handy comparison of British and EU democracy, made a few years ago by @captain_europeAny view on that, @garyyounge?#Brexit #Democracy
You see, the probem I have with the government now is that everything they say is tarnished by their stance on Brexit.Knowing that Brexit will harm the UK, how can I trust them on anything else.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
Some facts:EU tariffs on US cars: 10%US tariffs on EU cars: 2.5%EU tariffs on Chinese steel: up to 73%US tariff on Chinese steel: Trump suggests 24%13,000 other EU tariffs.It's not Trump who started a trade war, Remainiacs, it's your beloved EU.We must exit CU #Brexit
John said I saw antisemitism and left while Seamus said I didn’t but stayed when in fact I saw antisemitism and stayed. Our position is clear. At least compared to #Brexit.

Corbyn’s euroscepticism on full display at the Scottish Labour conference.Not surprising though. He’s always been a eurosceptic. Unfortunately his euroscepticism is aiding the Tories in their quest to drive us off the Brexit cliff.#Brexit

WATCH: #Brexit must stop immigrants being used to undercut wages, @jeremycorbyn tells Scottish Labour conference #ScotLab18 More: 
Is it just me or does anyone else feel we should be taking to the streets over this #brexit power grab, the treacherous Scottish Tories, the lying Scottish Labour & the deplorably biased Scottish media, i mean greetin on SM just isn't cutting it guys...
Schrodinger's Immigrant: simultaneously taking jobs from British people & being a drain on British taxpayers by claiming unemployment benefits!The joke is lost on anyone who voted for #Brexit 
I feel quite sorry for those who claimed that #brexit was a demonstration of the will of the oppressed. That it was a strike back against tyranny, the salvation of sovereignty and generation of a new world order. They now sit in a house of sand, and the tide draws close.
This is absolutely, utterly remarkable. If ever you wanted proof that power devolved is power retained, here it is in black and white from a UK government minister. #brexit #scotref
#Brexit provided a swift, if unwelcome, education for Britain’s 3m EU migrants about what rights they enjoy.Local elections taking place in parts of England in May will be their first chance since the Brexit vote to vent their feelings at the ballot box. 
Mike Russell @Feorlean says list of powers published this morning is confirmation UKgov is pursuing a “major power grab and a re-writing of the devolution settlement” #brexit 
Boris Johnson gave up citizenship of his country of birth, just to avoid tax.That pretty much sums up what #Brexit is all about.
"Food labelling" - so they can sell everything as "UK Produce""Food safety" - so they can do grubby deals with the USA"Animal health" - also so they can do grubby deals with the USA"Chemical regulation" - so they can dilute the NHS and drug controls#Brexit is great! 
The EU is demanding the UK negotiates a deal for “EU citizens” yet we are leaving the European Union. Should the UK recognise EU citizenship or deal with EU member citizens bilaterally? #EU #Brexit
This isn't just about #Brexit. There's an agenda here to dismantle the Scottish Parliament power by power until there's nothing left.
#Brexit pits not Britain against EU27 but 'EU2' against the rest.Smaller nations are keen on a positive deal with Britain,but the Commission digs its heels because of the French and the Germans.Europe is starting to see that the EU is an Franco-German imperialist stitch-up! 
You snowflakes have no memory of history.  But can only self reflect in the gutter.  #MBGA #MAGA #Brexit 
Liam Fox has spent the last 2 years dreaming of negotiating an amazing trade deal with the US. Next week he will fly to Washington to beg the US govt to spare the UK from a US trade war. Every single reason for #brexit has been obliterated. Every one.
If we crash out of the EU without a deal then a Corbyn government is a certainty. There is no question of retaining the Tories. A no deal #Brexit is pretty much the end of the Conservative Party in its current incarnation.
"I don't think Scotland and Wales trust the government as far as they can throw them" says Professor John Ryan from @lseideas as tensions rise with Westminster as Scottish government passes #Brexit bill. 
GAME ON. @scotgov comes out fighting against Westminster #powergrab. #Brexit #ContinuityBill .@Feorlean

Andrew Neil on Barnier's latest Brexit threat:"After a year of warning Brits they could not cherry pick, he proceeded to cherry pick with a gusto that matched Jack Cherry McCherrypicker the year he won cherry picker of the year competition!"#Brexit #EU
Corbyn should offer pro-Europeans hope, not more fears about #Brexit. Mary Kaldor from @Another_Europe writes today.
The great thing about being old and rich...is one can talk bollocks about #Brexit and not worry about being affected by the consequences. 
Austerity was not caused by the EU, it is Tory govt policy. It has kept wages stagnant whilst food, fuel, clothes and housing costs have soared. It has starved the NHS, Emergency and Armed services.#Brexit won't fix it. It'll make everyone poorer. #Leavers you were lied to.
Nigel Farage - "If you want to look for collusion in global politics, don’t look at the Russians, just look at the way the Labour Party are."Remainers  are  working  hand  on  glove  with the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels to try to undo #Brexit." 
This proves that the UK isn't a union. Unions, like the EU, agree trading between member states. In our precious precious "union" the biggest member tells the others what they're getting imposed on them by a government they didn't vote for.#brexit #powergrab
Here's the #Brexit damage report Theresa May didn't want you to see.It was released after being leaked to Buzzfeed.It shows that the UK economy will be hurt in all scenarios modelled.These are the government's own numbers.source 
"After a year of warning the Brits that they could not cherry pick, Barnier proceeded to cherry pick with a gusto that matched Jack Cherry McCherrypicker the year he won the cherry picker of the year competition." #Brexit 
Prue Leith - "I think there is no reason at all why we shouldn’t do good trade deals in or out of the EU, in fact, I think I’m about the only person who’s old enough here to remember that there was a life before we were in the EU." #Brexit 
And my father came  HERE  to fight for YOU, @EfffingTory.What he didn't fight for was a  society afraid of itself; its neighbours and the world.He had plenty of that back home in #Mississippi!#Brexit 
This is a government that only allowed MPs to see #Brexit analysis after it was leaked and only by appointment, in a private room. 
If Theresa May wants real 'full spectrum retaliation' against Moscow, then she should cancel #Brexit. That would deprive Putin of the massive victory Brexit is already giving him in his hybrid war against the EU & Western democracy. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Hang on a minute, I thought we were the ones that always obeyed the rules! How are we going to cope with all the extra work that being an isolated country post #Brexit brings if we can’t manage VAT/Customs checks now? 
A cheer for Tory MEP @CharlesTannock who has fought from day one to stop the lunacy of #Brexit. A courageous voice of sanity & good sense in a Tory party gone mad. He's got 10.9k followers, let's get him to 20k fast!#StopBrexit #FBPE #BrexitPlease RT
EU accused of ‘gangster’ behavior as it halts #Brexit talks over border issue 
Despite her speech last week, @theresa_may is still a long way away from agreeing any deal with the EU. Now it is obvious that the hard Brexiters and those that voted out won’t get their preferred #Brexit, she must grant the public a vote on the deal. 
Since it is now clear that trade lost through #Brexit will nullify any dividend, it is equally clear that any #UK government with the country's economic interests at heart would try to persuade their electorate to reverse its position (as IRL & Denmk did).

I was born in the UK to immigrant parents. I am British of Armenian descent. #Brexit has empowered and emboldened xenophobic idiots to tell me to "go home" or "piss off to Europe" if I like it so much. #Brexit has poisoned the country I was born in. #BrexitIsPersonal #StopBrexit
They said it was Project fear when we warned about this in the Ref. Here is the reality of creating an external border with the EU. Demand a vote on the deal from your MP, #Brexit is madness and can be stopped. 
So they lie to us, cheat us, ignore us and conspire to take away our rights.  Then they tell us to "come together" and "get behind #Brexit."  Sorry, but no.#StopBrexit #DavidDavis #Remain #Brexitshambles #EU #FBPE #ABTV #WATON #rEUnion

#bbcqt53 YouGov polls since June 2016 show that the UK public have already changed their minds about #brexit.Since August 2017 the MAJORITY think that the UK was WRONG to vote to leave the EU.Brexit is no longer the will of the people.The majority will demand a #FinalSay.
Prue Leith is the Chancellor of Queen Margaret University. I'm not sure how her pro-#brexit views on #bbcqt can be logically reconciled with an institution where 28% of the student body is composed of EU citizens.
#Brexit is the most severe act of cultural, political, social and economic vandalism since the second world war. If Prue Leith thinks that we who believe in the E.U. are simply going to give up the fight she has absolutely no idea how furious we are. #bbcqt
'The greatest protection you can have is to be in a #TradeUnion'. @LauraPidcockMP points out the danger to workers' rights of Tory hard-right ideology post-#Brexit #bbcqt

#bbcqt Prue Leith. We should support Theresa May & make #Brexit work. Her son was an advisor to David Cameron.  The man who created this division & now pontificates from his shed.
So, tonight's expert political panel includes a Brexity Cake Maker and someone who has not managed to negotiate anything in two years of Brexit Negotiation - why not just get Postman Pat and Tinky Winky to spout bollocks??  @bbcquestiontime #bbcqt #Brexit @LiamFox
1. Fishing was always going to be a big row in #Brexit because its one of the most emotive - touching on matters of territory, identity, heritage and sovereignty - but especially because it was one of the most visible symbols of what was done to the UK without consent.
It’s informative to observe the respect Ireland enjoys within the #EU & to contrast it with the disrespect Scotland endures within the UK. We should remember this when Scotland comes to choose which union might serve it best #brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
In 1940 Labour spoke for the nation, refusing to go into a coalition with Chamberlain at the helm & paving the way for Churchill. Arguably that act of patriotic opposition saved our country!Where is Labour now when the country is staring down the alt-right #Brexit gunbarrel?
The best summation yet of #Brexit.Thank you to the Irish Times reader who composed.#Newsnight
I like @JamesKelly's thinking here, and I hope the SNP are ready for a political battle. But I can't shake this feeling that a lot of Scots are still sleepwalking towards #Brexit.

Hey, let’s do something 48% of voters didn’t want and which isn’t remotely like what 52% were promised #Brexit
Can someone tell me who will be better off after #Brexit? And just as Russia threats are rising, we walk away from the rest of Europe to go it alone
Oh yes what a good idea let’s have a public debate about what the economic effects of #brexit might be, why didn’t anyone think of this before? 
I’m going to spell it out clearly, @RuthDavidsonMSP:The. SNP. Can’t. Force. Through. A. Bill.They. Are. A. Minority. Government.The. Rest. Of. The. Parliament. Supports. Them.You. Are. On. Your. Own.Got it? #ContinuityBill #Brexit

Am I the only one that bakes when the utter insanity of #Brexit is really getting me down?L Pain de campagne. R Date and walnut banana cake, with chocolate. 
The U.K. Government’s #Brexit end game isn’t difficult to see. It’s a no deal, which will undermine the Northern Ireland peace process, damage our economy & GDP for years, and make austerity policies look benign in comparison 
The Bank of England has also warned that economic uncertainty caused by #Brexit will knock 5% of wage growth by the year end, compared to pre-referendum forecasts. People didn’t vote to be poorer!  The public must be granted a vote on the deal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit
Since #Brexit, business investment has decreased as firms hit the pause button on major projects, unemployment increased in the 3 months to December by the largest amount in 5 years and employment and productivity growth has slipped back.

The bulk of MPs understand that the customs union is the only plausible way of achieving the continuation of “frictionless” trade the gvt. claims to aspire to. It's a shame that @theresa_may is scared of the #Brexit ultras and puts Tory party politics over national interest.
It is clearly the EU’s fault. They made us leave. They called the referendum and drummed up support for Leave backed by falsehoods and stirring up xenophobia. Frankly Barnier, Tusk and their ilk should be ashamed of themselves #Brexit
Wrapped up a very useful meeting with @eucopresident Donald Tusk. Thanks again for standing firmly beside Ireland on #Brexit. Always a pleasure to welcome him to @merrionstreet. Next step is @EUCouncil on March 22nd.
Life will be different after #Brexit, also for financial services.I fully respect UK Chancellor’s competence in defining UK’s interest. I would ask to allow us define what’s in EU’s interest.
If in London someone assumes that the #Brexit negotiations will deal with other issues first, before moving to the Irish issue, my response would be: Ireland first.
This utterly demented #Brexit project needs to be called off immediately. The damage to the UK is far beyond anything a hostile power could have hoped to achieve. Yet is being implemented by our very own MPs.Stop it, just stop it now! #StopBrexit
Taxing tech giants, clamping down on tax havens, fighting global warming, pursuing a humanitarian agenda in warzones... Corbyn can do all this better from within the EU. So why back #Brexit?

Punishing UK for #Brexit is 'language of a gang': trade minister Fox

Easy to see the EU's point on mutual recognition. When you have mouth foaming inbreds like Rees-Mogg who would happily dismantle systems to prevent the import of counterfeit airline spares and tainted baby formula, there is no basis for trusting the UK.#Brexit
I'd love to see the true level of support for #Brexit on Twitter; hat would it look like if all the non-national, bot, shill, sockpuppet, fake & spam accounts disappeared overnight? We'll never know. But we can find out for real how many people want to #StopBrexit in a #FinalSay
Currently NO sectoral analysis by UK Gov on impact of #Brexit on 'Health'. From loss of EU staff,  delayed drug access or weakened Public Health / Health & Safety rules. Would have thought was important enough to most people for an impact assessment. #BrexitShambles

John Redwood: Italian electionBBC & other media very quiet about Italian election!Both 5 Star & Lega are Eurosceptic.Lega campaigned for Italy to leave Euro & remove Maastricht, Nice, Amsterdam & Lisbon Treaties from Italy’s constitution.#Brexit #EU
.@theresa_may must grant the public a vote on the deal.Promises made by Leave campaigners are yet to be met, like the extra £350m a week on the NHS.Many electors know that they were misled.The electorate has every right to vote on the deal, now the cost of #Brexit is clearer.

On #InternationalWomenDay we should all - and especially #Men - reflect on what still needs to be done to secure true #equality and #respect for women. This year, it’s also worth looking at what #brexit means for #WomensRights :
Scottish fishermen react with fury to EU demand for unchanged access to UK waters  #Brexit
So basically immigrants financially propping up the NHS for the aging indigenous population who mostly voted leave to get rid of the immigrants they think are causing the NHS to fail.......it would be funny if it wasn't so serious #brexit #brexitshambles
There is too much at stake for me and my family not to protest against #Brexit. It is an assault on our rights in many ways #FBPE #WATON
Since frontpages in UK press are dominated by other issues than #brexit today, one might benefit from that short break and have a much closer look at third country regimes of EU agencies (e. g. EMA, ECHA, EASA). Mind the strings attached...
As I've said all along: If a single family is split up as a result of #Brexit, it will be a complete travesty. And we're not talking one family - we're talking MILLIONS of families who wake up in a state of anxiety over their future every single day. #StopBrexit #WATON
Ever wondered which gender #Brexit is? Obviously male, since 55% of men voted Leave, while 51% of women (and 80% of women aged 18-24) voted Remain. Happy #IWD2018:)  
Two-thirds (68%) of #NHS consultants fear patients’ safety is being compromised by widespread nurse shortages.Yet we still stumble on deliriously drugged on #brexit while the #NHS bleeds nurses & Drs #brexithealth
#Brexiteers, get supporting these companies! #Brexit The way forward.

#Brexit: European Parliament threatens to veto deal over Theresa May ‘discrimination’ of EU citizens. 'Parliament will not accept discrimination against European Citizens who arrive during the transition' says @EP_President.#citizensrights
Nigel Farage - "The EU sells itself around the world as being a free-trading organisation. Actually, it’s not. It is a customs union, with a big tariff wall around it to goods that come into it all over the world." #Brexit 
David Jones MP - "I don’t think Blair & Clegg can stop #Brexit. If they were to make a real effort to stop Brexit then it would be a constitutional crisis."It would be showing contempt for the people of this country and the vote that they cast in June of 2016." 
I have no objection to the Tories putting forward the the proposal of an ultra-free market economy in a General Election. But instead they've tried to sneak it in under cover of #Brexit immigration & sovereignty concerns, and that I consider wholly criminal.#StopBrexit #FBPE

Britain will have borrowed an extra £60 billion by 2020 because of #Brexit.Put that on the side of a bus. 
The Daily Mail in January 1973. If they have the right to change their mind, then so do the people of Britain.#Brexit 
With only 12 months to go until we are set to leave the EU, we need answers, not aspirations from this incompetent government. #Brexit is so far-reaching, so permanent, so over-arching that it will have an impact on all our lives, especially on the young and the future.
The message I'm getting from #bbcnews correspondents tonight on #Brexit is the old showbiz adage 'Don't worry, it'll be all right on the night.' But, having worked in the theatre, I know it often goes tits up on the night.
The refusal of the #May Government to face the devastating reality of #Brexit and all of its inevitable collateral damage is now frightening. I never imagined that I would feel personally threatened by my own country declaring war on itself.
Could it be possible to loath this man even more ? Today, the #EU re-asserted that the fishing arrangements for shared access to fishing grounds will not change in the event of #Brexit. You lost #Farage !
Have I understood this correctly? The #EU want access to our fishing waters post #Brexit but they don’t want to include financial services in an #FTA. They agree a transition period benefits both sides during which we have obligations but no say. And we’re cherry picking??
#Brexit: What is missing is a concept, an architecture, a vision for how the future relationship can work. An Associate Agreement would fit the different elements for our cooperation inside a framework.

The gvt. must change course on its #Brexit strategy basing it on what is actually practically achievable rather than the demands of a right-wing elitist clique. It is likely to leave the country weaker and less prosperous and reduce our standing as a world power.

1/ Thread:  In a reply to me @CentristDada wrote that WW3 has started. It sounds extreme, but it isn't. WW3 is underway. It's not a military war. It's a war of fake news, political manipulation, big money, kompromat and subversion. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
On the basis of promising £350 million a week for the NHS, the UK Govt is implementing a #brexit policy which will in fact cost £40 billion and is expected to cause a hit of 8% to GDP. So glad we are getting rid of those unaccountable eurocrats though.

We’re all being thrown under that fuckin red bus by #Brexit millionaires with their own agenda but this was aided and abetted by certain sections of the right wing media which used faux outrage against the #EU to rally the hard of thinking! Time for us to get out of the UK
Since there’s a lot of #Brexit discussion today, it’s probably a good time to repost this from the BES. Social media is a great tool, but its demographics make it very unrepresentative 
There can be no meaningful democracy if people are denied the information they need to make their decisions. The very fact that the government is seeking to curtail democracy by witholding vital information is reason enough on its own to cancel #Brexit.#StopBrexit #FBPE

David Davis stated today that he 'would find it almost impossible to believe that [a future] British Parliament would treat 3 million [EU nationals] in such a cavalier manner'. How EU nationals have already been treated since the #Brexit vote is cavalier!

It’s a familiar refrain that by being in the #EU #Britain has lost its sovereignty, which will be regained after #Brexit, writes Prof Christopher Grey. This not only overstates the reach of EU law within the UK, but is also unrealistic. Full article at:

#Labour is the party of Remain in every region, even in the most pro-leave areas. Many seats are there for the taking if Labour solidifies its #Brexit position towards staying in the EU. #StopBrexit #LabourisRemain Want to find out more? 
There hasn't been any serious snow on the ground here in Bristol since Sunday lunchtime yet my local Tesco is still running with empty shelves. Shows how vulnerable supply chains are to even minor perturbations. A timely illustration of why a no deal #Brexit cannot be allowed.
Of course - because the majority of the British people don’t want #brexit. Make it a priority to allow UK citizens retain EU citizenship if the so want. It is possible. @guyverhofstadt #stopbrexit #IamEuropean #WATON #BrexitReality
Every journey starts with a single step On my way to 10 Downing StreetWHY am I 'Schrodinger's Citizen'?I am a dual national So post #Brexit, I'll have FOM/no FOM at exactly the same time. I'll be able to live in any #EU country, and I won't.#stopbrexit #Iameuropean
Here’s what I think is going to happen over #Brexit: I think we will end up with a deal that is rejected by Parliament. I think we will end up having to have another election as the Government collapses. I think @UKLabour will win the GE & we’ll end up part of the SM & CU.
So many British people feel and are proud to be European. The welcome I received today in London was overwhelming. It is my priority and that of the European Parliament to make sure that citizens' rights are protected after #Brexit #IamEuropean
Everyday brings yet more indications from business that #Brexit and associated uncertainty will cost jobs.  @GovUK ploughs on regardless....Vauxhall chief warns of Brexit threat to Ellesmere Port - BBC News

And as a resident of Edinburgh, I know exactly what is going to win the majority of the folk here over to independence. #Brexit This is the most European city in Scotland. People here DO NOT want to leave the EU.
Who do you trust to negotiate #Brexit ? @Conservatives @UKLabour @LibDems
It must be about time for the rational moderate Tory MPs to decide whether they want to continue to be associated with the #Brexit harm to all of our interests, and the assault on the democratic institutions of the UK, that remaining in the Conservative Party now represents! 
A powerful display of celtic solidarity in Parliament this afternoon, as @WelshLabour and @scottishlabour MPs and peers meet to reaffirm our commitment to defend the devolution settlement across these islands. #Brexit 
Boris Johnson calls for a boycott of the World Cup, thus drawing attention away from the glaring reality that by pressing on with #Brexit the government is helping Putin's hybrid war against the EU and Western democracy. #BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #FBPE

Important image to understand why #FiveStarMovement is NOT the same phenomenon as #Trump& #Brexit.Young people voted overwhelmingly (44%) for #M5S, while only 19% of older people voted for them. The exact inverse of Trump and Brexit votes.Brussels ignores this at their peril.

The man negotiating to get the best #Brexit deal possible on behalf of all UK citizens, has today met with David Davis... 
This is incredibly disappointing: judge rules that we should use FoI route instead. So many have tried via FoI route and all have been refused. British people are being denied access to evidence about the impact of #Brexit on their lives 
Ford's European boss calls for the UK to remain in a customs union after #Brexit“We want to continue with tariff-free trade & any sort of border restrictions or customs friction is going to be an inhibitor... " Steven Armstrong said#StopBrexit #FBPE
The majority of ppl haven't suddenly become hatemongers, the media gives publicity to the few not the many. The bulk of #Brexit voters dislike the EU but that's because they've been brainwashed over 40 years by a EU hating press & politicians that blame it for their own mistakes.
In Luxembourg tomorrow Tusk @eucopresident will present the draft EU27 guidelines on the future EU-UK relations after #Brexit.Thursday Tusk meets Taoiseach @campaignforleo in Dublin.Updated public agenda here:

Great to meet @DUPleader, @NigelDoddsDUP and @eastantrimmp last night before their meeting with @MichelBarnier  and catch up with my colleage @DianeDoddsMEP. Letting him know that the EU cannot annex NI or split the Union. #Brexit 
Weird cos I thought you guys were taking back control, seems more like you're giving away yrs of traditional produce, trade marks & standards cos you're desperate for trade. #brexit
The people deserve a #FinalSay. That's why we will continue to campaign for a People’s Poll on the final #Brexit deal. 
MSYPs are on their way to meet w/ @ScotGovFM & @scotgov this morning at the second ever Children & Young PPl's Cabinet Meeting! A brilliant opportunity to share the views of Scotland's young ppl on issues like #Brexit, #PeriodPoverty & young people's rights! #SYPrights #YOYP2018
Before #Brexit referendum: “We hold all the cards”After Brexit referendum: “The EU are punishing us”Let’s engage with this fiction a moment - if we hold all the cards, how can the EU “punish” us?(Is it just possible those who come out with such comments are clueless?)
#Brexit Can we just get on with Brexit. Everyday same bloody bores out trying to derail Brexit. 17 million voted leave we’re leaving the EU. Labour FFS changing your mind about Brexit everyday. Jeremy Corbyn you hate EU all your life, biggest hypocrite going no one believes you. 
David Jones: No Deal and WTO terms#EU speak in religious terms about EU Supremacy & Sanctity of 4 freedoms.UK decision to exercise our treaty right to Leave is regarded as blasphemy.Proposal for new relationship may be dismissed as heretical.#Brexit
Here's the background on today's hearing in the High Court as @GoodLawProject and I seek to force the govt's hand over the #Brexit impact studies: Govt has muddied the water over these studies. They are in the public interest so must be the public domain.
Double standards? UK media railing against Trump's #tariffs, but also insist that lowering tariffs after #Brexit would lead to the 'collapse' of UK agriculture and manufacturing, and forget the EU imposes anti-dumping tariffs too. So US tariffs are bad, but the EU's are good?
The UK’s departure from the EU could cause almost as much damage to the Irish economy as the financial crisis of 2008-2009 where it shrunk by 8%.  The Irish economy could shrink in size by as much as 7% post #Brexit.  Brexit will damage both the EU and Uk economies.
#pcpeu labour #Remainers I get that @jeremycorbyn will fix a lot of the shit the tories have messed up. However he can't do any of the good if we #Brexit If #Labour stay on the side of the tories and go along with brexit who will you vote for?Retweet for larger sample. Thanks :)
#Brexit #BrexitReality“Taking back control of our money” means taking back control of the 0.7% of our GDP that we were paying to the EU whilst simultaneously giving up the 8% of GDP that membership of the EU brings. Doh.

 No. It’s EU subsidies via single farm payments that goes to well off landowners like I’m a remoaner cos I get £90k a year from the #EUSSR Heseltine. #Brexit means we can concentrate subsidies on environmentally friendly small family farms who provide the landscape we want.

#Brexit must mean leaving the European Arrest Warrant. No British citizen should be dragged from their bed and sent to a foreign prison without prima facie evidence.
It’s Tuesday.And my country has tied itself into an enormous #Brexit knot.The vast majority of our elected representatives know that #Brexit is a huge, costly mistake but are too scared to say it out loud and explain it to the people. #StopBrexitSaveBritain#NotInMyName
The economic damage of #Brexit is now mounting dramatically: 
US security services say the Russian State has killed at least 15 people in the U.K. but @theresa_may takes no action as the UK is now in Putin’s pocket. #Brexit #Russia #Salisbury #SergeiSkripal
This article by former Taoiseach John Bruton is well worth a read. Superb analysis of #Brexit & @theresa_may’s contradictory & unhelpful stance. Thanks to @BrigidLaffan for sharing. Would never have stumbled across it otherwise; I don’t often browse the Meath Chronicle’s pages...

John here (who voted leave in June 2016) makes an excellent point that #brexit is so complex that it should have never been put to a public vote. Even many politicians and commentators didn’t appreciate the half of it! @sigma_john  for joining so many others as a #remainernow
The thing is I understood a lot less about how the EU operate before the referendum. Now I fully understand & feel fully justified in putting my cross in the right box #Brexit
Guy Verhofstadt set to visit the UK to tell Theresa May that [predictably] the EU are not happy with her proposals again ... Tell him to shove off !#Brexit #Brexiteers #LeaveEU #leave
Letter I wrote on behalf of @LondonLibDems in response to @jeremycorbyn's #Brexit speech published by @guardian. It doesn't mention that 108 of our council candidates from across London also signed.
Mrs May has nowhere left to go. Her grand design doesn't fit. She either has to make a u-turn on the single market or admit her version of #Brexit is a job destroying, trade killing mess. 
Said it from the day after the EU referendum vote #Brexit will destroy the UK union:  Happy days inded for all self respecting Scots!
Brexit: drawing conclusions - the practical issues that determine how businesses can function in a post-Brexit world are not being addressed. If they are not given answers, businesses will draw their own conclusions...  #Brexit. 
WOW!Look i've found ONE reason from a Brexiter for wanting to leave the EU! Although I can't help but think that we would have greater influence on reforming dubious policies inside the union than outside... But you know...#Brexit means #Brexit 
Post-Brexit Irish border could be like US-Canada, says May. This is the reality:So either she's ignorant or is willing to risk peace in Ireland in order to get a hard #Brexit. Either way she & her government are utterly unfit to govern.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Thousands of Airbus jobs at risk from #Brexit It doesn’t need to be this way. Give the People the #FinalSay to accept the Deal or to Remain in EU #FBPE
A worrying by-product of #Brexit has been startling decline in what's considered acceptable language by politicians. As language descends into cries of 'betrayal', 'traitors' & 'enemies', the risk of another attack on an MP increases.Cross-party action is needed to stop this. 
Is the Roger Stone on the list the same Roger Stone who dropped in on Assange, before addressing the hard right wing think tank, The Bow Group, in support of #Brexit? Curiouser and curiouser. (via the excellent @brexit_sham )
#Brexit The #ItalyElection2018 results spell the BEGINNING OF THE END of the Evil EU Empire 'integration' / super-state dream.Italy will now join Austria, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Denmark and Slovenia in providing a ROBUST BLOCK to Brussels expansionist madness.
Can't believe I saw ultra-sound @LiamFox & @JuliaHB1 on my way out of @UKParliament tonight! As these two keep rightly saying, 90% of future global economic growth will come from outside the EU. The opportunities are out there so let's reach out & be a global Britain  #Brexit 
So I can't predict the future. But if I was trying to come up with a terrible idea execute it as incompetently as possible with a view to inflicting as much damage as possible on an entire society Id find #brexit hard to beat

Lots of questions from @Euromove_poplar audience. Main theme is why isn't @UKLabour doing more to stop #Brexit Nobody voted to be poorer and stopping Brexit will stop the increase in austerity @Labour4EU @London4Europe @labour4europe
The EU would be mad not to allow the City to continue trading in the EU. Companies based here put more than a trillion quid’s worth of lending into the Continent every year. #Brexit 
I’m proud to have reported last year @patribotics both that @GCHQ has recordings of this meeting and that UKIC recorded Trump and Team Treason the day after #Brexit at #Scot24
I don't think there are any rational leavers leftThe last #Brexit hangers on who don't have a massive financial cushion to protect have retreated to a "they'll never take me alive!!" mentality 
The truth is that Labour are Unionist lackeys, just as the Tories & LD are. They ride the WM gravy train, aspire to the House of Lords and stick their snouts in the trough. Any socialist principles they had died with Labour's #Brexit hypocrisy. #indy2now please, September 2018
No deal is the only deal we want. #Brexit 
Please RT. @Theresa_May knows full well that what she wants for #Britain after #Brexit is impossible. Her #RoadtoBrexit is going nowhere. Read @Jon_Danzig’s blog to find out why.  @BestforBritain @OpenBritain @campbellclaret @RemainingKind @Labour4EU

I asked the PM today whether she was willing to back the majority in this country who don't support hard #Brexit.  She said No. She will be the third Tory PM who will be destroyed by her party's obsession with Europe. But this time she risks dragging the rest of us down with her
Just listened to PM #Brexit statement repeated in the Lords. So the Gov admits we won't have 'the exact same benefits', will have to belong to EU agencies, will have to find a solution for Irish border and there will be costs and huge complexity. What will be next?
WATCH: Theresa May admits what we've all known for a long, long time - that #Brexit in the terms it was sold cannot be delivered. We can, and should, keep an open mind on whether Brexit is the best choice for our country: 
Dear Brexiters in #Cornwall,Looks like people may soon be able to buy "Cornish" pasties made in the US with hormone-injected beef. - once we've got rid of that pesky EU protected status.Isn't #Brexit wonderful?(HT @paullewismoney)
Will there be a robust government response to what is very likely another instance of Russian state terrorism in Britain? One doubts it. Britain is helping Putin with #Brexit, so why would it offend him about this? #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
"When Theresa May gets into negotiations with her European counterparts about trade arrangements, could she remind them that cake exists to be eaten and cherries exist to be picked." #Brexit 
Irish border v US/Canada border; would be a majorly regressive step to put up such a hard alternative post #Brexit 
A hard #Brexit could cost the Irish economy €18 billion, resulting in thousands of job losses and leading to the cost of the trade of goods to the UK rising by more than 30 per cent. @theresa_may must step-up and deal with this economic and security issue.
This is neither a soft border nor a viable post #Brexit suggestion for Ireland. 
“If UK gov gets #Brexit wrong it'll seriously affect UK’s world-leading scientific reputation.Fusion is far too complex for any one country to pursue on its own.These projects hinge on cross-border collaboration and involve scientists from all the EU” 
#Brexit Quisling @Nigel_Farage on Fox News calling for UK/EU to surrender to threats from Trump, throwing our steel and car industries to the wolves. Whatever this man is, he’s no patriot
.Theresa_May saying she understands why young voters are angry about the lack of affordable housing. She should also acknowledge why they are angry at being forced out of the EU by her generation when 76% want to Remain. #Brexit.
Just been at Tripartite Commons-Lords-UKMEP bi-annual meeting. It seems that #Brexit means just leaving all decision-making to the remaining EU27, but still following the rules they set....So much for taking back control!
So #Brexit news summary today:1. US offers UK worse aviation deal then it gets now thru EU2. US lobbies to rid Scot Whiskey, Cornish pasties, Cumberland sausage etc of protected status3. US slaps 25% tariff on UK steelAt what point do rational Leavers question this madness?
.@IanBlackfordMP says Scotland’s voice has been left out of crucial cabinet discussions on Brexit and questions why the Secretary of State for Scotland was not present when Theresa May gathered her cabinet at Chequers. #Brexit #PMstatement
A shame to hear @jeremycorbyn refuse to oppose Tory Brexit. By far the biggest threat to our public services is the Tory #Brexit plan being executed by a cabinet of deregulators. 
US negotiators are “trade warriors” and their President welcomes trade wars.   @GovUK intends to walk out of the strongest FTA in the world in the hope that it might , on its own and without negotiating experience, be able to get a good deal from such people.  #Brexit #Madness
My intervention during the PM’s statement on UK/EU Future Economic Partnership. I am pleased the PM confirmed that the UK Government will ensure that we are ready to leave in March 2019, with or without a deal or a positive response from the EU:  #Brexit 
Russia is engaged in a hybrid war against Western democracies including Britain. By pressing on with #Brexit the government is knowingly helping Russia in that war. In other words it is helping an enemy of our country.#BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #FBPE
Another utterly vacuous and deeply worrying statement on #Brexit from the PM - we are being utterly failed by this shambolic Government @Open_Britain
Jeremy Corbyn says government is "nowhere near to delivering a good deal for Britain" over #Brexit
PM’s #Brexit statement rivals Queen in Through The Looking Glass - thinking 6 impossible things before breakfast.  Apparently strengthening union by introducing hard border & protecting jobs by making the country poorer
Theresa May's speech has failed to deliver any solutions or recognise the concerns expressed by Scotland. Here's why, to protect jobs and living standards, we need a 'Norway-style' deal that keeps us in the Single Market. #Brexit 
Theresa May tells MPs she is seeking the "broadest & deepest possible economic partnership" with the EU after #Brexit 
Sinn Féin leadership holds ‘productive meeting’ with EU Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier  #brexit 
Theresa May speaking once again in parliament on #brexit, noting that "access to each other's markets will be less than today"- not what was promised, everybody, in particular leave voters, has the right to reconsider @Open_Britain
As much as we need to ask questions as to why our government cannot come up with a coherent #Brexit plan, we need to ask why our media is incapable of producing a single interviewer capable of taking her to task on the specifics.
1. UK-US Open Skies talks hit Brexit turbulenceIs there #Brexit supporter realising that to swap membership of the EU for some form of subservience to the USA & China is doing anything other than taking back CONTROL?! #StopBrexit via @financialtimes
Obviously I cannot account for everybody from within the yes movement but personally, the minute I saw the Brexit result in scotland compared to the rest of the UK, I realised I was looking at independence.  #indyref2 #brexit #Scotland #ScotRef
Once a nation loses the power to maintain an empire the mentality and habits of imperialism and the nostalgia around its loss can become a crippling handicap preventing its adjustment to a post-imperial reality.#Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE
The damage of #Brexit does not matter Robert.We still have the Empire.Oh!Never mind we still have the Commonwealth.Oh!Well we still have the vassal states of NI and Scotland.Oh!
The Centre cannot hold. Denying the reasons for the collapse merely hastens the decline. It’s time for class politics, the only politics which can unite the great majority. Against our rulers, against the establishment, against the elite. It’s time already. #Italy #Corbyn #Brexit 
Will there be no end to the benefits of #Brexit. I'm getting so tired of winning all the time: No £350m/wk; reduced market access; loss of workers in various sectors; M20 queues..? Brextards are just being obtuse in sticking to this course, or is it just self-interest?
The US is offering Britain a worse “Open Skies” deal after #Brexit than it had as an EU member - @FT scoop by @KatrinaManson @alexebarker @tanyapowley
FT on -  Open Skies problem post-Brexit. Wasn’t the Brexiters biggest hope that  would do what  demanded? And the UK needs 65 airline deals by March 2019… Not. A. Hope.#Brexit
The notion of 'taking advantage' of trade deals with the rest of the world has to be challenged. Yes we could make such deals, but it's very doubtful that the big ones with the USA & China would be better for us than the arrangements the EU has & will obtain.#StopBrexit #Brexit

An astonishing moment last week at PMQs where a labour leader @jeremycorbyn cited the CBI and the IoD against a Conservative PM. This really does sum up the incompetence of this gvt. and their destructive #Brexit plans, putting internal party politics over national interest.
Sinn Féin leadership hosts press conf in EuroParl following positive meeting with Michel Barnier on #Brexit and #Ireland “The British government need to put on the table the proposals that will make these objectives possible - the ball is in their court.” @MaryLouMcDonald
“The people of the North of Ireland have not consented to #Brexit. #Ireland cannot be the collateral damage here.” - @sinnfeinireland leader @MaryLouMcDonald
#Brexit : @sinnfeinireland leader @MaryLouMcDonald "We had a meeting of minds with @MichelBarnier to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions, to avoid a hard border and to protect the single market" -  
We all know what rabid nationalism has done in the past. It was utterly criminal of the #Brexit elite to breathe new life into this monster in selfish pursuit of their #BrexitTaxHaven. Already they have created divisions that will take decades to heal. #StopBrexit #FBPE

Why are 500 MPs who oppose #Brexit doing nothing? 
UK Gov's obsession with reducing rights of EU citizens in UK was always more important than protecting the 1.2m British in Europe.  Let that sink in. Racism and persecution of 3 million EU citizens WAS the main goal of #Brexit, so much so that UK gvt abandoned its own citizens.

How ironic that UK regions would potentially get more EU support from #cohesionpolicy after 2020 if UK stayed in the EU… many of which supported #brexit. See @CPMR_Europe analysis here: 
George here has some issues with EU Governance (& I believe he voted leave) but he is happy to campaign for #remain in a #FinalSayForAll (with a condition).@gfkw47 many people accept EU needs reform, but that must be done from within as #brexit is too harmful to UK’s prosperity! 
Cornish Leave voters were warned about this during #EURef and dismissed it as scaremonger.Nevermind they can have #BluePassport to make them feel like we are in control #Brexit 
Today #YourOCO and @nichildcom published a joint #Brexit report that focuses on the views of children and young people. This follows a cross border consultation with young people north and south of the border. To read the report please go to 
"While one could nitpick over some of the EU’s rules, for the most part they are pretty good. It’s not surprising the rules are pretty good. The UK has played a leading role in devising them."Bravo, @InFactsOrg - very well said. #Brexit #StopBrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain
The entire reason for #brexit was for control of the amount of people we are forced to take by the EU thry must have no say at all ponce we leave .. be careful Mrs May you are treading on very stoney ground !!
I don't see any reference to Tony Blair's own poll, which showed that 70% want #Brexit at whatever cost. The press pick and choose to suit their narrative.#WhereIsTonysPoll ?
So @LiamFox This makes it clear that the USA has absolutely NO interest in Trade Deals with us.  So how are you going to replace the £190bn per annum we will LOSE as a result of #Brexit?   It’s time to kick out these  frauds who are trashing our economy to create a tax haven

#Brexit doesn’t pave the way for the glorious joys of free trade. It sets us up to be bullied by the big boys. Trump’s tweets tell us why.

Just a reminder. Or in case you didn’t know already. #Mandelson should do the decent thing and absent himself from any relevant votes in the House of Lords.  #Brexit.
Why did it take so long for #TheresaMay to do a #Brexit U-turn on EU agencies?She was warned over a year ago:
It was very shortsighted of @AndrewMarr9 to state that agriculture was not important in the #brexit negotiations this morning. The recent empty shelves highlight the need for a profitable and productive UK agriculture
Next time a pro-Brexit person tells you “oh, but the UK is not imposing an actual border in Ireland”, send them these. Super work.#Brexit

I like the #JoinWithUs twitterstorm. The root causes of #Brexit and #Trump are similar - rich white men, terrified of losing their privilege, using fear and falsehood to manipulate voters. But let's not leave it at a hashtag. Let's develop practical networks to resist. #FBPE #FBR

Anyone out there heard from a #Leaver who's been able to cite a measurable, tangible benefit they will gain personally after #Brexit. Or any EU rule forced upon the UK, that has detrimentally impacted their lives. All I get is flatulent soundbites and we won you lost get over it
The PM is now willing to sacrifice our influence because, if we quit the EU, it is the only way to preserve our prosperity and security. But there’s a much better alternative. We don’t need to become a political eunuch. We merely need to cancel #Brexit.
It's gone from #Brexit "Milk & Honey" to "Jesus, we need an urgent plan to ensure motor manufacturing survives!" #JoinWithUs to end the madness.

There's a common brexiter misperception that the EU is pulling Ireland's strings. They cannot grasp the idea that the EU26 are showing solidarity with Ireland's interests, in a way the UK has never done with Scotland's interests. Condescending & misleading #brexit 
Feel sorry for all the small business owners who will see all their hard work undone by #Brexit. I hope they remember the damage the Tories have done next election and vote for a pro-EU party. #marr

tRutLess Davidson on TV as the so called leader of the Tories in Scotland Showing that she is nothing more than a vassal of her London leaderDoing as she is told regardless of what impact it has on Scotland She has turned her back everything she ever said re #Brexit 
Disappointing interview with Ruth Davidson on @Sun_Pol_Scot. A lost opportunity to quiz her on pro hard #brexit @ScotTories MPs, the absence of David Mundell at Chequers summit & fact that UK Govt impact assessments are even bleaker than those of @scotgov
I may be WRONG  !BUTIMO - the Tory *unity* around the PM's '#Brexit speech is COSMETIC !. Designed to keep her in office - until such time as they can DUMP her - and impose their own * regulatory divergence* ie #HardBrexit
"I thought it showed the prime minister at her best - calm, patient, disciplined...I think it has united the country" - Lord Howard on PM's #Brexit speech #bbcsp
I do get sick of people telling me I voted for #Brexit because of what was written on the side of a bus. Not one of them read the quite compelling essay on the roof. That swung it for me.
We have reached the stage where most people are turning off when #Brexit comes on the media.They have had enough of the endless dither and delay.'We the people' gave the politicians a clear instruction.#LEAVEThey should stop messing about,Just get us OUT.
This Theresa May love-in is nauseating. All her speech did was put off the inevitable omnishambles until after the local elections. It's laughable to think Jacob Rees-Mogg and Anna Soubry are suddenly as one. May's simply kicked the #Brexit can further down the road. #bbcdp #marr
The power of positive thinking is fine when you've got a massive bank balance, live in a fortified manor house and have money stashed offshore. However, no amount of positive thinking will help if you have no home or are struggling to survive on a crap wage. #Brexit #ToriesOut
Tony Blair’s institute commissioned a #poll.Now, having seen what they are like on the early #Brexit negotiations, according to his poll 68% of Brits have had enough of the #EU.
#Heseltine #bbcsp #EU #Brexit No wonder  
When leavers and remainers fully come to terms with the extent to which global standards influence EU regulation these global bodies will become of interest to the media; the hidden realm of privatised rule making. Dragging them into the light of day is a clear benefit of #Brexit
John Redwood: Media interviews on #Brexit@BBC & even some independent channels interview far more Remain than Brexiteers & give Remain more uninterrupted airtime.Brexiteers get barrage of interruptions if you dare to say sensible & moderate things.#EU
It's important to remember that the people negotiating #Brexit on our behalf are the people least likely to be affected by any negative economic impacts. In fact, perversely, it's highly likely they will in actual fact profit from them. We're doomed. #Marr #bbcsp
Nicola Sturgeon on  is talking more sense on May's Brexit speech than any of #Marr's guests. We're still looking at at disastrous outcome to #Brexit negotiations, and May has not moved things on significantly.
EU and Ireland robustly protecting their own interests, wasn’t that what #Brexit was about for the UK? #TakeBackControl

I run an SME - one of those businesses that are supposed to be clamouring for Brexit. We can trade around the world now and do. Most of our business is in the EU though and #Brexit will not only be more difficult in the short term, but also possibly fatal medium/long-term. #Marr

Voting @scottishlabour will NOT achieve Scottish independence but it would guarantee #Brexit which - given it will create more poverty, lead to smaller public services & general economic decline - is just what a Stalinist like Corbyn would like.
If Theresa May wants to "appeal for unity" perhaps first she needs to apologise for Tories destroying it in the first place by having totally unnecessary #Brexit vote instead of addressing the real austerity-induced problems in our country.#FBPE
Good chart from @GeorginaEWright shows why @theresa_may idea of “Associate Membership” of EU regulatory agencies after #Brexit would leave UK with less influence & sovereignty than today... 
A pretty sobering read. The reality of #Brexit is starting to dawn on us all, and our nation will be diminished because of it. The nation needs a #FinalSay to give the people the chance to back out of #Brexit 
Steve Bannon - “The contempt that Brussels has shown for the mandate of the working men and women of Britain, who want #Brexit, has been to me nothing short of shocking.” 
This is the very definition of UK , in fact Anglo, centric and will cause as much offence in Brussels  as it does in Dublin ( and indeed Edinburgh). It is als entirely wrong to assume  there can be any benefit from #Brexit , as even the PM was beginning to admit on Friday . 
Now that #Brexit speech is out of the way, back to our No1 agenda. Building homes. 
No Chuka, the Queen will do what she has always done and promote British interests, not the EU's. As for trade deals. A good trade deal is better than no deal at all. #Brexit will be better than staying in the EU. Disruption or not.
Now, why would anyone still push for #brexit when it will so obviously cost us jobs and extra taxes?Could it be that the extremists are trying to save their own off-shore tax schemes?#stopbrexit before it is too late#6monthsleft
USA is UK's biggest trading partner.The EU forces us to put massive tariffs on USA imports.This puts up the price of US imports in UK shops.When we #Brexit we can slash the tariffs and do a lot more trade with US.EU is holding back our trade with our biggest trading partner. 
If Scotland votes for anyone apart from @thesnp we’ll suffer even worse under the uk establishment. This is our chance to show WM we have a future without their oppression.Corbyn wants #brexit. He doesn’t want ScotindyHe’s not a socialist.

I think, Andrew #Marr, the time has come when the theorising of politicians should be subverted to the real impact of #Brexit upon real people in the real world..No amount of ideological posturing is going to replenish the UK's communal piggy bank when businesses & farms fail. 
Every single MEP invited onto #BBCQT in past 5 years has been a #Brexit peddler - all 35 of them! 33 UKIP & 2 Tory.No Lib Dem. No LAB. No Greens.How come  the BBC are getting away with this corrosive anti-EU bias?

Fantastic news that @PlaidAberconwy has backed our place in the EU #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion.The people voted for the "exact same benefits" and deserve #FullAndUnfettered access.#Brexit 
Contrary to popular belief the UK cannot 'leave' the EU. We can cease to be a member, but the EU economic superpower will still be 20 miles away, its influence over us only slightly reduced, while we will have wholly lost our large say in its decisions. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
If I was Scottish, I'd want to leave the union. Scotland likely to be better off out, UK worse off without Scotland. What a horrible situation #brexit has landed us in, and we haven't even left yet.
On @theresa_may's #Brexit speech @BBCNewsnight #Newsnight: -  Good: Welcome change in tone: a process of Gov't being mugged by reality;-   Bad: Still too cherry picky, suspect UK will be offered Canada-style FTA;- Ugly: Still no solution to Irish border issue.
Seems the #Brexit preference of @theresa_may is to stay as close to the EU single market as she can without splitting her party or contradicting herself.

Interested in migration after #Brexit? Dr Paulina Trevena from the University of Glasgow writes about attracting and retaining migrants in post-Brexit Scotland. 
I think what the world needs right now is 4 slides putting the #Brexit border issue as simply as possible. So here goes...
Feb 15: French unemployment drops to lowest level since 2009. The decrease of 0.7 percentage points in the last quarter of 2017 was the biggest drop in any single quarter since at least 1996.So much for the Eurozone collapsing. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
Lexiteers should understand that although EU was based on a broadly neoliberal platform, there are also a lot of of built-in social protections. #Brexit will lead to a more draconian neoliberalism. The sensible left/centre left need to counter the populist left and wake up Corbyn
Just as the EU is focused on preserving the single market,all Britons have a duty to preserve the integrity of the United Kingdom,while respecting the result of a democratic vote.Anything else is frankly fifth column?#RoadToBrexit#Brexit 
Brexiteers won #Brexit referendum saying UK needs to control its borders.Now they’re insisting that the EU should accept, in Ireland, a giant open hole in its own border - through which 3rd countries could sneak goods in tariff-free.Why would any political entity agree to that?
I resigned as a Labour member because of #Corbyn and will now vote LibDem because of #Brexit. Charlie Mullins leaves the Tories and switches to the #Libdems because of Brexit. Over 16,000.000 voted to remain, that’s a lot of votes for pro-Remain parties!

Appalling that #ReesMogg accuses the #EU of dividing the United Kingdom. It is those advocating #brexit who undermine the #GFA and stoke Scottish nationalism. #brexit politicians get what they advocate - they should respect the 56% + 61% #brexitreality #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Steven Kinnock... SHUT UP about your anti-#Brexit bullshit. You'll say anything to protect the family #EU gravy train and pensions. #BBCNewsChannel
The BBC have stated that pint bottles of champagne were "banned by Brussels". They weren't. Never happened. The BBC has simply got to the point where they are willing to publish complete lies in order to support a particular (pro- #brexit ) political agenda. 
Regular reminder that it was the UK government's decision to impose the metric system and that the right to use the (ridiculous) Imperial measurements is specifically protected by EU law #Brexit #bullshit
The one result of #Brexit that Remainers are hiding from you is that Britain will become a European economic power-house with the financial sector that produces nothing diminishing and proper economy developing. Germany does not want that. #fact

I can only afford a decent flat because a friend accepts less than going-rate rent. I can't afford a decent holiday or car, because I haven't had a pay rise in ten years. What is it that May and Mogg etc want me to sacrifice unnecessarily post-hard #brexit? And why should I?
I voted in all the referendums over the decades to bring our Parliament back. Now it's under threat by a tory government we didn't vote for taking us out of EU we voted against #ContinuityBill #brexit 
There's no reason for #EU to compromise. They they have the integrity of the EU to protect. The #UK is willing to commit self-harm for no tangible benefits. EU knows it'll be economically harmed by losing UK, further structural harm is not in its interests.  #Brexit #bbcr4today
Forget education, I've heard your reasons before for #Brexit & they don't make sense. I understand you're trying to build a commentator career but if you won't try to understand the issues what exactly qualifies you to "debate" it?

Brexit: rotten at the core - Mrs May wants to stand completely outside the EU's ecosystem, yet demands a better Free Trade Agreement that anywhere in the world today.  As a core strategy, this is rotten – it cannot possibly succeed...  #Brexit. 
#TheresaMay's #LancasterHouse #speech vs today's debacle - a subtle yet significant backtrack on her so-called "#redlines". #MayMustGO!  #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress #Tory @Conservatives #Tories #ConservativeParty @theresa_may #BREXIT #EU #UK
Well said Mark.  The sooner everyone accepts the democratic vote & pulls together, the better for all of us - UK & EU #brexit 
15 minutes into News at Ten, and only just getting into PM's #Brexit speech. All about the weather, and recurring theme has been farmers: clearing roads & braving conditions to maintain food supplies. Farmers fundamental to our country. #backbritishfarming
Of course #Brexit can be stopped! Plenty of scenarios where Brexit would collapse including ongoing legal action that Government has no control over. At the start on 24.06.16 I knew Brexit would never happen and I still feel as confident today. #StopBrexit #FBPE #FinalSay
Forget the spin. The view from Brussels is unequivocal: theresa May’s #Brexit ideas are ‘unrealistic’ and ‘non-starters’. How much more time does she propose to waste on fantastical no-fly ‘solutions’? 
"85% of the electorate want #Brexit"This assertion is wrong on several levelsNamely that many Remainers voted tactically #ABTV to keep the tories out in the mistaken hope it would prevent a hard #BrexitWe do not have a fair democracy under FPTPWe need electoral reform 
PM confirmed today that financial #passporting rights are gone for London. Why would the EU allow a third country to look after its money? #Brexit 
Mundell's 'popularity' hits a new low, with even right-wing Tory think tanks calling for his resignationThey're suggesting Mundell together with Ruth Davidson have deliberately caused a constitutional row in a bid to thwart #BrexitTypical Tories...obsessed with independence 
Remainers call people who voted for #Brexit Little Englanders and make it sound as sarcastic as possible. The irony is, of course, that these Little Europeans are selling their own country down the river, in the hope of getting their thirty pieces of silver.
“John Major is the reason we had a referendum and is the reason why we voted to leave the EU. It was Major who rammed through Parliament on double Three-Line Whips, day and night in the House of Commons, to impose the Maastricht Treaty on this country” @talkRADIO #Brexit 
The will of the people is for a second EU referendum on the final Brexit deal. It is our democratic right to have a #FinalSay on #Brexit.
My thoughts on the Prime Minister’s excellent #Brexit speech today. 
Great to hear Brendan O'Neill on #bbcaq people who voted #Brexit were well informed not ignorant and racist. The discussion of the Irish border rehabilitates old stereotypes of violent and irrational Irish.
“This week John Major, the Brixton Boy, the slow batsman with grey-underpants, the man who made the beast with two backs with Edwina Currie, was out this week with his shirt tucked in. He told us we’ve made a terrible blunder. ” #Brexit Join George now: 
Any normal, sane person would get angry at the EU’s high-handed attitude  #Brexit
.@jeremycorbyn's approach to #Brexit is being rejected. Anyone surprised?  
.@Anna_Soubry being quite magnificent on @BBCAnyQuestions re #CustomsUnion #Brexit & the Border between North & South of Ireland. @FraserNelson says drones will police the border to the sound of derisive laughter #RoadtoBrexit #FBPE
Said the same thing after that  speech #LiamFox made the other day.,So who's lined up? #WhereAreTheDeals ?#BrexitIsAScam#Brexit 
#Brexit this week:1 Corbyn has moved #Brexit debate on Customs Union2 May has moved Govt position on EU agences, EUpayments & standards3 Realisation Irish border will require EU agreement4 Enough Tory MPs to back Customs Union majority voteMomentum is only in one direction.
Theresa May should be absolutely ashamed. Why are the Tories not doing anything about people dying on the streets in this freezing weather? It is volunteers who are setting up emergency shelters. Meanwhile, she accepts that #Brexit is going to have hard truths for the UK. 
#JeremyCorbyn responds to the #TheresaMay #Brexit speech Today.“She’s had a very long meeting with a lot of people who fundamentally don’t agree with each other”#RoadtoBrexit #MansionHouseSpeechpic.twitter.com/VoPboKrp16
Today’s @theresa_may speech the best & most serious so far by a British minister on UK/EU relations after #Brexit (not difficult). Mostly describes a lot of very complicated ways of staying as close as politically possible to where we are now.
Five signs that you're in a cult.1. Indoctrination. Distorted information is drip fed to you over time. *Thread #brexit 
Did I miss anything or was the #Brexit speech a meaningless diatribe of nonsense? Hard/No Deal Brexit, I presume?
Theresa May was right to admit that Brexit can't deliver everything everyone wants. But the truth is that her proposals won't deliver *anything* *anyone* wants - Brexiters, Remainers or EU.If this is #Brexit, what on earth is the point of it?#RoadToBrexit #TheresaMaySpeech
Right #brexit truth. If we want to trade with EU we need to match their rules and regs. I didn’t  have a Crystal Ball... night followed day!
1. Don't need 5 Tests to change position & back you #TheresaMay; just the 1 which U forgot 2 mention.Will U guarantee you'll deliver a BETTER #BREXIT DEAL than the 1 we have as a full member of the EU? One that retains All Rights & Control & a Stronger economy? Proof required.
“Life is going to be different” May warns as she bids farewell to “cakeism” & concedes UK reduced access to Single Mkt on very day US launches a trade war. The "#brexit dream" is dying, hard breiteers will hate the "reduced vision", remainers will wonder why we're even bothering
Bargain-hunter Theresa May still wants a Norwegian cake for the price of a Canadian cake. If she doesn’t hurry up and chose soon, the cake shop will close and she’ll have no cake at all. #Brexit
UK policy on #Brexit continues to be driven by differences in the Conservative Party rather than the broader national interest. This means a small group of Eurosceptics have a disproportionate impact on UK policy. That will be the case as long as the Tories remain in power.
I used to be depressed #Brexit, but now I am just angry. SCOTLAND VOTED REMAIN! The UK is not a democracy, and it makes zero difference how we vote in Scotland.
 Details on next week’s round of #Brexit negotiations @EU_Commission are available online: topics include Ireland/Northern Ireland, transition, governance & #citizensrights - 
A summary of the #RoadtoBrexit speech from @theresa_may earlier in one video:No Border in Ireland or the Irish seaRespect the Referendum ResultControl of BordersControl of LawControl of TradeRespect the peace agreements in Ireland#Brexit 
Surely Theresa May didn’t need to speak for 45 minutes to prove her unspeakable incompetence? #brexit
The PM has no mandate whatsoever to do this.  NO-ONE has a mandate to ruin the UK via the self-evident lunacy of #Brexit.  Let's just all take a deep breath and #StopBrexit right now. Please.
The vast majority of MPs are against #Brexit, so why haven't they stopped it? It is their responsibility to act in the best interests of the country. Allowing this lunacy to continue is a dereliction of duty.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Jacob Rees-Mogg:“Soft line is we’re going to give [#EU] £35bn & if we don’t have a deal you won’t have any money & you're bust!Bear in mind EU has no legal ability to borrow so it would either have to cut expenditure or get Germans to pay more!#Brexit
Proud of our PM today.Took a lot of stick since becoming PM.UK media on her like she's Trump's evil twin.EU playing games, enabled by frothing Remoaners.She stood tall, said she'll deliver #Brexit we voted for, not a watered down version Brussels lemmings want.#RoadToBrexit

That's IT !I'm hacked off with #Brexit - the PMs speech - the various commentariat analysis of it etc etc etc. ad naueseum.Nothing will change before March 2019.TONIGHT - I'm going to have a long bath - watch a rubbish movie - and eat chocolate !!
“#Brexit: UK faces unprecedented food crisis if no trade deal secured with EU, says Sainsbury's boss: Closing the borders for a few days to free movement of food would result in food crisis the likes of which we haven’t seen,’ Mike Coupe says” 
Takeaway from @MichelBarnier meeting with Danish business. All businesses - even the food industry that risk loosing half its export to the UK - are more concerned with keeping the integrity of the internal market than any loss of UK market access #Brexit #eudk
Will the govt, .@theresa_may, be compensating businesses for the losses incurred as a consequence of #Brexit?Many people who have founded and built up SMEs have risked everything and worked their socks off to do so.#RoadtoBrexit#bbcpm #Newsnight
A Prime Minister of any stature - correction, any other Prime Minister at all - would turn round to the British people and say ‘You know what, no kind of #Brexit is worth it, it’s just too damaging to our economy and our society’
Theresa May makes an excellent case here for staying in the EU. But then it's like who cares, it's Brexit so we're going to do something stupid and self-destructive instead. #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE #TheresaMaySpeech
#Brexit will benefit a few billionaire tax avoiders. Rest of us will be worse off in every conceivable way. Can't put it plainer than that
A great many ordinary Europeans are on Britain's side. Unfortunately they have little representation in the political circles of Europe.#RoadToBrexit#Brexit#Vlexit 
German Media hit the nail on the head with this question - Is #brexit worth it.?#StopBrexit #FBPE #MaySpeech
Recap of the week: ‣ We took part in the #WesternBalkans Tour ‣ presented the draft #Brexit Withdrawal Agreement ‣ discussed #cryptocurrency and #blockchain with @VDombrovskis ‣ set out measures against #illegalcontent online More → 
No customs union.No single market membership.No hard NI border (at least not by us).A time-limited transition period.No ECJ rule.No freedom of movement.@theresa_may always said "#Brexit means Brexit".Do you believe her now?#RoadToBrexit
UK Prime Minister says on her most important #Brexit speech that data protection is one of the five foundations that must underpin its trading relationship with the EU. Politics aside, this is one of the most sensible (and reasonable?) objectives stated by the government. 
"Come back together"? Would it not be better if the PM respected the majority wish of the Scottish people to remain in the EU and abandoned #Brexit entirely? Why should we "come together" & leave? Why not "come together" & stay? 
Leave voters will listen to PMs wise words on the complexity and cost of #Brexit & increasingly realise they’ve been sold a pup. It doesn’t have to be this way and people must be entitled to change their minds #FinalSay
PM’s problem now is 1. Will her #Brexit deal even get off the blocks given EUs clear stance that we won’t get an extensive bespoke deal? 2. Will she keep the #HardBrexiteers on board or will they seek to oust her for a leader who will deliver their no deal/WTO Brexit?
In her honest & conciliatory speech @theresa_may has set out the sort of #Brexit deal she wants & in so doing has rejected #HardBrexit. The PM was frank about how complicated & costly Brexit will be. Even if the PM achieves that deal we won’t be as well off as we are now.
Looking forward to chatting to @skynewsniall on @RidgeOnSunday from #Gibraltar to discuss the latest on #Brexit from just after 11am CET on Sunday 
First Minister @NicolaSturgeon responds to the Prime Minister's #Brexit speech. 
.#Brexit is a tragedy, ruining this country. It is not about me as #EU citizen, it is about us all, our human rights, our workers rights, our disabled and vulnerable citizens rights, our precious #NHS, our education, our justice system, our environment. Our history. #roadtobrexit
Yayyyy let's celebrate the UK budget SURPLUS!! The  surplus came from SPENDING cuts in EDUCATION & HEALTH.Government revenues stagnated during this time, meaning they failed to TAX the RICH & INCOME INEQUALITY INCREASED...Sounds great, right?#FBPE #Brexit #stopbrexit
Never forget. This man created #Brexit chaos because of an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all of his mates (and f***ed off) 
Currently writing a piece on #brexit and EU agencies. Short version is so far only EEA countries have the kind of associate membership May is asking for - and not only have to accept the ECJ, but also fully implement EU legislation in the relevant areas. And ofc no voting rights 
#BREAKING EU negotiator Barnier welcomes 'clarity' in May #Brexit speech

"We are going to become a normal independent Parliamentary democracy operating to high standards...  with unprecedented ambition" @SteveBakerHW on @theresa_may #mansionhouse #Brexit speech 
Listen to us Britons, we are failed prime ministers, we know better than you what is good for Britain.#Brexit 
After what I have heard today I am even more concerned.  I don't see how we could reach an agreement on #Brexit if the UK government continues to bury its head in the sand like this.  #TheresaMaySpeech @EPPGroup
Strong, detailed and well argued speech by the PM. Outlines a positive and coherent vision of UK-EU relations post #Brexit. Much work to do but looking forward to getting on with it #roadtobrexit

Staying in the Customs Union would mean having our trade policy set by unelected, highly protectionist  bureaucrats from other countries without any say in it. Bravo Mrs May. #CustomsUnion #roadtobrexit #trade #EU #Brexit 
#TheresaMay... C'mon let's be honest now #Britain has got a much greater vested interest in "getting #Brexit right"The #EU is a progressive union, it will continue into the future regardless of whether our country falters and fallsThe #RoadtoBrexit leads to a cliff edge
Ok. BBC Correspondents laughing at Trump's tweets about trade wars. Tell me how what Theresa May wants with #Brexit is any different. I can't stand Trump, but I get so fed up with Brits not seeing this WM gov. is just as bad.
With today's speech, @theresa_may seems to no longer want to have her cake and eat it too. She appears to accept that Brexit will mean neither having cake nor eating it.Either way, today @GreenwichInEU & @Open_Britain showed her that cake still exists. #eu#FBPE #cake #brexit 
.@theresa_may has set our opening position for the #Brexit negotiations with the EU27. Pragmatic and realistic but optimistic too. Time now to set differences aside and for the whole of the UK to come together to support her in getting the best deal #RoadtoBrexit
Key points from PM's #roadtobrexit speech:- Still cherry-picking.- No solutions to any of the important questions.- No tangible benefits of #brexit.- All VoteLeave campaign promises forsaken. Parliament must therefore reject the terms, and send it back to the people.
Theresa May claims she wants to to "bring country together" - yet she’s done exactly the opposite, held hostage by the far right of her own party, pursuing an extreme, reckless hard #Brexit which puts jobs and our futures at risk @Open_Britain
So now the PM has reached the “I admit #Brexit isn’t going to be nearly as good as what we’ve got but I hope  it’s not going to be as absolutely dreadful as you say ” stage of denial.  Its progress of a #Maybot sort but it is still leading us to disaster #Letscallthewholethingoff
Asked if Brexit ‘is worth it’ PM responds: ‘we won’t be changing our minds.’ 1. She’s accepted in that response that Brexit is bad for UK. It is in fact an act of self harm.2. She’s speaking for England & Wales. That’s who the ‘we’ is. Time to get out.#indyref2 #brexit
PM refuses to say #Brexit is “Worth it” but commits to what British people voted for in referendum.
Theresa May: "If that was an attempt to ask 'will we think again on Brexit', the answer is 'no, we will not think again on Brexit'." That's what you want in a Prime Minister someone who never thinks about things twice, especially when new information emerges. #Brexit 
Theresa May has in effect stated that the deal being sought will harm the economies of both the UK and EU and increase complexity. #brexit
I'm mindful of the irony that the PM claims Parl will be sovereign once we have left the EU, which of course it always was within the EU, & yet she's sought at every turn to subvert the Parliamentary process to avoid opposition to her version of #Brexit! Hypocrite#FinalSayForAll
NB having heard PM’s speech.. EU negotiator Barnier said in speech yesterday that EU has more to gain from its unity - it’ssingle market and customs union than it has to lose from #Brexit
PM right to point out that EU has multiple types of association and trade deals with a array of countries. The EU will have to create a ‘special’ deal with UK but that does not mean it will necessarily break its own rules #Brexit
May's big speech in summary: We want everything to stay exactly as it is today, except a few small bits we don't like, but if you could call everything by a different name, so the raving loons will vote for me again, that would help us out a lot. Thanks. #Brexit
The 8 year ECJ sunset clause for EU citizens in Withdrawal Agreement must go!Theresa May contemplating ECJ oversight for agency & Euratom membership post #Brexit but not for #citizensrights.How can it be that goods are better protected than people? #peopleB4politics
This was the extraordinary detailed position that the cabinet agreed? This was the compromise? What May said is: We want to have our cake and eat it and we want some of your cake and we don't want to pay for cake.  #Brexit
British Govt clearly trapped in a #Brexit cul-de-sac as #TheresaMay speech is nothing but preamble and absolutely devoid of substance
"Change is not to be feared" #Brexit is chance to "reaffirm Britain's place in the world" - PM @Theresa_May on #RoadtoBrexit 
No workable detail in PM’s speech on how to avoid hard border on island of Ireland #Brexit
There must be "no hard border" in Ireland after #Brexit, Theresa May says, saying UK will commit to keeping standards "as high" as the EU's and entering a "customs arrangement" #RoadtoBrexit
First impression: Most serious May speech on #Brexit to date. Will take some unpacking, but it sounds like she basically wants to recreate the single market as much as possible without being a member.
Theresa May ensuring no hard border in Ireland by a magic technology approach that doesn't yet exist, and by trusting traders to tell the truth. 21 months on and still living in denial with no new ideas. #Brexit
Theresa May says the UK wants to remain part of key EU agencies, including the European Aviation Safety Agency, pointing out that Switzerland, a non-EU country, is a member #Brexit
There we go. Theresa May: 80 pc of goods traded north-south in island of Ireland will not be checked as they are by smaller firms. Remaining 20pc would be monitored through a "trusted trade scheme". #Brexit
Theresa May is intent on stripping devolved powers away from Scotland after #Brexit. Sign our petition and send the Tories a message – hands off Scotland’s powers: #powergrab
What I hate about #Brexit is that at some point, through no fault of our own, we are going to have to apply to the French authorities for permission to continue to live in our own home.
This PM speech is like your careers adviser sitting you down after you have been told your projected grades arn’t good but trying to make the most of it #speech #brexit
Last year @DavidDavisMP wanted #Brexit deal with “exact same benefits”. Now @theresa_may admits “access to markets will be less”. That’s the UK Government giving up on the businesses, jobs and prosperity dependent on European market access.
May: "I want the broadest and deepest possible partnership, covering more sectors and cooperating more fully than any free trade agreement anywhere in the world today." Should someone point out to her that we HAVE that now, but are leaving it at huge cost and risk? #Brexit
So far @theresa_may speech is all about the nuts & bolts, not the soaring vision...#MansionHouse #Brexit
At least some honesty at last - she knows that her plan risks jobs and businesses in the UK. #Brexit 
"We will not accept the rights of Canada and the obligations of Norway" - PM @Theresa_May outlines vision for #Brexit in Mansion House speech

From today's @FinancialTimes #Brexit #TheresaMay
Theresa May speaking at Mansion House admitting that in future outside of the single market trade will not be as easy as now - if the PM is saying the #Brexit will call into question economic prosperity, everybody as the right to reconsider @Open_Britain

#MaySpeech starts by saying “my vision” - not that of the government? -still no agreement on #brexit within government?
So here we go @theresa_may another speech on #Brexit and another vision of U.K. and EU vision. Sellout, partial sellout or Brexit. Will the EU be laughing or just smiling at the end of it.
Dear Commentators, Tory and DUP MPs, you cannot say what is acceptable to the people of the north of Ireland on #Brexit. The people voted to remain and that needs to be respected.
At the end of the day, @jacob_rees_mogg will never amount to anything or achieve anything without the help of others. He is the very epitome of the British elite establishment that cares about nothing other than feathering their own nests - something #Brexit facilitates.
As an aside, only one other person has ever refused a briefing from me and that, by some incredible coincidence, was @BorisJohnson – and it was made clear to me that if I wrote one, he would not read it. I suppose these #Brexit-ers aren't keen on facts.
A cop has just removed this sign after the media pounced on its metaphorical implications for #Brexit 
Dutch PM starts speech in Berlin with #Brexit joke: "You had a choice today. You could have listened to a speech in the UK about a future without Europe. Or a speech in Berlin by someone who believes in Europe and wants to talk about the best way to move forward with Europe."
Let me be clear " Brexit means Brexit." "In tough times everybody has to take their share of the pain." "This is a strong and stable government." "We're negotiating #Brexit from a position of power."... If all else fails blame the last Labour government #MaySpeech
Ultimately if May is unable and unwilling to offer anything of substance and remains incapable of making a choice then we need a new PM who can and will. Dithering is no longer an option. Britain's standing for the next 50 years hinges on this. #MaySpeech #Brexit
Jacob Rees-Mogg shows his reluctant lapdog @theresa_may the #brexit he wants 
John Major - We're all urged to be patriotic & to get behind #brexit but it's precisely because I'm patriotic that I'm opposed to it... I want the country to be influential not isolated... every serious international body forecast that the UK will be poorer outside the EU#FBPE

Goldman Sachs & Globalist Fascist puppet Mark Carney falsely claims that #BrExit has led to "lower than expected wages" when almost every Corporate CEO encourages mass immigration because it helps lower their wage costs to increase their profits, at the expense of ordinary Brits. 
Goldman Sachs & Bilberberg puppet Mark Carney says that all the scare stories pushed by the Banking Elites about #BrExit haven't worked, so he's going to try yet another new angle, to try & fool the ignorant uninformed masses. 
The Prime Minister’s five #Brexit tests would require us to join the customs union & single market. She has ruled that out so today’s speech is PR. We will end up with no deal with this approach.

We don’t need 5 tests for #Brexit. The only test that any Government has to meet is whether it is acting in the best interests of the country. May’s hard Brexit fails that test.
The real thing that’s jeopardising #brexit is the endless stalling by vainglorious remainders like hestletine, Blair, major et all who more about their so called ‘legacies’ than democracy. Oh, and the BBC giving them endless airtime. #r4today

SA also needs to intervene in #Brexit negotiations.
Chris Grayling on #BBCR4Today: “If we are outside the European Union it really doesn’t make sense to have another political entity deciding all of our future trade arrangements”. So why should a political entity in London decide Scotland’s future trade arrangements? #Brexit
Today PM May will announce she wants the best trade deal in the world. So #Brexit is cancelled then. Any other option is worse than the current deal the UK has with the EU.
As #TheresaMay prepares her 'big speech' on #Brexit, over 3mn people in Britain remain unsure of their rights. This is unacceptable. We need guarantees on #citizensrights now, and an end to the scapegoating of migrants.#EUMigrantsHereToStay
When you think the British public can vote for #brexit but obviously can’t handle the details you tell them you want a ‘respectful enduring strong consistent united relationship’ and hope they don’t read the EU’s docs

Mullins’ main #Brexit concern is losing cheap, fast-turnover labour. The money he’s spending on funding the Lib Dems to reverse Brexit, could be spent on paying people more to work for him, instead of exploiting Eastern Europeans. Problem solved
Seriously? Increase in homelessness, nurses using food banks, underfunding in the #nhs. Have you no shame?The only right thing you did 'Dave' was resign. Then again, you left us with the parting shot of #brexit too 
She doesn't mean come together, she means everyone blindly get behind this extreme brexit without pointing out the fundamental flaws. Well, @theresa_may I will not get behind #Brexit which makes this country poorer, makes people feel unwelcome & takes away mine and other's rights
If @paulwaugh is right and these are May’s 5 #Brexit ‘tests’, I don’t know whether to  or . You can’t actually test those. And even if you could, what then? No Brexit?(Link via @ryobi)
Will May be honest with the people as promised and repeat the speech given by John Major or is it just more unicorns?I'm guessing it's more unicorns.#FBPE #Brexit #FinalSay #MaySpeech

The real problem with #Brexit is that nobody can have respect for a gerrymandered referendum result based on lies and deceptions. @theresa_may and her cabinet must acknowledge and respect what is now the majority who want to #StopBrexit.#Brexit is illegal #A50Challenge

Adrian has set @ChrisMasonBBC a challenge based on one of tonight's #bbcqt questions...Can he explain what has happened in the last 616 days of #Brexit? 
UK - since it joined the #EU - has been consistently withdrawing from engagement with it-Schengen-The Euro-Rebate of contributions-Voting #Leave is the most recent oneSince 1945 #UK has been limping alongNow it’s attempting #Brexit suicide
What Theresa May will NOT say tomorrow !"Listen up folks - I'm TOTES hacked off with this PESKY #Brexit malarky - it's a load of old COBBLERS - you've all been sold a pup - so I'm pulling the plug innit"#WishfulThinking
The best and perhaps biggest benefit to #Brexit is that it casts grandees like Major &, Blair into the dustbin of history - and makes an irrelevance of even the current crop of politicians. When we have left the EU this sorry bunch are toast and a new chapter begins.
#NigelFarage: If #Brexit gets betrayed, there will be a new coming together and a new party in #British #politics. Of that, I've got no doubt whatsoever!"  Interesting...  #BBC #SKY #LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress @Conservatives #ConservativeParty @theresa_may
#bbcqt @Nigel_Farage contradicting himself, it’s wrong to go against the “will of the people” over #brexit but not about #fracking showing his true #Tory values
.@MichelleDewbs on #BBCQT made a very good point.@jeremycorbyn’s decision to stay in the Customs Union has betrayed those @uklabour voters who voted for #Brexit. 
I thought the Russian bots are out pumping Nigel BS again!It was like #Brexit all over again!Then I realised it was my bad. He was just getting paid on #bbcqt again!I missed it. Did anyone ask him if he's still a person-of-interest in the #TrumpRussia #Mueller investigation?
Brilliant point raised in @bbcquestiontime, the UK had control of its immigration, it did not need #Brexit.The UK is not in #Schengen area and #FoM allows you to restrict EU immigration. If you want to. The UK did not. #bbcqt
The @Conservatives, with the DUP, have a majority in the Commons. That everyone wants to make it about @jeremycorbyn is rather telling! The simple fact is this: Tories are responsible for #Brexit entirely and they are IN power, “negotiating”. Get angry with them. #bbcqt
My recurring conclusion from these utterly tedious #Brexit debates on #bbcqt, where people surmise on why people voted Remain or Leave, is that it was fatuous to expect such a complex question to be boiled down to two binary answers. That's why referendums aren't that democratic.
Really good to see so many young folk speaking so proudly about our country tonight, emphasising the importance of democracy & respecting the #Brexit vote. Great stuff. #bbcqt
#NigelFarage: Every single major player of that referendum said that if we #voteLeave we are leaving the #SingleMarket & by implication the #CustomsUnion. Unless we leave we will not be able to go global and get the benefits that ought to come from #Brexit 
MacroView: Hard Brexit or Else? When Will The EU and UK Face Reality? #Brexit #UK #EU #FreeTrade #stocks #investors #investing
So #TonyBlair now thinks there's only a 50% chance of #Brexit actually  happening. That's funny, his own institute's #poll reveals 68% of 143,000 #voters  want to "#leave at whatever cost". Still ignoring the will of the people, Tony..? #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome @UKLabour
.@MichelleDewbs on #BBCQT is spot on about the talk of a second #Brexit referendum.Here is David Cameron before the referendum saying exactly what the vote meant. Leave the EUNo second referendum 
"I said major players" -- Farage trashes @DanielJHannan's #Brexit influence (he was PRO single market ) on the eve of Hannan travelling to D.C. to claim *he* is the "architect of Brexit". Don't worry, no one believes Hannan. Or cares. Or knows who he is.
.@OwenSmith_MP is not being truthful on #BBCQT when he said that we were not told that we were leaving the Single Market.Here are a series of Ministers speaking before the #Brexit referendum saying leave means leaving the Single Market.
Just a reminder that the ex leader of a party that recieved 2% of the vote in most recent election is tonight making his record as most appearances this century on Question Time. With #Brexit disastrous & slide to populist 1930s style politics -you cant just blame Dacre & Murdoch 
Didn’t take #Farage long to tell his first fib on #BBCQT when he said everyone in referendum campaign said we’d exit the #SingleMarket if we #brexit.  Several prominent #Leave campaigners said the opposite:
Having just read full trail for the PM’s “5 #Brexit tests” , featured in her much advertised  speech at the Mansion House tomorrow  I can (not surprisingly) report they are as vacuous & devoid of content or concrete proposal as everything else she has said in the last 18 months.
BBC News - Government defeated on Brexit bill. The government has been defeated after the House of Lords said ministers should guarantee EU nationals' right to stay in the UK after #Brexit. 
Can I ask you @liamfox - did the US Trade Ambassador warn you of their plans for 25% tariffs on our steel products when you met? What will you do about this? And you’re still confident US trade policy will compensate for trade we’re risking with #Brexit?! 
Some time ago I pondered the purpose of Ashcroft's Twitter poll. I came to the conclusion it was probably to determine the size of bot/troll army which would be needed to overwhelm Remainers on social media. I suspect we are starting to see the results. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
Apparently - in her keynote speech tomorrow - the PM will URGE the Country to *come together*on #BrexitI think she FORGETS the EuRef vote was 48%/52%.She has focussed ENTIRELY on the 52%And what about Scotland & NI - BOTH voted to *remain*So what IS your VISION Theresa ?
Clown car @TheEconomist #EU #BrexitShambles #Brexit 
Theresa May admitted there could be no open border in Ireland if Britain was outside the EU, newly emerged video shows.She gave an interview before the referendum saying there would 'have to be' a border if Britain left the EU#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
As the power to influence ebbed away, we heard a fragile echo from the past, but without resonance anymore. The shock of a world that had moved on. For #Brexit is taking place.
Young #EU citizens (18-27)ESPECIALLY #British citizens who may not have this opportunity after #BrexitApply for a travel grant and experience the fantastic #EU countriesGrown up peeps please tag your youngsters!  @SchwarzkopfStfg
Back off, Barnier – you don’t need to invent obstacles to #Brexit. Outside Brussels there is little sign of wanting to punish the UK. 
#OTD 1 March 1979: Scotland's first devolution referendum. Scotland voted 52:48 for devolution but blocked by threshold requiring 40% of electors vote for change. If we had such a requirement for #Brexit UK wouldn't be in this mess: 37% of electorate voting Leave. 
Politicians keep talking about how #Brexit has divided the country but it looks to me like we're pretty much united in the view that our politicians are drooling imbeciles.
“Look Donald, we have this thing in the United Kingdom called ‘Democracy’...” #Brexit 
It's hard to understand why this old canard keeps getting an outing. The idea that Leo Varadkar is running scared from Sinn Fein is laughable. How many times do we have to say it from this side of the Irish Sea? #brexit @FraserNelson
The 'well-being of the people', not 'the will of the people' said John Major. If you are patriotic, send a message about the recklessness of #Brexit in the May local elections - don't vote for any Brexit party. #HearOurVote #ABTV #FBPE
Tony Blair says he thinks the chance of #Brexit actually happening is now at 50% 
.@theresa_may is to deliver a major #Brexit speech tomorrow. She is expected to provide details of the next steps on the #RoadToBrexit.
And if you want a deal at the shop, you don't dictate the terms and then try to #bigfoot . The shops says: "Can't do that.I'd have to do stuff for everybody,  And anyway,you know the rules. You helped make them.Have a nice day."PS-In the matter of #Brexit-The UK is #supplicant
The idea that the opinion of an electorate on one day should invalidate further opposition is the stuff of tyranny as it legitimises the idea that the will of the rulers who purport to be implementing the "will of the people" cannot legitimately be challenged.#StopBrexit #Brexit
Even the Tories know it’s the Tories sabotaging #Brexit and the country:“Many @CONservatives are horrified at what is happening in our name. A few extremist Tories have hijacked the #Brexit process and are being allowed to run riot...”
Excellent. Can we have pounds and ounces back as well? Also the Raj? Bring back the Raj. Texan bars? (no actually fuck Texan bars). Rations! Yes fucking ration books.What about rickets? ...the plague even. Yay ...fuck sake #Brexit is great.
The #Brexit vote was the British people feeling we were finally having a say in the future of our country again instead of a few politicians in Westminster deciding for all of us. The behavior of Soubry et al is reversing that again. Undermining our PM and mocking our democracy. 
It’s time for answers Theresa May. If the British Prime Minister is saying no to the EU then it’s time she told us how she’ll stop a hard border in Ireland. Big speech tomorrow - we’ll be watching.#Time4AnswersPM #Brexit Agree  RT …
Tusk (@eucopresident in a voice with panic tones):  When the UK leaves, we need to find all of this cash to plug the hole in our budgets after #Brexit. Please help.Theresa: Are you ok Donald? Do you need to lie down? 
Very dangerous for #UK to  go down this route-victimhood might be comforting but will not serve UK in the end. Leaving could never be on #UK terms-club rights are club rights. #Brexit will diminish UK standing & influence-humiliation enough 
Ahead of @theresa_may 's speech, @MichaelGasiorek looks at how to reconcile the UK government’s stated conditions with options for UK-EU trade relations. The solution space appears to be null. At least one condition must be dropped #Brexit : 
Attempts by some Remainers to suggest that peace in Northern Ireland is somehow endangered by #Brexit are shameful. I’d like an apology from folk like Chuka who are doing so but know it won’t come in “begrudging” or any other form 
Guess we are leaving on #WTO rules then. That’s what I voted for. #Brexit 
#Brexit- EU Chief negotiator, @MichelBarnier on Theresa May's speech:-"Any vision of the future must take into account the fact that the EU cannot and will not compromise on its founding principles"-"I hope it will help move the negotiations forward by setting out her vision"
Under the Tories, we can be assured that #Brexit means the end of the United Kingdom because for Northern Ireland to have a hard border with the South will be like cleaving the spirit of a people in two.
UK government expected to launch supreme court action over Scotland bid for #Brexit emergency powers 
One of these men is an EU stooge, wants to undermine Britain, reverse #Brexit & deny Britons their democracy. He wants the UK run by a corrupt cabal of unelected pen pushersThe other is Michel BarnierCorbyn is a weapons grade wanker#ConmanCorbyn #EU@UKLabour @jeremycorbyn
Just seen a post on Facebook claiming unemployed immigrants in the UK get £29,900 p.a. in benefits; comparing it to old age pensioners getting just €6000 p.a.These outright lies are why Farage and the #Leave camp were able to get the gullible to vote for #Brexit.#StopBrexit
Since the #Brexit vote there has been a deplorable rise in hate crime, often making migrants feel unwelcome, threatened and marginalised. Many have returned home as a result and now there is a huge labour shortage in the #NHS and social care industry
Speech by @MichelBarnier giving more information on #brexit than the UK Government has in 20 months "For citizens, for your businesses and for each of our countries, my conviction is clear, the future of our Union is more important than Brexit"
As a scientist, I have no objections to experiments.But if experiments are going wrong, or looking dangerous - like in clinical trials - then you call them off. Standard procedure. Yes, I'm talking about #Brexit.
.@andrewismaxwell on the ridiculousness of the situation with the #IrishBorder and #BrexitFrom #Unspun with @mattforde on @davechannel
Tony Blair has said in a speech today the "rationale for Europe today is not peace, but power".   All the more reason for #Brexit
#Leveson2  cancelled - government signalling that it's much more concerned to stay cosy with Murdoch, Dacre and the rest of the right-wing press than to keep its promises to their victims. After all, where would #Brexit be without these media cheerleaders?
Here are some samples of what Brexiters were saying before the referendum and what they’re saying now. There are hundreds of examples. Please RT, to counteract the nonsense that “everyone knew what they were voting for”. #BrexitShambles #Brexit 
This morning's @AlexSalmondShow featuring former Uachtaran Mary Mcaleese on #Brexit and the Northern Irish border.
The government pays back the #Brexit billionaire press for peddling right-wing Tory propaganda.Our politics is now wholly corrupt. Britain is no longer a functioning democracy.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE #Leveson2
Blaming remainers and the EU for a disastrous #brexit but still wanting to go ahead with it is like blaming someone for poisoning a cake and eating it anyway.
'Got a better idea?' EU's Tusk to ask May on Irish #Brexit 
Eire has different VAT on pretty much everything compared to Britain. But there is no 'hard' border in Northern Ireland. Why would a different customs regime in the countries make a hard border inevitable?#Brexit#LeaveCustomsUnion

Missed our evidence session this week with Pascal Lamy, former Director General of the #WTO and European Trade Commissioner? Watch it online here  #Brexit 
Bravo! We urge more decent MPs who voted Remain to take Britain's side against the EU bully#Brexit#LeaveCustomsUnion
"I certainly offer those gentlemen the respect they deserve." Watch this clip of @patrickharvie on top form, taking Tories to task for the #Brexit crisis. 
He doesn’t understand MPs are representatives of all their constituents nor that I made my #Brexit views (to support SM & CU) perfectly clear. Yet more evidence of how #BrexitBullyBoys seek to close down debate & destroy democracy.
UKs #Brexit EU dealings explained:1. Fill up media/public discourse with angry idiots like Julia Hartley-Brewer, Tim Martin Nadine Dorries etc. demanding "unicorns"2 Get shocked by business reality, European reality, legal reality3. Capitulate4. Return to step 1 & start again
Meeting with PM @theresa_may in London before I next week will present draft EU27 guidelines for our future relationship. #Brexit 
Like most people I’m so confused about #brexit sad that we’re separating from Europe lost in a muddle of political bargaining but seriously pissed about being lied to 
Good to have your support @PimlicoPlumbers - as a former @Conservatives & now a @LibDems I know how you feel. @LibDems are the only ones fighting this destructive #brexit. 
It’s time for the answers Theresa May. If the British Prime Minister is saying no to the EU then it’s time she told us how she’ll stop a hard border in Ireland. Big speech tomorrow - we’ll be watching.#Time4AnswersPM #Brexit Agree  RT 
Euro Parl approves new tax committee to investigate financial crimes & tax evasion/avoidance. A chance to tackle the running sore of UK's overseas territories & make sure #Brexit doesn't lead to a world-leading tax haven on EU’s doorstep.#taxjustice
This clip is the sort of thing that proper journalists throw at politicians when grilling them.Will the balanced @BBCNews rise to the occasion?#IrishBorder#Brexit 
Real concerns that #Brexit could spell the end of the UK’s Europol membership and the European Arrest Warrant.  This would prevent crucial data-sharing, with negative safety implications.
BREAKING: Theresa May warns that #brexit will inevitably mean hard border in Northern Ireland border... Ooops sorry that was 2016, so whats changed her mind since? 
Blimey @BBCNormanS maybe it’s the cold but he’s thumping his fists making the point @theresa_may must set out the detail of what #Brexit deal Govt wants as @eucopresident makes it clear we can’t have frictionless trade outside #CU #SM
My reply to @Telegraph @lettersdesk explaining why Marcus Fysh was talking a load of pollocks about #EEA #EFTA #Brexit in his telegraph column earlier this week 
Tomkins is full of BS. He knows fine well that Westminster's Brexit Bill - which as presently written would destroy the devolution settlement - has to pass by 22nd March.Therefore, a Scottish #ContinuityBill HAS to pass before the #Brexit Bill. That's why it's an emergency.
The #Brexit factsThe UK never voted to join the EU. We voted to stay in a trade market, 2 years after the Tories took us into it, on the express promise (lie) from the PM that it would never become political.We next got a vote 41 years later, we voted to leave.The end.
The Telegraph has been trying to whip up nationalist hate against the EU - our democratic allies. Before the referendum Boris Johnson tried the same with his cynical and mendacious "The EU wants a superstate, just as Hitler did" headline.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
1/ This Telegraph headline is intended to whip up hate against our main trading partners and democratic allies. It is a headline of those who wish ill on our country, a headline written by traitors and believed by traitors!#BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit

Claims that food prices will soar on a "no deal" Brexit are based on a misunderstanding of the global trade system. Indeed, if we embrace openness and lower protectionist tariffs after #Brexit, food prices could fall 
In the forthcoming General Election, if you want #Brexit, you must vote for the candidate in your area who will deliver it, which ever party they stand for. If you stick with your usual they will claim it as a mandate to keep us in the EU. It's up to you people.

A conservative MP literally compares the self made chaos of #brexit negotiations to Dunkirk. Remember decades back when you looked at some unstable/emerging democracies and the odd ball stupid MPs they had? Well we are that country now @Mike_Fabricant This is what we have become.

The @Europarl_EN cannot accept any form of differentiated treatment for EU citizens who arrive in the UK after the start of any #Brexit transition period. Our statement here: 
Of course it’s an attempt at a coup - the establishment, aided & abetted by Labour, are determined to undermine democracy & wreck #Brexit #TheyWillNotSuceed #UKIP
A lot of bewilderment as to why tory MPs are attacking their traditional supporters - business. The answer is easy. The #brexit cult is at the self flagellation & public sacrifice stage now. Enemies attacked & denounced. Suffering is proof of ones purity & devotion to the cult.
This would be funny were it not so tragic.The European Commission put forward a draft yesterday based on what the UK (yes, your government, Nick) agreed in December.What part of that do you not understand?#Brexit 
Charlie Mullins(Pimlico Plumbers) - He's up for reversing #brexit & he's not beating about the bush anymore.... he has just tied up with @vincecable & the #libdems & he's going to financially support them to stop Britain going into a disaster. #StopBrexit #FBPE
2 British Prime Ministers of different parties, consecutively in office for nearly 2 decades, are warning of a #Brexit disaster. You may not love them politically, but they have masses of experience. It’s time to listen.

Is it reallly @toryboypierce ? Because I keep being assured by leavers that #brexit was all about trade deals and parliamentary sovereignty. And that to say vote was about immigration a slur on leavers...funny that.

In the movie 'Darkest Hour' can you imagine Churchill running the war in 1940 with social media & newspapers questioning every move?"How exactly do you intend to get 300,000 men off the beaches of Dunkirk? It's impossible, isn't it?"Well #Brexit negotiations are not dissimilar!
With WTO tariffs with EU the UK will be £7,000,000,000 a year BETTER offAlso better off cos we won't be sending the EU a net £10,000,000,000 a year.Also better off when we get back the £23,000,000,000 of EU assets that belong to us.Sounds like a pretty big #Brexit bonus to me.

UK red lines will determine shape of our future relationship. Next week I will present draft guidelines on this. Let’s be clear: there can be no frictionless trade outside the customs union and Single Market. Friction is an inevitable side effect of #Brexit. By nature.
One possible consequence of UK #Brexit red lines is a hard border on the island of Ireland. EU27 wants to prevent this, hence the proposal to "establish a common regulatory area" – if no other solution found. Today in London I will ask if the UK government has a better idea.
Edward Heath, Harold Wilson, Jim Callaghan, Margaret Thatcher, John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, & David Cameron: Whatever you think of them, EVERY former prime minister of the UK thinks/thought #Brexit a terrible idea.Even Theresa May supported REMAIN.

Tony Blair on @BBCr4today: I feel a sense of obligation to speak up. The fact is we've waited for a year for the Government to advance its negotiating position, and the truth is we're no further on. Read Tony Blair's recent article on the #Brexit dilemma: 
As Tony Blair lectures today's politicians on what we should be doing on #BREXIT one wonders if he has the self awareness to realise one of the key reasons we are leaving the EU is because of his inability to control immigration when he was PM for a decade. #r4today @BBCr4today

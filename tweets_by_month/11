It's eye-wateringly obvious that the health & welfare of the country are being savaged by #Brexit. Why do May et al persist? Other agendas?
Brexiteers opposing the *idea* of associate EU citizenship for individual Brits are vindictive shits. You've got your #Brexit, ok?
Err, no Andrew Bridgen MP. This citizenship plan allows Brits to keep something some of them treasure, post #Brexit.

What price #Brexit now as remainers talk down UK but confidence rises for post #Brexit as another giant shows confidence in this country.

It'd really be helpful if #Labour briefly just shut up about #Brexit.They're utterly risible, & trawling for #UKIP votes is sadly shabby.
Dear #Brexit fans. Hear this from Matthew Parris. Please post your plan to Mrs May. Yes, *your* plan. She hasn't a clue. Help her. 
Remainers carry on trying to drag our country & #Brexit down with doom and gloom. This is what real people are doing 
Boris Johnson is a clown who has united the EU against #Brexit Britain

Missed opportunity for British PM at today's Ministerial meeting in Wales.Not turning up means avoiding telling us what #Brexit means !!! 
Of course if the govt acknowledges we can't have the Single Market & migration controls the Conservative party will fall apart.#Brexit
Government deception in pretending that Britain can be in the single market & have migration controls#Brexit #YesEU
Un-f*cking-believableNot content with their Red Bus #BrexitLies, son of Vote Leave is now doubling down on #PostTruth #Brexit bull#bbcpm
Good to see govts at British-Irish Council discuss how to protect our place in Europe. Disappointing PM May didn't attend #BICwales #Brexit 
A shout out to anyone who thinks this #brexit stuff is straightforward... here's some of my afternoon. 
Theresa May increasingly resembles a child who has won musical chairs only to find that someone's shat on the last chair. #Brexit
You’re an idiot who did not know what he was doing when he voted for #Brexit. That one’s on the house.

#Brexit:If 100 people tie themselves together & 52 decide to jump off a cliff, should the 48 resist the insanity or just jump off with them? 
A couple of claims in the #AutumnStatement caught our eye - what's the cost of #Brexit? And is there a "bonus"?  
I remember #JohnMajor's government it was a horror show for ordinary working people but as he was a Tory PM a paradise for the rich. #brexit
An absolute tour de force by Prof. Grayling. Makes one proud to be standing up for our country against the the #brexit con-men and wreckers.

#Brexit  Farage is NOT a friend of the UK.  He is the cause of the biggest disaster this country has faced for decades, a liar and a fraud.
Why do I have to pay @BBC £145 a yr so they can tell me I'm an idiot & a racist, who did not know what I was doing when I voted for #Brexit?

Oh, GOD.Watching #bbcqt is like being stuck in a perpetual sense of Deja Vu... #BREXIT #BREXIT #BREXIT 
It genuinely baffles me that months later, people still don't understand that #brexit hasn't even happened yet #bbcqt
#bbcqt The cost of #brexit is indeed high. @timfarron and @ChrisLeslieMP are right about #brexitshambles
Isn't it interesting that the BBC seem unable to find any politician to robustly defend #Brexit. This is yet another butt hurt Remain panel
British workers face a sharp earnings squeeze next year, says the OBR, as the weaker pound drives up inflation#Brexit#BBCQT
At start of #bbcqt @timfarron gets applause saying British people should have the right to stay in the EU if they don't like #Brexit deal
#Hammond insists he's doing the best for the UK economy but fails to say that killing #Brexit would help enormously.#posttruth by omission
#Brexit should be cancelled. It will cost BILLIONS, the result was achieved through a campaign of lies, and it's encouraging nazism.
About 3 years too late. Send your report to the unemployed Steelworkers of Redcar. #brexit will save Sheffield's.  
Hey Better Together @blairmcdougall this #Brexit Britain you have lumbered us with is an absolute disaster! 
#brexit is about destroying the UK. It has nothing to do with patriotism or nationhood. So far, Brexit destruction is working well.

Memo to Mr Gove et. al. re Autumn Statement: looks like the experts were right about the danger of #Brexit -
The true cost of #Brexit has been revealed by the #OBR. @bigginslondon shows how we should get it out there:
Pro-Brexit MPs should note: the support for #Brexit has withered. Time to support #Remain if they want to keep their jobs.
Considering we are no where near #brexit yet that is cobblers ..... time to give up your trying to put this country down 
IT'S BECAUSE OF #BREXIT, YOU MONSTROUS WANKPUFFIN. 
Some things the #Brexit borrowing money could have brought: 9,800 primary schools 108 hospitals over 2m nurses

It's happening. This with a local baker. Brace yourselves, it might be bumpy #brexit 
Dominic Grieve is absolutely right about @OBR_UK forecasts - the cost of #Brexit to British livelihoods "simply can't be ignored." 
#Brexit and its (ongoing) consequences...by moi. 
Interesting charts showing the cost of #brexit :
Blair rules out return to frontline politics as media would go to "destroy mode" & says #Brexit can be stopped 
The Tory #Brexit con: £225m per week in extra borrowing & not a penny more for the NHS. #FMQs
The @OBR_UK forecast is more specific about #Brexit vote effects than other forecasts. It’s also more optimistic: 
Unionist parties are in a shambles and #Brexit is an absolute mess causing a constitutional crises, so let's talk about Trains

The evidence is in. #Brexit must be stopped: not soon, but now; not with half measures, but completely. When a mistake is made, right it.
If #Brexit wil indeed lead to a recession, also immigration will decrease. After all, the best way to curb migration is to wreck the economy

#Italia #Österreich! We The People of the World support your fight for freedom: #IoVotoNo #FPÖ.The tide is turning. Keep fighting.#Brexit 
We are witnessing the economic suicide of Britain. When will MPs tell the truth, #Brexit is not in our interests and we need to think again?
For 5 years we heard the #Tories saying 'it was all #Labour's fault'Now it's all the fault of #BrexitNever mind who called the #EURef?
Brexidiots demonstrate desperate to get Article 50 activated bc economic consequences are becoming obvious #Brexit 
It really is the end of the world as we know it… @ianbremmer to me on the end of the Pax Americana #brexit #Trump

The victory of @realDonaldTrump cements the fear among European elites that was first stoked by #Brexit 
£122bn to fund #Brexit. Could have been spent on our crumbling public services after 6 wasted years of Tory (& Lib Dem) austerity
Today' #AutumnStatement must be proof enough to all including politicians that Britain will not survive a hard #brexit and we must oppose it
So what has #Brexit cost the UK economy? 122 billion pounds!! That would fix the current NHS deficit for >50 years. #AutumnStatememt
This campaign seems to be gaining strength. #BoycottVirgin #RespectTheResult #brexit 
My favourite number in #AutumnStatement is the OBR's estimated cost of Brexit in 2020 is £292m a week. Thanks #brexit
Let's make it real.What if you get #Brexit but no state pension? Is that an OK price?Or no NHS, what about that?What *is* your price?
Weak pol leadership got us into #Brexit mess #Hammond's weak econ leadership will leave us in it.#autumnstatement
This is not my flag. #EU is not my country.And it will NEVER be.Follow #BREXIT: #Nexit #Italexit #Frexit #IoVotoNo #Huxit #Auxit #Grexit
Only the Tories could tout 15 years of austerity and record levels of national debt as success.#AutumnStatement #brexit #ToryBritain
Decent appointment #Brexit 
Here's what you need to know about the Chancellor's #Brexit bombshell #AutumnStatement 
I hate to bang on about this whole '#Brexit is really bad for the economy' thing, but, you know, given that it is, how about we don't do it?
At pro-#Brexit protest outside Parliament to call for no more delays. Parliament & the Courts need to get on with it 
 #London: Today outside the UK Parliament: "#TheresaMay don't delay, we want #Brexit right away!" Well done Brits!!!  
Who should negotiate trade deals for Scotland? #Brexit
The cost of the threat of #Brexit is £58 billion but we have no idea what the cost will be after Brexit. This is madness - it must stop.
GAH! I KNEW my moaning about #brexit would have a bad effect and NOW look what’s happened. Sorry guys! :( 
Of course it’s much better to be poorer than have so many foreigners around. I mean, it must be. That’s the point of #Brexit.
How long would it take to flush £122bn worth of £20 notes down a toilet? That's #Brexit#Remain #YesEU
After autumn statement and the fucking disaster that #Brexit is, the next time Scotland has an indyref you know which box to tick don't you?
Think of what could be done with the £122bn to be wasted on #Brexit#Remain #YesEU
#Brexit protest today 
#BorisJohnson bef/ #Brexit: 'Turkey, no thanks'. Now: 'Turkey in the EU'. Unbelievable! Those who leave the EU can't decide over its future. 
If someone had had the good sense to put #Brexit will probably make most people poorer on the side of a bus, think where we could all be now
Lower tax revenues, lower growth, higher inflation & borrowing: @DerekMackaySNP on the Chancellor's #Brexit bombshell #AutumnStatement.
British workers face a sharp earnings squeeze next year, says the OBR, as the weaker pound drives up inflation#Brexit 
@StillYesScot Really? You see no connection between British nationalism and white supremacists?#indyref2 #brexit pic.twitter.com/SAtBAiEvq3
So Hammond admits UK will borrow £122bn more. This I suppose is just the first part of the land of milk & honey promised thanks to #Brexit?
It's as though they're not even trying. Expect hard #brexit by default.EU negotiators find David Davis has no idea.

#Brexit 'will actually cost £226million a week' - that wasn't on the side of @Vote_Leave's bus: 
OBR *needs* data to forecast finances. Govt refusing to tell OBR if Nissan deal involved promise of money. #Brexit.  
This is PRICELESS #DoItLikeNigel #brexit #eu
The OBR has forecasted that the UK would have achieved a budget surplus by 2020 without #Brexit #AutumnStatement
.@OBR_UK forecast that there will be a #Brexit borrowing bill of £226m a week - meaning less money for our public services #AutumnStatement
.@OBR_UK's #Brexit assumptions & forecasts explained by chair Robert Chote #AutumnStatement 
According to the Treasury report, #Brexit is predicted to cost £412m, purely in Whitehall admin. TAKE THAT, BRUSSELS! 
So… Let's have 2nd #Brexit referendum already. And, to apologise, spend the $58.7bn loss that Brexit would have cost us on the NHS. With me?
I've just put up a blog post about Art50, #Brexit, & devolved legislative consent. The Miller case changes the game. 
£122 billion worse off by 2020. Still think #Brexit is a great idea?
So that's busted the myth that #Brexit voters are all 45 or over and white. 
No £350 million a week for the NHS in the #AutumnStatement; just a #brexit black hole in the public finances #LeaveWatch
Struggling on a low income? #Brexit probably won’t help #didyouvoteforthat >>
OBR table that will be big news: #Brexit costs put at c.£60bn. Lower migration at c.£15bn.#AutumnStatement

The Chancellor trying to avoid the gigantic #brexit shaped elephant in the room by pointing at an #indyref shaped squirrel #AutumnStatement
For years we were told austerity was absolutely necessary, now the government plans to borrow £122bn more for #Brexit#Remain #YesEU.
The mere prospect of #Brexit has already led to a £122bn UK #budget black hole. Couldn't we find a less expensive ideology to be fooled by?
OBR says lower net migration after #Brexit will cost economy £15billion #AutumnStatement
An increase of £220 billion in national debt. That's £350 million per week for 628 weeks. #brexit
He and we should say: 'battle #Brexit.' We need to wake up to the fact that the choice is stark: it's between 'Hard Brexit ' & 'No Brexit'. 
Hammond unveils £122bn #Brexit black hole: wonder how many Leavers think this a price worth paying #AutumnStatement

Good to know, that facing massive debts and #brexit uncertainty - this government plans to do up another stately home #AutumnStatement
So expected cost of #Brexit now over double the expected cost of shifting to a low-carbon economy

Excellent analysis of current political delusions re #Trump and #brexit  from Aditya @chakrabortty via @guardian 
After a week watching America's grimness there’s something almost comforting about returning to our own cosy home-grown catastrofuck #Brexit
So, the Tories will be able to fund 30,000 civil servants to see through #Brexit but won't be able to find promised cash for the #NHS?

Maybe this is why James Dyson is so pro-#Brexit. He's already shipped manufacturing jobs to Malaysia.
Irony overload from the @ScotTories and Murdo Fraser this morning. Again. #Brexit 
All I read:#Brexit is complex.1000s working 24/7 to make it a success.Even PM is hands on!WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
Now this is interesting. Times sticking to its guns on the #Brexit memo. 
A leaked memo obtained by media allegedly says that the British govt. has no plan for #Brexit. 
Tory #Brexit plan is clear - make it work for corporations and the 1%; dismantle workers' unions and rights, starting with Human Rights Act.
.@StephenGethins on leaked memo - ScotGov setting out realistic vision to protect jobs/economy, UKGov beset with infighting #Brexit 
Breaking news: the government's detailed #brexit plans are finally released following Whitehall's leaked brexit memo 
UK Government has no plan to exit European Union, leaked memo reveals #brexit 
The time is now, Germany. We The People are winning! Remove #Merkel #abmerkeln #merkelmusswegLet us #DrainTheSwamp & follow #Brexit 
Leaked memo confirms government has no plan for #Brexit. Time for them to establish a clear plan that protects British jobs and livelihoods
The Assembly #EUExit Working Group meets @ScotParl @SP_European at City Hall this morning to discuss #Brexit 
More accurately: "Euro sceptic John Mcdonnell has conceded to Tory/UKIP leadership on #Brexit and wants Scottish Government to do likewise." 
This memo underlines the sheer complexity of the #Brexit negotiations the Government will be faced with 
"no economic strategy..." "a case-by-case basis as specific decisions are forced on the government..." @thetimes #Brexit leaked 
They don't even have a cunning plan. #Brexit 
There's only one thing worse than this man's cunning plan. Having NO PLAN. #brexit 
#BlackMirror director relates Trump win to #Brexit: "This is a reflection of who we are right now"

Big news this morning: British Govt.has no plan for #Brexit !!! Surprise,surprise !!!
so how much evidence do those who voted for #brexit need before they realise their colossal, self-harming mistake? 
#BrexitClueless means clueless, with May & the 3 Brexiteers doing sterling service in pursuit of the unfathomable
No wonder Govt won't tell us what #Brexit plans are - they don't know what they're doing, are split & overwhelmed 
Sir Henry reaches for a glass of sherry upon hearing that an extra 30,000 civil servants are going to be required by the Government #brexit 
Familiar. #Brexit all over again. How to hold tabloids and other liars accountable. 
Irish economy can overcome #Brexit uncertainty says ratings agency, Moody's.  
 There's still no workable #Brexit plan 
I would like to suggest that #Brexit is nominated for a Darwin Awards 2016. #Brexit #DarwinAwards
#BBC anti-#Brexit campaign funded by OUR money must be stopped!'Consultant' memo becomes a negative main headline?
Major India businesses invest in UK as bridge to EU & see #Brexit undermining UK's appeal: PM's visa rules resented!
What shall we spend all the #Brexit Bonus on Troop? 
Yes, it was inevitable #Brexit 'would be as difficult as this' #R4today. Many, who knew what they were talking about, said so at the time.
Top Politics Tip: When a government says 'We're not telling you our plan, we're keeping it a secret', it's because IT HAS NO PLAN #Brexit
You couldn't make the #brexit mess up 30.000 civil servants needed no money to pay them because of austerity ideology that birthed Brexit !!
Fox with bold threat not to ease trade for EU partners as leverage for preferential EU market access. #Brexit
Tory austerity looks set to continue well into next decade - Stormont budgets will be hit hard once again #EndAusterity #BREXIT 
For all the media nonsense about 'Brussels bureaucrats' note that we now need an 30k UK civil servants to deal with #Brexit 
#brexit There never was a plan, months after the ref there still is no plan, the Gov is simply focussed on its own survival #clownfest
So, to recap:1There is still no plan. 2 Everyone is still making their own plans. 3 There is still no-one to implement the plan. #brexit 
We in SNP knew no plan for #Brexit -now we have confirmation. I reckon #Brexit has at least 7 options, hence the cluster issue for UK Gov.

Whether it is #brexit or #TrumpPresident this will leads us to more inequality, more animosity and more financial stress on the 99%

#Brexit market panic lasted 2 whole days.  Post-Trump election panic doesn't even make it to the market open. 
First bloody #Brexit now #PresidentTrump and yet "Boaty McBoatface" is the one vote the fuckers decide to overturn.
So they really did vote for Lex Luthor. I can't help but feel #Brexit forced the door. He just kicked in. In Jackboots.

More than anything #Brexit & Trump was a rejection of the 'global citizen'. A yearning for a to return to values & identity #election2016
In a time of #bigdata and advanced #data #analytics, how did we not see #brexit or #trump coming? #DPC16
Trump's win has so many parallels with #Brexit- record  numbers of people voting against a political elite that wasn't listening to them
Revolution of elderly uninformed scared white people, just like #Brexit, just like #OneNation, just like #Hitler in post WW1 Germany.

Strong parallels between #Brexit &  #Trump voters, yet education gap greater in UK and partisanship the driver in US 
#Brexit Hopefully those who lost yet seek to overturn biggest vote in #UK history will be defeated & consigned to political graveyard #Leave
I think it is safe to assume that with #Brexit and @realDonaldTrump winning the US Presidential race, the #TTIP agreement is now history!
The success of both the Trump & #Brexit campaigns was based so strongly on anti-immigration ideals. Why are y'all so scared of brown people?
Hilarious guy on Radio Scot earlier trying to group #indyref with #Brexit & Trump. YES were/are so far from the other two, end of story!
Hey @jk_rowling, can't Harry do something to help us ? Please, think about it. #Brexit #TrumpPresident
"How did we get it wrong?"#GE16 #BREXIT #TRUMPBECAUSEThe media, the "elites", the "literati" no longer manipulate the public, get over it.
Remember. Trump #brexit the #AltRight and the rest of the hate, are all REACTIONS to progress. Don't let the reaction, decide your actions.
What worries me more than anything, I think, about both #trump and #brexit is the glorification of anti intellectualism. Terrifying.
#Brexit, #PresidentialElection2016 show, that media has lost focus on what matters, namely to listen w/out political agenda #mediarelevancy
#Brexit can be a huge opportunity for European #tech says @GianpieroLotito #tech4eu #eutechday
"nearly a quarter of Europeans feel no longer welcome in the UK & a fifth plan to leave within two years". #Brexit 
They said Donald Trump wouldn't happen. They said #Brexit wouldn't happen. What're you going to say if they tell you #Calexit won't happen?
Britain with May and @Nigel_Farage retains the record of stupidity 2016. A US president has a 4 years mandate, #Brexit impacts 2 generations
Sadly, as in Wales with #Brexit, the forgotten of America embraced the very establishment who made them poor in the first place. #Trump
We need a strong, inclusive, welcoming civilised Europe now more than ever. That the UK will not be part of it is a disgrace. #Trump #Brexit
Populist votes for #Brexit and #PresidentTrump have definitely dealt a blow to the Globalists whether you agree with them or not.
I'm enjoying the outpouring of disbelief on Facebook over the Trump win, no doubt mostly by the same individuals who voted for #Brexit
#Brexit UK trade deficit widens from £3.8bn in Aug to £5.2bn in Sept: Exports fall & imports rise, despite £ slump!
Your worst nightmares came true today. This is #Brexit on steroids. A racist, bigoted, misogynist @POTUS has been elected.#Election2016
There's an uncanny parallel between #trump and #brexit when you look at voting behaviour per age group: 
How to win elections; tell a pack of lies, appeal to people's fears, + provide simplistic + impractical solutions #Trump #Brexit
The arrogance of the left.They said this about #Brexit too.These individuals hate "the people". 
But let's not do a repeat of #Brexit and lazily dismiss the millions who have voted for #Trump. Let's ask why and work harder.
As for #Brexit...Here's what the Electoral College map would look like if only millennials voted  #US2016
To quote my granddaughter "it feels as though England & America had a competition to see who could mess up the most in 2016" #brexit #trump
#Trump & #Brexit demonstrates how "out of touch" those in authority are from the people they serve. Listening is more impt than talking!
Dear 2016,Please end now...enough shock to deal with for one year #Brexit #USElection2016 #my30thBirthday 
If you are upset about #Trump or #Brexit, look on the bright side: you'll die at some point and won't have to worry about anything anymore.
As with #Brexit we're happy to consider psych-informed "what the hell just happened?" / "what happens next?" pieces… #Trump #ElectionNight
We shouldn't have laughed so hard at #Brexit

Are we at the FRONT of the queue for a trade deal now? Obama had threatened we would be at the back post #Brexit.
I'm tired of being told to respect views which are destructive, inhuman, divisive. I don't respect them. I deplore them. #Trump #Brexit
Common theme of #Brexit and Trump victory - young people no longer control the political agenda. Ageing population affecting our politics.
From the economic advisor who called 2007, #Brexit and now #Trump, @DrPippaM (AKA the Oracle of Delphi) - how you too can read the Signals
People who support the death penalty were the most likely to vote #Brexit. Something similar in the US? 
Woohoo! We are no longer the dumbest nation on earth! Result. #brexit #trump
..and after #Brexit it happens again: young people overruled. stolen present, stolen future, this is heartbreaking #USElection2016
Let's not forget one thing no matter what they say This is an incredible victory for the working classes of the world #Brexit#Trump
In wake of #Brexit+#USElection, @iainchalmersTTi mission to teach children to detect BS has never been so important 
This has rather similar echoes to the #Brexit vote. Even when you look at the stats, plotting a way fwd is really hard. 
Maybe if we'd have let the result of the Boaty McBoatface vote stand, none of the rest of this would have happened? #Brexit #DonaldTrump
#USElection2016—Just like with #Brexit, liberal amoebas claim "#democracy does not work." It works exactly like that—you snooze, you loose.
#Election2016 I'm told a £5 Treble on @LCFC , #Brexit & @realDonaldTrump would have yielded £15.1 million.

If #Brexit and #ElectionNight has taught us ANYTHING it's that young people NEED TO VOTE! Just look at this! Look at what we could do!!
#Trump winning the #Elections2016 only few months after #BREXIT is to remind us: Reality is harsh. Art and poetry is truly all we have ...

Everyone melted down after #Brexit too.. haven't heard a word since. Chill out it's all just a scam to make u think u have a choice anyway
If MPs are unhappy about #Brexit, they should vote against #Article50. Nation before party now.
Guess #Brexit wasn't a lesson anyone took to heart huh? Or people didn't vote in protest? Or 3rd party? How the Fuck did we get here?
Actually sitting here trying to figure out which nation is more stupid - UK voting for #Brexit or USA voting for #Trump! #TrumpVsBrexit
Picketty said we would have revolutions if the gap between rich & poor did not narrow. That is that we are seeing with #Brexit & #Trump.
People have clearly reached breaking point. The establishment is paying the price for not listening . #Trump #Brexit #BrexitPlus #POTUS

It's terrifying but as with #brexit people are voting for #change not necessarily fully understanding the situation... #USElection2016

After Leicester, After #Brexit, and now Donald Trump anything under the Sun is possible #GhElections #CitiCBS @benkoku @JustNanaAma @Citi973
Major issue for @BBCNews - from @BBCNewsnight to @BBCr4today to general approach - is how they underestimated & got wrong  #Brexit & #Trump 
Not all Trump voters are racist. But all racists voted for Trump. Not all #Brexit voters are racist. But all racists voted to leave.

Exactly the same scenario as #Brexit.  Devastating result for forward thinking millennial, women & minorities.  #Elections2016
Don't understand why everyone is so shocked about US election result?? After #Brexit result: nothing should come as a surprise #Trump #truth
We are living in a world of hate. It's incredibly sad. #PresidentTrump #brexit
#Brexit and #TrumpThe moral of the story is  - don't pay attention to the pollsters and the media.
#Brexit and #Trump's campaigns tell us that if you lie, are vague about policy but keep appealing to people's fears, it's a winning strategy
Not to get too technical, but this world is so fucked up. #USElections #Brexit
THE WORLD IS GOING TO CHANGE >> #BREXIT #TRUMP>>> THE PEOPLE HAVE TOOK OVER THE ESTABLISHMENTS  :)))
Both #brexit & #Election2016 have proved that despite what the media tells you, there's a silent majority heavily against leftist ideology.
Respect to Emily Maitlis on @BBCNews for admitting she & the chattering classes got #Trump & real voters totally wrong. Same with #Brexit!
Y'know, #Brexit doesn't seem so bad today.
If you want to understand what just happened read the brilliant book #Signals by #PippaMalmgren @DrPippaM She predicted #Brexit too. #SNRTG
Interesting how in a digital age of so much conversation, a silent majority is still possible & powerful. #brexit #Elections2016 #ListenMore
If the aftermath of #Brexit is any indication, I predict a sharp spike in hate crimes.I hope I'm wrong.

All we need now is for honey G to win the X factor #PresidentialElection #brexit
.@GuyVerhofstadt Then start by ensuring #ScotlandinEurope, we are Europeans who did NOT vote for #Brexit
I'm a Brit and this is the second time this year I'm skipping to work. The masses are ready to fight the establishment! #Brexit #Trump 
#USElection #brexit As a British American- bewildered & ashamed. France &Germany its your turn-rescue western democracy from fascism #irony
As with #brexit they didn't think so either. Electoral college weirdness notwithstanding, they're surprised too. 
I mean these things are finding me .  #brexit #trump
#Brexit & #Trump wins prove polling industry 'bankrupt' -intent on manipulating the outcome of elections instead of honest representation
2016 in history: the year the world proofs humans are all idiots #brexit #Trump
Lesson for Africans #Brexit #ElectionNight - Put AFRICA FIRST
And we though waking up to #Brexit was bad... #DonaldTrump is president...!!!!! 
2016Leicester champions#Brexit Portugal winning the EurosTrump presidentImpossible is nothing.
Oh no... What a worrying world we live in.#brexit #donaldtrump those seeking to destabilise doing a grand job
Don't like what's going on #Trump #Brexit? Join the #FightBack with @Plaid_Cymru - Become a 2017 council candidate. Support our campaigns.
Muffed three in a row, eh, @TheEconomist? 1. #Modi 2. #brexit 3. #trump. Bloody supercilious buffoons, #deepstate flunkeys
Before #MAGA and #Brexit, there was #EkitiDecides. Good time to stop ignoring the apparent power of the "iyán k'òlóbé" sector.
Wish people would do their own research rather than believe what the media +corporations want you to. Power to the people #Brexit #Trump
Good, bad or indifferent 2016 will go down in the history of our planet as as a pivotal year #Trump #brexit
What a year !!!!Leicester Won the Premiership Britain left the EU #Brexit Donald Trump is President of USA What's next?
2016. The year all sanity was lost. Good luck everyone #Trump #Brexit #fail
Maybe it's time to believe the unbelievable.. Stop saying "it's never gonna happen" because it has...twice...this year... #Brexit #Trump
The biggest hit from #Brexit and #USElections might be on the credibility of polls
Not for the first time this year I have woken up dumbfounded. Unbelievable Jeff #trump #brexit
Back to back #brexit and #donaldtrump 's win reflects a wave of anti-globalization, anti-free trade, inward-looking, xenophobic mind-set.
2016: Dim white people being told the evils of capitalism are the fault of immigrants. #brexit #USElection2016 #AmericasBrexit  #2016
Hey Brits. You guys are no longer the dumbest country in the world. You're only second. Congratulations. #Brexit #ElectionNight
So apparently a £5 bet on Leicester, #Brexit and #Trump would have brought you £12.5m in winnings...2016 folks!
2016:Q1 - Everybody diedQ2 - #BrexitQ3 - Bake off ends (I never watched it but many did apparently)Q4 - #TrumpHoly #$@%
Well, I thought the UK were foolish over #Brexit But America, you have certainly Trumped us on this one. 
Informed Ppl on street now refuse to listen to #IvoryTowerIntellectuals. #TrumpWin #Brexit #European Immigration crises #Modi show clearly
America trumps #brexit. #USElectionOk 2016, this isn't funny anymore.
Never believe in another poll again.#ElectionNight#brexit
They said people wouldnt vote #BrexitThey said #Trump had no chanceIt shows how much Politicians/Media are out of touch with the Public
I thought waking up into the #Brexit nightmare was bad enough, but waking up to a #Trump presidency is… the words have run away.
#Brexit and Trump is what happens when you politicise the underclass those who've feel left behind ignored and taken for granted #USElection
Nobody ever thought #brexit would happen,#Trump would be president.i say: @lfc will be Champion this @premierleague season. @TheAnfieldWrap
All I can say is congratulations #Trump.A year of the unexpected- #PresidentTrump #brexit #endofblackmoney in india hope all are great moves
Americans: at least in 4 years, assuming the world hasn't ended, you can reverse your terrible mistake. #brexit
Puts premium on European unity in both #NATO and #EU, does it not @CER_IanBond? Oh, was forgetting #Brexit 
Congratulations for the Audacity! President-elect @realDonaldTrump. The American version of #Brexit
#trump being elected and #brexit demonstrates that the majority of americans and brits r racists and idiots. Im unsure why people r suprised
It's like #Brexit all over again. Good luck America  
#America, please look after each other. Bullies will see the #ElectionResults as a green light. We saw it here with #Brexit. Be safe. 
Trump victory in USA will be great for a post #Brexit #UK.
Speechless. And we all thought #Brexit was the end. America has spoken @realDonaldTrump #Elections2016
World driven by racism #Trump #Brexit
Can we get a refund on 2016? #brexit #trump
First #brexit now #trump I'm a very happy man this morning. Despite my boiler going pop.@XxPLWxX @NickPringle6 @Timothy_Conan @AMDWaters
Small poll failure on national popular vote - smaller than in UK GE and #Brexit. Really big GE2015 scale polling fail in Upper Midwest.
Democracy is a bitch. #Trump #Brexit #Zuma #Erdogan #andrzejduda
... my only advice is "build bridges", "get over it" ... as per #Brexit, don't try & destabilise the whole country with your righteousness.
I posted this on the morning of #Brexit.. And now. 
2016 is going to be one difficult year to explain to future generations... #trump #brexit
Russia elected PutinBritian went with #BrexitIndian ended up electing ModiNow USA has elected Donald Trump.
First #Brexit and now #Trump - I'm done.
I guess Donald Trump & Boris Johnson can now officially exchange hair bleaching tips #idiocracy #brexit #blondambition #itsreal
this is History#PresidentTrump#ElectionDa #USADecides #DonaldTrump #Brexit #USElection2016 #BrexitUSA #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
A Trump victory means makes it all the more vital that Europe stays united as a bastion of freedom and democracy. #YesEU #Remain #Brexit
Politics and politicians brought #brexit and #ElectionNight #results2016 on themselves. Don't dare blame the voters or #democracy
#TrumpWins. Feels like morning after the #Brexit vote except with nuclear codes not just increased #Marmite prices & fewer #Toblerone peaks.
The British and Americans have, with their courage, landed a massive hammer blow to the ruling elites this year. #Brexit #Trump
After #brexit #Election2016 proves that even the people of the richest economies of the world fear … #globalization 
The world feels like a big social experiment! #Brexit #Trump
Time to dust off post #BREXIT blog - we need to re-double our efforts to build an economy that works for all 
So it's real now.... "Clowns to the left of us, jokers to the right, here we are, stuck in the middle" #Election2016 #Brexit #ElectionNight
What an unbelievably crazy year. #Brexit & now #Trump.
Im scared for my daughter's future  #doomed what is going on people?! It's 2016, it feels like we are going backwards #brexit now #trump 
Well I never thought I'd live to see history being made twice #brexit #Election2016 my condolences to the UK and US. Tough times for us all
Grim times #Trump #Brexit but we must continue to challenge racism,sexism,homophobia,war,poverty & keep on campaigning. #HopeNotHate
Exact same thing, the youth weren't heard, again. #ElectionNight  #ElectionNight  #Brexit 
With a Pro-Brexit American President ... #BREXIT IS FAR CLOSER THAN YESTERDAY :-) 
Politics in 2016:#brexit #trump
Britain: "#Brexit is the stupidest, most self-destructive thing a nation could do to itself."USA: "Hold my beer."
"Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups" 2016 you've gone and put the cherry on top...#USElections #BREXIT 
Appalled by our neighbours on the left, appalled by our neighbours on the right. Someone throw a blanket over us quick. #USElections #Brexit
Is it Like #Brexit? Not in the way many think-After folly of #Brexit £ crumbled by 12%-US stocks likely to dive minus 10%-Little people hit-
It's going to be odd explaining to my daughters when they're older, the thinking of #Brexit and #Trump. From our underground bunker.
It was predicted they wouldn't #Brexit It was predicted that he wouldn't #PresidentTrump .. shows how biased media can be..
Lesson from #Brexit. Before you go around accusing half of the US of being Nazis, Racists, Idiots ... try disaffected with the status quo.
Let's look on the bright side. At least we won't be the biggest laughing stock of the world now after #brexit #ElectionNight
#trump #2016 #brexit #welose #fuckus illustration by @zhion pic.twitter.com/O7IPm4QutD
It's official:2016-worst year ever. #brexit #trump #bowie #Prince  last one out turn off light on dark ages.Leave 'em to it.
Racism & prejudice is being legitimised by #Brexit and the new US President. It's a horrible & scary world to live in right now
In the midst of this, #media must not inflate voices of #farright leaders seeking attn. That's how #Trump #farage #Brexit gained momentum.
#2016 the year of the crazy! #Brexit #PresidentTrump never in a million years did I think people would be so stupid 
Gold rally strongest since #Brexit as Trump leads White House race:  #Elections2016
2016 is a year that we will never forget. Reeling in the Years will need to be about 3 hours long #Brexit #USElections
Bloody hell. It's happened again. #ElectionNight #USADecides #brexit
#Brexit #Trump The white working classes have finally revolted as Marxists predicted but to punish the weak rather than the rich.
#Brexit and now #Trump, forget leaving the EU, how about we just leave the planet? #Election2016
Like #Brexit I'm finding it very hard to get my head round what I've woken up to this morning. Where is this all going wrong?
At least America only has 4 years of it, the U.K. has to suffer for decades now. #Brexit #ElectionNight
*slow hand clap* Bravo! Only another £83bn and you've covered the #brexit black hole to break even. #remain
Crucial for education to promote: questioning, critical thinking, empathy, respectful relationships, citizenship & hope.#brexit #US
Welcome to the new USA.Anti non-whiteAnti-factsAnti womenAnti Muslim#ElectionNight Basically #brexit on speed. Welcome to the new world 
One lesson common to #Brexit and #Trump: we don't know our fellow citizens. A dangerous place to be in a democracy. #ElectionNight
Whatever the result,ppl should stand united against #hate & bigotry.Sadly post-#brexit showed #racist attacks likely to rise#USElection2016
2016 will go down as the greatest year yet for nationalist, right wing politics. First #brexit and now Trump #MAGA #ElectionNight
Trump set to be President. The establishment, polling industry and media are out of touch both sides of the Atlantic. #Brexit #Electionnight
#Brexit gives us a perfect forecast for how the liberals respond next:-call everyone racist-ask for a do-over election...#ElectionNight
Calm down America, I'm sure it's just "advisory", and you can have another one when the butt hurt gets too bad. #Electionnight #brexit
Never underestimate the power of the common man..World altering decisions r made at grassroots level! #Modi #Brexit #Trump #Electionnight
Turns out when you run racist bigoted campaign, many voters agree but are too embarrassed to admit it to pollsters. #r4today #Trump #Brexit
"Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right. Here I am, stuck in the middle with you." #Ireland #Brexit #ElectionNight #USElection2016
Just woke up. On a scale of one to #brexit this is off the stupid chart. O_o #WTF
Theresa May needs to make a big bold move and stop #Brexit now. A united and forward-looking Europe has never been more vital for Britain.
#Brexit #USElection2016 the world has changed. don't know what lies ahead but it's too late to get off the train. Adapt or get left behind
Remembering my first thought after #Brexit on June 24th: 
First #Brexit, now this... Can we scrap leaving the EU and leave the planet instead? I hear Mars is nice this time of year! #ElectionNight
To all the morons who laughed at me when I told them that the West was rejecting globalism - this one is for you #brexit #MAGA #Trump
#Brexit repeat. 
#Brexit morning brought genuine tears to my eyes; this morning is the same.Extremism never, ever brings societal benefits#USElection2016
#Babyboomers: you've lived the good life and now you're leaving us with #Brexit, #Trump and #ClimateChange. How nice of you.
I'm heading to The Winchester until this all blows over. Who's coming? #2016 #ElectionNight #Brexit 
Well, since #Brexit happened and now Trump, #CalExit doesn't seem that farfetched.
If #ElectionNight is actually anything like #brexit, America will have months, possibly years before Trump gets the keys to the Oval Office.
Can you invite me. The world is f**k up. #ElectionNight #Trump #brexit #NoLoyalty #selfishness… 
Post #brexit and Trump, the EU needs a "1000 Talents" program to help scientists who want to leave. Reverse Hitler's brain-drain.
Clowns to the left of me, jokers to the right. Here I am, stuck in the middle with you. Soundtrack for Ireland  RIGHT NOW! #trump #brexit
Interesting discussion to be had about an age where social media feeds & news consumption narrow the views we are exposed to #Brexit #Trump
Europe: "Let's do some dumb shit no one can beat. #brexit.USA: "Challenge accepted." #trump
1. Reacting to #Trump - part of pattern with #Brexit - revolt against established neoliberal order led by reactionary super wealthy
Never underestimate the power of racism and hate in people's hearts. #Trump #Brexit
This is how we felt in Britain in June, waking up to #Brexit. Winning didn't take the edge off our racists, either.
2016 can officially go down as the worst year in human history:Terrorism, mass shootings, #Brexit, Harambe, President Trump
Welp, America's #brexit just happened. @realDonaldTrump won. Don't care what MSM says.
Good news Britain.The world has just stopped laughing at your stupid decision.#ElectionNight #Brexit
Same feeling I had after #brexit but multiplied by 1000000000! Scared! Very scared of modern world&s politics! Let love rule! Sad day!
First came #Brexit. Now comes #Amexit.
So...never ask @NicolaSturgeon for betting tips. She never backs a winner.#indyref#brexit#Trump
Just like #Brexit, the older generation  voted the wrong camp. #ElectionNight
Comparing the Trump vote to #brexit is madness-we only voted out of Europe.Americans voted out of the world.
The Western world is about to experience a double #Brexit & it will never be the same. Pollsters can't be trusted in this social media world 
Markets may recover quickly, but #Trump's election probably a much larger problem than #Brexit, says J. Krämer @commerzbank #election2016
Like #brexit. Change is coming at any cost.
Flight prices just went through the roof, I bet. #Amexit #brexit
#Elections2016 #Brexit; two unforeseen results? @CFAinstitute global poll in 2015 pointed to members worrying most about political risk
Well done America, you beat the Brits again. I thought #brexit was the stupidest thing people would vote for this year. #USElection2016
......I think, after #trump and #Brexit we must question whether popular democracy is delivering results that benefit mankind....
Just like #Brexit, market weakness will be completely blamed on Trump rather than the end game of a global fiat standard
The world has coughed all it's darkness up to the surface for transmutation. #WeGotThis #artists #thinkers #lightworkers #brexit #Trump
Maybe Berlin should offer Silicon Valley to move to Berlin as well?!  #ElectionNight #brexit
Good news Britain! We are officially not the biggest dickheads of 2016! Hooray!#ElectionNight #brexit
2016 the year racism, hate and prejudice won #ElectionNight #Trump #brexit
@jk_rowling is this how you felt about #brexit cuz man this is tough #ElectionNight
So "people who voted Brexit are racist.""People who voted Trump are racist."How can a majority be demonised by a minority? #Brexit #Trump
US to UK: I see your #Brexit, and raise you... #POTUS
2016: The year the western world lost their collective minds and handed the reins of leadership to bigots and racists  #brexit
The people that thought #Brexit would not happen and thought #DonaldTrump would not be president,are the same ppl that dismiss #Bitcoin
How is the deportation of 11 million Mexicans from the US going to make the EU citizens in the UK feel?#Brexit I hate all this. It's wrong
"Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive..." #PresidentTrump #AltRight #Brexit+++ #LockHerUp #Peace #HueyLong
Of note... these markets did the same thing after #Brexit and corrected themselves in a few weeks. #LetsHope
After #Brexit and #Trump You know #HoneyG will win the  and Ed Balls will win #Strictly. You've heard it here first.
First #Brexit now @realDonaldTrump - it's clear that the commentators & left-wing activists are out of touch with real people. #democracy
#BREXIT#LeicesterCity#CronullaSharks#WesternBulldogs#Ireland vs #AllBlacks#ChicagoCubs and#PresidentTrumpThe year of the upset.
.@Nigel_Farage: @realDonaldTrump’s victory wll be ‘bigger political revolution than #Brexit’ 
Guys!  The @europeanunion has a slot open - It's even about the right size and shape!  Let's get California in there! #Calexit #Brexit
This is the era of #Brexit and the era of #Trump. Make no mistake that Fascism is mainstream again.
Just like #Brexit is anti-establishment, @realDonaldTrump is anti-establishment could @JohnReesEvans as anti-party establishment be next?
#Gold has shot up nearly 5%, its biggest single-day gain since 24 June when it rose as much as 8% following the #Brexit vote #USElection2016
That's exactly what i was saying one hour ago, here's the result of the lack of education that characterize the World 2.0 #Brexit #Trump
2016...hmm let me think...yes! #brexit #trump #reset #turmoil
After the 2015 general election I promised to be massively sceptical of polls. After #Brexit I really meant it. After #USElection2016 ....!!
We live in a world where racism, bullying, xenophobia and lying guarantees election success.The idiots have won.#USElection2016 #Brexit
Polls said Tories would not get majorityPolls said that #Brexit would not winPolls said Trump would not win Polls say Le Pen can't win. 
Today I am meant to be inspiring young teenagers to save the planet. If only adults would show them some leadership on this #brexit #trump
two men who have changed the world#NigelFarage & #DonaldTrump#PresidentTrump #Electionnight #USADecides #Brexit #USElections #BrexitUSA
Breaking up the #EU and weakening the western world still looks a good idea does it? If you're not afraid you don't understand. #brexit
#Brexit and #USelection: showing minorities and immigrants that having citizenship is NEVER enough to feel home.
Rising regional inequality is the overlooked story of our time. You saw it in the anti-London resentment of #Brexit and now you see it here. 
I have no words to express how I feel...there is madness in the world and we have all been infected. #Brexit #ElectionNight
America's worst nightmare was 9/11. Now it's 11/9.The tables have turned! New change! #ElectionNight #USElection2016 #ElectionNight #brexit
This is a 2nd lesson, after the #Brexit vote, about how crucial #education is.
I called #Brexit, I called Trump. I'm the only Pole you can trust!
If David Attenborough were narrating on what human race has just done he'd be talking in that hushed, concerned voice #Trump #Brexit
There are swathes of disaffected people in Britain and the US that neoliberalism has left behind. I fear they have worse to come.#Brexit
Well America seems like you can't really take the piss out of #brexit anymore 
FLASHBACK : Barack Obama was wrong about #Brexit and he was wrong about @realDonaldTrump #TrumpTrain #Trump2016
Groundhog Day #Trump #brexit 
.@SarahPalinUSA compares @realDonaldTrump's strength in the #USelection2016 to #Brexit 
Wow. #Brexit #Trump - Opinion Polls mean nothing. What a year in Politics, 2016
British voted to leave EU #brexit Americans voted to leave their own country #ElectionNight #TrumpPresident
Looks like he's got PA. 99% reporting, 58,000 vote lead.This is #Brexit^10A massive epic "fuck you" to the hated Establishment!
My own conclusion from #Brexit and #ElectionNight is that exit polls and polling companies should be made redundant. No results in 2016.
I suddenly don't feel so bad about living in the land of #brexit 
If I fell asleep and am dreaming, DON'T WAKE ME UP!‘America’s #Brexit’ as #Trump confounds polls to win presidency
#brexit and #trump2016 victory mark the end of liberal lies. Humanity has woken up. #draintheswamp #TrumpTrain #draintheswamp #MAGA
Crikey...it's like #Brexit all over again, only bigger! Trust America!!
TFW #brexit was the second most embarrassing vote of the year. I am ashamed.
Pro tip from the UK to the USA #brexit #Elections2016
#Brexit was bad for minorities in the UK. Can't even imagine how a #PresidentTrump victory will be for minorities in the US. #ElectionNight
Is #ElectionNight #Election2016 Americans version of #Brexit - #Amerexit ?
Can I just say Britain we are no longer the stupidest nation on earth thanks America. You absolute morons . #ElectionNight #brexit
#ArabSpring #Brexit #USElection...#democracy is a sought-after double-edge sword that can also alienate and divide. #Praying healing for all
Remember the noise Malcolm Turnbull made over #brexit & used it for political gain during the election. A lot quieter now on #USElection2016
Maybe too early, but I think we can now confirm that the Americans are more stupid than the British! #USElection2016 #Trump #Brexit
In front of our eyes a revolution in the West seems to be underway #brexit #USElections I advice my sons not to start a polling company
2016. The year everyone decided they hated each other. #brexit #ElectionNight
What is happening in USA just made #brexit look like a parish council election @SkyNews
First Bowie, then Prince, #Brexit and now #USElection2016 #ElectionNight results. Is this our   generation's 1933?
This isn't #Brexit.Brexit was Middle Tennessee State (15) beating Michigan State (2).This is USA Hockey defeating the Soviets.
Another WW2 analogyUSA has just entered the war against globalism on the side of Britain who previously stood alone w #brexit@UKIP #Triump
Is this going to be like #brexit where Americans will be looking up "what does the president do?" tomorrow? #ElectionNight
I'm worried that this and #Brexit signal a weakening of the age of globalism. Nationalism is back and it's scarier than ever.
You vote for #Brexit They vote for #Trump but still We are the racist we are the extremists. Next time search terrorists in your own country
So #brexit was the successful beta test and now white men are rolling it out across America. #ElectionNight
#Brexit and #Election2016 has shown that nearly 10 years later, the crisis of 2007-8 is still playing out both economically and politically.
2016 will be remembered as the year globalism died. #ElectionNight #brexit
Britain, we forgive you.  Brexit really wasn't that bad.  WTF, America? #electionnight #brexit #americadecides2016
Woken up early in  to a second unexplainable voting decision in space of 6 months. Numb & confused all over again. #USElection2016 #Brexit
This is NOT like #brexit guys. It's NOT. They voted to leave the EU union. We voted in a racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, LGBT-phobic bully
Dear Britain: We see your #brexit and raise you Trump  #ElectionNight
After #Brexit and #Trump, will the media learn that insulting voters with legitimate concerns is not a good strategy? #ElectionNight
 supported #Brexit and supports #TrumpPence16 we stand proud as a conservative blog! Thank you all readers
No matter the outcome #Brexit & #Trump have exposed #MSM and made fools of elitesWe need to promote that@pruemacsween @AyesHavit #auspol
First #Brexit, now #Trump. Ty British, ty Americans; we, the Greeks, used to think we were the most stupid all over the world #ElectionNight
From @nakulssawhney's FB wall: #Modi in India, #Erdogan in Turkey, #Brexit in Britain and #Trump in USA. When is the next #MarsMission?
"Anything is possible" used to be a positive phrase. After #brexit and #Trump it is now the phrase of nightmares #ElectionNight
Obama a bully! Threatening UK over #Brexit deeply unpleasant! Trump said so kindly, was OUR decision, if he won we wud B at front of queue!
Well, Britain, we raised...we have managed to do the dumbest thing imaginable to ruin our country. What are you gonna do next? #brexit
After #Brexit, Elections in the USA show again that populism is invincible even in mature societies 
Wish we had some #brexit wisdom for you guys but there's nothing. It's crushing tonight and it'll be crushing for a long time #ElectionNight
Hope #US & y'all #Brits are about to get much closer #Brexit #ElectionNight LMAO at @CNN talking about @HillaryClinton's fading hopes!
Britain: we don't need EU we're better than that.  Nothing can go wrong or be better. US: I see your #brexit and raise.. #ElectionNight
Remember when we thought #Brexit was a disaster? *Cue hysterical laughter* #ElectionNight
India voted for Bigotry. #AccheDinUK voted for parochialism. #BrexitUSA voted for Racism & misogyny. #MAGA #ElectionNight #Elections2016
After #Brexit there was a spike in racist hate crimes by people emboldened by the anti-immigrant mandate.Get ready. It's coming.
Remember when we laughed at the UK when they voted for #brexit yeah well you know...karma and stuff... #ElectionNight
Americans in June: WTF #brexit, you Brits are crazy racists, tanked your economy,etc Americans in Nov: cool let's try that #electionnight
“I keep thinking about #Brexit”Clinton supporter says Trump’s expected success shows “divided” USA#ElectionNight
Congratulations America. Enjoy your #Brexit! Those who "sat out", "protest voted" or "wrote in" funny names, great job! #ElectionNight
"This is deja vu of #Brexit - very worrying": Analyst on falling oil prices amid #DonaldTrump's #Election2016 lead 
Age demographics of the #USElection2016 is pretty reminiscent of what happened at #Brexit. (source CNN). #ElectionNight
Never one to be upstaged, the U.S. saw the fallout from your #Brexit decision, U.K. and decided to outdo you! Wheeee!

TOLD YA #BREXIT THE SEQUEL @realDonaldTrump WINS AMERICAN PRESIDENCY #Elections2016
What's become clear after #Brexit and #Trump Professional bookies and professional pollsters need to give up on politics
German media have learned absolutely nothing from #Brexit case. If @realDonaldTrump is going to win, they'll look like morons. 
Never underestimate this man ... Juncker did, Hillary did ... @Nigel_Farage #USElection2016 #Brexit #Article50 #LeaveEU
tbt to when we called UK dumb for #Brexit lmao 
This is the end of civilization. #Trump #Putin #ISIS #Brexit
After #Brexit and this #ElectionNight, everything is now possible. A world is collapsing under our eyes. 
A #Trump victory will make #Brexit look like a touch of man flu#USElection2016
The common people will only take so much. Remember that when you try to obstruct #BRExit using your privileged position. 
The U.K. had their #Brexit. We in America are experiencing our #NECKSit #ElectionNight
Fascism. This is not about the left behind or economic inequality; it's racial hatred pure and simple. #Brexit #Trump
Gotta love our global economy. When we mess up the Rand suffers. When the US or UK messes up, the Rand suffers. #Trump #Brexit
We laughed at the UK for #brexit, now they'll be laughing at us. Life comes at you fast.
2016 is well on its way to become the year when liberal democracy rejects liberal internationalism. #trump #brexit #ElectionNight
#Brexit comparisons are being made by celebs on this election night -- read tweets: 
Man I thought #Brexit was horrific, this is Cataclysmic! #ElectionNight The Horror The Horror #WorldGoneMad
Pretty accurate indeed. #USElection2016 #Brexit 
A big thank you to #brexit voters for showing us how to take our country back #TrumpVictory #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Welcome to the #Brexit Club America #Elections2016
The U.K. showed us what happens when you don't take your freedoms seriously with #brexit and y'all followed their lead. 
#Election2016 #brexit When scared white people vote to "take back their country." 
French ambassador to US: "After #Brexit and this election, anything is now possible. A world is crumbling before our eyes." #ElectionNight 
So #Brexit & #Trump are actually opportunities for #Africa to assert herself as the Global Order reconfigures itself. TAKE THE CHANCE!
America: You got played even worse than #brexit played us. They had to outright lie to us but you didn't even need that #electionnight
#Brexit happened and @realDonaldTrump is gonna be president. Times are changing.
England: #Brexit is most embarrassing thing everAmerica: Hold my beer#ElectionNight
After #Brexit, I wrote: #Africa needs to stop mourning the West & become more selfish with itself as Europe & the US are doing.
2016 is the year we realised that racism, homophobia, sexism and ableism is much more prominent than we all thought #ElectionNight #Brexit
Not shocked to see what is happening in the US. #Brexit says it was always on the cards. The world will be a different place after this. 
Wolf referenced #BRexit sentiment Is @CNN finally getting a clue 99% is sick & tired af of establishment MSM & politicians? #ElectionNight
#America we made HISTORY tonight. It's time to CELEBRATE!#Europe #Russia #brexit #Germany #France #ElectionNight
Key messages from #Brexit & #uselection2016. Share your wealth or destroy your democracy. And pandering to mobs is bloody dangerous.
Even @SarahPalinUSA is saying "this is exactly like #Brexit. We look forward to a great relationship with Britain" @SkyNews
@Richard_Florida same voting pattern as in #Brexit, same demographic. Rural, small town, lower education, white., working class
I stayed up to watch left biased broadcast journalists squirm. Not been disappointed #brexit+++ NOW DO YOU GET IT? #StopTheBias @SkyNews
UK: the #Brexit is a catastropheUS: Watch this.#2016
Going to bed feeling sick about the world. #brexit #Elections2016 whats next? WW3? Racism, walls and hate? It is just scary and sad
The issues might be different in each, but Singapore’s 2015 GE, #Brexit and #Election2016 shows that for all the social media chatter…
Trump well into a win. USA rejects the establishment. Proves the people of the U.K. After #Brexit are made of the same grit. #Ukip
#Brexit just happened in the #USA
good news for #brexit as we jump the "queue"
#Brexit and #Trump have proven once and for all, never believe what you read/see/hear in mainstream media. Incredible how wrong they were.
Are you getting the message yet, Neoliberal Global Elites? We, the people, are pissed off and angry! #Brexit #Hexit #inequality
My sleepy newborn is currently smiling at me. How do I explain this world to her?  #brexit #Toblerone
Today is U.S.A.'s #Brexit. No question. It is our 2nd Independence Day in which we embrace nationalism over globalism. God bless America! 
I'm hearing #Brexit are you? @CNN @HillaryClinton?  #ElectionNight
Trust and believe I said that America hadn't hit rock bottom yet that we were just circling the drain... you thought #Brexit was joke?!?
Dear America, we voted #brexit so you didn't have to do this. This is not a competition you know....
@WDFx2EU8 " We have a #Brexit on Sterioids"!!!!! @
Remember, the top search after #Brexit was "What is the EU?"Don't let tomorrow's be "Is Trump qualified to be president?"#Election2016
Remember when we made fun of the #Brexit and learned NOTHING?! 
People are openly crying at the #Clinton rally in New York"This is very similar to the night of June 23rd" says @SkyNews re #brexit 
Stocks are crashing now just like when #Brexit happened! @realDonaldTrump is only 48 electoral votes away from being POTUS! Thank u Jesus!
The democrats are in full panic mode.  #BREXIT 2.0 - @_JoeRedford ITS HAPPENING !!!
Looking like American #Brexit tonight #PhillyVotes
#Trump running mate Pence. Name is the same as the lowest currency of a country that just made the same type of huge mistake. #brexit #usa
How the pollsters got #Election2016 wrong - just like #Brexit 
#Trump & #Brexit represent a massive indictment of the free market appeasing, politically timid, social democrat liberal-left #ElectionNight
'Clowns to the left of me, Racists to the right, Here I am...'  #ElectionNight #Trump2016 #Brexit #Wow #USElection2016
Guess this is americas #Brexit. the white male morons are steering the Titanic towards the iceberg b/c they hate govt., women, & blacks
The media comparing us who voted for #Brexit in the UK as #Trump supporters shows what a biast bunch of corporations they are 
Micheal Moore at NBC: "Michigan, Ohio & Pennsylvania are #Brexit states of US, with an angry working class" True or False? #ElectionNight
...first Europe with the whole #brexit thing, now America with this  ...Canada enters the scene like,
So this is what #Brexit felt like, huh?
This election cld tell us that polls, field, integrity, truth, media, thought leadership = worthless. So #bush2000 all ovr again. & #brexit
It was already dead at #Brexit > 
I've seen this horror movie already #ElectionNight #brexit
Watching media luvvies,as it dawns on them they backed wrong horse, is delicious.Just like #Brexit all over again.What a yr 2016 has been
I'm sorry for every single #brexit joke I made.
White Americans are taking back 'their country'. White Nationalism prevailing. Remember #Brexit #USElection2016
After #Brexit and #ElectionNight I think it's time to declare most modern polling is entirely broken.
Dreadful #Brexit -esque fear clouding over. Please let humanity, inclusion & hopefulness win this time. #ElectionNight
OK. so how does this #Brexit thing work?
Are they still accepting people onto those Mars trials ? #electionnight #brexit
If #brexit was any indication if #DonaldTrump wins hate crimes against minorities in the USA are going to sky rocket.
Any pol sci folk out there pondering how do we go about teaching politics in this new era? Assumptions shuttered #Elections2016 #Brexit
Can @NASA hurry things along so some of us can move to Mars? #ElectionNight #Elections2016 #Brexit #Trump #Putin
It's only one election, without the permanent changes of #Brexit, but given America's power and influence, would a Trump win be bigger?
The day after #brexit  went like -1) Promises retracted2) Millions wishing they could vote again3) Worldwide facepalmGet ready America
Its like #brexit was just the trailer. GO USA!
Thinking a lot about the #brexit voters who were shocked by the results because they didn't know what they were voting for. #ElectionNight
Did we learn NOTHING from #Brexit???
Democracy is not a linear progression. Established 'Western Democracies' can experience setbacks too #Trump #Brexit 
After #Brexit and #ElectionNight we should have a serious rethink about election polling 
With #Drumpf being this close and #Brexit, it's hard not to be saddened by the large amount of hate out there in our world now.
If this continues, you can thank #Trump for cutting your 401k into a 201k tomorrow.And this won't be #Brexit.This is 100 times worse!
World: "Wow, no one could have had a worse polling screw up than the #brexit polls" America: "Hold my beer and watch this" #Elections2016
Disaster for the west. It started with #brexit
So, basically, 2016 has taught us that pre-election polls are completely useless. #USElection2016 #Brexit
whatever the result of US election, #Brexit was a foreshadow of discontent with political establishment
Hey USA, do you understand how the UK felt during #Brexit now? Doesn't feel nice huh? Well I guess we can go back to making fun of you again
At the risk of looking stupid later, Ohio is the #Sheffield #Brexit moment, and I'm calling it for Trump as #POTUS. #ElectionNight
It's done. It's over. I'm off to bed. Going to wake up tomorrow to see #Trump do a #Brexit and claim he never promised to build a wall.
Looks like #brexit stage left" for @HillaryClinton and brace yourself world for @realDonaldTrump #ElectionNight
I promised all my UK friends this wasn't #Brexit.Don't make me a liar, people.#ElectionNight
Waking in the night and putting the radio on ... this feels horribly like #brexit all over again. People really can be that stupid. 
I remember back in June scoffing at #Brexit...no scoffing right now.Angry populism is more effective than I cared to believe.#ElectionNight
Foreign investors have already pulled billions out of US markets. Maybe they learned something from #brexit
The market is tanking on the thought of a trump presidency. #brexit
BREAKING:Financial markets continue to tumble. When will Broward County be called????? #Brexit#VICTORY
#ElectionNight is #Brexit redux--ppl don't believe it could happen, till it happens... then everyone regrets their decision
Much like #Brexit, the liberal media gave us a very innacurate view of the state of our nation this election cycle.
Like I was saying one hour ago, #ElectionNight has all the signs of #Brexit:
#DowJones futures plunged nearly 500 pts — a move eerily similar to what happened back in June after #brexit. #txdecides #Elections2016
So, basically, 2016 has taught us that pre-election polls are completely useless. #Brexit 
"Hey England. You think that #Brexit was crazy?  Hold my beer and watch this."   -   America
The story of the night: rural america (Trump, ignorant) versus urban america (Clinton, educated). The same story as #Brexit #ItIsWhatItIs
OK, NOW bed. Final thot 4 Scots: if #Brexit AND #Trexit don't make you want to plight your troth to the boring, over-regulated old EU...

This is #Brexit. The market is already responding. This mess is actually happening guys. Thanks Comey! Thanks Johnson! #YayYouGuys!
Any real estate agents out there selling properties on another planet? I'd like to see your portfolio? #Election2016 #Brexit #Trump

If #Brexit taught me anything, it's don't underestimate how much stupid people hate foreign people. Trump could win this. #Election2016
Wow....Dow futures down over 400. Looking a lot like the morning after #Brexit, folks!! MAGA #Election2016
The world is sick & tired of normal politicians! #Trump looking good for a #Brexit! US$ being belted! #Election2016
"It won't be like #Brexit" they said. "Stop comparing this to #Brexit, you fools" they continued.Well, look at that now.#ElectionNight
Americans, we hired @raining_tea after the #Brexit so if you're serious about moving, here to help ;)
#ElectionNight is not so much America's #Brexit as America's #FuckedIt pic.twitter.com/2m6jdka6mN
I have the same sinking feeling in my stomach at #ElectionNight as I did when the results for #Brexit were announced.. Please God, please
Maybe I have an evil streak. .. But I love it when smug, Media luvvies look like they MIGHT be reaching for a puke bag.  #MAGA #Brexit
I'd go as far as saying MP's who fear #Brexit MUST refuse to vote for it. They have to do what THEY feel is best. That's their job as MPs! 
I think at least half of the heads of the Fairfax and ABC commentariat are exploding now like they did over #Brexit. They don't get it.
I watched the coverage hour by hour on BBC during #Brexit.Patterns are playing out exactly for #ElectionNight SOMETHING is happening!!!
Oh God, I'm getting #Brexit dejavu. Can this year get any fucking worse? Florida WTF?
Same trend as #brexit. Old people r trying to screw the young #USElections2016 #USElection2016SG
This is starting -- starting -- to look like an American #Brexit.
I'm starting to get that same feeling in the pit of my stomach as I had when Sunderland was first to vote for #Brexit. #ElectionNight
What we are seeing in the #USElection2016 is #brexit x 10. We did tell you this would happen #TrumpPence16
We will welcome any Americans that want to #Brexit over here when Trump wins, bring your sisters
The sweet wind of #Brexit is blowing across America... Do you feel it?
This election is starting to feel like #Brexit tbh. #ElectionNight
So per exits, CBS has Trump UP 5 in MINNESOTA within 1 in MICHIGAN #brexit
Comparison with #Brexit is uncannyJust as with Brexit1st part of night looked bad for LEAVE As night went on REMAINERS got more gloomy.
Feeling a lot like #Brexit. Damn, #AmeriKKKaLots of racist dreams coming true tonight! You're gonna get that wall, folks! Yay! 
ITV - #Trump out performing exit polls .... could this be America's #Brexit day?
Pouring my fourth glass of whiskey for the night. Cheering to the "this is so not going to be like #Brexit" crowd. #ElectionNight
Signs that race is tightening despite polls? Sound familiar? Night is young ! Ghosts of #brexit ?
Just wondering: Is this how Brits felt during #Brexit?
FL will be allllll night people, raw votes being counted and Dem crossover isn't factored in to early results.  Like #Brexit 
Went to bed with #Remain leading. Woke up to a #Leave win. Not going to repeat my #Brexit mistake with #Election2016. Up till Hillary wins
I remember at this point of #brexit night we were relaxed. Then came Newcastle, then Sunderland, and then... chaos. So sit tight.
Why #Trump is def going to win #USElection20161. #Brexit happened2. Americans are even dumber than Britons#Election2016 #ElectionNight
Thank you for thinking about the 48% and Britain's young people! Our own Government has sidelined us. #Remain #ParliamentisSovereign #Brexit 
#Brexit-style fallout after #ElectionNight? RT America's @AmeeraDavid & Larry King discuss 
Tonight is a lot like #Brexit night. The 'result' is not the only thing that matters. There has been a deeply corrosive & divisive *process*
#Koenders discussed Europe, #Brexit, free trade @AucklandUni: 'NL is solid partner New Zealand in negotiating Free Trade Agreement with EU'
I assume if Trump won the US election the whole election will suddenly become 'advisory' just like #brexit - maybe we will get #softtrump ?
I'm eating crumpets watching the US election. #Brexit
Unlike with #Brexit I am praying to wake up to the news of the first female US President #ElectionNight #HillaryClintonForPresident

#Brexit is no longer the property of the people. It’s been handed over to a political class largely hostile to it. 
Gove tweeting about how the UK’s free press is superior to other EU states’ press is typical of the UK’s inferiority complex. #Brexit
We were asked if we wanted to leave the EU, we weren't asked if  we wanted to ask parliament if they wanted to leave the EU #brexit

Big flaw with a 2nd ref is it wld give EU every incentive to give UK a poor deal, so voters wld reject #Brexit 
(2) - time for a new alignment in U.K. politics to defeat #Brexit & marginalise the irrationalism on both right & left.
Hard to disagree with Nicola's analysis; the problems that led to #Brexit were set into play longer than 6, or 12 months ago #sturgeonSPERI

It's important that we look to the interests of the 48% people who didn't vote for #Brexit. My thoughts: 
The political suicide will be of those forcing an irreversible #Brexit against a growing #Remain majority. #YesEU
Who voted #Brexit with NO control of borders an NO permission to make trade treaties???  Huh??? 
Post #Brexit, the UK experienced a surge in hate crimes. If Trump wins, the same will happen in the USA. When the right wins, people die.

Ridiculous "Tinpot Dictator" slur by Gina Miller directed at T.May. How does the 52% #Brexit vote make Mrs May a despot?

Well well. This puts a lot of the SNP's overblown rhetoric on #Brexit into some context

No. That was the #Brexit vote.This was just a boring thing called the rule of law. Remember that?  
Time to take the power back! If the elite want to ride roughshod over #Brexit then maybe time we change the elite! It's over @theresa_may

My analysis of today's #Article50 Judgment - it's no surprise and it will STRENGTHEN not stop #brexit: 
Anyone complaining about today's court decision is effectively admitting they did not vote for sovereignty, but against immigration. #Brexit
Reminder that homophobic  violence rose 147% in the three months after the #Brexit referendum. 
Sorry guys but #brexit won't be halted by this Judgment:

Would be interesting to read the whole judgement on #Brexit by The High Court. Almost certain it's seriously flawed. Will look into it.
Tory Gov promised to implement whatever we decided . . Broken promises are the quickest route to political suicide. GET ON WITH IT #Brexit ! 
Just in case anyone actually believed the #brexiteers that £ fall was "balance of payments" not #brexit lets look at events of today @brexit

Everytime a politician says #Brexit is "the will of the people" it s an insult to almost 75% of us who didn't vote to leave the EU#c4news

Good morning all, especially to those stalwart Britons mobilising for a renewed battle for #Brexit & freedom from the Brusselstaat 
MPs have a duty to do the right thing, not the popular thing. That's why national interest comes before public opinion over #Brexit.
I was a Remainer but I find the possibility of #Brexit being thwarted disgusting & disturbing. It must happen. It's the will of the people.

Everyone just chill out. There's no need to worry about Aritlce 50, Bjørn's on standby...#brexit 
My #Brexit in 1534 was a plan that worked for all! And when I say all I mean me!
On what basis will the government appeal? Was the court decision unduly influenced by a big lie on the side of a bus or something?#Brexit
If #brexit proves one thing it's that opinions are like toilets. We all prefer our own and the public ones are bloody awful.

Let this sink in. Gina Miller, an arrogant woman from Guyana thinks her wish is of greater significance than that of 17.4m people #Brexit
One of the greatest lies of the #Brexit campaign was that we had no parliamentary sovereignty. As #Brexiters have just had shown to them.
YOUR COMMENTS: I think reader ‘CountryNotIndividual’ is making a pretty explicit threat here… #Article50 #Brexit 
Key passage in #Brexit judgment. *If* EU law rights are 'domestic law rights created by [statute]' & *if* A50 irreversible, the rest follows

Waiting for Nigel Farage's reaction to the #Brexit ruling. Perhaps "Who are these unelected bureaucrat MPs to decide the future of Britain?"
It will be hilarious if #brexit case reaches the European Court of Justice...
We elect politicians to do our will, not to change things when it doesn't suit them. #BREXIT means we voted OUT. Get on with it. 
OUR GOVERNMENT & LAW MAKERS REFUSE TO DEFEND THE DEMOCRATIC WILL OF THE PEOPLE ... THEN WE REMOVE THEM & GET SOMEONE WHO WILL.#Brexit 
One of the considerations in the High Court was loss of rights in a #Brexit - this & other key points to be emphasised in persuading MPs.
It's Judicial Activism vs The People. #Article50 High Court blocks #Brexit. The will of the people 2nd to the will of the establishment

My Goodness !Just tuned into #newsnight & heard Marcus Fish Tory MP having his feet held to the fire on a "no deal #Brexit "His ignorance & arrogance beggars belief !Plus -he takes *stupid *to a whole new level !!
Marcus Fysh is still a fully paid up member of the #Brexit Unicorn Society then. The food industry operates on the same just in time system that the car industry does. If there are hold ups at customs then produce will go off. It's not rocket science #Newsnight
The political class, majority of the mainstream media & the professional elite have set their faces against the democratic will of the British people. They want to thwart the will of the little people, because they think their votes & views count for more than ours. #Brexit
This nonsense about a 2nd #Brexit referendum.Tosh!Literature (which backed remain!) sent to all homes said:The Government would implement the outcomeIt was a once in a generation decisionI didn't hear remain asking for a 2nd referendum before the vote.  
Finally the British Sandwich Association (BSA) are speaking out... #brexit 
“I think silly season has obviously started a bit early this year … I don’t believe there would be a blockade of imports from the EU” - Conservative Marcus Fysh on warnings of a no-deal #brexit@maitlis | @MarcusFysh | #newsnight

So given that we will not have freedom of movement after #Brexit, is the next series of Love Island planned for Anglesey? #newsnight
Tuesday's Express: "How dare he insult 17m #Brexit voters" (via @AllieHBNews) #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday
Watching @BBCNewsnight Emily Maitlis doing a brilliant job tonight holding corrupt #Brexit bastards to account. Hello #BBC can we have more of this....long time coming.
Some of the vitriol & straight up #brexit lies put out by this “think tank” has been absolutely dire. Sad to see it got such high media exposure, worrying to see its high level of Govt access 
I love there is a British Sandwich Association @BBCNewsnight I don’t love the trouble #brexit is going to cause it.

Good to know that the Irish plan to infiltrate the British Sandwich Association is working , we will replace all the #walkers crisps with #tayto on the side of every plate of sandwiches in the UK. #brexit 
There is nothing about #Brexit that we can be proud of.If it goes ahead we will look back in future decades and feel thoroughly ashamed of this catastrophic and selfish decision. 
Interesting to note that support for #Brexit rises with age until we get to the generation who actually lived through the war. The 'patriotism' of the baby-boomers is based on the idealised vision of WW2 fed to them during their childhoods. #PeoplesVote

If you were for a moment tempted to believe Shanker Singham's claim that the IEA is not exerting undue influence on the #Brexit process, here's what the head of the IEA said about it to an undercover reporter.#Newsnight
UK @Conservatives Government Set to Take €1 Billion Funds from Scottish Control after Brexit #Brexit #DissolveTheUnion #indyref2
And please add “our 1955 founder introduced factory-farmed chicken to the UK and today we welcome #Brexit to bring in US chlorinated chicken and much other filfth, to make money for our hidden sponsors...”

1. Normally it's me doing the preaching but I have some concerns about post-Brexit defence and defence twitter seems to exist in a parallel universe where the word #Brexit is seldom mentioned.
MAITLIS: "What would be in those sandwiches? What do sandwiches look like, to you, after a no deal Brexit?" SANDWICH EXPERT: "There'll be shortages of ingredients like tomato, lettuce... avocados will be difficult to come by..."#sandwichoggeddon #noonevotedforthis #brexit 
Feel totally disillusioned at present with @UKLabour and it’s prevarication on #Brexit and the appalling, apparently wilful, blindness in the failure to tackle the ingrained antisemitism of many on the hard left @tom_watson @YvetteCooperMP @hilarybennmp et al please stand up...
We'll have to pay tariffs to Mexico for importing THEIR avocados? Strange logic. On #Brexit day we could place a zero tariff on Mexican avocados #Newsnight
Britain invaded 90% of countries in the world!! I actually think Tim doesnt realise that this type of arrogant comment is why you have to confirm that youre Scottish when abroad! #indyref2 #Brexit #DissolveTheUnion
Whichever Cabinet minister stupidly claimed that a no deal #Brexit would spark “a sharp recession at least as bad as 2008” needs to resign ASAP! Project Fear has no place in our @Conservatives Government! Let's focus on our bright free-trading future! 
Brexit Reality .. #EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
We go live now to #brexit 
#Brexit the Only ‘Possible Justification’ for Continuing with ‘Failed’ & ‘Flawed’ #HS2 says Secret Government Report.  #StopHS2
Even if all this were true, Owen - which it isn’t - I’d rather prepare properly for #Brexit than wargame for a #Communist #Labour Government under your friends Jeremy #Corbyn and John #McDonnell
What does #Brexit have to do with continued @GOVUK support for #HS2? We've the secret @cabinetofficeuk report that said the project is 'fundamentally flawed' and will cost at least £80bn, and it's got a couple more revelations to give. More at Midnight! #StopHS2 #FailingGrayling
The penny's beginning to drop. The 1% like Farage, Johnson & Mogg get richer with #Brexit while 99% of us get a lot poorer. If Brexit ultimately fails, it means the penny has finished it's drop before March 2019.
7/ What I think we should take away from this is that #Brexit is not a British project. It is one project of a transatlantic kleptocratic elite, aided by Putin, which is using fear of social change and nationalist hysteria as political tools to undermine democracy.
Food runs out? People starve.Medicines unavailable. People die needlessly.Fuel runs out. No cars, no transportThen the stealing and the violence starts.Then the army get called in.Then people get shot. This is your #BrexitThis is not #ProjectFear2This is coming.Again. pic.twitter.com/sLP0ikNsLi

#Brexit is far too many sandwiches short of a picnic...#Newsnight
As foretold . #Brexit 
Politicians will offer miraculous promises to solve the #brexit food problem because after all it worked in 2016 here Theresa may offers the magic Gruel Potn 
Sky News lead with the increasing calls for a #Peoplesvote. No mention of #Brexit in BBC headlines.
BREAKING: British Sandwich Association man on #Newsnight confirms. No deal. No avocados   #Brexit
Hefin David has done no reading or reasearch on Welsh independence. That's worrying, isn't it. Given that Tories & Labour are madly pursuing a #Brexit that will decimate Wales, I'd kind of hoped there might ge a plan. Silly optimistic me! 
The IEA is selling snake oil. The divergence they are selling off to their clients has serious repercussions for UK exporters.  #IEAtapes #Brexit 
Some cry baby remoaners will seek not opportunity but solace in a new #Brexit national drink turnip gin

I've seen three tory MPs interviewed today, they all accused their own govt of scaremongering, when asked what their plan for #Brexit was, all three gave the same answer, fuck the stockpiling of medicines/food/blood, we must respect the referendum, we're doomed #Newsnight
I’ve lived with #Diabetes for 18 years. I’ve never had to worry about getting the #insulin I need via the #NHS, which literally allows me to stay alive. The possibility that, following #Brexit, I’ll not have access to medication is utterly terrifying.
No My Lord. I voted for Brexit. I am not a nationalist and I don't hate foreigners. But you. You are an EU nationalist. You seem to love every country except your own. #Brexit 
Others however grasped the opportunities of #brexit and rediscovered traditional food sources one such well loved tale is the Pied Rat Rustler

For the sake of fairness, I must cop to the “bot hashtag” tweet, but in this piece of mine for @DowJones in October 2016, where I broke “Bots for #Brexit” and Trump, I defined “bot” as including human trolls and influencers and meant it in that sense.

Sky keep peddling the line that the public mood has changed on #Brexit  As @thecarolemalone rightly points out, the public have turned against Theresa May's #ChequersPlan - not against Brexit per se
Ouch. Marcus Plankton might be a better name, on the strength of this performance. #MarcusFysh #Newsnight #Brexit #Yeovil
Funny that isnt it Deborah.They invite Farage on loads of times, taxpayers alliance (whose aim is not to pay tax) get on and that genius who sells cheap beer also. About time tbey had you on - but does that suit Bbc pro brexit - doubt it.#Brexit
This #thread below on #Brexit from one of the hard Brexiteers, and disgrace to #Scotland - Ross Thomson - proves everything that @IanDunt piece says.If you voted Leave & Tory & work in the food/agri-sector, you've a lot of waking up to do
BREXITEER MP Kwasi Kwarteng demolished calls for a #Brexit re-run, branding calls for a second referendum on the final deal with the EU "patronising" and "not very helpful to democracy."
"I don't think it means absolutely no sandwichs..." - well that's a relief #Brexit #BrexitShambles
She said Shankar Singham and the #IEA are the brains of #Brexit ⁦@BBCNewsnight⁩
Well done @maitlis for holding @MarcusFysh to account re #brexit what a total waste of political space he is - more interviewing like this pls #bbc to expose the lie that is Brexit and the machinations of this Govt.
Very worrying indeed!The longer May continues as self-appointed negotiator in chief in the #Brexit talks, the more Tory poll ratings will slump and the bigger the gain there will be for Corbyn and McDonnellIn other words, lose-lose for all but the Marxists 
Blimey @MarcusFysh  MP on #newsnight, simply won't recognise reality, For him #brexit is a religion and reason is irrelevant. Aimed at @theresa_may  mostly, Tory war continues unabated
Hi! you can read it here: Thread by @PeteNorth303: "1. So what does the IEAtapes scandal tell us about Brexit, specifically the ERG? Well this goes right back and it touche […]" #IEAtapes #Brexit Talk to you soon. 
The so called people’s vote are demanding a 3 option 2nd EU ref! Brexit is split across 2 options & remain just 1. It is clear they want to destroy UK democracy & force us to remain in EU against our will.  Collaborators and anti-democrats will stop at nothing to prevent #Brexit.

The UK is trying to replace the EU with the Commonwealth after #Brexit. Will it work? 
Thanks, @GerardBattenMEP for reminding me about @walkers_crisps. After reading your tweet I went out and bought some. Incidentally @GaryLineker is doing an excellent job: 1. In promoting them and 2. In pointing out the sheer lunacy of #Brexit 
You couldn't make it up Oh wait.#brexit@CadburyUK
This is an astonishing display by @SkyNews of which Goebbels would be proud. Truly astonishing, brazen abuse of reality. #BREXIT

“Parliament has let down the nation..they are a miserable lot,gripped by a religion, can’t stop believing in it.They've managed to convince themselves they are entitled in a strange way to thwart #Brexit."- the formerly very pro-EU Lord Owen.Hits the nail on the head? 
When #ProjectFear decide that their fear tactics need to be more realistic #Brexit 
Deutsche Bank moves half of its Euro clearing from London to Frankfurt. Only a few hundred jobs will be lost, but if London loses its Euro clearing status it could loose up to 100k jobs which would be an economic disaster. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

Because it's a vote on the final deal  Mr Morgan @piersmorgan you halfwit. A chance for everyone, even you, to tell the government whether you agree with the deal or not. Do you deny the people the right to respond to the inadequate way the government is handling #Brexit ?

Hi @BBCNews, i and many other people have noticed that not one of your #bbcnews outlets has mentioned the massive #Brexit poll commissioned by @SkyData, the one that shows a massive swing to remain and a #PeoplesVote, ppl now see the disaster of no deal, when will you? #SkyNews

Thankful for @Andrew_Adonis raising the deteriorating state of NI under DUP and Tories- most importantly recognising that opposition to Brexit is cross-community. Also re-iterates what Alliance have consistently calling for- An independent mediator to facilitate talks #Brexit 
I see . @SkyNews are still conning people on a poll of 1466 Sky viewers that 2/3 of Brits have changed their minds about #brexit ........ trying to con the and scare the less savvy ..... its getting ridiculous now ..... maybe . @Ofcom should step in .....

9th September 2014 - @martin_compston absolutely nails what would occur two years later regarding #Brexit.(I won't be uploading this to my YouTube channel btw, as it would probably only take the Beeb five minutes to censor it with a DMCA notice...) 
#Remoaners using the same old economic fearmongering to scare us away from #NoDeal have failed to learn the fundamental lesson of the 2016 referendum.  #Brexit is about sovereignty; #Britain's ability to determine its own future & to tread its own path. No prize is greater! 
What elements of #EU law is the UK keeping after #Brexit? Who can change this law in the future and how? Watch our Constitutional Law Researcher, Graeme Cowie, explain what you need to know and read our brand new briefing for more detail 
Hope to be on @Channel4News & @SkyNewsBreak this evening to discuss the Government's "plans" to stockpile vital medicines for a no-deal #Brexit (impossible) & poll showing big shift in favour of #PeoplesVote & staying in EU. Don't think @BBCNews has mentioned either story. Hmmm.
Are you fed up with remoaners labelling anyone with a different opinion to them as xenophobic or racist. Well did you know Godfrey Bloom is married to a Pole. Gerrard Batten is married to a Philipino, Nigel Farage to. German, Aron Banks to a Russian #BREXIT pic.twitter.com/L4BtUoQHyt

Staying tied to the EU after #Brexit is like the United States having Jim Crow laws after the abolition of slaveryNO to slavery under another nameYES to #nodeal Brexit
It's disgraceful that @UKLabour are pushing forward with #Brexit knowing that there is not a single version of brexit that is beneficial for our nation.You've been warned time and again that it will disproportionately impact the most marginalised in society.
Cardiff don't miss out on joining us to rally for a #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal on 8th September: 
It is now absolutely clear that there is a large majority against #Brexit, and in favour of a #PeoplesVote. If Brexit is pushed through against majority opinion there could be some very harsh retribution against Brexit politicians#StopBrexit

Wait a minute. How do illegal immigrants get citizenship!Also quite ironic for a country that quit EU over immigration!#BREXIT
Our politicians are bought, our press is not free, votes are undermined by cheating & law-breaking, we live in a faux democracy & those in positions of power are either in it up to their necks or frozen to the spot, unable to stand up for those who get shafted every day.#Brexit
Lack of confidence suggests a #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal is the only way forward. Clear the public need to be given control of the final deal 
And those investigations uncovered exactly how #LeaveEU and #VoteLeave won "unexpectedly". They broke the law, pumped £600,000 illegally into illegal social media adverts, even ignoring the 3 day moratorium due to the murder of Jo Cox. That's how they won "unexpectedly". #Brexit

Here is the feedback from Saturday. People in #Slough back a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit . @TanDhesi are you going to represent the views of your constituents in parliament? cc @Labour4EU @labour4europe
Labour peer Lord Mandelson says the government's #Brexit negotiations are "a shambles" - and the only way to give legitimacy to the final deal is to put it to a public vote 
At our hotel in Belfast @susanmcolton  asked for a Map of Ireland. This is what she was given. ‘Have you not got the whole thing?’ asks she. ‘Oh no!’ says he. #hardbrexit #brexit 
In what way did the British public change its mind over #Brexit?Head of @SkyData @HarrydCarr says we've seen a "big change" in how people perceive the way the government is negotiating an exit from the EU.Read the full story here: 
Like the storms that broke the heat wave, I think public opinion is turning against #Brexit for three reasons1/ Brexiteers have no plans for the future2/ Russia Bots, Cambridge Analytica etc all muted3/ The volume of criminality and corruption around the vote is being exposed
Britain has changed its mind on #Brexit - but what are the implications for @Theresa_May?Head of @SkyData @HarrydCarr says they are "quite profound".Read the full story here: 
A new Sky Data poll has shown that 78% of the UK public think the government is doing a bad job negotiating a #Brexit deal 
This is the real FOREIGN INTERFERENCE in our democratic process. When leaders & elected representatives of major UK parties such as @GerardBattenMEP are “shadow banned” & have their account/voice restricted by US Corporates such as Twitter?Time to chose #NWO or #BRexit & freedom
1. Time 4 those MPs who've sat on their supine arses or backed this farce to get off them.#Brexit's failed before it's happened. A majority no longer want it...only a #PeoplesVote can validate the end game.We must have the #FinalSay with a #Remain option.
Just spoken on the BBC Radio Sheff phone in about @MagicMagid to sing his praises - he's helping to engage the youth in the political debate! Unlike the Tory government who are putting off a generation of kids by destroying the country over something 18-24s didn't want! #Brexit

Bank's £1 trillion business leave London because of #Brexit. Up to 100,000 jobs to go too. The Brexiteer response when 'project fear' not only turns out to be accurate, but worse than we thought? Dig in, double down, head in the sand. #Brexit 
Public mood continues to shift against #Brexit& #Remain has clear lead.The numbers are now reaching point where supporting a #peoplesvote should be considered as a career saver by May or Corbyn.It vindicates @vincecable 's call for an #ExitFromBrexit

I'm sick of putting any @BBCNews output on and being confronted by shadowy figures from right wing think tanks, if it's not taxpayers alliance its the IEA, they get a free pass day in day out to promote #Brexit and austerity again unchallenged, it's nauseous #r4today
more and more people are now calling for a #PeoplesVote at the end of the #Brexit process - good to see - this is what "taking back control" is really all about - giving the people the right to frame their futures. 
If the majority vote counts for nothing then our social contract is voided too. There is anarchy in the air. Hold the line for #BREXIT 
Italy’s deputy prime minister has accused the EU of trying to “swindle” Britain out of #BrexitSalvini has urged @Theresa_May to adopt a tougher stance...“My experience in the European parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you.”
Btw, even in 2014, Scotland never faced the prospect of stockpiling food & medicine if Independence won. The EU have now said they will trade with us. Just a reminder to Scots who hate Brexit but are still wavering over Independence. #indyref2 #Brexit #YouYesYet
Just look at this, only 10% think the Tories are doing a good job managing #Brexit. The inevitable disaster if the Tories carry on is obvious to pretty much everyone now. May’s choices are carry on towards disaster or reset with a General Election.#ge2018
It’s Monday.And following my pillow tweet it is clear that #Brexit fanatics don’t give a toss about how much it costs. Even if it cripples others. Missing the point completely, they accuse Remainers of worrying only about money. So wrong, we care for our country & compatriots.
Will #Brexit be good or bad for you personally? 31% say it will be good, up from 29% in March.42% say it will be bad, up from 36% in March.18% say neither, down from 26% in March.Read more: Source: @SkyData

Aren't the Tories making a complete mess of #brexit , its a good job that this is not Labour making all this mess, it would be on the news morning, noon and night #BrexitShambles
So. Will the government get a good deal on #Brexit?Our new @SkyData poll finds 14% say yes, down from 26% in March.65% say it will be a bad deal, up from 50% in March.
Wow! A damming conclusion on #Brexit. Not ONE answer in favour of it. Poll after poll after poll, support for a final say & remaining in the #EU grows. Pls like & RT to show @theresa_may & @jeremycorbyn that the country wants & needs a #PeoplesVote

Farmers fear crops will rot in fields unless government releases details of how seasonal workers will be able to work in UK post #Brexit. Just 0.6% of 86,000 seasonal workers are British.

I said this 9 months ago, but worth repeating again. There are those who know a lot about Mercer/Putin and the dark foreign money behind #Brexit. Some have come forward and their lives are better. It's not too late to do the right thing. But you're running out of time.

Seriously, bro, STAY DOWN!Poll methodology is BROKEN!Only 10% of the public answers poll callers, and it's been proven that many don't answer correctly.Poll credibility was LOST with #Brexit and Trump in 2016. It will never recover.GIVE IT UP! 
Rightwing thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs has a new digital manager.And guess what?It's Darren Grimes of BeLeave/Vote Leave, who committed serious breaches of electoral law during the #Brexit campaign.Small world, the #BrexitSyndicate.

Another devastating #Brexit concession disclosed on the front of tomorrow’s @thetimes UK citizens living in the EU will have to abide by ECJ rulings on their rights, but EU citizens will avoid UK courtsThis breaks a key component of May’s manifesto & Lancaster House speech
Frank Field is a man of principle - unsurprisingly there is no place for such a man in the Corbyn led Labour Party @frankfieldteam @labour #Brexit 
Institute of Economic Affairs offered a potential US agribusiness donor the chance to influence a report on Michael Gove's "green #Brexit" - and maybe dinner with Gove.Thus is our democracy & our environment bought, sold & trashed.
I know there are some people in the EU who would find it "funny" if brexit leads to chaos or just don't care what happens to the UK. But there is nothing worse that can happen to us than a proud and important neighbour being devastated and looking for any way to survive. #brexit
A "no-deal brexit" is a genuinely apocalyptic situation for the UK (and most probably the end of the UK as we know it). Just read about the consequences the food sector will have to sustain and you know what I mean:  #brexit #brexocalpyse

1: Jacob Rees-Mogg's father's notion of the 'Sovereign Individual'. 2: Charles Tannock MEP reporting on the extreme ambitions of the Tory Brextremists. It would seem that the Brextremists are seeking to carry out the program outlined by William Rees-Mogg.#Brexit #StopBrexit
We should have demolished all the #Brexit lies by now, says @Jon_Danzig in his wake-up call to the #Remain movement. We’ve squandered two years since the #EUReferendum by not tackling head-on the lies that led to Brexit winning. Please share his blog.

Rightwing UK thinktank 'offered ministerial access' to potential US donorsSaid they were in ‘the #Brexit game’Shocking By @Robert_Booth
A no-deal would surely result in a state of emergency which could include the 'temporary' curtailment of many civil & political rights, and the introduction of detention without trial to save the courts from the huge new workload caused by the new offences.#StopBrexit #Brexit
All Conservative & other MP’s/ Parliament need to stop it in that case. If this is known, then there needs to be action. To not act is to be complicit in what happens to this country & it’s people. It is time for a vote of no confidence. #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #Brexit 
Surely we should be able to agree that if the government is considering civil contingency plans as a result of their policy then they need to change their policy? An EEA Efta #Brexit would avoid the chaos and nobody need be put at risk.
You wait for ages for a #Brexit bus then about a hundred turn up at once. 
Well it's like this see. Nothing is more dear to me than my insulin dependent nephew, so either I believe the EU notices to stakeholders or take the word of a pack of cousin marrying Toryboy mouthbreathers who six months ago didn't even know what a non tariff barrier was.#Brexit

I think Sarah Vine ought to look at the paper she works for, which is undoubtedly the biggest source of fake news, as well as fascist hate and bile, in the UK. She might also want to enlighten us about her husband's chat with Steve Bannon.#brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Who’s approach to #brexit to you support the most? #bbcnews
Lots of recent scaremongering re insulin supplies drying up on a #Brexit no deal. So it's somewhat reassuring that 8 out of 12 products approved by NICE, are from co's OUTSIDE the EU + a spokeswoman from Danish Novo Nordisk (1 more) has assured no change.
We won't tell you how bad it's going to be. Ignore rumours of stockpiling food & medicine. We don't want to panic you so we'll keep you in the dark. If you knew how bad it'll be you'd want to call off #Brexit, & we can't have that. Keep believing No Deal is better than a Bad Deal
Don’t Panic! If through EU perfidy we “crash out” of the Bankers Club in March, we have been there before. In fact it was our finest hour. Britain can and will be an independent country. If we run out of Brie we can always eat cheddar. Let’s have confidence in ourselves #Brexit
.@oliverjamesking gets called out spreading fake news for #Brexit #ProjectFear. He is shown up, and this is his response. 
Britain truly has some of the best in the world.If we can't do well outside the iron grip of EU, its laws, its customs rules, its courts;if Britain can't succeed as an independent nation, who can?#Brexit 
.@BorisJohnson said #Brexit would mean we could have our cake and eat it. He didn't say the cake would have to be stockpiled and delivered by the army. Let's have a #PeoplesVote on the final deal.
My friend @VetDannii brilliantly taking @Nigel_Farage to task for his absolute nonsense. He wasn't aware that the veterinary profession is reliant on EU Nationals, especially in food production and public health roles. This affects food security. He is left speechless. #Brexit 
#Remember the referendum when we were told #Brexit was 'going to be wonderful', with 'no downside' because 'we hold all the cards'.Now we're talking about stockpiling #food.If Brexit was a #new make of #car it would feature on Watchdog every week. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit

Are you saying, I didn't campaign properly b/c I travelled to 22 cities and towns in 30 days to speak for Remain at the age of 93. What did you do again? #Brexit 
By deciding not to publish information about plans for a no-deal #Brexit the government is once again attacking our democracy. How can people make democratic decisions if they are denied access to such vital information? We are ruled by enemies of democracy.#StopBrexit #FBPE

Brussels Big Stick diplomacy!“British people voted to Leave & now #EU waves a big stick at us!We need to Leave under terms we voted on; to take back control of our borders,waters,finances & lawsThe people voted to Leave; this is NON-Negotiable!”#Brexit
PM's Office says ECJ control over Britain after #Brexit is because "this is how trading relationships work."WRONG! No sovereign nation allows a foreign court to adjudicate on its matters. This govt is turning Britain into a vassal state of the EU. 
Clear risks of a botched #Brexit. We need a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal to let the public decide their future 
Sorry to say Brits, but you have an evil government.It looks like they’re punishing you for #Brexit, by giving you what you don’t want, and don’t need. 
This is a disgrace. The Government is now actively conspiring to withhold from the public the truth about #Brexit #Brexitshambles for fear it will encourage people to change their minds.
It's very simple John.All those supporting #Brexit have beel labelled "extremists" for wanting govt to deliver what we voted for.'Moderates' don't exist, because we are not permitted to *be* moderate, such is the quagmire of spin & lies we face from Remoaners in govt & media. 
Many people are not so fortunate to be able to chose to leave. Many may wish they could but can't, and others don't want to leave their homes. But #Brexit has affected our lives in one way or another making us rethink our life plans.
Two main parties represent over 80% of the electorate. One cultivates Anti Semitism & changes #Brexit views to suit opinion.The other couldn’t lead her way out of a paper bag & manipulates the electorate to suit her true anti #Brexit views.No wonder people dislike politics 
All this daft talk about #Brexit giving you the clap, then I just remembered this... #WeGotItCovered 
The Sunday Times is reporting that the tories have abandoned their weekly updates on what a no deal #Brexit means, they know its going to be a disaster, so they are going to hide the facts from us, @Conservatives are duplicitous bastards, we need #PeoplesVote, come on folks.
I’m not sure how much clearer the message could be All moves for a second referendum or #Brexit in name only are anti democratic, as clear as dayWe must deliver on Lancaster House & our manifestoAny betrayal will lead to a crisis of democracy 
Even Farage acknowledges we probably cannot feed ourselves just like when we needed convoys in the first & second world wars. To have food from outside the UK we will have to have a trade deal in place won't we? Remind me how long does a trade deal take?No #Brexit#PeoplesVote
#brexit didn't happen over night it took 30 years of neoliberalism, de-industrialisation, the erosion of the welfare state, political indifference by the working class and a rabid consumerism that has replaced individual spiritual purpose. 
Thanks for your input, but that’s not what Workhardt, a huge manufacturer of insulin in the UK, and a major supplier to the NHS, says about its European hub in Wrexham. Find another #Brexit story to scare people with, #ProjectFear!
Of course we mustn't panic the Ppl into realising that this #BrexitShambles is a total disaster & that politicians & charlatans deceived them, lied & cheated; mean to say they might start wanting a #FinalSay which might mean their #Brexit coup will fail.#PeoplesVote #Remain.
It's clear the government have locked down the BBC. They have control of most of the press.Post #Brexit just what will happen. Will we see fair and free elections again?Will our politicians be held to account for lying?This is bad, very bad. #FBPE
you're really gonna try and tell us this is what you voted for, #Brexit fans? really?
Fishing has played a big part in pro-#Brexit propaganda, in #Cornwall & elsewhere.But it's misleading to blame the EU for the problems of fishermen - and Brexit will make life much more difficult for an industry that exports most of its catch to the EU.
The simple fact is Theresa May's govt is no longer functioning b/c of their no deal #Brexit stance. So we need another general election now, not another referendum.
When you peel the onion back, you find #Russia #Facebook and #Trump behind #BrexitThis is very scary and yet Donald Trump does NOTHING to stop #Putin from attacking our Democracy!  The truth about fake news, Facebook and Brexit
Whenever someone mentions WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement as part of the solution to solve #Brexit border problems, I'm not sure whether to laugh or cry. Have they read it? Do they know the context of who/what it was aimed at? Or why UK-EU borders are actually frictionless?
Brexiters wail that the EU is pushing us towards a no-deal. They said we held all the cards. They boasted that an independent Britain would sail away from a sinking EU. We warned them this was drivel. They yelled "Project Fear!". They lied to the British people.#Brexit #FBPE

Those who think that the UK can "fall back" on WTO rules for international trade after #Brexit should read this thread from Bloomberg's WTO correspondent. There is not an agreed UK/EU approach and a prolonged trade dispute around the approach to be taken is quite likely. 
When they said 'Take Back Control' - they missed the point about the army controlling the streets...#Brexit in any form is a disaster. No Deal is a catastrophe. It must not be an option in a #PeoplesVote. It must be ruled out.

Funny how many of those currently criticising the BBC's coverage of #Brexit and #VoteLeave were happy to mock Corbynites when we had similar complaints about the BBC's coverage of Corbyn.
@BBCNews will have a lot to answer for when the #brexit inquest takes place. They've given over the stage to liars, fantasists, crooks & clowns without so much as a challenge. They're still at it.
I voted Remain and was devastated at the result but this is clearly OTT scaremongering. The entire world (less 28 countries) exists outside of the EU and can function perfectly well without military aid. #FakeNews #TimeForTruth #Brexit #Eu #WTO
The UK opted out of Schengen and the Euro, gets a huge rebate and we've enjoyed all the benefits of being in the EU for 40 years. Our children and grand-children will be denied the rights to study, work and settle anywhere in the EU. What are the benefits of #Brexit for them?
When there is a threat of the country running out of food and medicine, and people still support #brexit then it only further confirms this to be true. #brexit is not the will of the people. It is the conditioning of people to believe it is their will. #StopBrexit #peoplesvote
Just awful, awful human beings. #Brexit
I'm ashamed of what the Labour Party has become. Frank Field is one of the great politicians in British politics, he is dedicated, hard working and, because he votes for #Brexit, he is persecuted by the party he has served for 40 yrs. @UKLabourShame
"HOW EU AGRICULTURAL PROTECTIONISM PROTECTS ITALIAN, FRENCH,AND SPANISH FARMERS" - The EU looks after its own, and its own doesn't include the UK. Damning #Brexit example here: 
"WHERE'S BRITISH INFLUENCE? - 2 unelected men from Brussels hold 2-day EU-China Summit."  And no, Remainer MPs, you can't hold them to account in the Commons. A must-read #Brexit original: 
"Just think for a moment what a prospect that is. A single market without barrier, giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world's wealthiest and most prosperous people." M. Thatcher, 1988  #Brexit

1) Jeremy Corbyn rebelled over 500 times since 1997. 2) Jeremy Corbyn apparently marched with rival parties against Labour and called for an uprising against British troops.3) Jeremy Corbyn would have been voting with Field and Hoey if he wasn't the leader.#Brexit

Dear #FBPE, one of the fears of the #brexit campaign is that we get organized and act as one. That is why this troll is attacking the #FBPE group.  We wouldn't get this unless they saw it as a threat to them. That means we have something. Let's use it.

#Labour MP Frank Field - “It would have been a betrayal of the principles I have held for my entire political life, had I voted against the #Brexit legislation two weeks ago.” 
Join us in Newcastle on August 25th for a rally to demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal 
My guess here is that @BBCNews won't admit that #VoteLeave broke the law until people are physically arrested, charged and found guilty in Court. So, just now they're only prepared to use the word 'allegations'. I'm in no way defending them because #VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw#Brexit
Through the dark clouds of the EU a WTO #BREXIT is brewing. The future's bright, the future's #WTO
Thank you for your voice @DJJY  #BREXIT
#Brexiteer hero Labour MP Frank Field hits out at his local party after losing no-confidence vote over #Brexit He has put principle above career, unlike Leavers in CabinetYet more evidence that Labour have abandoned the working classes outside London
Thank you very much. And to all my former haters, now supporters. Welcome all. We #standstrong together x  #brexit
Starving, syphilitic & sugared into a deep vegetative state, they crawled towards their deaths with bleeding fingernails and shredded nipples all. #BREXIT 
The #VoteLeave #Brexit campaign been evidenced to have been a criminal conspiracy backed by dark money and the #AltRight....orchestrated by a lot of posh boys...backed by the Daily Mail...notice the similarity.
#Brexit is not ‘the will of the people’. According to latest @YouGov poll, a majority in #Britain now want another referendum. And if there is another referendum, a majority would vote to reverse Brexit. Share @Jon_Danzig’s commentary. Link:  #StopBrexit
The clue is in the picture.I believed her #Brexit means Brexit lies.The truth is: She is a remainer.  Olly Robbins is a remainer. She asked Olly Robbins to draw up the #ChequersPlan behind the Brexit departments back She does not believe in Brexit#MAYMUSTGO
Da iawn i chi gyd! Well done to you all!Fantastic turnout today in Llanelli for the launch of #CarmarthenshireForEurope #Brexit #FBPE
Steve Bannon - Trump’s chief strategist in 2016 election - now in close liaison with Farage, Johnson, Gove & Rees-Mogg in anti-EU campaign... One might almost think the two things might be related. #Brexit #voteleavebrokethelaw
Extend to Pretend!Liam Fox: The public told us to leave the EUThe public already wonders why it's taking more than 4 years after referendum to fully remove ourselves from #EUTo attempt to extend our membership even longer is a complete betrayal.#Brexit
If Barnier and Juncker don’t like the UK's #Brexit proposal and insist on continuing to punish us then they leave us with no choice. No-deal is the only logical next step. 
Nadine Dorries MP - "There is a definite sway and a definite global move towards the right. A global move towards being eurosceptic.“Because the EU has served well Germany and a small number of countries. But there are others who have paid prices." #Brexit 
It is perfectly clear, the Establishment are STILL deaf to us, the little people. There is talk of delaying article 50. A second referendum is on the cards. And we now know Theresa May is Angela Merkel, a slightly less offensive wig.... #Brexit 
Project Fear Round-up: Planes won't fly, everyone will be force-fed chlorinated chicken (but not on sandwiches, which will disappear), and we'll all get the clap. #Brexit

WILL OF THE PEOPLE: More than 300,000 ppl back The Independent's campaign for a #PeoplesVote on govt's #Brexit deal 
Absolutely spot on by @Arron_banks civil servants, some media/journalists and establishment pursuing him and others #Brexiteers as vendetta for backing #Brexit with false allegations, spurious claims to overturn it and ensure others don't support it  
The sky will cave in, volcanoes will erupt and their will be a tsunami after #Brexit unless we remain the the #EU#GuessProjectFear
We've got to the bit in the fairy tale where even the most deluded members of the crowd start realising that the little boy is right.Emperor #Brexit has no clothes.The question is, what happens next?#PeoplesVote
British farmers say a no-deal #brexit would be an "Armageddon scenario"Let's be blunt. A no-deal #Brexit would be little short of an act of war against the British people by a tiny minority craving a #BrexitTaxHaven.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
We are uniting the north for the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference! We are delighted to add Julie Ward @julie4nw, MEP for North West England, who joins previously announced speakers from Yorkshire & The Humber (@RCorbettMEP) and NE England (@Jude_KD).  pic.twitter.com/KLwfcQbGwI
We are being sold down Brexit river How come 5th column of politicians & civil servantswholly living off our taxes,dependent for every mouthful of food& the roofs over their heads on our money,are allowed to work night & day to deprive us of #Brexit? 
Bannon in contact with Rees-Mogg, Gove and Johnson. Bannon is the top link man between the kleptocrats and the fascists and racists who in the form of a Kleptonationalist axis are, in alliance with Putin, trying to destroy our democracies.  #brexit #FBPE
A *lot* of people wanted to express their views on our #Brexitometer in #Falmouth today.Only *one* person thought #Brexit was going well.And the vast majority thought there should be a #PeoplesVote on any final #Brexit deal.Are you listening to your constituents, @SNewtonUK?
Bannon -> Breitbart -> Cambridge Analytica -> Jacob Rees Mogg -> Boris Johnson and now -> Michael Gove The Alt Reich are showing their hand. The same lawless undemocratic tendencies running all the way through #Trump #Russia #Brexit. 
We love running our #Brexitometer stalls in #Cornwall - so much enthusiasm from the public for what we're doing - and *massive* support for a #PeoplesVote on any final #Brexit deal.Thanks to the many people in #Falmouth who took part today, despite the torrential downpour!
Majority of voters back 2nd #Brexit ref for the first time  
I can stomach a party in power that I didn't want or vote for, I only have to wait 5 yrs to have a go at voting them out again.Meanwhile I can rely on HM Opposition to keep the government on their toes. However #Brexit is for life, & there is NO FUCKING OPPOSITION! #PeoplesVote
If you’re a Labour voting Brexiteer and you’re in any doubt of your party’s position This rounding up of hardworking MPs, who simply followed their party’s manifesto and the #Brexit referendum result, is disgraceful @JohnMannMP will be next 
Theresa May is not a put-upon moderate. Everything about her political record marks her out as an authoritarian nationalist who regards democracy, human rights and the rule of law as barely tolerable impediments to carrying out government policy. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
Really have a problem with snobbery & condescension shown to Gary Lineker & others for "daring" to comment on Brexit. No offence but these intellectual snobs could learn a thing or two from him. Brexit is a crime against the working class, not a noble act to help them #BREXIT
The referendum was advisory and MPs are representatives whose duty is to use their judgement for the good of the country, not delegates who must obey voters.It is high time that the many MPs who know #Brexit is harmful to the country started doing their duty.#StopBrexit
Gerard Batten: If you are 1 of 17.4 million people who voted Leave, you should feel rightly betrayed.#Ukip fought for 25 years to be where we are today.We fought for the referendum.We won the referendum.We NOW have to win the result...#Brexit #EU
The shambolic £11billion smart meter rollout was inspired by a 2006 EU directive:  #Brexit
Brexit will bring down food prices for UK consumers.When we Leave EU, we Leave the Common External Tariff.And that, in simple terms, is why food gets cheaper!Lord Price: “The EU has pretty penal tariffs on food, to protect European farmers”.#Brexit #EU
When you wake up to read the latest No.10 #ProjectFear #Brexit story.They have officially become a parody of themselves. No medicineSTI’s (super ones)No sandwichesNo cheese or DairyHow on earth do America, Canada, Japan, and all the other Non #EU countries cope?
Tory MP on #LBC: 'We always knew Brexit was going to be difficult.'Er, those of us with memories longer than a goldfish remember being told it would be the easiest deal in history. #Brexit
There you go, it's the #EU that could have a medical crisis after #Brexit and not the #UK.  No. 10 and #ProjectFear really aren't doing to well with this orchestrated attempt at fear are they? It's going as well as the #ChequersPlan 
Millions of patients could be affected by 'no-deal' Brexit medicines shortages, says MHRA chair Sir Michael Rawlins.#NHS #NHS70 #Brexit
There’s fake news, electoral fraud, rule-breaking. All ‘Cheating’.  Whether you voted #Remain or #Leave, don’t let the privileged British establishment duck the blame for their mess. Demand a vote on whether to accept or reject their poor deal/no deal #Brexit. 
I didn't have a fucking clue what the Customs Union meant, or understand the complexities of the Single Market. I didn't know I was voting to prevent food & medicine stockpiling.Neither the fuck did you.#Brexit is a fucking disaster, you didn't vote for that.#PeoplesVote
They're springing up everywhere!Yet another #Petition for a vote on the actual  #brexit deal:   via @UKChange
Jackson , I know you regard yourself as a humorist but as Tory Deputy Leader in Scotland could you offer some practical advice to a country that voted against #Brexit (as you did to be fair) but is now told that we must stockpile medicines (& lots of other things) 
Millions of patients on #insulin and other vital medicines could be harmed in case of a 'no deal' #Brexit #NHS70 
Oh the government are worried about the spread of #fakenews and are trying to clamp down on it. No they're not, they are worried that the internet has allowed the public to see beyond their lies. #Brexit wasn't supposed to win. They want us mushroomed. In the dark and fed shit.
The sheer brokenness of Remainers wanting second and third goes at a #brexit referendum when they lost the one that mattered, despite Remain having had all the support of the modern media/establishment & all its spivvish, Blairite hangers-on #LeaveMeansLeave
NOTE to the PMTheresa , I *get* that you've a lot on your plate just now- what with #Brexit an' all - and a disobedient dysfunctional Cabinet doesn't helpBut what happened to those *burning injustices* you were going to tackle ?Are they still on your *to do* list ?#JustAskin
Oh, but this is peachy...   Your actual French. #brexit 
I don’t think #Brexit can be better defined. 
"WHAT DID THE EU OFFER THERESA BACK IN MARCH?" A #Brexit Facts4EU summary of Tusk's zero-tariff trade deal offer, which she has ignored: 
The #Leeds for Europe team will be out in Briggate today from 12.30pm. Find out more about the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference & our many other actions over the next few weeks. See you later! 
"EU PARLIAMENT REITERATES ITS VETO ON #BREXIT DEAL" Summary of what MEPs said yesterday.  Important for this to be reported.  Read it here:
It represented the best of us, confident, optimistic, outward looking. A sharp contrast with today, #Brexit represents the worst of us, a retreat to a narrow view of the world, suspicious, spiteful and closed. We are better than this! 
You asked us to factcheck this graphic - it's based on DExEU analysis which explicitly said it could not be made into forecasts.Even ignoring this, many of the figures are still incorrect.  #Brexit #EU
May's taken control of the #Brexit negotiations. She's attempted to bypass #Barnier by going behind his back with her infantile Chequers plan. Heads of the #EU countries have rejected her direct overtures. What did she expect, to divide and conquer. She really is very naive.
“The excitement they experience when they murder an unarmed animal is  entirely due to their deep feelings of inadequacy and impotence in ordinary life. " - John Cleese. #trophyhunting #bullfighting #foxhunting #brexit #animalcruelty #yulin
I was never good at languages in school. Can any French speakers or those schooled in the language tell me what this says? Do it sound good? We are really hoping for some good news over here #Brexit #EU #Brexitdeal
This is really annoying. Britain does the most damaging thing possible to Ireland & when we defend our position & way of life, London "isn't happy with Dublin." It's as if they don't think we have a right to exist #brexit arrogance 
No UK prime minister has visited Africa since 2013. In contrast Macron has visited Africa nine times. UK believes it will "form trading links with the Commonwealth post #Brexit".I can't see how UK can compete against EU on this continent.
So Darren Grimes' crowdfunding video isn't hosted under his own YouTube account. It's among the videos created by recent Guido appointee Tom Harwood.#brexit

The whole point of May's strategy is that she IS wasting time. She is just following orders, to run things down with no agreement, so we crash out with the hardest possible #Brexit. Mogg and his scum chums will make millions. We will suffer.
A tiny band of Hard Brexiters have exploited May’s weakness and are bullying her to a No Deal #Brexit. The hard right have always wanted that. No one was ever going to vote for an ultra free chaos market economy. So they’re engineering a coup to get one. 
We must not normalise what this sham govt are doing. They are caught in dangerous tunnel vision, desperately clinging to power no matter the consequence to the people of this country. #Brexit #voteleavebrokethelaw
Dear @theresa_may / @MattHancock Curious to know whether the inquiry into why >20,000* excess deaths occurred from Jan - April 2018 - has begun? Whilst govt talks of “stockpiling medicines” perhaps understanding this first might be helpful, to avoid more catastrophe.#Brexit pic.twitter.com/liY4865ywt
The Tory Brexiters appear psychologically incapable of understanding that the EU27 countries value group cooperation and solidarity, and that the EU is a rule-based, not a make it up as you go along, organisation. #Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
The EU is incapable of negotiating a beneficial #Brexit for both itself a federal bloc & a sovereign UK for fear of setting a precedent, it craves power not a deal. The sooner Mrs.May realises this the better. Nation-state sovereignty is considered far right within EU circles. 
How our democratic norms die. Tonite on #bbcaq Chloe Westley of secretively funded Taxpayers Alliance. She ran social media for Vote Leave churning out Facebook dark ads in #Brexit campaign. What sort of thinking in BBC puts such people on a programme? 
Tory MP"I have been around my constituency asking people what they think of [the #Brexit white paper]... To them, it just doesn’t pass the sniff test...of this being a proper Brexit. We remain attached to too many vestiges of the EU"

According to this article, if a country leaves the EU, the EU should make sure that the leaving country keeps all the benefits of staying, but without the costs. The EU should also compromise on of its 4 freedoms#brexit #brexitshambles #brexitlies

Join us on 11th August in Bristol to rally for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Don't miss out, register now: 
#Brexit looks like a great success so far. Our next step in exterminating humanity will be a referendum where the US votes to leave Earth (because Earth doesn't treat them fairly).
It is a great honour to welcome @theresa_may in #Salzburg for the festival. In our bilateral meeting we discussed the excellent relations btw the #UK & #Austria, #BREXIT and the AT EU Presidency @EU2018AT.
I am gratified to see that the Committee has ignored a concentrated attempt to make its focus on the subversion of the #Brexit referendum be about spending or other ephemeral matters. Report mentions these but goes straight for Russia’s throat on #Brexit AND US elections.
Brexit is a mistake and we all know it #brexit #blunder
Who said @UKLabour was listening to its #Brexit voters? 
Honoured to be in Santiago de Compostela, forging closer links between #Wales & #Galicia. Our new relationship comes at an enormously important time as we prepare to leave the EU. The people of Europe are our valued friends and will continue to be after #Brexit. 
At present some cocoa products from Africa are subject to punitive tariffs of 60% and some canned fruit 146%Doing away with these tariffs would not only mean cheaper fruit and chocolate, it would hugely help farmers in the developing world. #Brexit

If the #Brexit bus was around today.....#MAYMUSTGO#ChequersMeansCorbyn
Economist Andrea Hossó - "The last deal that we saw is sort of a #Brexit in name only kind of arrangement. So, those who voted to leave are quite unhappy about it and I think with reason." 
Yes @Jacob_Rees_Mogg it would mean the failure of the treasonous scheme to throw the British people off the no-deal cliff, producing great profit opportunities for disaster capitalists, and forcing a desperate UK to become a tax haven to attract business. #Brexit #StopBrexit
So, does @LoveIsland's Hayley finally understand #Brexit? 
The government’s plans for a #Brexit “Settled Status” for EU #Citizens in #Britain is unlikely to work smoothly and will hurt the most vulnerable ones:
Important to understand Crux of #Brexit is that #UK voted in #EUref for the #MagnaCarta narrative identity it shares with #CANZUK, NOT #EU’s Charlemagnian alternative. It was a choice between two possible futures. #Leave won & #Remain lost. It’s time to #RespectTheResult #ukpoli

Another Tory helping out a law breaker and, like Baker, Mogg and of course Trump, undermining the institutions which ground our democracy. Remember the Tory rage at the Article 50 court case. The law is the basis of democracy, these MPs are its enemies. #Brexit #StopBrexit
Q. Why do the Tories keep on backing failed privatisations of public services?A. Because Tory ideology is religiously based on the extreme free-market economics of Hayek & Friedman.Even financial crisis couldn’t change their minds. Prepare for more privatisation after #Brexit
There’s a simple and obvious answer to this: #EEA + a customs union. Crystal clear that an EEA-based #Brexit has always been the only viable alternative to crashing out with no deal (as I’ve been saying for about two years!). Time to get real.

If a majority now want a 2nd EU referendum why are we not being allowed one? The UK is supposed to be a democracy, so why are we being forced to accept #Brexit by a handful of the Tory right wing? @theresa_may
May and her Ministers trolling round EU capitals are trying to apply an established Tory domestic policy to #Brexit: Divide and Rule.But it's unlikely to work because the 27 aren't going to see the Single Market undermined in order to save May's Premiership. #bbcnews
Whether you voted Remain or voted Leave... would you want a #FinalSay on the #Brexit deal?  
Kate Hoey and Frank Field. 2 MPs who've fought for #Brexit to be delivered in the face of Labour's negligent attitude to the result.And now Labour activists are working to kick them out.Well done Labour, you've once again shown your contempt for Britons and our democracy!

Ok so y’all know I love @mrjamesob -but in all objective seriousness, having listened to him on @LBC all this week, I do believe history will remember him as one of only people in British Media brave enough to tell the truth about #Brexit. Outstanding (if scary) broadcasting.
The #Tory far-right have three different strategies for getting a hard #brexit:
#Barnier rejects #May's #Chequers plan.#Brexit #cartoon
Satisfaction with Mrs May falls to its lowest point so far among Conservative voters #brexit 
MI5 say there are 20,000 plus UKMuslim terror suspects among these. But protected from arrest and interrogation by EU Court of HR! Another imperative for Brexit? #Manchester,Westminstermurders. #TheTimes.#Brexit #MI5Report.

'Patients could be seriously disadvantaged by Brexit, if we don’t get our act together' - no-holds-barred interview with @MHRAmedicines chief Michael Rawlins #brexit #pharmacy
European people are suddenly beginning to realise the costs and effects of a corrupt subsidy & tariff regime most thought normal. #Brexit will bring much needed perspective to debate about the EU, which is only just getting started in continental Europe. 
Remember when Britain was somewhere to be proud of?When we were seen as a Global Superpower?When we were kind and welcoming to others?Me too. #London2012 was Peak-Britain. Then Cameron, then #Brexit, now May. We are a global joke because of the #BrexitShambles
Confidence that Theresa May will get a good #Brexit deal is plummeting. Over 70% are not confident.What many have yet to grasp is that there is no such thing as a good Brexit deal. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
But surely #Brexit is proof that the American political marketers are right - endlessly parroted silly slogans work. And yes, that makes people more cynical & distrusting, which makes them less willing to engage with reasoned political debate. A vicious circle.#StopBrexit
Desperation from Theresa May on her Europe tour1) The Czechs have rejected her white paper2) Experts warn the white paper makes it unlikely the UK can join the Trans-Pacific Partnership3) Now three-quarters of Brits say May is handling #Brexitbadly
Congratulations to @Sidcup_Labour and @CroydonNorthLab on passing motions calling on @UKLabour to support a #peoplesvote! Even more to follow soon, #Brexit is not inevitable!
We need a #PeoplesVote - but this time things must be different. Those of us who want to stand up to the Tories' disastrous #Brexit must learn from past mistakes & make the case for a better Britain within a reformed EU.My piece for @independent
Coming to a city near you... This summer we will be holding rallies across the UK to show why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal 
1. #brexit is a coup. I have added a few names in recent months as more have put their hands up to join the ERG & their Party Central. So this my current role of dishonour. Johnson, Leadsom, Mogg, Wigmore, Mercer, Banks, Hands, Davis, Farage, IDS, Fox, Redwood, Gove, Dacre....
The deliberate attempts by a select few to knowingly frustrate #Brexit are nothing short of treacherous & need holding to account. If the vote had been to Remain then we wouldn't be having a discussion about what EU elements we wish to remain within ??Public inquiry needed.
UK, YouGov poll:EU membership referendumRemain: 52%Leave: 48%Field work: 25/07/18 – 26/07/18Sample size: 1,653#Brexit
A majority of the public now back a #PeoplesVote. PM must listen - Government chaos makes even stronger case for all of us to have a final say over #Brexit deal  
Arron Banks - No, I didn't plot a coup in a small African country. The lies spread about me are an attempt to stop #Brexit 
Parties don't have to merge to stop #Brexit.They just have to form a temporary #BrexitCoalition to ensure the 17.4m have just ONE candidate to vote for in each constituency.If we can mobilise the 17.4m to vote for #Brexit one more time,we can change politics in the UK forever. 
Brexit voters (who won by the way) don't believe in this terminology - its #Brexit or be a vassal state. Not hard or soft. 
Let’s pop over to #Brexit and see what’s happening... 
#Brexit Project Fear morning noon & night. Never - ending shut up  FFS were leaving the EU. 17 million voted leave the EU. James O’ Brien, Owen Jones, Gary Lineker, David Lammy, Anna Soubry, Chuka Umunna, Alastair Campbell. This is what 17 million voted leave think of you. 
Delighted that my own #Labour party local branch in Shipley adopted this resolution on #Brexit last night 
"I don't care what is does to my family and country. I don't mind if we end up eating dirt. It'll be worth it." This, in essence, is what I have heard #Brexit callers to LBC say. It's what sensible, rational people are up against. The question is: Worth it for WHAT?
I hope I won't have to carry a #StockPile of food & medicines with me as I travel around the UK campaigning to stop this #Brexit madness... I already have to carry my guitar, suitcase & a bag of books, posters, stickers & badges to distribute everywhere I go #tweetyourstockpile
Festival time!!! On my way to @WOMADfestival to talk #Brexit & refugees with @MollyMEP on Saturday, #Fracking with @jonsnowC4 @frackfreeunited @simonpic78 & @TinaLouiseUK on Sunday...and of course listen to some great tunes!
The proportion of voters who favour a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal has overtaken those who do not for the first time, according to a YouGov poll for The Times.
When Labour propose nationalisation, more progressive taxation, better welfare, they're doing what it says on the Labour tin. But #Brexit is not on the Labour label. It is collusion with the kleptonationalist right & would prevent Labour achieving its aims.#StopBrexit #FBPE
This is the Brand New Range Rover Discovery it is going to be built in Slovakia because of #brexit well done you silly sausages, putting thousands on the dole from Solihul and the engineering supply chain make all the components still we have our country back Innit 
If it weren't for austerity, the referendum could easily have gone the other way, writes @fetzert, based on his latest research into the economic drivers of the #Brexit vote. Read here:  @warwickuni
Many of the shockingly mendacious Facebook ads microtargeted by Vote Leave/BeLeave had no imprint on them to say who was putting them out and paying for them.If, they'd had one, it should have looked like this.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
If you are bored with Brexit now so am I.  If you think it will go away if we strike any old deal, forget it.  We have 10 000 ++++ further agreements to make and it will go on and on and on ... then there's rationing and austerity to pay for it ...#NoDealOrNoBrexit#Brexit

New @YouGov poll shows support for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Clear momentum is building for the public to take back control of the final deal: 
Get rid of Hoey and you get rid of an authentic genuine free thinker who is on the side of the working classes who voted for #brexit ... no doubt to be replaced by some bland upper middle class champagne socialists... 
The targeted social media ads used in the 2016 #Referendum by the pro #Brexit campaign have been revealed - and all of them are misleading or blatant lies: 
Nigel Farage:It doesn’t matter how many concessions we make, it doesn’t matter!It doesn’t matter her OWN party say she has betrayed #Brexit with Chequers.It won’t be accepted by Barnier, Juncker & Brussels crowd.They want to force us into a crisis.#EU
.@Arron_banks: 'I have no regrets about backing #Brexit. What I do regret is the establishment’s efforts to undermine the will of 17.4 million people' 
great to see that momentum is building towards a #PeoplesVote on the final #brexit deal @peoplesvote_uk  - great way to start the day and we can continue to push for this by signing the petition here:
A majority of DUP’s Facebook ads for #Brexit vote were placed in England, not N Ireland. A loophole means the funding source for their campaign is confidential.

Piers appears to be confused about the meaning of democracy. We THE BRITISH PEOPLE have every right to change our mind. To question the referendum. To demand parliament acts in our best interests. #brexit is not above scrutiny, the law or continuing democracy. End

EU, unsurprisingly, rule out unworkable customs proposal from May. Yet again, Barnier sets out need for backstop to be agreed. Let's remember, it is the EU that are standing up for people of this place, ensuring that NI is protected- NOT  the UK Govt #Brexit

Constructive and frank discussions today with @DominicRaab and the #UK team. Work continues over the coming weeks to reach a #Brexit deal. Next meeting will be in mid-August: 
I wonder if designing a #Brexit proposal to meet the needs of the Conservative party rather than one that meets the needs of the UK and EU might have been a teeny error 
Barnier kills off May's Chequers plan by ruling out cross-border trade"UK wants to take back control of its money, law & borders & we will respect that, but #EU also wants to keep control of its money, law & borders & UK should respect that!Good!#Brexit
#EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier says "a large part" of the #Brexit deal has now been agreed, including the issue of citizens' rights - but warns that "the job does not stop here" 
At joint Brussels Press Conference, after talks with Raab , Barnier says the EU “cannot and will not delegate responsibility for its customs policy, VAT and tariffs to a non-member”.  That would appear to kill the Chequers #Brexit agreement which is based on just such a plan.
Ouch. Barnier has dismissed the Facilitated Customs Arrangement. The UK is either in our out of the customs union. #Brexit

"Michel, we've got work to do" - #Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab gives update on negotiations 
.@MichelBarnier speaking at a press conf with @DominicRaab in Brussels on #Brexit makes clear that the EU will not delegate the collection of customs of VAT to a third country - this means that customs proposal from Chequers is completely dead #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk
Yet the Brexiteers assured us that UK citizens in the EU would be unaffected by #Brexit. As the broken promises stack up, the case for a #PeoplesVote continues to grow. And make this one a #FinalSayForAll while you are at it.
UK & EU "both want an ambitious free-trade agreement" - EU chief #Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier 
These are the results from today's @Devon4Europe Brexitometer.Wherever a #Brexitometer is used, the results are the same. The British people demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. It's time for Parliament to catch up. 
They cheated.They lied.They are desperate to profit from damaging your family, your friends, your country, your future.This is the reality of #Brexit.Democracy isn't frozen in time. Time to think again.
“The UK wants to take back control of its money, law, and borders. We will respect that. But the EU also wants to keep control of its money, law, and borders. The UK should respect that.”@MichelBarnier #Brexit #Article50
Thing is David, as a democratically elected MP it is your job to ensure that the result of the referendum is respected. It is simply a matter of democracy, whether you like the #Brexit result or not. If you don’t feel you can do that then you should resign.

Important to note in Arron Banks/Farage timeline. Russian connections/diamond deals apparently begin in 2014, after #Brexit ref plan announced.  You've got Bannon backing Farage with Breitbart and then where does UKIP get its money from? It's always #Trump #Russia #Brexit
It just keeps getting worse. I used to think the #brexit mess was due to utter incompetence by the govn, but as we discover more it looks increasingly like it was wilful neglect & maybe even deliberate economic sabotage. Unbelievable. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay

Read why @Femi_Sorry believes a #PeoplesVote is needed by people across the country. The public needs a vote on the final #Brexit deal: 
1 The EU didn't exist in 1975. It was the Common Market/ EEC2 We joined in 73 not 753 The vote was about whether or not to stay inRemember when you got angry at politicians spouting off about football when they didn't know what they were talking about? @GaryLineker#brexit 
We should take comfort and reassurance in the fact we are stockpiling food, medicine and blood because of #Brexit That’s that Theresa May said in an interview. She ACTUALLY said those words. She’s ‘leading’ our country. It’s a fucken shambles is what it is. It’s shameful.
Great to see entrepreneur and Dragon's Den star @DeborahMeaden supports a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal 
Is she actually f*cking kidding me? We’re at not at war yet we’re voluntarily making a decision that requires us to stockpile foods and medicines and I should take reassurance and comfort in that?! WHAT PART OF THIS MAKES SENSE? #Brexit Tresemmé. Girl, no.

I agree with Priti, we should encourage more young people to get involved with politics. We should give more attention to the concerns of 75% of 18-24 year old who voted to Remain. And have a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal where 16-17s are allowed to vote on their future.

One min the European Communities Act was due to be repealed and the next minute the Tories confirm the UK will be party to the Act until 2020. This hokey cokey approach to key details of #Brexit is typical of this dysfunctional Tory Govt.

There's been some talk about treason today. Surely any British politician who is trying to drive our country into a situation in which food has to be stockpiled in order to pursue a #Brexit that will harm the county would be a prime candidate for a treason charge.#StopBrexit
A lie goes around the world faster than anything else. Some leadership is required in the UK - not this nonsense: “Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace,” claims Daniel Hannan #brexit
The time has come, the time is now. Just go, go, go, I don't care how. You can go by foot, you can by cow, Theresa May, please go now. You can go on skates, you can go on skis, you can go in a hat, but please go please.#WalkawayMay#Brexit@DanielJHannan
I now finally understand that "We're taking our country back..." was supposed to be followed by "...to the 1950s"Seriously? Stockpiling food and medicine? Can't wait to bust out one of these bad boys! #Brexit #BrexitShambles #FoodStockpile

Today's talk about extending the #Art50 timeframe is all about our Civil Servants & PM tying the hands of government with a bad deal and a prolonged #Brexit in the hope of then reversing it with yet another vote.We have to be prepared & free to walk away, No deal means WTO. 
Owen Jones calls out a Labour MP accused of 'propping up' the governmentBy @nyejones92 #Brexit #BrexitShambles #Brexitchaos
We've now gone from a #Brexit  which had 'no downside' to the point where the #Government has plans to stockpile #food.   Brexit doesn't work as advertised.  #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Theresa May taking personal charge of the #Brexit talks is bit like me asking my blind uncle keep a look out while I rob a bank. Both doomed to fail. By the way, I know it's only been 761 days since the referendum but has anybody found any Brexit benefits yet?

What's that you say? "This young woman talks a lot of sense and where could I hear more from her?"Well, we can help you there. Tessa Milligan of #OFOC is the 11th (yes, 11th!) confirmed speaker at the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference. Be there!
I've lost friends through #Brexit but, if they're prepared to watch me lose my job and gamble my family members lives in having access to the drugs they need to survive, then you have to ask the question, what sort of a friend does that?

Steve Bannon encouraging people to “rise up” & “fight to take their country back,” Tory MEP suggesting Treason Act be updated to deal with those showing “extreme EU loyalty,” public being called “Saboteurs,” judges labelled “enemies of the people.” Remember Jo Cox? #Brexit
Having PM take over #Brexit negotiations reflects reality over recent months.  But totally ill-equipped she could not even contrive to deliver a deal with her cabinet, let alone the EU.Expect more concessions. Bet Dominic Raab is delighted to be demoted 8 days into his role #FBPE
This is a flawed article by the BBC insofar as it overlooks three key facts -1) most of the public do not approve of the #ChequersPlan2) only 26% think Theresa May capable of getting a good #Brexit deal 3) most grassroots Tories are opposed to the #ChequersPlan
I don't blame those who voted Leave in 2016. They were promised something they thought was deliverable.BUT, if they STILL think #Brexit will be anything other than a disaster, I have no sympathy left whatsoever. Shame on anyone who supports ruining our country.#PeoplesVote
The big problem we have with the #Brexit stalemate is that the uber wealthy pro-Leave figures believe that even in the worst case scenario, bankrupt Britain, their own personal wealth will insulate them...They have no real vested interest, other than their own narrow xenophobia
There is still time to save #BrexitIf we do get agreement with the EU on withdrawal by October, only then would trade talks commenceIt is vital the Tories replace May BEFORE she can botch those vital trade talksIdeally May should be ditched ASAP#SaveBrexit#BinChequers
Today I broke down in tears in front of my class of students while talking about #Brexit.  It's not a good look for a teacher but being #inLimbo has reduced me to this.  Luckily my lovely Italian students were fantastically suportive #ILoveEU #BrexitIsPersonal #PeoplesVote

John Nelson, former Chairman of @LloydsofLondon says a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal is needed: 
This. Happening Now because of #Brexit. Fact not theoretical punchlines. Nick, I feel for you..deeply. 
I agree with @HenryCPorter that politicians who lie in order to promote policies that are contrary to the national interest should perhaps be subject to the treason laws. If that were the case now we could prevent the catastophe that #Brexit would otherwise be at a stroke
Hi @Foodanddrinkfed  We notice you’re pumping out #Brexit #ProjectFear stories on a regular basisCould you confirm whether you receive EU funding and how much?Thanks 
This is not a parody account I repeat NOT a parody account this is the UK in 2018:  Scotland this is complete insanity we need out of this #Brexit catastrophe ASAP!
Re stockpiling medicines etc pre #Brexit. My Physics is a bit rusty in places, but a lot of the radionuclides used in medicine (treatment and diagnosis) have short half lives, don’t they? Meaning that stockpiling them isn’t an option.Do tell me if I’ve missed something here?
The fact that the UK government is now stockpiling blood and food for the increasingly likely possibility of a no-deal #Brexit next year should be comforting, says Theresa May.Feeling comforted?
Here's how us being in the EU could get you out of a tight spot abroad. An interesting dive into the helpful EU laws we will lose after #Brexit, from @jaminbjoel. 
Ahem, Remain did in fact massively overspend, twice what Leave did, and promised World War 3, instant recession and massive unemployment. So hence we dismiss nonsense about 22 year olds ticking the wrong box and a mate of Farage having lunch with a Russian. #Brexit 
You said it @CarolineLucas - any form of #Brexit is lose-lose-lose. We're worse off every way you look at it. But the good news is we can #StopBrexit with a #PeoplesVote
Great to meet the Irish Minister for #Europe @HMcEntee. Appreciate new momentum in our relationship. #Irland can count on our clear solidarity: strong support for the Irish Protocol & the need for it to form part of #Brexit #WithdrawalAgreement. #EuropeUnited 
What an odious wretch East of England MEP David Bannerman is. To oppose #Brexit and the damage it is inflicting on the UK is to be truly loyal to the people of the UK. Time to #StopBrexitSaveBritain!

Only 14 teachers from #EU registered with @gtcs in first half of this year - 186 in total in 2017. @GTCSKen attributes fall to #Brexit and unwelcoming immigration approach by @GOVUK.
Interesting submissions re #CharterofFundamentalRights. A spin off from #ContinuityBill case quite apart from #Brexit cd be judicial confirmation of the extent to which @ScotParl is free to legislate on #HumanRights provided it doesn’t repeal or modify #HRA
What a laugh...As Britain stockpiles food and medicine, the words "the EU need us more than we need them" are playing on repeat in my head. Out of interest, what EU countries are stockpiling British food and medicine? Any? #Brexit #StockPiling #Indyref2

Who do you trust the most to tell you the truth about the consequences of #Brexit?
A ruthless transatlantic elite aided by Putin is using fear, hate & bigotry as tools to weaken & hollow out democracy and free themselves from taxation & regulation. Far from being patriotic #Brexit is just one part of their war on democracy.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
British civil servants have always revelled in 'gold-plating' EU directives into British law:  adding more regulation than was stipulated even by the EU.Why would they now want to leave this lovely EU that helps them wield such power in over-regulating Britain?#Brexit 
I'm on a family holiday this week in Menorca. My toddler made friends with a Spanish girl & we got to know her parents. On the 5th day we got chatting about politics & #brexit. The couple said the general view in Spain is it's v.harmful & can't understand it! Indeed. #stopbrexit
I guess they are hoping that we’ll all be grateful that they were able to do a deal no matter how bad it is. Time to think again. #Brexit is not about the future of 650 MP’s who come & go at “the will of the people” but 65,000,000 who have to live with the consequence for life.
Desperation. @DanielJHannan and @TheSun know people are waking up to the damage #Brexit will do to the UK. Putin's foreign policy is break-up of the EU and we all know now about Russian money funding Leave: these people aren't pro-UK, they're pro fascism, pro their own wealth.
Funny, but we've heard no outcry from Westminster MPs that they haven't been given a 'meaningful vote' on this...  Distinctive #Brexit research and news daily: 
We want our democratic vote honoured and delivered @Conservatives @theresa_may#NODEAL #BREXIT 
As @PhilipPullman said - voting Leave was like shooting yourself in the foot to cure a headache.With no-deal #Brexit our negotiating position is threatening to shoot ourselves in the head. The country is being held hostage by a bunch of chancers, charlatans and Putin lackeys
Some EU nations have the worst youth unemployment rates in the WORLD. Some topping 58%. Its a failing organisation who use the poor and youth to keep mega wealthy people wealthy. Leaving it is a forward step for ordinary ppl , staying is sinking with the ship. #Brexit
Banks, Wigmore, Hannan all celebrate the return of the Commonwealth and Empire post #Brexit.And this is why #Brexit is bigger than Suez. Economically we're soon going to discover that we are a kind of Gibraltar. 
Why do #brexit MPs walk around in groups of three ?First one can read.Second one can write.The third one is there "to keep an eye on the two dangerous intellectuals" #StopBrexit#StopBrexitSaveBritain#InvestigateERG pic.twitter.com/vT0ub7AxFr
That is of course a very sensible and rational point of view. The only problem I have with it is  that nothing about #Brexit or the current government is either sensible or rational.
Holy fuck. The S*n & @DanielJHannan significantly ramping up the #Brexit rhetoric - accusing Brussels of 'hostility' & 'aggression', & using pictures of Britain engaged in armed conflict with the EU.Utterly disturbing. This propaganda is unacceptable. 
The #Brexit panic hides the rest of the current gov's failures. And even the head of the civil service thinks we shld panic. Better #StopBrexit altogether. #FBPE  @BrexitBin @spaceangel1964 @Women_4_Europe @acgrayling @emmyzen
The UK will remain under EU laws for an additional 21 months after #Brexit. Dominic Raab has told MPs that maintaining EU law was “necessary”.Why on Earth is UKGov still pretending that leaving the Customs Union and Single Market is beneficial?
Here you go, Brussels is upping the trade war with the USA without your explicit permission.  Viva #Brexit 
As a doctor I would suggest removing the need for this by stopping #brexit. Think of it as a public health intervention. It would probably save money too, less admissions and treatments for relapses and uncontrolled disease.Comprende? 
Here is the original tweet Conservative MEP David C Bannerman deleted so as to appear less offensive #brexit 
The stockpiling of medicines won’t work.  Many have very short shelf lives. #brexit will kill and it’s mainly the fault of fat fraud @BorisJohnson
At @UKSupremeCourt for #ContinuityBill case it’s clear the court is in no doubt that #EUWithdrawalAct has altered the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. So there has been a #PowerGrab.  @ScotTories & UK Govt please take note #Brexit
Do you agree with @theresa_may’s approach to #Brexit?If no, have you contacted your MP to tell them?There’s a major push by No 10 over the summer to sell this sellout.Don’t leave it to someone else. Let your MP know your views and rescue Brexit now.
One thing that the #Brexit process has proven is that the UK has absolutely no friends in the EU, not even our closest neighbours. We should walk away, whatever it costs.
A crowd is offered a fireworks display. They say yes and stand close by in happy anticipation. Those in charge know the fireworks are pointed directly at the crowd. They know the people, given the new info, would reject this if given a vote. But they just let it happen.#Brexit
Getting quite giddy about #Brexit now. Having previously been a remainer I’m now thrilled that we might be able to stockpile enough drugs, may just have enough food to stop people starving, can save  on the NHS by not having enough staff & in about 50 yrs MAY see a £ benefit 
My worry is that no matter how crap, no matter how stupid, no matter how illegal, no matter how damaging for 65 million men, women and children, Theresa May is going to force though #Brexit. All to please a few tax-avoiding billionaires who stand to benefit.
There is still time to change course on #Brexit – if those of us with shared values, across all parties, join together in resisting the growing tide of right-wing politics, and start pushing back.  #PeoplesVote

To show how successful the @conservatives #Brexit plan has become, @theresa_may , her of numerous u-turns and lack of Brexit comprehension has taken over all negotiations and @DominicRaab is now demoted to Minister for Food Stockpiling and Rations.  At least these will be blue...

Olly Robbins is in Brussels today for more #Brexit talks. Top of the agenda is the 'insoluble' Irish backstop issue - but how 'insoluble' it really? Is there a way through?Maybe. Some thoughts after chats with both sides. 1/Thread 
I think people forget that there's a huge network of distributors in the UK that keep shelves stocked by making daily deliveries to the major supermarkets. Any delays at UK ports would lead to empty shelves within a day of a no deal #Brexit. The government MUST know this already 
Far from offering us our liberty, the #Brexit (Jacob Rees-Mogg) offers threatens to turn us back into corporate chattels, stripped of our hard-won civil and democratic rights. 
READ: @CarolineLucas tells the Labour party they must listen to young people and support a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal:  
Tony Blair fuels rumours of cross-party Remainer plotting as he urges 'new political coalition' to fight 'populism'  #Brexit 
If you compare relations between UK & Ireland, what strikes me is generosity from Ireland to UK, even in face of provocative,unhelpful language. No institutional memory in UKG of importance of Anglo-Irish relations and how they impact on NI- this has been writ large in #Brexit
The piece is barking enough - the fact that it is then retweeted by a Labour MP shows that the world is turned upside down particularly as the detail of yesterday’s @YouGov poll shows that #Brexit is now largely a south /middle England Tory enterprise. 
More people are backing a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal every day. Have you signed the petition yet? If not, you can do so here
. @OllyRobbins not answering questions properly just illustrates how a deep state within the civil service will go fighting to stop #brexit.
2015: Brexit will be the new ambrosia! We’ll be rich beyond our wildest dreams! 2016: Everything will stay the same, but with added sovereignty!2017: We don’t know what will happen but we’ll probably cope.2018: Most people probably won’t starve. #brexit #adequatefood
Little-known WTO clause allows UK & Brussels a “reasonable length of time” after #Brexit to agree a free-trade deal.Tariffs would be ZERO between UK & EU as part of an interim arrangement lasting up to 10 years allowing more time for free-trade deal.#EU
Sat at a health seminar on diabetes treatment and hearing terms like ‘apocalyptic’. Mainly in terms of EU drugs supply chains and delays for licensing new drugs after #Brexit 
I recall @DominicRaab with @michaelgove pressing me to agree in the first ever meeting of the @CommonsEUexit Select Cttee that #Brexit could be successfully done in 6 months. I note that almost 2 years on he is Minister in charge of stockpiling essential goods.
A Cumberland sausage will no longer be an EU protected Cumberland sausage. Without the weight of EU protections behind us, #brexit Britain is opening its famous brand names to more imitation and illegal counterfeiting which we shall have less power to stop 
It is clear from Olly Robbins' response and David Davis's statement that ReMayner Theresa May disclosed the contents of her #Brexit white paper to Remainers in Cabinet in advance of the Chequers getaway but she ambushed the #Brexiteer ministers

#Brexit, the easiest thing in history. If stockpiling food doesn't scream 'we lied to you', I don't know what does. Our leaders are being lead, never was this country more in need of leadership than now. Mrs May @theresa_may, Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, you ain't it.#PeoplesVote
Food for thought: Raab admits planning to secure #Food supply for disaster of a #NoDeal #Brexit
In the 2 yrs since 37% of the electorate expressed their dissatisfaction in an advisory referendum, the government could have made a concerted effort to  address the causes of #Brexit. Instead, they are going to stockpile food & medicine & Mr Mogg opens a second fund in Eire.

Contrary to popular belief, the north of England now has the strongest support for Remaining in the EU of any part of England outside London. 55% back Remain according to the latest polling. People up here are realising that #Brexit is a project of the elite, for the elite.

May blocked David Davis from planning for a 'no deal' #Brexit several months ago - Stewart Jackson, a former adviser of the ex-Minister.So there we go, why should Britons trust the Tory govt under May and Raab is preparing for a #WTOBrexit in earnest this time?

Quentin Letts - "The political class have been able to nullify #Brexit, they’ve been able to rubbish it enough that we’ve ended up with this Chequers agreement which is a terrible damp squib."

Unless I blinked and missed it #bbcnews at Six on BBC1 didn't mention May elbowing Raab aside and taking over #Brexit negotiations herself, nor mention any of today's Brexit developments at all.Most important UK issue for 60 years or hot weather? No contest.
Journalist Will Hutton @williamnhutton joins the growing list of speakers at the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference. Author, along with @Andrew_Adonis, of must-read book “Saving Britain” he will certainly have plenty of relevant input into the debate.

OK Scotland time to get this message out.#Brexit means #fracking of our beautiful land and the poisoning of our water table. Oh Aye, and earthquakes. Let's get out of this corrupt union before they get their greedy hands on our lands?#DissolvetheUnion
No harm, but see when the outcome of a referendum being implemented leads to a state of emergency & rationing of food, (gov would rather we didn't talk about stockpiling)at what point do you literally CALL IT OFF AS A BAD JOB #Brexit #brexitshambles #PeoplesVote
Saddened by @jeremycorbyn speech today.He said: "A Labour #Brexit could provide real opportunities, as well as protections for our exporters."The truth: Any form of Brexit will undermine exporters, cost jobs and hit hardest those who have least.
Dominic Raab calls this afternoon’s take over of his  #Brexit negotiator role by PM “some shifting of the Whitehall deckchairs”.  Not , given the inevitable #Titanic analogy, the best choices of words .  Next he will be humming “Abide With Me”….
Are you happy with @theresa_may’s announcement where she said that she is sidelining the #Brexit Minister (@DominicRaab) and will now lead #Brexit negotiations herself with @OllyRobbins.Please RT for wider sample.
BREXIT CHAOS: A no-deal Brexit could make most of us poorer – and Jacob Rees-Mogg richer /#EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Corbyn receiving deserved praise from the fascists. His latest bright idea - let Brexit devaluation make us poorer so we can compete on labour costs with cheap labour countries, and he tops up the message with a xenophobic dog whistle.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
There is so much "being clear" going on in government today, I'm afraid it leaves most of us not clear about anything much at all. #Brexit#LastDayOfTerm
Can anyone please tell me what concessions the UK has received from the EU to date in the #Brexit “negotiations”? 
In a #PeoplesVote - a huge 77% of #Labour voters would vote to #Remain. We need a change in direction. We need @UKLabour policy on #Brexit to represent the many, not the few. 
The last person we'd choose to run #Brexit negotiations is the person who's just taken over, assisted by an unelected Remainer civil servant. She must be removed now before she does more damage.  This can't wait.Distinctive #Brexit research & news daily: 
BOMBSHELL: Olly Robbins was ordered by Theresa May to sideline David Davis. Davis finished the White Paper which delivered a True Brexit. May held it back from being published.Then at Chequers May took the betrayal plan by Olly Robbins. Davis only found out on the day. #Brexit
With Brexit Secretary Raab so quickly demoted to May's bag-carrier I'm wondering if Barnier's team phoned May and said "Merde alors! Why have you sent us this stupid and arrogant boy?" #Brexit #bbcnews
Now this is interesting - snuck out as the Commons winds down it confirms what has been the case - disastrously it has to be said - for a long time ; the PM is steering the #Brexit ship….straight for the rocks … 
EU put EU stooges in to run Greece and Italy.Now they have put an EU stooge, Holly Robbins, to stop #Brexit.EU will stop at nothing to get their own way.
New Health Secretary Matt Hancock tells @CommonsHealth he’s ordered stockpiling of vital medicines & medical equipment for no-deal #Brexit, but doesn’t say for how long & ignores short shelf life & no domestic manufacturing capacity in many areas. #BrexitShambles #PeoplesVote
In 2016 Dominic Raab waxed lyrical about the glorious economic future of #Brexit Britain. Now he's Brexit Secretary & his promises have shrunk:"We will make sure there is adequate food supplies."Thanks, Dominic. We're all very grateful.#PeoplesVote
Progress is in danger of being reversed. WE are working to ensure that women's rights are protected and expanded in the UK regardless of the outcome of #Brexit negotiations. 
The ex-British army colonel who was recently in #Israel supporting the #IDF as they killed unarmed protestors and, who called for mass internment (imprisonment without trial) of thousands of #Muslims in #Britain explains how with #Brexit we bring back the death penalty. Bravo! 
This is @OllyRobbins, the man who is driving #Brexit negotiations and telling the Prime Minister what to do. Olly is a remainer.Olly has been steering the PM for ages and was instrumental is the disregarding of the #Brexit department.Olly is not elected. #MAYMUSTGO
MP fails to declare free holidays & could be forced out if 10% of his constituents sign a petition.But the 158 MPs who voted to stop #Brexit, even though they represent a LEAVE constituency,can't be forced to stand down.Surely overturning the vote of 17.4m is more important?
How come a Prime Minister who can't negotiate agreement amongst her cabinet, is best person to negotiate a UK/EU deal? #Brexit #BrexitShambles
Dear @jeremycorbyn May I be the 100th person to point out that the #NHS is kept afloat thanks to doctors and nurses from #EU27 Your support of #Brexit will hugely harm the NHS. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
.@DominicRaab  just sent alarm bells ringing in homes across the country. EU citizens who've built a life in the UK deserve certainty that their basic rights will be protected if this blundering Government fails to reach a #Brexit deal with the EU 
You can’t say we didn’t tell you @DominicRaab your position is just a illusion as @theresa_may and @OllyRobbins try to keep us shackled to the EU. And your have lost a lot of credibility with #Brexiteers now. #Brexit 
I hear Theresa May will personally lead the #Brexit negotiations. In other news, I have just placed a large order for popcorn.
⁦Last of today’s meetings in Bucharest was with Romanian PM @VioricaDancila⁩ at Government Buildings. Very useful discussion on our two countries and #Brexit. Tomorrow on to Venice where Irish architecture is blazing a trail

Theresa May appoints Dominic Raab as #Brexit Secretary and merely days later confirms it will actually be her and Olly Robbins that will lead negotiations in Brussels. Beggars belief at what Brexit department is even for. Raab may well revert to his Hard Brexit stance now

Nice to see him confident enough to express himself on #Brexit after being bullied into a corner by FBPE Blairites. 
Now that #Brexit is unravelling and the truth of the impossibility of the #Leave promises are dawning on #Brexiters, you can bet the EU will be blamed for the negative consequences. Hunt has already tried it on in Germany. No wonder Davis ran away.

Welcome Germany's proposal for a generous approach to UK citizens post-Brexit & I hope this will set the tone for other EU27 countries. The EurParliament is committed to scrutinising the preparations of EU countries. People shouldn't be victims of #Brexit 
Wonder if Costa del Sol #Brexit voters realised they were voting themselves out of being able to receive their future insurance based pensions. Of course they didn't, none of the downsides were on the ballot paper, despite #Leavers claiming to have known the consequences.
The reality is that if we have a 'no deal' Brexit, we will lose jobs, and we will lose investment in #Wales and the UK. There is no question about that, which is why I am fighting against a 'no deal' #Brexit, and why I want a #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk

I predict all of the Brexeratti will resign on 30th March 2019 & will just leg it with their ill gotten #Brexit windfall. Mrs May @theresa_may will make an impassioned speech outside No10 'You wanted Brexit, here it is, enjoy, I resign, it's all yours'

FYI. The EU briefings for industry, trade, services, business a#nd citizens on the practical consequences of #Brexit:

I run a small business - we don't export, but do rely on raw material cominbg in from all over globe.I'm no international trader, but it's obvious to even me the disaster that is #Brexit. IMO we are sleepwalkinh into 20 years of stagnation - that's my optimistic forecast!
Negotiating away a democratic mandate served by the electorate isn't only foolish but political suicide #Brexit 
Corbyn shows his true colours by pretending there are economic benefits to #brexit despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary 
If you’re really worried about Putin’s agenda to destabilise the EU and undermine democracy you should launch a proper inquiry into Russian involvement in the #Brexit vote 
Jeremy Corbyn goes all Donald Trump to highlight economic 'benefit' of #Brexit as he demands UK stop relying on 'cheap labour from abroad.' Still chasing the UKIP vote then.We desperately need a realignmemt of centre-left politics in this country.

The #Tory #FarReich have been working on blaming the #EU for a #NoDealBrexit for over two years!Its THEIR objective, they KNOW the consequences won't be popular with voters, & so they are looking to say when #Brexit goes belly up, "Honestly,it wasn't our fault!"#PEOPLESvote

No .@Jeremy_Hunt , the public won't blame the EU for a No Deal Brexit. They will blame a divided Tory Cabinet which claimed we could have our cake and eat it and instead is delivering a shambolic Tory #Brexit , at the expense of British jobs and livelihoods.
My speech on #Brexit shows why Commons won’t vote 4 PM’s options. Govt's approach is like a man who says to his ex “will you be my live-in mistress when the divorce comes through? Unless you agree we can't discuss alimony.” That's why #peoplesvote has support of John Major & Co
What the leftist Brexit enablers don’t seem to understand is that Brexit is their Iraq. It’s not some clever ploy that will get their leader into power, it’s their grand folly; a generational betrayal of their core constituency that will haunt them for years #brexit #corbyn #fbpe

After 2 years, the Conservative government has FINALLY revealed its #Brexit plan...BLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EUBLAME THE EU 
Silence can be the most painful sound.No vision, no courage, no #Brexit plan and looking at this, no personality at all. What a disaster of a Prime Minister.#MayMustGoNow
...because @jeremycorbyn and @johnmcdonnellMP are old style hard left no deal Brexiteers! They will sell out “Remainers” and sensible #Leave voters who  want a #Brexit that protects jobs, prosperity and peace in N Ireland. 
PM in Newcastle says she is delivering on #Brexit vote.She's still lying through her teeth.She's delivering #REMAIN.She has some brass neck to say she is delivering #Brexit when she's doing the oppositeTories need to remove her before she destroys their party.#BrexitBetrayal
Delighted to back this campaign. Working people & families in Britain and Ireland need to hear honesty about the real implications of #Brexit.@UKLabour should demand a #peoplesvote.
Oh my goodnes !!Theresa May in the North East.She is STILL pedalling that TWADDLE about £300m plus - going into the NHS post #Brexit.Theresa DO keep up !!That myth has been demolished many times .
.@theresa_may says she's "had constructive responses so far" from the #EU on the UK's #Brexit proposals.Follow the latest Brexit stories here: 
What we need is a common agreement and not a chaotic #Brexit. FM @HeikoMaas talked to @JeremyHunt today about the most urgent priorities. @GermanEmbassy @GermanAmbUK @GermanyintheEU
Project fear say #Brexit will cause:No dairy (English cows are available)Civil unrestA need to stock up on foodIt’s like the post #Brexit emergency budget, Market crashes, House price crashes, Job losses that were predicted if we voted for Brexit.None of which happened. 
If you think the rise of Islamophobia hasn't been weaponised by Putin - think again. (The Chechen conflict cemented his power)And look at all the #Brexit Alt Reich accounts which boost this hatred, and their Russian connections.(Hi @Arron_Banks @andywigmore and Leave EU)
Tories are stepping up the rhetoric of blaming the EU for an "accidental" No Deal #Brexit. There is nothing accidental about this, it's entirely deliberate. Propose things they know the EU will refuse & then claim they're being inflexible. The EU didn't want this, England did.
With Mogg admitting it will take 50 years for the UK to see any benefits from #Brexit, how can any #Leavers still support it. The majority will be long dead by then and our children and grandchildren will have lost half a century of opportunities.
'WE Control THEM!'Iain Duncan Smith: "Just say for a second EU didn’t agree to do Open Skies, that means all routes across the Atlantic are shut to them!They can’t fly to New York on Polar routes, on Northern routes because we control them!"#Brexit #EU
Switching to trading with EU under WTO is the exact opposite of a 'leap to the unknown' --WTO is a well-known system and Britain operates under it quite well with large parts of the world.A #WTOBrexit is the best #Brexit as it offers far greater certainty than an untested deal? 
Apart from the obvious, one of the other losses for me due to #brexit is the BBC News. I always held this institution in high esteem and was always proud that it stood as a beacon for fairness and balance.The poison that is #Brexit has destroyed this too. #FBPE
If #Brexit ends in a mess, we will blame the UK gov, not the EU.  You started this, not them. When you infer you are speaking for us, more often than not, you are putting your words in our mouths. You don't have that right. No one has.
Rees-Mogg accuses the EU of behaving like the Mafia. But as #BrexitSyndicate reveals, it is odious groups like the ERG on the #Brexit side that are driven by a secretive cabal seeking to manipulate our political system to their own advantage. 
Lord Ashcroft's research People feel the following are incompatible with #Brexit1) Not being free to strike trade deals2) Being compelled to follow adverse EU rules 3) Staying subject to the ECJ; and 4) Not having control of our immigration policy
The EEA is the only intelligent Brexit. Crashing out will only see us paying more and signing up to the NI backstop just to reopen talks.#Brexit

The ERG preparing to cash in on a No Deal #Brexit is outrageous Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn.Stop respecting a result obtained by cheating & breaking the law, bring your party members together so they work in the best interest of the country, not the few. Support a #PeoplesVote
"Dont worry about #Brexit no-deal because we'll just boost UK production instead of relying on EU imports" is a thoroughly Putin-esque, Trump-style mercantilist approach to trade policy. You dont get to use the free trade moniker if you're resorting to that
#Brexit ‘No Deal’ = Brexit WTOMrs May greatly underestimated the threat to her White Paper ‘betrayal’2 years of getting nowhere have made people furious.Now new appetite for ‘No Deal’ & trade on World Trade Organisation terms.World Trade for all...#EU
As we leave, the UK becomes almost the EU’s largest single external trading partner, only just behind the US. The time has come for everyone in the EU27 to realise that their vital national and economic interests are at stake in the #Brexit negotiations.

You can listen to Theresa May for several minutes on any subject to realise how uninformed she is. Whether it's foreign policy, the economy, #Brexit , crime, racial relations, education, science, she always talks in PC cliches fed to her by her aides. Absolutely useless woman.
Photo from our Brexitometer in #Bracknell. Constituents are clear that they support @DrPhillipLeeMP in putting country before party, and that they support a #peoplesvote on the final #Brexit deal. 
Ex PM John Major is “wrong on almost everything he said!”'The only thing that’s changed is he LOST!'Jacob Rees-Mogg:“The only fact that has changed is he lost the vote and it is very important to implement a vote that has taken place.”#Brexit #EU
Yet to hear of the very same people demonstrating outside @vincecable office, despite the fact he missed the most important vote on #Brexit in Parliament. Still to hear them criticise his abdication of duty. Not a single chant of "Where's Vince Cable" Why? 
Just not backing #Brexit though are you? #ChequersMeansCorbyn#MAYMUSTGO
Project fear round 2. 1. No Cheese2. Stockpile food3. Brexit worse than the IRA4. Brexit worse than Nazi Germany5. No flights6. Motorway truck parks7. Civil unrest8. No Doctors or Nurses9. Won't be allowed travel to Europe.The heat is sending the Remainers mad.#Brexit
The reality of our 45 years of integration into the EU economy is only now coming home as we face the catastrophe of no deal #Brexit. The vandalism is criminal. And one of the biggest culprits is our press which - led by @BorisJohnson and Murdoch - has deceived us for 30 years
Right, I am fed up with this nonsense about an EU Passport giving us all these magical travel rights that will supposedly end after Brexit. So here is a thread with my own personal experiences of why this is total nonsense. #Brexit 
What is more strategically important to us? Trade with EU, percentage of which is falling every year down to 42% or trade with USA, Commonwealth, Middle East, Africa, Asia percentage of which is growing fast 58% & growing fast by volume too. Key factor for #Brexit deal @SkyNews
When you hear Remainers whine about a "No Deal Brexit" and "crashing out of the EU" remind them we would leave in an orderly manner on WTO terms. The only chaos is in the minds of the sore losers #Brexit

At the start of this #Brexit debacle @theresa_may set out her 'red lines' that made it impossible for any Brexit deal to be achieved. (see charts)If the country is pushed into a 'no deal' #HardBrexit by Government, Parliament should have a red line & declare no confidence.
Read threat. This is not politicians bleating on about the down side of #Brexit, its a real economic threat to the most vulnerable. Demand a vote! We can still stop it. @peoplesvote_uk @AlynSmith @MollyMEP

Segment on BBC GMU citing DUP claim that they don't want hard border, repeating DUP line of "sensible" Brexit. At every, single opportunity the DUP have, by process of elimination and in their rhetoric, RULED out, VOTED DOWN any options that would prevent hard border!! #Brexit
#Brexit has already cost the U.K. more than Its EU budget payments, study shows 
After the #ChequersPlan was announced I have had no doubt that May intends to sign a deal with the EU, no matter how feeble, unsatisfactory or costlyShe never intended to walk away from the #Brexit talks Surely I am not the only Leaver who thinks this
I’m looking forward to receiving my blue ration book.#Brexit

Apparently there is no majority for #Brexit in Parliament. So why are we letting the stupid loud people take control of our nation and opposition? Why aren't the silent majority standing up in defiance of this #Brexit madness. It is a time for British heroes, not liars and fools.

May's 'no deal is better than a bad deal' lie is going to bite her on the backside. Here silly soundbite could well toss the UK off the #Brexit cliff and into an economic abyss. The public will pay the price for her folly. Time to start stockpiling food.
After reading @MesutOzil1088's retirement letter, I hope he has a kickass season with Arsenal. "I'm German when we win, an immigrant when we lose". Substitute the first country and it will be true for most of so called modern countries. #Ozil #IStandWithÖzil #Brexit
#RussiaGate hoax is deflecting attention away from the biggest political catastrophe in 300 years. #Brexit: a multi-trillion pound dumpster fire that will reunite Ireland, sink the British economy completely, and see muppet @BorisJohnson become PM.

Like Farage, @Jacob_Rees_Mogg didn't say that #Brexit would be.. a success! Like #Farage, all he said was that it would give the nation back its #sovereignty.  Plus it might take 50 years to see the benefits..But #JacobReesMogg has mouths to feed.Now!#PrepareForANoDealBrexit
Project Fear reaches a new level of hysteria, now that the Remoaners realise that a no deal #Brexit is a realistic prospect 
All coming out of the non-existent #Brexit ‘dividend’. Imagine if we could spend this on the NHS instead. Time for a #PeoplesVote to stop this avoidable misery
If it transpires that two years of establishment dithering conspired to frustrate #Brexit to the extent that the decision were U-turned under the pretext of political complexity, I fear the consequences for British democracy and Parliamentary credibility would be irreparable. 
Apparently Raab's happy to toss over a million UK citizens living in the EU under the wheels of the #Brexit bus. Arsehole
1. All of this was predicted by some 2yrs ago & #Brexit lost when May backed by Corbyn invoked A50 w/o a clue what they were doing.Gross negligence & a lack of due diligence. The deceitful party political game play since then is a travesty of Democracy.

Fmr PM John Major, who played instrumental role in NI with Downing St Declaration, who stood up to Tory bullies over Maastricht knows a thing or two. He's right. Brexit will impact on poorest. It will decimate NE Eng & NI. Impact on GFA. At what cost Brexit? Who gains? #Brexit

I'm just gonna say it again. I support MPs of all colours who oppose #brexit.  I do not support Corbyn on brexit because he is a #brexiter.  Brexit is THE defining moment for our future. It will ruin the country and it is being done to the country by a coup of fanatics #FBPE
Put another way: John Major wouldn't even let us have 1 referendum on the Maastricht Treaty, that created the EU, let alone 2. All of his promises and assurances turned out to be false. But we had to wait almost a quarter century before we were asked our opinion #marr #brexit 
So I swear a lot on Twitter to raise awareness of the hideous #Brexit, that's my thing. Others like @albawhitewolf& @nickynoo007 get out there and do significant, awesome stuff. This guy, @ConsultantRogue is starting an epic journey on Tuesday embracing the concept of free 2

John Major on #Marr, “Any deal is going to be worse than the one we currently have with the EU...and no deal would be the worst of all.” #Brexit
John Major says on #marr that a #PeoplesVote on the deal creates difficulties but is morally justified because Leave’s pie-in-the-sky promises are not going to be met and because it’s better than disillusion 5 years down the road as the full damage of #Brexit becomes clear
John Major: "When circumstances change, you can change your mind""and if promises made are not going to be met, there is a justification for changing your mind" #marr#brexit#Scotref #indyref2
John Major coming across once more as a calm, sensible, pragmatic voice in the #Brexit debate #marr
No deal with the EU after #Brexit "should not be an option", says Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey #marr
Former British Prime Minister John Major says an irreconcilable minority in HoC cannot be allowed to lead to no deal #Brexit as this would be catastrophic for the people who have least, they will end up being hurt most. #Marr
Say what you like about "grey man", Y-fronts etc, but John Major is a towering statesman in comparison to the cabal of crooks, charlatans and fantasists who have now taken control of his party.Refreshing to hear a Tory telling the truth about #Brexit.#PeoplesVote #Marr
A letter seen in Kent's @fstoneherald this week. All over the UK, people are frustrated at the chaos and division being caused by Brexit, and supporting calls for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal.Frustrated too? Sign the #PeoplesVotePetition at 
Are stories about UK plans to stockpile food for a no deal scenario true? #Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab says it's an unhelpful "selective snippet that's made it into the press"  #marr
#Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab says he's working for "the best deal" with the EU, but the UK has to be prepared for a no deal scenario  #marr
He met Jacob Rees~Mogg, who also has a lot of articles published in Breitbart.(Google it)Now Mogg has stepped up his hatespeech, using words like MAFIAThis is more than #Brexit, it is a rightwing takeover plan. #marr  #Brexit Fascism doesn't always come with jackboots 
Now let me think, who has been the person in charge of delivering #brexit so far....? 
Never let a good lie get in the way of facts.Especially if you are a Tory and member of the ERG group.#brexit #PeoplesVote
New boy #Raab threatens to refuse paying #Brexit bill ... where did he learn such idiocy? ...#StopBrexit #DavidDavis #Remain #Brexitshambles #Marr #FBPE #ABTV #WATON #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
"In order to bring the 52 per cent and the 48 per cent of this country together, and indeed forge the win-win deal with our EU friends, we would need to be pragmatic", says @DominicRaab in the @Telegraph. "The White Paper delivers that" #Brexit
38 MPs sign letter calling for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. Momentum is building to give the public control: 
What’s your preferred option for #Brexit? Please RT for a wide sample.
Anyone still fantasising about a #Brexit ‘dividend’ needs to wake up to the reality. As no-deal becomes ever more likely we need a #PeoplesVote because there is no mandate to inflict this kind of misery
As @Jon_Danzig writes in his blog today about #Brexit, ‘We will be poorer, and with less sovereignty, fewer rights and protections, restricted trade, and diminished power after we’ve left. What’s the point? There’s no point.’ Please RT.  #ExitBrexit
No Deal #Brexit means no more UK, via @iainmacwhirter in today's @newsundayherald
What a good job the UK did not join the euro.It would have made #Brexit even more difficult. 
Britain is about to get a kick in the complacency#Brexit 
I don’t care what your views on #brexit are, you don’t talk about party colleagues like this 
And yet the uninformed and dumb swallow it - along with every other #Brexit high-command lie - hook, line and sinker. I guess we probably need less-dumb voters. What're the chances of getting some of those? 
They are really pushing for a no deal #Brexit which would be devastating for all but the very rich, and would be very good for Trump, Putin and disaster capitalists. Let us be clear that if they do this they will rightly be regarded as traitors.#StopBrexit #FBPE
The vast majority of people who voted for #Brexit will be dead before its far-from-assured 'benefits' materialise in 50 years time.Let's have a #PeoplesVote now & let those who are alive now decide the future for themselves, their children & their grandchildren.
I understand that John Major, ex-Tory PM will appear on #marr tomorrow to reiterate his concerns about his party's handling of #Brexit. And I'll be nodding along. This is the darkest place that I've ever been in support of what I believe. #LeftAgainstBrexit #Remain
MEDIA after #Brexit @BBC will be censored and @ITV @Channel4 etc will close programmes will run from 2pm until 11pm to save power the test card will be shown at all other times with music. Only official newspaper will be @DailyMailUK rest will close#NoDealBrexit #NoDealSurvival
Now we're getting a double dose of anti-#EU anti-#Ireland hysteria in Brit tabloidswith a view to attempting to disguise the total incompetence of @Conservatives to deal with the huge problem of #Brexit they inflicted on us allsolely for party advantage
It just so happens Brian Lucey has done a marvellous thread on the question of planes being grounded post-#Brexit.Chris Grayling (and JRM) have got it wrong, as per usual. Caller is vindicated. (Are you surprised?)Thread 
I, as a German, don't understand, what's going on in Britain. #Brexit campaign was definitely a fraud. You WILL await poverty and unemployment after Brexit. If not today, there will be no 2nd chance to fight, to demonstrate, to #StopBrexit. Cluelessly ...Jörg
So Rees Mogg thinks it reasonable for not 1 but 2 generations of Brits to be guinea pigs in his #Brexit experiment. Note also his opposition here to simple binary questions on complex issues - new since 2016 clearly... 
They cheated And now for the reckoning #Brexit 
What is this #Brexit “bill” for? If it’s for commitments to the EU budget then there’s a two year notice period and we’ve given them that. That’s two years to rework their budget. Why should we pay cash for an agreement? Where’s the refund for our share of assets? #SkyPapers
TAX  @HMRCgovuk have been planning for #Brexit so even though most of you won't have jobs after Brexit you will be pleased to know that if you did still have one they could still take tax and national insurance from you.#NoDealBrexit #NoDealSurvival
This thread by @danieljohnsalt is mandatory reading, if you're interested in the #Brexit debate.We all have our own reasons, but this is a super awakening.h/t to @GeoffNorcott for noticing this.
If you want to get an understanding of #Trump’s collusion with Russia and how it relates to #Brexit, here is a great link. It’s the political scandal of our times 
What they certainly did NOT vote for was the Brexit In Name Only where we stayin the Customs Union and Single Market where unelected bureaucrats control our laws, borders and trade policy and pocketing billions of pounds for the privilege. #Brexit
Tory member support for May’s #Brexit plan fallsThe percentage believing that the white paper would be good for Britain if implemented has fallen to 27 per centThat thinking it would be bad for the country if implemented is up to 68 per cent
50 years!! Which bus was that written on?? #Brexit 
NUCLEAR after #Brexit there may be problems with nuclear safety as our nuclear power stations belong to @edfenergy and they're French! We anticipate some kind of armed stand off at stations and inevitable power cuts will follow. Stay inside.#NoDealSurvival #NoDealBrexit
No need to worry then."Officials admitted [...] they were unable to provide a count of the number of border officials employed for customs checks and they were unsure of whether the number had increased or decreased in recent years."#Brexit #NoDeal
Very proud of our skipper @nealerichmond picking up the award for “Senator of the season” in today’s @IrishTimes supposedly for his #Brexit work but more likely due to our parliamentary 6 nations win! 
A £9.3m pro-#EU publicity blitz by David Cameron's government in the run-up to the #Brexit referendum gave the #Remain side an unfair advantage, the like of which should be outlawed in future votes, an independent commission has suggested.
Problem: The majority  of the folks who voted for #Brexit ....they won't be here in 50 years. While the folks who weren't allowed to vote...they'll still be here.Or somewhere. #PrepareForANoDealBrexit
AVIATION If you are on a connecting flight in the EU,  perhaps going via Charles de Gaul or Schipol then you and your bags are going to have to get off the plane and be re-searched whilst, embarrassingly, the rest of the plane wait for you.#Brexit #NoDealBrexit #NoDealSurvival pic.twitter.com/DTfofWnkXr
Final scores on 2 Brexitometers we ran in #Barry & #Cowbridge today.Some interesting variations between 2 towns but v clear message: vast majority think #Brexit is disaster & they want #PeoplesVote@AlunCairns@SDoughtyMP@OwenSmith_MP@AtStalls@WalesForEurope@peoplesvote_uk
The government's pro-EU publicity blitz gave Remain an unfair advantage in the referendum, report finds:  #Brexit
Never thought of it like that but #Brexit really makes us the first country in the world daft enough to impose trade sanctions on ourself.
We were promised by Leave campaigners ALL the advantages of the Single Market at little or no cost.If @theresa_may cannot deliver that, her #ToryGangsters have NO mandate at all for #Brexit and a #PeoplesVote is essential
Caller tells Rees-Mogg the American Ambassador says all flights will be grounded in a 'no deal' #Brexit, as per international law, Rees-Mogg says trust Chris Grayling.Chris Grayling who screwed up prisons & can't run trains, THAT Chris Grayling? via @LBC
I for one hope we get a fair & balanced #Brexit - If we don’t we’ll need to start making and inventing things again. Such as Antibiotics, TVs,Telephones, Chocolate Bars, Cement, World Wide Web, Jet Engines, Refrigerators, Toothpaste, Lightbulbs, Tin Cans, Photography etc 
Away from #Brexit, the Labour Party is now being sued over its antisemitism  #bbcsp #marr
If he’s JUST a backbench member of Parliament why the hell is he given so much airtime? #ERG#Brexit 
The sound of a very large #Brexit penny dropping. 
A NO DEAL #Brexit would only cause very brief disruption when the UK left the European Union, a leading European economist said
1) Barnier said his officials now had dozens of questions about how May's #Brexit plan would work in practice2) France and Germany mocked May's weak grip on power3) Our Prime Minister has humiliated not just herself but the whole country. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg: “It's a question of timescale... The overwhelming opportunity for #Brexit is over the next 50 years."He's already making excuses for the impending disaster.And, as Keynes remarked: "In the long run, we're all dead."#PeoplesVote
#Brexit GlossaryTo "Crash Out":To Leave the #EU & go back to World Trade Organisation rules to trade in the same way we did before we were a member of the European Union & in the same way as we trade with American imports in the UK at the moment & in other parts of the world.
"Because you're proposing a very simple question on a very complex set of circumstances" - You do realise @Jacob_Rees_Mogg that you have very succinctly outlined one of the fundamental reasons why #Brexit should not be happening. #StopBrexit
What Rees-Mogg is really saying here is:'You lot might struggle for the next 50 years. But I won't.'By most standards, I will probably only live for another 50 years. So thanks Jacob, you've decided the rest of my life is worth pissing away for no benefit. #fbpe #brexit 
Sacrifices will have to be made, some will have to give up their jobs, food and lives for the greater good of the #Brexit cause, but for those that survive, they will be free from the tyranny of Brussels and free (almost) to enjoy a new utopian global Britain. 
WARNING perhaps the biggest threat to the success of #Brexit is remainer sabatours and @EU_Commission sympathisers, they can be anyone, a friend, a relative, a neighbour, report any suspicious activities now to your local #Brexit authority.#NoDealBrexit #NoDealSurvival
Resounding results from our #Brexitometer in #Truro today:Is #Brexit going well? >> NO!Will it be good for the NHS? >> NO!For jobs? >> NO!Do you trust Westminster to make up lost EU funding for #Cornwall? >> NO!Would you like a #PeoplesVote on any final deal? >>YES!
#brexit Conservative party & The Labour Party trying to stop Brexit everyday. PATHETIC both parties. 17 million voted  BREXIT. Leave The Customs Union, & The Single Market. Then you got GUARDIAN journalists, on TV everyday slagging off Brexit as well. Get on with it FFS. 
ATTENTION amateur radio hams your county needs you, in the run up to #Brexit we expect the UK to be flooded with spies from the @EU_Commission of course @GCHQ will be tracking them, but due to austerity cuts they could do with a hand. Sign up now!#NoDealBrexit #NoDealSurvival
Spotted at @CheltForEurope stall today - my local MP @AlexChalkChelt! He signed letter to @theresa_may along w 45 Tories demanding she listen to biz leaders re her #Brexit negotiating position. Here he is admiring the Brexitometer. When will he see sense and back a #PeoplesVote?
Rees Mogg is TELLING you you won’t benefit from #Brexit. People MIGHT do in 50 years. I am certain you didn’t vote to make your children poorer or to have to just get through as best they can. I’m not saying this. The chief Brexiteer is. Shouldn’t we have a say now #PeoplesVote
This should have everyone on high alert: alt-right boss Steve Bannon is moving to Brussels to infiltrate #EU politics more effectively. #brexit is part of his plan. we must #stopBrexit #FBPE  @BrexitBin @spaceangel1964 @uaf 
So Reesmogg is saying that there might be benefits resulting from #Brexit within 50 years. But he's not sure. We don't need to worry, then. 
Please do your own research and stop listening to the people trying to divide #MAGA  I have never been asked for a single red penny, @CONNOR4TRUMP is as #MAGA as any American just as I'm as #Brexit as anyone in Britain.  This man supports our @POTUS and all #MAGA We welcome all
Treason May paid Olly Robbins £20k Bonus, to oust David Davis from negotiations and water down #Brexit into #Brino#MAYMUSTGO Controversial Brexit civil servant handed big bonus by PM
Parties don't have to merge to get #Brexit.They just have to form a temporary #BrexitCoalition to ensure the 17.4m have just ONE candidate to vote for in each constituency.If we can mobilise the 17.4m to vote for #Brexit one more timewe can change politics in the UK forever.
Andrew Bridgen MP - “The Irish border issue is actually a complete construct to prevent the UK from having a free trade agreement that we want, a Canada++.”"The EU have done a free trade deal with Canada. Canada or Japan didn’t pay for the free trade deal." #Brexit 
Two years on from the referendum, as the facts continue to emerge, it is painfully clear that #Brexit will make us poorer both financially, and in terms of much needed EU health workers. There is no chance of the post-Brexit bonanza promised by the Cabinet joker, @BorisJohnson.
#imwithmay is basically the hashtag if you are myopically loyal to the point of you sacrificing your #Brexit and general political viewpoints because of fanaticism. Just saying #imnotwithmay#MAYMUSTGO#ChequersMeansCorbyn
The #EUreferendum vote was unsafe. Nobody gave informed consent for #Brexit. We didn’t have FULL KNOWLEDGE of all the RISKS; we didn't know about all the CONSEQUENCES; we were not given any choices on the Brexit ALTERNATIVES. We cannot proceed on this basis. Please RT. 
Thanks to your sick #Brexit policy, @theresa_may, I now feel more at home in mainland EU than in my actual home country, Britain. You have taken our country away from us.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote
Great story. How could Arron Banks afford to give millions to the Leave campaign when he was short of cash for his South African diamond mines? Spoiler: it has something to do with Russia. #Brexit 
Final result from @Best4Doncaster #Doncaster #Brexitometer: Remain AND leave voters are not happy with how #Brexit is going, don't think it'll be good for the #NHS or #Donny, and DO want a #PeoplesVote. Thank you @Femi_Sorry for joining us! @BestForBritain @DonnyFreePress
EU yes-man Hammond says Britain should be ready to give preferential treatment to all EU citizens in the future as the only way to secure a trade deal with EU.Has he forgotten the British people voted to be an independent nation capable of controlling our Borders after #Brexit? 
#Brexitometer result after two hours on the @ValeforEurope #PeoplesVote Day of Action stall in Barry this morning showing strong support for a People's Vote on the final #Brexit deal and many @AlunCairns constituents unhappy with the ongoing #brexitshambles.
We should take Trump's advice.#SueTheEUEU has £130bn in assets.UK is entitled to £58bn of that.@realDonaldTrump was right.UK should sue the EU for our share of the EU's assets after #Brexit.Why aren't the Gov demanding our share of EU assets?We have helped to pay for them.
And when the post #Brexit landscape doesn’t deliver what we want we will blame the Govt for not delivering when what we were expecting is impossible ... because it’s up to us (uk )not them (eu)
Calling @theresa_mayNo way are you ‘delivering the #Brexit people voted for’.My neighbour, for instance, voted Leave ‘cos Remain is going to win anyway’.Square that circle.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote
#Brexit won't stop you travelling to and settling in a EU country. 
Rather than a GE i'm coming more & more to the view that we need a government of national unity with @theSNP moderate conservatives, @LibDems, @Plaid_Cymru and some fantastic @UKLabour backbenchers (like @DavidLammy & @BenPBradshaw) all represented to sort out this #brexit mess!

London was only English region not to see rise in suicide after 2008 recession - warning that #mentalhealth impact of #Brexit will be greatest on people in poorer areas - roughly in proportion to distance from Westminster.
In a visit that was clearly organised and choreographed by the DUP and frankly, for the DUP, May had the audacity to refuse the EU version of backstop that SHE agreed to and then has the brass neck to suggest that the EU evolve? Theresa, you've had TWO YEARS #Brexit
After 2008 recession, suicide in England rose by 700 deaths/yr - reminder of how remote & reckless economic decisions track into lives of vulnerable people. #Brexit

You leave that really difficult job until the last minute. You keep putting it off and you start kidding yourself that it will be fine. Then you realise that you haven't got a clue how to do it and you’ve left it too late. That’s when you realise you are Theresa May.#Brexit
Andrea, I agree with you&Hammond is a disgrace to his office. But #remoaners are trying to stop or delay #Brexit. The vital thing is to leave on 29th March. We can live with lots of stuff short term. We can sort out the rest after we’ve left.

What's the difference between the devastation of the  blitz of WW2 and the devastation of #Brexit? The blitz wasn't self inflicted and couldn't have been avoided.
SENIOR civil servants in Downing Street bypassed #Brexit secretary David Davis in a bid to stop Britain leaving the EU, a former MP and senior aide has claimed. 
Leaver, Remainer, Inbetweener, or a tourist- doesn't matter. If you wish to know who's #Brexit it is & whom to 'thank' for it listen to this. Then follow @carolecadwalla's work & buy @J_amesp's #TheAlternativeWar. If not for self, your children, family & friends deserve the truth
Food expert warns #Brexit could lead to rationing ... and the UK is 'less prepared than in 1939'.Nobody voted for poverty and starvation. 
If the UK Gov is issuing guidelines to people on how to prepare for a No Deal #Brexit , I think @NicolaSturgeon and the @scotgov should be writing to Scottish business and households with what we’re going to do to protect ourselves. It’s time to show some leadership.
So it's come to comparing #Brexit to 2 tragic world wars. Just over two years ago we were finally recovering from a long economic recession. A leading member of the EU, we had every opportunity to forge a better future for our citizens & to be a force for good in the world.Sad!
You are out with a group of friends. Some want to go dancing. Others want a quiet drink somewhere. You end up in a noisy pub, that has no dance floor. Nobody is happy. This is #Brexit

I'm not sure which is more infantile: comparing #Brexit to the 1st & 2nd World Wars or likening EU leaders to the mafia. Good night.
It’s time to consider civil or criminal prosecutions of @BBCNews executives for their part in deliberately covering up and propagating the Russian funded #Brexit fraud.  The establishment is fatally corrupted 
RT the hell out of this one...the #Brexit cheats can't be allowed to get away with it... 
We strongly recommend all businesses should plan for the possibility of a no deal #Brexit. It is not certain, but it is, in our view, more likely than when we published our recent report. 
.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg likens EU to the Mafia.Jacob, some of your fellow #Brexit campaigners were colluding with Putin's Mafia state.And your investment firm has a large stake in a Kremlin-linked bank that arranged for one of them to buy into a Russian diamond mining operation. 
A no deal #Brexit would serve Putin, Trump & a transatlantic faction of the super-rich who see taxes as theft & democratic states as thieves. A no deal #Brexit by grossly harming the nation to the advantage of foreign powers would surely be an act of treason. #StopBrexit #FBPE
These Autocrats must be stopped...there is no basis for any valid #Brexit let alone this one..it has nothing to do with the Will of the Ppl & everything to do with the will of a handful of ideologues allowed to get away with it by craven MPs. #PeoplesVote

Hysteria over Varadkar aviation comments doesn’t fly  @bbcnewsnight #brexit

John Major puts it in a nutshell: Vote Leave promised things that could never have been realised.If you voted #Leave, please watch this.  #Brexit can’t be done. 
Dominic Raab faced ridicule on his first trip to Brussels as #Brexit Secretary as the EU flatly rejected Theresa May’s Chequers plan and mocked spelling errors in translations of the document. 
60 British MPs - the far right Brexiteers - are holding 500 million people to ransom. That is the true state of #Brexit.It should and must be stopped.#bbcnewsten
In a swipe to British politicians, Ms Bishop said she "looked forward to a time when the UK feels free to make statements beyond those issued by the European Union". #Brexit

My Op Ed piece on Mrs May's diminishing options in delivering a good #Brexit via tomorrow's @Telegraph
Trying to work out how May is asking the EU not to fall back on unworkable positions? Does she mean the Single Market & Customs Union?Both seem to be working rather well for the EU as they do for us.The unworkable position is held by the Govt & anyone backing #Brexit.#Remain
By cheering #Brexit, dissing the #EU, suggesting #NATO is obsolete, departing #Syria, trying to get on with #Putin, #Trump is threatening the entire U.S. foreign policy establishment.  For if there is no war on and no war wanted, what does a War Party do?
Brussels says its #Brexit red lines are clearly incompatible with Theresa May’s proposal 
Fascinating ‘end of year report’ from our @EdinburghSNP MPs @DeidreBrock & @TommySheppard. Updates on the chaos that is #Brexit, #walkouts & the Scotland Office’s huge spend on social media advertising. Ably chaired by @DenisDixonSNP. They’re doing an excellent job on our behalf.
Heard a Brexshiter state on @LBC that they don't care what the consequences of #Brexit are, they just want their country back. Troll, because no ordinary decent person would be so selfish.
UNWORKABLE.  Barnier shoots down May's pathetic dead and buried sellout, because they want to dig up the bones and gnaw on them.  He then lies that May fudge is "too competitive"   OUTRIGHT LIE.  EU set on our outright ruin.  @borisjohnson #borisjohnson #boris johnson  #Brexit

When @Anna_Soubrytalks about 'forces of darkness' her explicit reference is to Tory #BrexiteersShe is also implicitly insulting every single one of the 17.4 million who voted for #Brexit -  including the majority in her Broxtowe constituency
The majority of the electorate do not want @theresa_may & her civil servant's #Chequersplan.Hawking it around the country during the summer will not make it any more acceptable, as it does not deliver the Lancaster House #Brexit & the Conservative Party 2017GE manifesto promise
1. Absurd to say #VoteLeave illegal spend didn't affect #brexit results. Ads were highly coordinated - decades of advertising science were behind that campaign.2. Comparing LEGAL govt spend with your ILLEGAL spend is like comparing the car I BOUGHT to the one you STOLE. #c4news

The effects of #Brexit on the Irish border have been absolutely clear for a very very long time. Ireland and the EU have stated it as clearly as it is possible to state anything - over and over again. Why is this only just sinking in to Theresa May?  #C4news
Logically, only one of these #Brexit statements can be true. 1. We are deeply enmeshed in the systems of the EU and we have lost control of our country.2. It's not that big a deal if we leave without a withdrawal agreement, trade will carry on as normal.
Australian Foreign Affairs Minister, @JulieBishopMP, has confirmed that the #UK and #Australia are ready to agree a free trade deal as soon as the UK leaves the #EU in 2019.#CANZUK #cdnpoli #auspol #nzpol #ukpoli #Brexit
The reasons these #Brexit negotiations are doomed isn't due to a lack of trying or our weak leadership. The UK has bent over backwards to accommodate the EU, but ultimately the European Union craves power & not a deal. They'll put their political project above all.
Whatever you think of Tony Blair I think we can all agree with him on this one:- "This #Brexit agenda is being driven by a Government in more chronic disarray than any Government I've literally ever seen in my lifetime in the western world.."#StopBrexit #FBPE
Steve, both the Lib Dems (£18,000) & @Open_Britain (£1,250) were fined for breaching campaign finance rules during the EU #Referendum. I guess that doesn’t fit the Remoaner agenda? #Brexit

I'm not sure the EU negotiators would be too happy at being compared to the Mafia ?BTW - what description would you attach to the ERG ?You know who I mean - the *cabal* that's calling the shots for a hard #Brexit Funded I believe from the member MPs individual allowances. 
How did remain lie pray? They didn't promise anything.They just warned about what is beginning to happen now. I wish with all my heart #Brexit was beneficial for the majority but it is & always was evident to anyone knowing the EU that it is/was  a disaster #StopBrexitSaveBritain
The choice is either: We remain in the EU and prosper or, we leave the EU and spend decades trying to recover our economy.That is the choice we face. There is no other.I say remain. #FBPE #StopBrexit #Brexit
Clearly May in the six counties is simply an exercise to appease the DUP,  nothing more.Hopefully those in the south playing party politics with #Brexit will now realise their pontificating about SF taking Westminster seats is pointless.Get on top of the real issues.

Although strangely, it didn't stop Somerset Capital Management, a firm that you helped to found, establish an investment fund in Ireland ahead of #Brexit. You hypocritical little shit.
'It's a whole mess': expats on #Brexit @SkyNews. [Editorial note: 'expats' = British in Europe; 'immigrants' = Europeans in the UK]
In a previous life this warmongering shitstain on our democracy would have been sending the troops over the top to a certain death - while sipping a G&T miles away from the front. You #Brexit fools....... 
EU & Irish PM are playing a dangerous gameThey're using #Brexit as a way to split off N Ireland from rest of the UK.40 non-EU countries have a land border with EU without any problems.Irish border issue is a fake issue with a sinister aim.N Ireland will always  be part of UK.
Varadkar - Va-rad-karBarnier - Bar-nee-ai(r)Banc Ceannais na hEireann - Ban-kh Can-ass nah hair-in (that's the Irish central bank, in the mafia-like EU, which regulates your Somerset capital vehicle which you established in Ireland in May 2018 to protect you against #Brexit)

Mrs May, you've had your reply from the EU, your infantile solution won't fly, it never would.Two choices lie ahead1) You crash the UK out of the EU and take the economy, jobs and people's futures with it.2) You grow a pair and kick #Brexit into the long grass.

I don't particularly care what the Chancellor thinks. Maybe if he stopped trying to thwart Brexit, we wouldn't need to ask such direct questions, seeking clarity for the 17.4 mil people who voted to leave. I sincerely hope #Brexit doesn't mean Remain. We must keep our promises.

It is not that "the #brexit they wanted" can not be delivered, it's that it could never be delivered because it was never based in fact. It was always a fantasy and now reality proves that.  It can not be the will of the people because it doesn't exist.  #FBPE

Mr Javid is a proven and habitual liar.He is our Home Secretary.Ms May is a proven and habitual liar.She is our prime minister.Mr Smith is the Tory Chief Whip. He rigs votes in parliament.Mr Raab is #Brexit Secretary. He can't circulate papers on time.#GE18
And no transition period....not looking good...what a stubborn disingenuous PM we have. A great leader would be able to say #Brexit ain't working, it can't be made to work & here's why. We need to ak the Ppl if they still want it or are prepared to #Remain with the best deal.
1. I cannot contain my loathing of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson and John Redwood et al. They are wreckers and liars manipulating the stupid and the easily led. #Brexit thread.
This. Exactly. Sums up the conflict for many @UKLabour supporters.It's also why I can't support #Labour under #Corbyn with his pro #Brexit stance.  
1/ It's all very well-worked out tactically, but you're not going to stop Remainers laying into the Labour front bench when one of them talks about a good #Brexit deal, or a jobs first Brexit, or rejects the #PeoplesVote, and of course any such response will target Corbyn.
The Brexit problem. #Brexit 
I follow some Conservatives who are pro EU, I follow many in @UKLabour who are unequivocally pro EU. I do not respect those claiming to respect a vote that was obtained by cheating & breaking the law, who deny us a #PeoplesVote & who want #Brexit. I am #FBPE
Should Britain one day be saved from the disaster that is #Brexit, the credit will not go to any politician, since virtually all have abdicated, but to heroic journalists like @carolecadwalla, who, through their dogged pursuit of truth, have uncovered its underlying criminality.

I work with many firms who span the Irish 'border'.Not a single one is concerned about threats of a "Hard Border" because it is literally nonsense.All the NI 'issues' being raised are done so purely as a barrier to #Brexit, not for any realistic reason.Keep calm, carry on. 
Any UK politician who had a hand in delivering Anglo Irish, Downing Street Declaration or GFA must be utterly appalled at reckless and almost wanton act of expedient political vandalism by May towards NI. She's spent what little political capital she had at behest of DUP #Brexit
For Theresa May to suggest that backstop is "constitutional dislocation" is not only wholly inaccurate, but is dangerously divisive. Nationalists, unionists and others all agree need for backstop. I'm sorry, this just reads like DUP  propaganda. Reckless in the extreme #Brexit

This is just insulting. British Prime Minister claims backstop is a breach of GFA. Imposing #Brexit is the breach. And while we are on breaches what about an Irish Language act agreed in St. Andrews, Legacy agreed at Stormont etc.

Important. For the EC to consider a permanent European citizenship, in addition to a national one, a million signatures from at least 7 EU countries will be needed. The petition opens on 23 July. Even if it'd be too late for #Brexit, it's in the interest of all other EU citizens. 
EU Bosses warn Mrs May her White Paper “will not form basis” of any Brexit deal so UK will have to Leave EU after all...UK would then trade WTO rules same as EU does for non-EU countries.Both #EU AND 17.4m #Brexit voters brand White Paper ‘unacceptable’.

#Tories #cheating to get votes through parliament. Tory cabinet on the board of the #Leave campaign that cheated to obtain the #Brexit result.How can #May continue as #PM unless she sacks those conspiring to #cheat in both votes. By doing nothing she is condoning their actions.

Worse.  No-one claimed that the will of the people was for a nuclear war. We now seem to have a government who would rather spend money on leaflets and half-baked contingency planning than simply stand up and admit that #Brexit is just not workable
No Deal= WTO global trading same as EU does for most trade outside EU.Crash out= Leaving without paying EU £39bn!Fall off cliff edge= Carry on as we do today in other non-EU countries.Disorderly #Brexit= Leave without paying: annoys #EU but good for us!
Daniel, we had a general election last year where Kate stood for re-election and was voted back in with a large majority. Her constituents knew full well her views on this topic as she played a large role in the #Brexit debate and they still voted for her
1/ The EU have published their general preparedness note for no deal #Brexit. And it looks very bleak on the #citizensrights for the 3.6m EU citizens in the UK and 1.2m @BritishInEurope.
When you say crash out, you mean, the #Brexit that was voted for in the referendum ?

Irish PM says Irish govt making contingency plans for "the unlikely event of a no-deal hard Brexit". No EU leader has done more to obstruct a smooth #Brexit than the Irish PM, none has made a no-deal Brexit more likely than him. What planet does he live on? 
The country has no effective government.The Conservatives' #Brexit strategy is incoherent and reckless.The prime minister's position is now untenable.It is in the national interest for Theresa May to ask the Labour leader to agree to an early election.

I see the EU is now warning the EU27 to get ready for the disruptions and long queues for goods and people crossing UK/EU borders in the event of a no deal #Brexit. Indeed it is also warning that disruption to supplies will occur in any case, even is a deal is reached.
Babysteps to understanding, for the media and public, of the multiple concurrent Russian intelligence #HUMINT operations of #TrumpRussia #Brexit and other related efforts... 
For those of you with a bit more stamina and undiminished interest in #brexit #IrishBorder, here's a long read from @DPhinnemore and me.
Countries we have historic links with, such as India, continue to grow exponentially. One of the most petrifying prospects of #Brexit not being delivered is remaining trapped behind the EU's protectionist walls and missing out. We would be sacrificing the future!
It always comes back to this. Why people who live in poverty believe that the wealthy will work to give them a slice of their wealth is beyond me. The few that do are definitely NOT in politics. #IndyRef2 #Brexit 
The government is having to rely on such low tactics to keep winning votes. There is no parliamentary majority for any sort of #Brexit. We need a #PeoplesVote
so the Irish Gov says even if no deal they wont impose a hard border EU says they wont either & UK says they wont as well , seems the border issue is sorted #brexit so WTF was all slabbering about if all now agree deal or no deal no hard border
The #Chequers #Brexit plan has gone done like a bucked of sick in Brussels @EurasiaGroup Mij Rahman tells clients in latest note.
The reason there's no contingency plan is because there is / was never any intention of the UK Leaving, despite the referendum.Boris is correct "it was not too late to save #Brexit" but ultimately we need a Brexiteer at the helm. 
#Brexit whistleblower sues Taxpayers' Alliance and reveals nine organisations "all based out of or with links to the same London address" met regularly to strategise. That address is 55 Tufton Street. Read more:

A "no deal" #Brexit would spell disaster for the UK, but the Government are now actively preparing for it.This is why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Support the campaign by signing the @peoplesvote_uk petition:

yes 'stick to science'...and leave politics to the experts... like those running #Brexit ... oh wait.... 
Remainers will never get it .. we don't care about doomsday threats, ridiculous predictions, plagues of locusts etc. The majority voted #Brexit and to end EU interference in our lives .. We want our Country back .. deal or #NoDeal

One of the (many) problems with the Brexit is that the manifesto turned up 7 months after the vote (Lancaster House) & was rejected at the Election (May lost majority). 2nd manifesto (Chequers/White Paper) launched 2 YRS after vote. Attacked by all sides.#brexit #BrexitChaos
More evidence of a shameful dereliction of duty by Gov Ministers at #Brexit questions. No analysis done of the impact on profitability, job creation potential and ability to export to the EU of the services sector if either the Chequers agreement or No Deal is implemented #FBPE
John Redwood: #Brexit language“No Deal” is WTO global trading as used by #EU with non-EU states.“Crash out” is Remain phrase to describe Leaving without paying EU £39bnNo crash, More cash!“Fall off cliff edge” is just another meaningless Remain phrase.

 A must read article by @FraserNelson. The PM’s plan for #Brexit at Lancaster House was excellent. Yet we’ve not even tried to negotiate with it. The alternative to the #ChequersPlan has been there all along. So let’s stick to the PM’s original plan that had huge party support.

Every time #TheresaMay finds herself in trouble over #Brexit and her other failures police very conveniently release more information about their supposed' 'progress' in their farcical investigation into the poisoning of Sergei Skripal  and his daughter. This is becoming absurd.
How did we get to this point? The UK government will shortly be issuing literature advising its cutizens how to protect themselves from the negative impacts of the governments own #Brexit policies.If you were watching a film about it, you'd say the plot was unbelievable.
Tory Brexiter lying, their rage at the Article 50 court case, their loathing of the ECJ and ECHR and this, all indicate a party faction with a serious disrespect for rules, and therefore, as democracy is based on rules, a serious contempt for democracy. #PeoplesVote #Brexit 
Daily Briefing: - Skripal Novichok poisoning suspects identified - report- PM May visits Northern Ireland to offer border reassurance- UK's new #Brexit minister goes to Brussels
Of course. When we show confidence, pride and belief in our #nation - like May did in Lancaster House speech - the world and markets notice. #Brexit will be a huge success if we believe in #Britain.

'It's not too late to save #Brexit', Boris Johnson tells UK parliament 
1. Boris Johnson is right about one thing. #Brexit does need saving. From people like him. On present trajectory there is virtually no change of it no being a disaster purely because the complexity is beyond the abilities of this administration.
Exciting news!  A commitment from May & Gove to put green rhetoric into law.  This gives us a real shot at a #GreenerUK, if the Act is ambitious & if the UK-EU deal ensures continued environmental cooperation after #Brexit 
Barrage of questions awaiting new #Brexit secretary on his maiden visit to Brussels. My thoughts: 
Now medicine licensed in the UK is valid in the rest of the EU & vice versa thanks to common standards but in #Brexit? We raised this issue in the run up to the Ref but the UK press wouldn’t run with it. AstraZeneca to stockpile drugs for Brexit - BBC News 
“It’s not too late to save #Brexit”@BorisJohnson has expressed the sense of betrayal felt by ordinary voters He understands that this is the only chance: it won’t be possible to reopen a “botched” treaty in 18 months’ time#BrexitIsBack#BackBoris4Brexit #MayMustGo
The anti-Brexit bias of @BBCr4today is demonstrated yet again by the way it repeatedly refers to 'crashing out' of the EU, rather than 'leaving' it. Even the biased anti-Brexit Electoral Commission agreed to the word 'Leave' on the EU referendum ballot paper. #BBC #Brexit
BBC reports that @DominicRaab will continue negotiations with the EU's Michel Barnier Leavers know that this is merely window-dressing. In reality, arch-Remainer Olly Robbins is Theresa May's appointed #Brexit wrecker

Pharmacists preparing to stockpile medicines after warning over  no-deal #Brexit 
Boris Johnson delivered a statesman-like resignation speech, urging the PM to deliver the positive #Brexit promised at Lancaster House, not the BRINO of her #ChequersPlan.This was no leadership bid, but a warning shot, from a PM-in-waiting.
Question for those public figures who say "I don't like the result but we must respect the referendum on #Brexit" What corruption threshold needs to be passed before you say "no, enough's enough - it must be stopped"Do you really want to be remembered for defending this stain? 
So why the hell is her majesty’s opposition party not opposing #Brexit. Talk really is cheap Yvette. We are running out of time. #baffled too
Just a thought..re #Brexit has anyone yet heard Theresa May, or for that matter Jeremy Corbyn, utter the phrase:"We're going to get you a BETTER DEAL"?Seems to me that really would be the only reason to justify this utter #BrexitShambles & the denial of a Democratic #FinalSay
Or to put it another way, if overspending by Vote Leave and Leave EU, coordination between campaigns, dark psychometric ads by #CambridgeAnalytic and massive Russian interference changed the minds of just ONE in 50 voters, it swung the vote for #Brexit 
Shut up Boris! You're one of the main people who got us into this mess, then didn't make much progress on #Brexit while Foreign Secretary. Forget saving Brexit, this is now about saving our nation's future from an unnecessary manufactured crisis. #FBPE

I am in full support of @darrenpjones call for a judge-led public inquiry into the #Brexit referendum. Four current Cabinet Secretaries, inc current Brexit Sec, were on Campaign Committee of Vote Leave - that org that has now been referred to police. They must explain or resign. 
40 YEARS! I voted for Labour, I wish I could take every single vote back, you have backed the Tories all the way through #Brexit and shat on Scotland, You’re done.
Theresa May's new #Brexit chief called to 'turn back the clock' on workers' rights. This is what #Brexit is all about, a #BrexitTaxHaven, a paradise for the rich in which wealth gives them all the rights they have robbed from us. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Former UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson just gave the best and most important speech of his life: the one that might, with luck, save #Brexit

Fraudulent? #Remain was backed by government funding. Plenty of working class people voted for #Leave. You all said the UK economy would fall apart once #brexit was announced. Here we are with the best unemployment figures for 43 years and 21 consecutive quarters of GDP growth.

In the past 48 hrs - anti Labour FBPE trolls seem to have desisted in their demands that Corbyn STOP #Brexit.Could that be because Farron & Cable FAILED to turn up for a key vote ?Or MAYBE they're planning a campaign to RE-RUN the World Cup - so as to get the result they want ?

Theresa May at the Liaison Committee was asked about the European Health Card and the possibility of grounded aircraft if the Rees-Mogg's get their no deal #Brexit, she didn't have a clue, think about that, not a clue, she must go #GE2018Now and Parliament must suspend Article 50

As I have told you, I will not commit (as an ex #Brexit voter) to voting #Labour unless you support a #PeoplesVote in which I would now vote #Remain We need to escape this brexit madness . I live in a Labour held marginal.
The hectic #Brexit events of this past week raise big Qs for NI/IRL.Here @DPhinnemore & I  assess the state of play re: #WhitePaper, #CustomsBill, & #backstop for @BorderIrish.  In sum: ERG amendments have killed neither the White Paper nor a backstop.
'@andreajenkyns asked the key question at #PMQs today: ‘When did #Brexit come to mean #Remain?’ The @Conservatives will rue the day @theresa_may allowed this to happen. Fate will not be kind to them! #MayMustGo #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress #theresamay @DCBMEP #Tory

Boris demolishes May's #Brexit shambles“Let us aim again explicitly for that glorious vision of Lancaster House, not the miserable, permanent limbo of Chequers.”
#Boris resignation speech simply sought to put him ahead of JRM & DD as captain of the NoDeal #Brexit team. Staggering failure to accept complexity &detail of Brexit, given his ringside seat for 2 years. Having left his own job - his proposed Brexit would see 1000s lose theirs.
HEART FELT PLEA made with sincerity and dignity by @BorisJohnson in Parl. THERE IS STILL TIME to deliver true #Brexit  and everything is possible is his message.Moving and truthful.  .    #borisjohnson #boris johnson  #Brexit 
"We should not be stampeded by anyone" - @BorisJohnson tells parliament in his resignation speech that the government 'should believe in Britain'Follow that latest #Brexit fallout here: 
"It is not too late to save Brexit"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson says government has time to change its position on #Brexit talks 
#Boris says that PM is delivering #Brexit in name only.But it is not too late to save Brexit.The Gov has not even tried to make a free trade agreement with the EU.Boris said he had a glorious vision of a strong,independent self governing Great Britain.
The government 'dithered' on turning the Lancaster House speech into a #Brexit negotiating position says @BorisJohnson
Historic and excellent  personal statement from @BorisJohnson - There is still time to save #Brexit if the PM can hold to the pledges she made at Lancaster House. Absolutely spot on. #GlobalBritain 
"In the 18 months that have followed it is like a fog of self doubt has descended"Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson says government never turned Theresa May's Lancaster House vision of #Brexit into a negotiating position 
Now @BorisJohnson setting out how the UK will be economic vassal to EU and not being able to have full free tradeIt is not too late to save #Brexit we have never tried to do so. We must do so now
Sitting listening here, Boris Johnston seems to completely have no use of self reflection, repose or indeed regret for his wrecking behaviours from Vote Leave to leaving the Foreign Office.  This is no valedictory speech but an admission of failure with a No Deal #brexit
Resignation statement of @BorisJohnson deep in denial of reality of situation regarding Irish border & Good Friday agreement #Brexit
Japan did not have to pay £39 billion?Japan did not have to sign up to a customs union. Japan did not have to sign up to the single market. Japan did not have to agree to free movement of people. this destroys Remain arguments for staying in anything EU related? #brexit
The exact antithesis to the vote in the U.K. Parliament yesterday designed to keep U.K. citizens in the dark. #Brexit 
BREAKING: @RuthDavidsonMSP has just announced that she meant to say we are NOT being sold a lie. Apparently #Brexit is awesome and we should embrace it.#BrexitShambles
Did the extra money used by the Vote Leave campaign make a difference to the #Brexit referendum outcome? Professor John Curtice of @UniStrathclyde gives @BBCPM his thoughts.
Don't dismiss the danger from the Populist Right Bigots & Charlatans who have cowed moderates 4 fear of backlash;Oppose them & this #Brexit!It has 2B put back for a #FinalSay & #Remain option to stop them.Some will protest violently- so arrest them!
Dear fellow Brits, no sign that German media is slowing on the #Brexit jokes. @Jack_Blanchard_ @kate_day
Next time some runt tells you that 17.4m voted for the #brexit fantasy, ask them how many want #brexit now that we know the reality. Forget the polls, they're bullshit. The reality is no one wants this shit. Most just want it gone and if we bin it tomorrow they'll be happy #FBPE
So if (us) British voters are too thick and uneducated to answer a simple Leave-Remain question correctly, how will these stupid voters be able to answer the far more complicated 3-part question Justine Greening proposes in her second EU referendum?#Brexit 
The bonkers #FBPE brigade would have us believe there is no difference between Jeremy Corbyn's position on #Brexit and Theresa May's. The PM clearly disagrees. At #PMQs today she listed all the differences. It was a very long list. It included not ruling out a 2nd referendum.
Very strong performance indeed at #PMQs from Conservative Prime Minister @Theresa_May - Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn absolutely rinsed on #Brexit 
David Davis now asking for DExEU to publish reports? The same David Davis who blocked me at very turn to publish the impact studies. #Brexit 
Here it is in black & white... sobering figures. #Brexit means Brexit? Bullshit. It means catastrophe plain & simple. 2nd referendum is the only answer to this god forsaken mess.

As an aside, I walked around Derrynane (south west Kerry) earlier and bumped into an English couple who asked what was happening in the house. Mentioned it was a special #brexit cabinet meeting, and the guy's eyes seemed to scream "I can't even get away from it down here". 
WATCH: Momentum is building. Increasing numbers of Conservative politicians are backing a #PeoplesVote to give the public a say on the final #Brexit deal 
A second referendum would be an insult to the people, a stunt worthy of a banana republic:  #Brexit
.@SteveBakerHW at #PMQs we know exactly what the ERG are up to. The ERG want a hard #Brexit and No Deal, even though it will be disastrous for British jobs and livelihoods. If the UK crashes out of the EU, the ERG will be responsible. #FBPE
As TM caves in time and again to her #Brexit extremists, she increasingly resembles the black knight in Monty  Python and the Holy Grail. As they hack off limb after limb“'tis just a flesh wound” she cries. No-one’s fooled any more #FBPE
Winning the #PeoplesVote won't be enough. We need to use this moment to utterly change our country and to reverse the tide of nationalism that is flooding over the world. On 8 Sep in #Leeds we will be debating how to do this, at the Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference. #gnsbc
Jeremy Corbyn has a theory why the new #Brexit secretary Dominic Raab stayed away from major EU talks in Brussels this week #PMQs 
Zombie Prime Minister, capitulating to remain on #Brexit, disastrous #ChequersPlan, mass resignations and the PM still destroys #Corbyn in #PMQS I am Tory, but my god, our democracy is crying out for a decent opposition.

Looks like the country is #remainernow based on polling based on the 3 way #peoplesvote suggested by @JustineGreening So if #brexit is both not the #willofthepeople and on (the vast majority of independent and the government's own) economic analysis bad for UK, why continue?
OBR confirms government is LYING about there being a #Brexit dividend for the NHS. That's the big fat lie on the side of the bus that Gove, Johnson, Davis and Fox told.Come on #Leavers / #Brexiters / #Quitlings defend this lie. Explain yourselves.
Stunning poll of 25k voters on #Brexit. Highlights:- 91% unhappy with negotiations- 10% of Leavers want to Remain (only 3% Remainers want to Leave)- 78% of those who didn’t/couldn’t vote want to RemainThe people have changed their will!#PeoplesVote

Thought provoking contribution from @iainmacwhirter. It’s important for future #indyref that we take a strong stand against the idea that it’s acceptable for a referendum to be won by lies & cheating #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope
excellent interview by @Just_RichardB on Sky News this morning - working class people will be let down by #Brexit and the promises which have been made by the Brexiters will not bear fruition - a very fair point for there to be a #PeoplesVote on the final deal @peoplesvote_uk
#TeamJunckerEU today: Important news on #InvestEU #JunckerPlan; European Citizens Initiatives #EUTakeTheInitiative; #EUTrade, #Brexit updates; a major antitrust decision. @EIB President Werner Hoyer visits the College.

#May govt. crumbling around her, #Brexit is in shambles, #Labour are ahead in the polls, there's talk of a "no confidence" vote in the PM & maybe a new General Election.BOOM. More fake #antisemitism nonsense to undermine #Corbyn and keep him out of No. 10. What a coincidence.
There are lies, Edam lies and statistics? Now Project Fear says CHEESE will become a “luxury good”after #Brexit?  
Once more, for emphasis: if you want to be kept informed about #Brexit, don't simply rely on the UK press and the BBC - read the @IrishTimes and @Independent_ie too. (Photo HT: @StevePeers)
There is no case for a #secondreferendum. Just like there is no case for a second general election if there is a close win for the victors. There was a vote, the electorate spoke - it’s called democracy - move on. #brexit 
No-one seems to be reporting this, but the look on #Corbyn’s face when the #Remain amendment fell, was incredible.Proper #Brexit and no General Election. He then skunk out of the Chamber looking a broken man.
Shameful bullying tactics to oust @KateHoeyMP and the few principled #Brexit supporting #Labour MPs. It is worth remembering around two thirds of Labour seats voted Leave. @labourleave
Dominic Grieve - If we got to the point where it was clear there was no deal then there would be a major political crisis & in those circumstances Parliament would exert its authority... there is a majority in Parliament that will prevent a no deal #brexit... #FBPE #StopBrexit

#Brexit could lead to nearly 3 MILLION jobs being lost in the UK, costing the economy over £150 BILLION each year.This is not 'fake news'. This is not 'Project Fear'.This is what the Brexit MPs have admitted.Nobody who voted Leave wanted this. We were lied to.#PeoplesVote
1/3 When someone of @NSoames standing states we need a Govt of national unity I listen. He’s right - events this week have created v serious #Brexit crisis. PM secured support for #ChequersAgreement & then scuppered it by accepting amendments from hard no deal Brexiteers
Jeremy Corbyn has nothing to say about electoral fraud . if the leader of an opposition ignores electoral fraud then fraud will be used against them and therefore corbyn isn't  interested in power Clearly the man would rather see #brexit than a labour government
Before we get into Day 2 of the abstention debate. Those on the Remain side of the debate should keep our eyes on the real people to blame for this #Brexit mess.  The Leave campaign who had no clueThe British govt who have no plan The hard Brexitiers who don't care.
At least we have got our country back innit, and the King and Queen can make all our Laws innit #brexit

There would be nothing wrong with the ERG putting their wish for an ultra-free market economy to the public in a general election. But it is wholly crooked and dishonest for them to try to smuggle it in under concerns about immigration & sovereignty.#Brexit #FBPE #StopBrexit
How is Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has never held any government office, who has lied to us, who will be taking his money out of the UK for safety, who has no mandate for a hard #Brexit, running our country? Please tell me how this is not a right-wing coup. 
It's showdown day for the PM.  Last night four Labour rebels kept Theresa May in No10 and avoided triggering a potential no-confidence vote. Here's @danbloom1 with what to expect on another action packed day on the #Brexit front  
How is Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has never held any government office, who has lied to us, who will be taking his money out of the UK for safety, who has no mandate for a hard #Brexit, running our country? Please tell me how this is not a right-wing coup.
As a @UKLabour supporter for 40 years I’m disgusted that I am hearing more from Tories like Anna Soubry, Phillip Lee and even Nicholas Soames on how to protect the people of this country from the disaster of #Brexit than I am from our leader @jeremycorbyn
.And now a proponent of all this says there should be a National Unity Gov’t to stop #Brexit and seriously says that @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is running the country.I fear this Remainer is truly deranged!
Look forward to hearing @STVNews @BBCScotlandNews explain to viewers/listeners the amendments brought by their majority snp mps elected representatives over the last 2 days and how they were voted down in WM #brexit
Only people I trust on Brexit, are brave socialists who reluctantly voted leave to stick it to Liberals and remain voters who are rightly disgusted by #FPBE and themselves. Anyone who proudly voted for either option is scum in my eyes. #Brexit
Let's be absolutely crystal fucking clear, a No Deal #Brexit is the very worst possible outcome for our country. 2,800,000 jobs is only the tip of the iceberg. It cannot and must not be allowed to happen. Nobody, voted to be poorer, to be jobless. @UKLabour, do your fucking job.

Please answer me this Brexiteers. When you cast your eyes upon the chaos, fraud, backstabbing, cheating, lying and bitching going on at Westminster, do you not agree that sovereignty maybe overrated? Do you really want to take back control and give it to these imbeciles? #Brexit
Have you lost the plot @Anna_Soubry? “Include the sensible SNP in a government of national unity”. You realise that the SNP only exist to break up the nation? All for unity, but they are the opposite of it. Be very careful with my country please #Brexit #IndyRef2
.@Anna_Soubry on fire on @BBCRadio4 #Today - calling for a Government of National Unity and claiming @Jacob_Rees_Mogg is running the country. #Brexit.

No matter how bad things seem, no matter how low you feel, now is nothing compared to where we will be if #Brexit is allowed to proceed unchecked. Do not give up, do not give in. We will prevail, Brexit must not. I will not give up, I will not give in. Stand with me.
It would have been sensible to have worked out the “how” before plunging all of us into prolonged chaos and uncertainty.   #Brexit may  seem to you to be a “faith” but some of us still believe in evidence based policy making.  You have produced no evidence at all. 
Graham Stringer, the Labour MP now working with Jacob Rees-Mogg's ERG to secure a hard #Brexit, is also a climate change "sceptic".This is something he shares with almost all the leading Brexiters. #ClimateChange denial comes very easily to people contemptuous of evidence.

7 in 10 Tory constituencies voted Leave.6 in 10 Labour constituencies voted Leave.Dear Tory and Labour parties, if you cannot deliver a real #Brexit despite these numbers, you are not fit to govern, you are not part of British democracy.You'd've destroyed British democracy! 
Latest YouGov poll for The Times shows why Brexiters are desperate to avoid a #PeoplesVote, despite clear evidence that the #Brexit referendum was tainted by extensive criminality.They know they would lose. The lies just aren't working any  more.#StopBrexit #Newsnight
This no longer has anything to do with Brexit or the future prosperity of Britain or British people or sovereignty. It's about the Tories clinging on to power. #brexit
Westminster #Brexit vote to keep UK in the Customs Union lost by five votes tonight. Sinn Fein's 7 MPs could have changed Brexit completely, safeguarding Northern Ireland & jobs in the Republic.
You voted with fascists and you will be tried with fascists. Even the '1000 year Reich' only lasted 12 1/2 years. History will not be kind to those who enabled #Brexit and destroyed the UK. 
On the day the Electoral Commission decides Vote Leave broke the law, the majority of Tory MPs voted to save their careers, even though it means driving through the most extreme, insane version of a mandate that we now know was corrupted. #Brexit
Just getting my head around last 48 hrs. @ScotTories voted against their own constituents, @LabourParty voted to keep @Conservatives in power and Parliament voted itself out of sovereignty and threw the UK off a cliff. Do I have that right? #brexit #YouYesYet
I would like to thank those democracy supporting Labour MPs for honouring their manifesto commitment and the Conservative manifesto commitment to leaving the Customs Union. Shame @Anna_Soubry didn't feel able to support her own party AGAIN. Are you listening @BroxtoweCons #Brexit

Jeremy Corbyn has voted against the Labour Whip 428 times. His he going to be first against the wall comrade. Grow up and put your toys back in the pram. Oh and #brexit 
Whatever your view on #Brexit, the way this Government has treated @UKParliament on the issue, especially in the last couple of days, is bad for democracy and a betrayal of everyone in our country whose interests it’s our job to represent
Jo Swinson has just revealed the Govt cheated on tonights vote by not pairing votes with pregnant/ill MPs on Customs Union vote #CustomsUnion #Brexit #TradeBill
Things people in Scotland need to know on #brexit:1) @ScotTories - like Boris - are prepared to sacrifice significant chunks of the economy because they think the hardest possible #brexit will frustrate Scottish independence;2) @UKLabour & @scottishlabour are cheering them on
So @theresa_may won her vote against #Brexit rebels tonight in part by deceiving a new mum with a tiny baby? @joswinson had stayed away as she’d been assured she was ‘paired’ or told a Tory wouldn’t vote to cancel her out. This is outrageous. And from @BrandonLewis, TORY CHAIRMAN
Hey @NicolaSturgeon looks as if Rees Mogg & his gang of lunatics have either a no deal or very hard #Brexit:  Surely time to call #indyref
Absolutely shocking betrayal of trust. A clear sign of how easily women’s rights will be traded for progress on #Brexit

Despite the reality this is all built on fraud and illegality.Despite the reality these MPs know full well what happened in Germany in 1930s.Despite the reality they know #Brexit will see us lose hundreds of thousands of jobs. We are now United in kompromat Kingdomski

Tory Remainers, the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs, Lib Dems and SNP have all stuck two fingers up to 17.4m who voted for #BrexitHowever they failed to lock us into a customs union with the EU and to deprive the UK of the ability to enter into new trade deals
Can’t understand why Tory govt opposed amendment to keep Britain in the European Medicines Agency - its vital for patients and NHS - fortunately govt lost the vote just now #Brexit #NHS
I‘m delighted that @HouseofCommons voted for my amendment to the #Brexit #TradeBill. It’s now a negotiating objective for the Government to keep our supply of medicines open after #Brexit. I’m just sorry that it came to a vote: this is something the Govt should have embraced...

If this government was in anyway serious about #Brexit then Jacob Rees-Mogg would've been at the very least involved at negotiation level, if not in the cabinet.The fact he wasn't is concern for us all and speaks volumes.Time is fastly approaching to right this wrong.
So dispiriting that the SNP have to try to explain to WM MPs why it's important that devolved parliaments should be consulted on future trade deals.  tories & labour don't have a clue or a care - they are only ever concerned about the SE and majority of the UK.#TradeBill #Brexit
Darren Grimes is already playing the classic trick of the political charlatan of portraying himself as the put-upon victim. No Darren you have played games with the lives of 65 million people. They are the victims of your electoral cheating, not you.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Under WTO tariffs UK would be £8 billion a year BETTER offAdd that to the net £10bn a year we will not be sending to the EU & that makes a grand total of £18bn a year that we've not had before #BrexitWe can spend it on the NHS,elderly,schools & on cutting taxes for lowest paid

An important video.As @UKLabour try to sway tonights vote to keep us tied to the #EU, it’s worthwhile remembering that @jeremycorbyn is lying & will say anything for votes.This video outs him as being anti #EU despite what he is claiming today#Brexit
#VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #VoteLeaveCriminals #ThisMatters #PeoplesVote A corrupt referendum confers no mandate.Mrs May is operating in a hung parliament, so now the Electoral Commission has found VoteLeave broke the law, her pursuit of #Brexit is illegal. 
When hard brexiteer @bbradleymp admits #Brexit could cause economic turmoil, it is clear the public need a #PeoplesVote to have a say on the final deal
Anna Soubry - Theresa May is in hock to the hard no deal #Brexiteers... so the question really is who is running Britain & it isn't Theresa May it's Jacob Rees-Mogg & that's the reality of it. People who voted leave did not vote for JRM's version of #brexit. #StopBrexit #FBPE
A few home truths for Sinn Fein...If they had taken their seats last night in the commons for #brexit votes, we’d be in a different space today and successful amendments which adversely affected Ireland could have been defeated. @fiannafailparty
The BBC’s coverage (or non coverage) of the manifold crimes behind the pro #Brexit campaign has been a disgrace from start to finish. Repeat: these are not “allegations”. They are crimes. 
Excellent thread from @AdamWagner1 on why it will be very difficult to legally challenge #EURef result on basis of #VoteLeave cheating. I agree with him that ultimately what we do about this is a political rather than a legal decision #Brexit #FBPE
The remain campaign spent over double what the leave campaign did on #Brexit?Leave spent £13.5mRemain spent £28m

After revealing her #Brexit blueprint, @theresa_may's approval ratings plummeted.
Isn't it a neat trick @theresa_may pulled off, to appoint a minister for #Brexit...Keep him in the dark, and suddenly pull out of her arse a white paper he had no input into, no say in, written by her adviser (not an MP) and force him at Chequers to agree to it. 
Please #retweet if you believe that #brexit is illegal and void.
Deal or no deal? Four possible #Brexit outcomes explained (and a handy jargon buster)
How quickly "we won get over it" becomes "we cheated get over it". If the only response to electoral fraud is a £60k fine then its open season for any individual or nation to corrupt any UK election. Just put aside £60k to cover the fine in case you get caught. #Brexit
Tory MP Ben Bradley admits this morning on @adamboultonSKY there will be economic turmoil when we leave the EU. I was arguing need to stay in customs union to protect manufacturing jobs #BrexitShambles #Brexit 
#Brexit was obtained through fraud and not through democracy.Anyone standing by the result condones law breaking. It's no different to turning a blind eye to someone burgling your home.MPs backing it are acting in bad faith. It is a dereliction of duty to the electorate.
#Brexit cheated.Let's call a #2ndEURef.I mean, this is terrible. It's all over the UK news.Oh wait...

"What we need is cast iron guarantees"- Sinn Féin's @moneillsf on fears #Brexit backstop could be killed off 
The Electoral Commission has today confirmed Vote Leave broke the law. Their campaign and slogans were dishonest and they were prepared to go to any length to achieve their ideological end game, including, it is now clear, cheating and breaking the law. #FBPE #Brexit

"We believe in the people's ability to make a choice," Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith says, after urgent question on #Brexit & the Vote Leave campaign 
Look how many Tories have turned up for the urgent question on Vote Leave breaking electoral law this afternoon. Chloe Smith MP has just said that 'they take this issue very seriously' clearly. Where is @michaelgove? Where is @BorisJohnson? #Brexit 
Labour MP Chuka Umunna says "foul play" could have affected the result of the #Brexit referendum, after Vote Leave is found to have broken electoral law 
The reason why the #VoteLeave cheating is so important is because it's not some minor technicality. That money was used to buy advertising that sought to deliberately mislead the public into thinking they would be better off with #Brexit. They won't. It's a compounded fraud
I watched a giant Chinese container ship glide into Felixstowe at the weekend and get unloaded by cranes in no time. Frictionless trade into the EU from outside. Today the EU signs a Free Trade Deal with Japan. Seems our face doesn’t fit. #Brexit
BoE governor Mark Carney warns of "big" consequences for UK economy under a no-deal #Brexit scenario 
I'll just leave this here shall I? You outspent us 2-1, had the machinery of Government behind you and still lost. #Brexit #VoteLeave
So many things wrong with #brexit it's hard to keep up:-Campaign based on lies.-Vote Leave cheated.-Threatens the Good Friday Agreement, -jobs,-the economy, -& UK's territorial integrity.  -Trump supports it. Feel free to add more in comments (there are more).
For Pete's sake we've done this to death now. How many times during the EU Withdrawal Bill (aka the Great Repeal Bill) did the Commons and the Lords try to tie us into the Customs Union? Loads! Every time it was defeated. But these remoaners won't take no for an answer. #Brexit 
My opponent at the General Election said a vote for her would allow the LbDems to save us from #Brexit How’s that campaign promise shaping up? 
The Government's own spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, has now confirmed that the "#Brexit Dividend" is a myth:
Mark Carney warns of big impact of "no deal" #Brexit. Presumably part of new-style, coordinated "project fear". But I wonder how many people are listening given the abject failure of old-style "project fear" prior to referendum. 
Nadine Dorries accuses Anna Soubry of being irrational..........and in my kitchen a fight has broken out between the pots and the kettle. #bbcdp #Brexit
"@theresa_may must go, we need a Brexiteer in Downing Street to deliver the will of the people" says @Janice4Brexit  as poll reveals that Brits would rather back no deal than PM's #Brexit plan. 
A reminder that @Anna_Soubry received £6,000 from pro #EU More United Ltd 8th May 2017 according to the MPs Register Financial Interests. She is receiving money to defy #Brexit, the government and the will of the nation.Just think on that#VoteLeave#ChequersMeansCorbyn
EU has £130bn in assetsUK is entitled to £58bn of that.As always @realDonaldTrump was right.The UK should sue the EU for our share of the EU's assets after #Brexit.Why aren't the Gov demanding our share of the EU assets?We have helped to pay for them.
How hard you have to fight to beat the Establishment.Vote Leave, fined by the Electoral Commission, everyone a Remainer BTW. For over spending but who actually spent millions less than the Remain campaign. See how hard it is to beat the Establishment yet?#Brexit

Did you know that the remain campaign spent over double what the leave campaign did on #Brexit?Leave spent £13.5mRemain spent £28m 
This is how serious this #Brexit shambles! 
Whatever Vote Leave spent on the referendum, it is a rounding error compared with what the EU has spent buying off civil society with our own money over the years. #Brexit
Today marked the signing of the largest bilateral FTA in the world between the EU and Japan. The UK looking to leave the EU is gambling away this preferential access to Japanese markets through #brexit -yet another reason for @peoplesvote_uk on the final #Brexit deal

End of the day, rooting out centrists should be priority A for the leadership. #Brexit is way down the list. Normal people don't even give a shit about it.
Our poll shows that society members overwhelmingly oppose the prime minister’s #Brexit settlement, agreed at #Chequers. RESULTS —• Support: 4.5%• Oppose: 91%• Undecided: 4.5%Turnout: 50%
This is a shocking way to conduct an investigation. Is this  a case of people who can't stand the fact that the country voted for #Brexit, using every tool they have to prevent it? 
Theresa May's dreadful fake-Conservative government betrays #Brexit and then seeks to go on holiday early to cut off dissent. Any MP with any decency will vote against this motion. 
Frank Field is the chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee, he knows about poverty, his constituency on Merseyside is poor, he's voted to help enable a hard tory #Brexit, which will cause devastation, Mr. Field must resign from this Cttee, he's a disgrace #BrexitShambles

#Labour must back both #JeremyCorbyn and a #PeoplesVote on the disastrous Tory #Brexit , argues @SalmanShaheen
Tories need to elect a #Brexit PM who will de-select all the traitors.Put Tories in their place who will honour their election promises.Call a #Brexit General Election to deliver the Brexit we voted for.Tories would win in a landslide. 
Jacob Rees Mogg is working Theresa May from the back#VoteLeave cheated yet the #Brexit result still standsThe Scottish Tory MPs voted against @ScotParl having any sayWhy is Scotland still in this UK union? This is NOT DEMOCRATIC! #indyref2
In the 80s Labour’s “Feeble Fifty” MPs at Westminster did nothing to protect Scotland from Thatcher  - roll on 30 years and the Tory  “futile thirteen” are just as useless . Their mute acceptance of #Brexit will have the same - in fact even worse - consequences for our country. 
Now we know that Vote Leave - headed by Gove, Fox and Johnson - both lied and cheated their way to #Brexit. I support @darrenpjones’ call for an urgent judge-led inquiry into the referendum. We need to beef up our electoral law to ensure that our democracy is not cheated again.
It is hard to fully comprehend the scale of the stupidity which has seized Downing Street. Theresa May is dismantling the white paper she published and accepting terms which would all-but guarantee no-deal #Brexit. It is cowardice on a Olympic scale. 
The PEOPLE -of what is ERRONEOUSLY descibed as the UNITED kingdom ,& what the PM refers to as *our precious Union* - are being used as PAWNS in an idealogical GAME being played out in the Tory PartyAdjudicated by ultra rightwingers - calling the SHOTS from the sidelines.#Brexit
Haha @theresa_may voting against her own policy, then desperately trying to close parliament early to stop being booted out. You can't make this shit up #GE2018Now #Brexit @LibDems hiding #FBPE not knowing what's up or down, #ToryRebels a joke #JC4PM now
She’s spot on as ever. I don’t believe #PM despite her good intentions can deliver a #Brexit deal that will win support in #Parliament. The people must decide @Peoplesvote_uk
Vince Cable/Tim Farron who've been very vocal in their criticism of @UKLabour on #Brexit didn't even show up in the Commons to vote down the Rees-Mogg amendments, they're a disgrace, they have no credibility left in any future Brexit debate, but they are yellow tories @LibDems
Brilliant summary for Remainer MPs this morning by the best #Brexit team out there. They should read this short article now:   A flavour is below.
We are continuaslly told that the clock is ticking & we need to get a move on or #Brexit will run out of timeSo what do MPs do?They go on holiday a week earlyWhat message does that send?The message is clear.Most MPs want to reverse the biggest democratic vote in our history.
‘Socialists dont like ordinary people choosing - for they might not choose socialism..’ - Margaret Thatcher #CaseandPoint #Brexit 
I suspect that the anger and frustration in this short thread are being felt by businesses the length and breadth of the UK. The hard #Brexit Tories should be ashamed of themselves. #voteSNP
This is the awful price of #Brexit. The leave voting north of England is a wasteland now. Nothing grows. Tribes of nomads move from oasis to oasis, but even these are drying up. Only staying in the customs union and single market can save them now. 
Official #Brexit campaign Vote Leave referred to police over "serious breaches" of electoral law 
I still favour #Brexit irrespective of how badly executed it is for one simple reason: If we don't leave, the evil shits in Westminster will never give us a say in who governs us ever again.
EU and Japan sign historic free trade deal after rush to agree terms before #BrexitExperts say UK on its own is unlikely to improve on the deal, which will remove virtually all tariffs and covers a third of the global economy#StopBrexit #FBPE
HUGE NEWS: Electoral Commission finds Vote Leave broke law during #Brexit ref, issuing fines and reporting 2 people - Darren Grimes + Vote Leave's 'responsible person' David Halsall - to police. Full report is stinging ( ) Here's some key points (thread)
So yesterday Theresa May and her government voted against its own policy and ripped up their #Brexit Whitepaper. And some spoofers claim that it was the fault of Sinn Féin. 
I’ve never been a ‘let’s have a second referendum’ person but surely if #VoteLeave have been fined AND referred to the police for breaking the law over their #Brexit campaign there needs to be another one or this whole Brexit thing stopped?

Every single one of the @ScotTories lined up meekly and voted FOR the ERG amendment, which will lead to a hard, no deal #Brexit.Every single one represents a constituency that voted Remain.
#brexit 17 million voted leave the EU. We voted leave The Customs Union & The Single Market. Why are you on TV trying to DERAIL  Brexit all the time. We’re leaving the EU get over it. Get behind Brexit make a change for you. Give it a rest for one day. 
How many #VoteLeave MPs have money in off shore tax havens? Is this why they want #Brexit because EU was going to clamp down on them? Asking for a friend.
Theresa May caves in to Brexiteers today. Theresa May caves in to remainers/EU tomorrow. She’s a disaster. The WORST possible leader we could have had to deliver #Brexit #R4Today
I’ve seen some Lib Dem excuses for @vincecable and @timfarron not voting. Claiming it wouldn’t have made a difference. *Even if true*, if there’s a knife-edge vote on a critical issue, you turn up. You vote. It might be futile, but you still bloody turn up and vote! #Brexit
All the headlines about #VoteLeave being fined £61k for breaching spending limits feels like a storm in a teacup when you compare it to the £9m of taxpayers money spent by David Cameron on sending #Brexit project fear leaflets to each household ?
Darren Grimes referred to the police for Vote Leave breaking Electoral law.Why not .@BorisJohnson @michaelgove et al? The Electoral Commission should hold them all to account. #Brexit
From satellites to drugs, #Brexit puts these five investments in serious jeopardy GalileoCopernicusEuratomFramework Nine European Medicines Agency 
Was this the reason why the former #LibDem leader was absent from crucial #Brexit votes last night? Giving a £5 lecture on how you can’t be a gay christian? 
Damning conclusions from the @ElectoralCommUK - the result in favour of #Brexit was obtained , at least in part , by breaching electoral law.   It cannot be allowed to stand - another vote now essential providing there are safeguards for Scotland in terms of possible outcomes . 
Vote Leave: "Official Brexit campaign fined and referred to police over breaches of electoral law".How can the catastrophic policy of #Brexit continue after an illegal campaign?
The plot thickens... and even before we consider the dark money in the DUPers' grubby little hands RT "#Brexit campaign group 'broke electoral law', says Electoral Commission "
#VoteLeave broke the law, have been fined and referred to the police. The referendum should be declared null and void. Not only was it advisory anyway, the campaign was illegal. Why on earth should the UK #Brexit in light of this? #StopBrexit
"HERE’S SOME ‘ARITHMETIC’ FOR REMAIN-VOTING MPs" - We debunk the MPs' claim that "the Commons arithmetic won't pass it."  Excellent #Brexit facts, as usual. Read the summary here:

Three @UKLabour MPs Stringer/Hoey/Field, they rescued a tory PM and their hard right Brexit ERG led by Rees-Mogg, they're facilitating a hard tory #Brexit, think about that, @UKLabour MPs voting to make people poorer,I'm in utter disbelief, they sided with Rees-Mogg #StopBrexit
Ok when is the investigation into the Remain campaign?#brexit 
This, this is what #Brexit is doing to small businesses thoughout the UK AND the Tories and Corbyn don't give a toss. 
So, #Brexit will lose anything between 700 thousand and 2 million 800 thousand jobs depending on soft or hard Brexit Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, but you are comfortable with that because you must respect the referendum vote that was obtained by cheating and breaking the law?

Vast majority of UK trade (61%) is done with EU or thru EU trade deals. A very misleading argument here. Worth noting that the UK is also a member of the WTO thru the EU, instant indp admission is far from guaranteed. No deal #Brexit is beyond catastrophic, for the UK primarily 
It was a great speech. Take a few minutes and watch it back. #Brexit #BrexitShambles
Hope still triumphing over experience unfortunately. She has got so, so much wrong with Chequers only her latest mess up. From elxn loss, failure to build one nation agenda and civil-service-driven #Brexit gruel she’s sadly a big part of the problem rather than the solution 
On top of all this, the Government now wants to bring forward Parliament’s summer recess. I can’t possibly go along with that and I don’t see how anyone else could at this critical time with the clock ticking on #Brexit; it would be shameful even to consider it
Instead, the Government must face up to the #Brexit challenge, be honest with people about what’s possible and what isn’t, #SuspendA50 until it has worked out what it wants - and later offer a #2ndEUref once it has established good, realistic options for our country
Tonight’s votes in @HouseofCommons on #Brexit were really quite shameful. The Government adopted changes that went against the proposals in its own white paper (that it had only agreed last Friday). It changed its position at the last minute
Frustrated at two narrow losses to extreme Brexiters earlier by just 3 votes following government caving in to them. I witnessed 3 Labour MPs voting with Tory Government and DUP, coached on the votes by Jacob Rees-Mogg and the DUP in full view of everyone!!! #Brexit #CustomsBill
Tonight was just one extended episode of their Brexit chaotic cluelessness. I really have no idea what they want to achieve now. The thing is - neither do they. #their #Brexit
And of course @DanaRohrabacher is good friends with @Nigel_Farage and know @Arron_Banks et al So the net tightens around #Brexit #Trump #Russia
THREE Labour MPs voted with the Tory Govt on the Brexiteers amendment. The govt majority was THREE: Kate Hoey, Frank Field, Graham Stringer. #Brexit #LabourBrexit
Tory #Brexit majority of just 3 in the Commons tonight and the tax amendment passed likely to kill the White paper, so not good for Ireland north or south. The 7 Sinn Fein MP’s would be, and could still be decisive in Ireland’s interest

Sinn Féin’s seven MPs could be making a tangible difference to the extent of the impact of #Brexit but instead they’re hiding behind abstentionism; while of course drawing down salaries, staff, offices, expenses and much more 
I USED TO defend the @BBC because of the importance of the public having access to unbiased & impartial news, but as @BBCNews has VEERED AWAY FROM IMPARTIALITY as has been well illustrated by THEIR COVERAGE OF #BrexitPerhaps its TIME TO END funding the #BBC via the licence fee!
Parliament undermines Northern Ireland and Good Friday Agreement with #Brexit vote, says @StephenFarryMLA See more here -
Looks like the Government lives to fight another day after very narrow wins on the Customs Bill. But you have to ask - why bother? The Govt have been tied up in knots by the ERG and the Chequers agreement binned #Brexit #FBPE
It was always going to happen that @sinnfeinireland votes might actually  have made a difference in an important #Brexit vote & this one was about Ireland. What a waste of political capital 
So far Brexiteer ministers have been resigning as they don't back Theresa's plan. Now she's caved to them, Remainers have started resigning in order to vote against the latest Government amendments. The Conservative Party has become a coalition of chaos #Brexit
But even this is not honest, it is only half the truth. The Tory Brextremists want the sovereignty so they can dismantle the welfare state, and hollow out our democracy, passing real control and real sovereignty into the hands of stateless kleptocrats. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Why do people portray Theresa May as a beleaguered moderate trying to restrain the Brextremists? Her track record since 2010 suggests that it is far more likely that she is a hardliner feigning moderation in order to keep the moderates on board.#StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
The ERG should table another amendment that says Britain will pay for access to EU single market only if the EU pays for access to the UK single market. Fair?#Brexit 
BREAKING Guto Bebb quits as defence minister after rebelling against Government over #Brexit. Theresa May has now lost seven ministers or ministerial aides in the nine days since Chequers paper published.
Just a reminder that without @patel4witham this amendment would not exist. Good on her and those who supported it. #Brexit 
Moving out and realising why your Mum used to go #Cray for leaving the washing out in the rain when you’re out all day.. #Brexit  
Every single Brit - of hundreds I spoke to - when I explained #Brexit was a vote to be poorer didn’t care. They all said they’d be happy to be poorer to, ‘get my country back.’ Now that poverty is happening, I wonder if they still think like that? 
Exactly. The EU is bad, but #Brexit gives more power to a known killer of UK jobs and dignity: the British establishment. (As I predicted before the referendum). 
The country is in crisis because of the tory #Brexit, so what does Theresa May do? She's tabling a motion before Parliament tomorrow to bring the summer recess forward to Thursday, she is a gutless coward, #StopBrexit then go on recess, our nation is fucked and off they go.
The unassailable truth:#Brexit will make the UK poorer. Growth is already down, & among the lowest levels in Europe. We'll not be given favourable trade deals by Trump's America First. There's a real risk of a food & fuel shortage.We're on our own - & nearing the iceberg.
This is ⁦@theSNP⁩ amendment we are now voting on. Looks quite reasonable doesn’t it? Tories are voting against & Labour are abstaining #CustomsBill #Brexit 
#Soubry:  "Nobody voted #Leave on the basis that somebody with a gold-plated pension and inherited wealth would take their job away from them." #Brexit
Good chance of some argy-bargy in the Commons tearoom after this. Conversative @Anna_Soubry attacks those with “gold-plated pensions and inherited wealth” for not caring about the effects of #Brexit on her constituents
If we Leave under Article 50 without a deal under UK, EU and International Law we owe NO MONEY at all, not a brass farthing....#Brexit#Moggmentum
Two years on and #Brexit is still a shambles. NI accounted for 0.5% of the total vote in that referendum and received buggar all attention. Don't be surprised that a UK govt would ignore us now.
104 pages of the #Brexit #WhitePaper reduced to 10 slides.Especially for those concerned for @BorderIrish, @BelfastAgmt, & with more sense than time.@DPhinnemore & I have scrutinised the WP in light of #JointReport commitments to NI/IRL & the UK's alternative #backstop.1/10
Having listened to the debate in HoC today, it is blindingly obvious UK MPs have no idea how to provide for #Brexit or the logistics involved.WTO has a simple set of rules, used worldwide.We'll just go to those, thanks.No Deal can be quantified, these clowns in WM cannot.
Don't worry Anna we will remind @BroxtoweCons that you give more praise to Chuka Umuna than any Tory and that your attacks are more scalding on Jacob Rees Mogg than on Corbyn and that you have spent the last year trashing what your constituency and the country voted for. #Brexit 
Just watched the tremendous @KateHoeyMP on @SkyNews - A truly great principled Labour politician - A #Brexit hero to 17.4 Million people.....and a really nice person!
If anyone voted leave is angry that #brexit backing MPs think you/your family losing your job is worth it for their idelogical vision, please know this.- brexit isnt a done deal- it's ok to change your mind & be a #remainernow - you'll be far from alone
Dominic Grieve - Throughout the whole process of #brexit we are collectively going through an exercise both in deception & self deception about the implications of leaving the EU... if we're going to make rational choices we need to avoid self deception. #StopBrexit #FBPE
This. This is what #Brexit has come to. Bannon suggesting #Brexiters take up arms and go to war. Why hasn't @metpoliceuk been called in. This is a criminal offence.
Why are Britain and the US going through the worst political crises in a generation? Look no further... #Trump #Brexit #Russia
Between 2009 and 2015, the UK was on the winning side in 87% of votes in the EU Council Just FYI @steve_hawkes - sure you wouldn't want facts to get in the way of your Pro #Brexit propaganda. 
The message from conservatives to @theresa_may is clear: we will support her if she supports us, and that means a full #BrexitLIVE: Remainer anger as PM accepts #Brexiteer demands
Anna Soubry made a remarkable comment during her speech in the Commons, hard brexiteers in her party have had private talks on the job losses their hard #Brexit will cause, but they don't care, they just want sovereignty bk, these are the ppl May capitulates to, think about that
We can still stop this madness that is #Brexit read this thread and RT.

Spell it out Mr Mogg @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, lay out your vision of #Brexit in excruciating detail so the people can see what is in store for them. Pull no punches, take no prisoners. They voted for it after all, what have you got to hide? 
BETRAYALWe've just witnessed UKG run roughshod over Good Friday Agreement. They've now set us on a path to a hard border, job losses, loss of access to healthcare & denied our young people education opportunities Remember this moment #Brexit
They would have 300,000 fewer members, 100 fewer MPs, no chance of stopping a hard Tory #Brexit, and @JolyonMaugham would be making excuses for why Liz Kendall's strict adherence to austerity and neoliberalism has failed to resonate with the public. Still, bloody Corbyn, eh?
Two years on from #Brexit and #Trump the governance of both the UK and the US is in complete turmoil. Laws and systems will have to change to create a new polity on both sides of the Atlantic. It will happen because the people are wiser and more tolerant than their leaders.
#Brexit is now just an internal battle within the Tory party. Jobs will be destroyed and families wrested apart just to satisfy the egos of a few multi millionaires. They don't give a toss about the public or the carnage they create.#Leavers you are the enablers of this madness
Whilst the outcomes of #Brexit are unclear, our environment deserves a good deal! England’s nature needs protecting. Take 1 minute to tell the UK government #WhyNatureMatters.
Should a General Election be held to allow voters to take back control and decide whether they want a Labour or Tory #Brexit?Please RT after responding
TM now clinging on until the summer recess with #Brexit & Tories falling apart. This is not a government, it is a bad joke. Senior Tories now calling for #peoplesvote. Even they accept it is the only way out of this mess. #FBPE

The Great Northern Stop #Brexit Conference is delighted to announce that Labour MEP @RCorbettMEP will be one of our speakers in #Leeds on 8 Sep 2018. Richard joins @eloisetodd of Best for Britain on our rapidly expanding list of participants. Many more announcements to come!
.@DavidDavisMP says in his resignation speech that neither UK nor Irish Govts would ever need to impose a hard border but is unable to give a satisfactory answer when I ask why then he agreed to the need for a #backstop provision #Brexit
Read from former Conservative staff member why a #PeoplesVote on #Brexit is necessary:  
Proof that the kids don't want #Brexit!!!!!!Well done to the #BollockstoBrexit team in Durham! You got the kids on message and the Leavers rattled = RESULT!
Government in chaos over #Brexit.  Clock ticking.  Theresa May's solution?  Hit the beach early 
Things getting pretty heated in Commons this evening over #Brexit as real intentions of the extreme Brexiters like Jacob Rees-Mogg are laid bare... Time for @peoplesvote_uk
Looks like Soubry is determined to finish what was started in 2017Why anyone would be so committed to fight against the will of the people, using every trick in the book, relentlessly for 2 years, I don’t know #ChequersMeansCorbyn #RespectTheResult #Brexit #Broxtowe
Lord Hannay, former UK ambassador to the EU and the UN, examines the fatal flaws in the government's #ChequersDeal #WhitePaper  on #Brexit@InFactsOrg
Interesting: as @Anna_Soubry makes the point that trading under WTO rules would require a hard border on the island of Ireland, @PhilipHammondUK sits on the Govt frontbench in the Commons just now nodding away in agreement #CustomsBillDebate #Brexit
I'm no tory (as you all know) but i must pay tribute to @Anna_Soubry, she has skewered the hard Brexiteers in her party on frictionless trade, the single market, she's told them in no uncertain terms their hard #Brexit will cost 1000s of jobs, take a bow Anna Soubry #StopBrexit
We are witnessing the Tory party tear itself apart over #Brexit right now as Leave-supporting Conservative MPs tear into Remain-backing Anna Soubry over trade with the EU after Brexit in the House of Commons. It is brutal.
Students support @JustineGreening call for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal: 
The horrifying #TrumpPutin axis that's emerged in Helsinki makes it all the more insane that Britain is leaving a successful association of friendly nations.#Brexit: a badly bleeding nation jumping into shark-infested waters.#PeoplesVote #TrumpPutinSummit
Tonight at 10.45 on @ITV, @piersmorgan asks @realDonaldTrump about his thoughts on #Brexit, the Queen and a trade deal with the UK. Piers, The President and Air Force One - an interview not to be missed. 
If the UK public don't want chlorine-washed chicken, hormone-fed beef or GMO food in a US trade deal, according to @LiamFox , they won't have to have it. If we leave the EU, I will hold him to that promise. #Brexit #FBPE
I can't help feeling those pointing the finger at Vladimir Putin over alleged #Brexit collusion wouldn't be better off going after Murdoch, Dacre, Desmond and the Barclays. Not to mention investigating the cause-and-effect of 40yrs of unbroken neoliberalism on British society.
I’m always amazed by the number of both remainers & Leavers who seem to think “just another heave & the #brexit problem will be solved”.Remain, hard or soft Brexit, UK will be stuck in “a culture war” over brexit for atleast the next 2 decades.There is no escape from this.
I’ll be with you Heidi. Having made great strides with her #Brexit #WhitePaper to meet the needs of business, the PM has allowed it to be wrecked by caving in to the hard no deal Brexiteers. Seems Jacob Rees Mogg is running Britain.
It’s good to see remain tories correctly being called rebels againBrexiteers are representing the will of the nation and the Conservative manifesto#ChequersmeansCorbyn #RespectTheResult #Brexit 
This is a crisis! We're heading for a hard border !! What happened to protecting NI and the Good Friday Agreement? If UKG/DUP adopt this amendment, NI is in serious trouble ! #Brexit #Backstop @PeterKGeoghegan @SarahLudford @OwenSmith_MP @ChukaUmunna @Andrew_Adonis
The #Brexit choice, always binary, as I've written so many times, is crystalising into a choice between a diamond-hard Brexit....or no Brexit at all. Not clear now that the politics on either side is prepared to buy into the necessary fictions needed to find a middle road. ENDS
Farage backtracks on 350 million NHS lie a day after the Brexit vote. Boris Johnson continues to peddle the lie, then makes a strategic move to swan off into a Cameron sunset. Davis quits when it matters. Michael Gove...says “it’s a difficult one.” What a bunch.#Brexit
May caves in to JRM amendment effectively ensuring that a hard #Brexit is the only option on the table. I despair. May would sell her parents to keep herself in a job.
Oh fgs!The @iealondon will finance, run and operate @Freer_UK.And @DominicRaab will be at a Summer drinks tonight instead of getting himself up to speed in Europe. #Brexit 
You can keep saying ‘We are leaving the European Union’ till your statement necklace falls off. It doesn’t make #Brexit the right thing for our country
“There is a sense at the back of my mind that we didn’t get everything absolutely right. It’s a difficult one.”[.@michaelgove ] There’s nothing difficult. The real question is why you, Boris et all aren’t in court due to breaking electoral Law.#Brexit
A happy guy lol#BenedictCumberbatch in character and dancing joyfully!#Brexit 
Oldest and easiest trick in the book is to scapegoat immigrants. It’s the first thing you learn in GSCE media studies. What fucking hurt about #brexit was seeing up close how these sordid methods work.

Fact is, we've got Blairites colluding with the government to prevent Brexit. Jeremy needs to form a temporary alliance with the hard right to ensure it goes ahead, or we miss our opportunity for a Jobs First #Brexit.
Hi @JustineGreening - as a former colleague of yours who left the @Conservatives & joined the @LibDems due to this #vile #brexit - I was wondering whether you would consider joining the @LibDems as we too are fighting for a #PeoplesVote & #FinalSayForAll? You'd be truly welcomed!
I was very impressed that Theresa May announced her new #Brexit team so soon after the last one all resigned. 
The government clearly prefers violent fascists to peaceful democratic protesters. Our government would appear to be on the side of democracy's enemies. #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE

Here’s a Tory MP openly calling for a second referendum on the #Brexit deal, whilst the Labour front bench refuse to contemplate one. Respect to her, but, as I called for in my last tweet less than an hour ago, it’s time for Labour to step up to the plate. 
The results are in!Last week we asked if you think the public should be allowed to vote on the final #Brexit deal.88% of those who voted said YES. 12% said NO. Book your place to join the debate with @Andrew_Adonis: #LoveQUB
. @NadineDorries is putting foward a fascist serial criminal as a future PM. If the Tory party does not expel her it will be sending the message  that criminal fascism is an acceptable Tory doctrine.#Brexit #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
'We will just LEAVE on WTO rules!' Rees-Mogg claims Theresa May's #Brexit plan will be voted down in the House of Commons unless she agrees to scrap it, as both Remainers and #Brexiteers believe the deal would be detrimental to the UK.
I am so keen to see how MPs vote. As has been widely reported, if @Theresa_May’s #Brexit plan fails, the U.K. may have to stay in the EU. That’s what the “Stop Brexit” brigade want, surely?Why would they then vote with/for Theresa?I am watching. Agendas will be laid bare.
Justine Greening - #Brexit is too important to have 1000s of people feel like their MP somehow did the wrong thing.. everybody deserves to have their say on such an important issue as brexit that will shape all of our lives for decades to come. #PeoplesVote#StopBrexit #FBPE
So proud to have worked for a TRUE brexiteer. A woman who sacrifices the time in her life to ensure that Brexit was not just a good idea, but a good reality! I am absolutely confident that @andrealeadsom has got our back for Brexit. #Brexit #DealForBritain #HistoryInTheMaking
I hope @piersmorgan is watching @SkyNews right now. @AyoCaesar backing up her fantastic showing on @GMB by talking absolute sense reference #Brexit 
No Anna I think you will find the electorate condemn those who stand on a manifesto commitment to do one thing and then spend the next year doing exactly the opposite and insulting all your colleagues. p.s. Those eyes....that stare....chills#Brexit 
Dominic Grieve says we may need to "think again what we are doing" on #Brexit. Clear that momentum is building for a #PeoplesVote:
#TheresaMay rejects new #referendum “under any circumstances “ - even if people want it ? - no matter how bad the #BrexitShambles ?- even if no parliamentary majority for her #Brexit deal?What arrogance!
#brexit Does anyone know what’s happening with Brexit. Conservative party all fighting each other over Brexit. We voted leave the EU 17 million people. Get on with it pathetic Theresa May stop waving white flag to EU.Labour even worse in EU out EU in EU out EU who bloody knows. 
Conservative MP Justine Greening has called for a 2nd referendum on #BrexitGreening has said it’ll have to have 3 options.Chequers Deal (Soft Brexit)No Deal (Hard Brexit)Remain in EUIf a Second Referendum were to be held, how would you vote?PLEASE RETWEET THIS POLL
Holy mother of god (I’m Irish) when will we wake up ???#brexit is part of a bigger global picture and we are collectively sleep walking into it, pretending this is #democracy. Bannon, Brexit #Trump, Putin even Tommeh are all part of this. We aren’t in control #FBPE
Question - if people didn’t respect the result of the first referendum, how on earth could we trust them to respect a second?  #Brexit
Here are six of the most ridiculous claims from #ProjectFear about the impact of a clean #Brexit on businesses, prices and jobs. I’m paraphrasing to make my points, but all are staples of the #Remain camp. (1/8)
The crucial bill in front of @HouseofCommons this evening is the #CustomsBill. It’s a Treasury dept bill under Philip Hammond. His PPS resigned this morning. It’s all unravelling #Brexit #WhitePaper
Twice as many voters want Britain to quit the EU without a deal than back Theresa May's #Brexit plan, a Mirror poll has revealed.More evidence that #ChequersMeansCorbyn
And herein lies the problem. Despite it being proven there was foreign manipulation and that bot factories exist all over the world, people think it’s too far fetched to be true. It might not make sense but it’s fact. #brexit 
We accepted the result in 2016 but now know - dirty tricks and dirty money involved- almost certainly Russia involvedand believe - democracy didn’t end in 2016- we deserve another vote now we know all the above PLUS the facts about #BrexitWhat are you afraid of exactly? 
Thought @PickardJE's 'no deal' #Brexit story about floating diesel generators keeping the lights on in NI was far fetched, because they wouldn't cut us off? Well, Ireland's withdrawing its strategic oil stocks from the UK to cut its 'no deal' risk: 
The @CONservatives are making a mess of #brexit deliberately to keep the UK in EU, @UKLabour and @Libdems don't really say much because remaining in EU is what they want as well. 17m people got screwed over. #bbcdp
The public are now backing a No Deal #Brexit. The British people voted to leave the EU and a No Deal Brexit is increasingly looking like the only way to deliver this. #bbcdp
For #journalists everywhere. Could have done with this common sense @rte during #repealedthe8th - but will be critical for #brexit #PeoplesVote
Number 10 on Justine Greening's call for another vote on leaving the EU. PMOS: “The British public have voted to leave the EU, there is not going to be a second referendum under any circumstances.” #Brexit

Here is the reality of #Brexit - an incompetent , internally fractured Tory party by its action & inaction causing real damage to small ( and large) business that is getting worse every day.  Meanwhile a delusional Prime Minster gabbles about a “successful” process 
Spokesman for PM @theresa_may says there is not going to be a second referendum on #Brexit under any circumstances
Breaking: Mays office has just said that under no circumstances would there be a second referendum and her deal for #brexit is the only one that will be put forward. So I guess that means that we now know the terms of brexit @NicolaSturgeon - Worse than mays plan or no deal.
Another little-known member of the government quits in carefully-choreographed #Brexit troublemaking. Presume wants some kind of Canada-style deal with hard Irish border & chaos in Kent, but obviously like other hardliners refusing to clarify vision beyond tendentious cliches 
Very well put by @wallaceme #Brexit 
It is crucial people read & understand this. It’s what @M_AndersonSF has been flagging for months. Any diminution of rights must be resisted. Our entitlements, our citizenship, the GFA & our expressed democratic opposition to #Brexit must be upheld. @campaignforleo @simoncoveney
Scott Mann, MP for North #Cornwall, has resigned as a PPS over #Brexit, citing the views of his constituents.Dear @scottmann4NC, we've been talking to your constituents. Many who voted leave can now see they were lied to and think Brexit is a complete mess.

I'm not going to accept calls for another referendum from people who clearly don't respect the result of the previous one. #PeoplesVote #Brexit
"Justine Greening"Pretty much every politician from every party appears in an interview and states 'We respect the result of the Referendum' than immediately goes away and tries to find a way to scupper it. #Brexit
It is striking how often #WhitePaper refers to respecting devolved institutions & importance of preserving the union. There’s even a reference to “the UK family” but as opinion polls show actions speak louder than words #Brexit #Indy 
A final decision on #Brexit should be taken away from politicians and put "back into the hands of the public"Conservative MP @JustineGreening calls for second referendum 
The irony of people who don't respect referenda, calling for additional referenda. #Brexit 
"The prime minister’s effort to keep Britain in parts of the single market is the “worst of both worlds” and will satisfy no one."Even the former Conservative Education Secretary has now come out in favour of a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal:
May’s #Chequers Deal is not only terrible for #Britain but clearly unpopular with voters. Commons goes into recess this week until September. Tory MPs must act fast to ensure we get a proper #Brexit or face defeat at next GE 
Today's the day when the far-right Brexiters have to choose whether to vote down Theresa May's Customs Bill. I'm betting it's the day when we find out Jacob Rees-Mogg is nothing more than a double-breasted suit full of hot air. #WestminsterHour #Brexit  pic.twitter.com/ty5VRo2RIk

Nicola has been right all along. Let the disaster of #Brexit become known to everyone in #Scotland then offer the option of a prosperous future in our own independent country.  Latest Panelbase Poll shows 54% support for Scottish Independence #indyref2
Britains in invidious position of being walked down road by vocal minority that’ll isolate them frm allies&establishd trading partners That’ll destroy its GDPThat could break up UK&reignite NIBut if they go back they think they look weak  All while being bullied by US #brexit
pendulum is starting to swing - more and more people are realising that #Brexit will have disastrous consequences for the UK and hardly surprising to see Justine Greening coming out this morning saying that the people should have the final say @peoplesvote_uk
Why does Mrs May say that #brexit can't go ahead without her.  I'm sure it will be a damn sight better without her & those in the shadows pulling her strings
Andrew Marr: "It’s Fake sovereignty, it’s NOT real sovereignty!In theory, we can go to Brussels and say ‘do you mind if we change these rules’.In practice, once the common rulebook is in place, we can’t, not in the real world."#Brexit #Leave #EU
Theresa May: "#Brexit means, well staying in the #EU"
Have read entire #BrexitWhitePaper. Too complex & wd leave us half in half out. Plus a chilling list of things that need sorting. Clear proof that there is no good form of #Brexit. @JustineGreening correct: vital to have a public vote before March 2019 with option to stay in.
EXCL: @MirrorPolitics @ComRes poll reveals twice as many people want a no-deal #Brexit than back Theresa May's #ChequersPlan
More ladybird #brexit books to read to your kids at bedtime 
#brexit is the will of #Putin
I think May chose not to appoint JRM to her Cabinet because he would have exposed her #Brexit treachery at an earlier stage.Any final deal reached with the EU will be all the poorer, given the absence of direct input into it by the Brexit hero Rees-Mogg 
The Tories held the #Brexit referendum to resolve a Tory dispute & now want to ignore that result & hold a 2nd referendum to stop their party falling apart.The country is not here for the convenience of the Tory party.It is time for a General Election.
Right on time - Just as Theresa May betrays Brexit, Justine Greening calls for a second referendum.If you gave the Tories the benefit of the doubt and have seen your trust betrayed, you're welcome to join @UKIP. We will fight for a true #Brexit
"Parliament is at stalemate...it's time to go back to the people."MP Justine Greening wants a second vote on #Brexit with three options:No dealThe Prime Minister's Brexit dealStay in the EU#5liveBreakfast
Kicking the #Brexit can down the road will eventually lead to a rising of extreme nationalism. The best thing this government could do is to act fully upon the 1st referendum and stop shilly-shallying ... it will only cause more bloodshed in the long-run.
Jonathan Samuels: The truth is an establishment elite are trying to overturn the #brexit referendumVince Cable: You can't get any more establishment than Jacob Rees-Mogg... people on the remain side are just ordinary people disturbed about the damage #Brexit will cause. #FBPE
May braced for showdown with #Brexit rebels as more than 100 MPs are thought to be coordinating voting tactics against her bill described by @Jacob_Rees_Mogg as "hopeless"
Justine Greening calls for second Brexit referendum - Clearly within Cabinet she never intended to deliver #Brexit - the lies and the deceit are palpable
‘We need to have a proper Brexiteer prime minister who puts in place a proper offer to the European Union’@Nigel_Farage talks #Brexit with @GMB
The Fail has yet another filming pic of #Brexit with Benedict. Wanted to laugh at how ridiculous the Boris Johnson wig looks, but then realised that makes it more realistic. :p 
#TheresaTheTraitor can attempt to cling in to power but she has been exposed as a #Brexit fraud.Those lines were never red.She never meant 'no deal was better than a bad deal'.Her plan all along was to Remain in the EU with a few minor changes.
Former education secretary Justine Greening has dealt a blow to Theresa May’s efforts to win support for her #Brexit plan, saying it offered the “worst of both worlds” and called for a second referendum. #PeoplesVote
@Jacob_Rees_Mogg has warned trust in Theresa May is slipping. In a scathing aside, he accused her of failing to embrace the opportunities of #Brexit, saying she was “a Remainer who remained a Remainer”. 
"CLOWNS TO THE LEFT OF ME, JOKERS TO THE RIGHT" - The forgotten #Brexit menace of the EU Parliament.  Read what they said about the Olly Robbins 'Wet Remain' White Paper: 
#Brexit creates the kind of turmoil in which extreme views can flourish. Do you want: (Please RT 4 better stats).
Post Chequers, post Trump visit, the Remainers are mobilising.  A people’s vote on three options: clean break, soft or stay with the EU #Greening #Brexit
How are we going to win a #peoplesvote and what will we do in a Britain without #Brexit? We need a positive vision. We need to offer real change. Join us at The Great Northern Stop Brexit Conference where an array of top speakers will share their ideas. 
Wow! Look! Carole politely reminds us how we were the test run for the presidential campaign. I will not respect the #Brexit referendum vote result based on clear evidence of meddling, manipulation, cheating & breaking the law. I will not be a traitor to my country. #PeoplesVote
It's important to remember the U.S. is by no means the only nation under Russian attack.As we watch parallel investigations play out on both sides of the Atlantic, it makes sense that we'd see cooperation between U.S. & U.K. investigators.#Brexit = #TrumpRussia = #PutinAtWar
Parties don't have to merge to stop #Brexit.They just have to form a temporary #BrexitCoalition to ensure the 17.4m have just ONE candidate to vote for in each constituency.If we can mobilise the 17.4m to vote for #Brexit one more timewe can change politics in the UK forever. 
How to #Brexit:UK: Hey, we're leaving.EU: What deal are you offering?UK: No Deal, we're just leaving....EU: Hey, UK. Wanna deal?UK: I'm not bothered either way, but I'll hear you out.

This is a sinister move, calling for another Referendum.Seeing Tory MP's mention it all of a sudden.Everything to delay us getting out is a bad thing, can't be trusted.They'll put more options on it, split our vote, or something.#Brexit is March 2019, we can take stock then.
With more turmoil looming over #Brexit this week, it's heartening to see support growing to #SuspendA50 and hold a #2ndEUref - most recently from @JustineGreening. What’s best for our country must be at the front of our minds
So says @andrealeadsom, the lady from the previous @Conservatives leadership contest who talked the #BRexit talk, but then stepped aside at last minute to give #remain-er @theresa_may an uncontested victory. What price was paid then? What price now? ANOTHER 30 pieces of silver?
Princess Charlotte wanted to know what face you made when Boris Johnson and David Davis resigned last week, right after you announced your cabinet had agreed a "collective position"? #brexit #Wimbledon #WimbledonFinal
Before #brexit I had never signed an online petition before.I’ve literally lost count of how many I’ve signed. This one looks worth the effort. 
AGREED... I really admire @KTHopkins for standing up & speaking out against EU tyranny. Whatever the future holds for the UK, at least she'll be able to say she gave it her all. #PatriotsUnited @POTUS #MAGA #Brexit #TrumpPutin #TrumpUK #WWG1WGA
#JustineGreening sat in Cabinet as recently as January. If she can now support a #PeoplesVote - then the @UKLabour leadership certainly can.Help our grassroots movement convince @jeremycorbyn & @Keir_Starmer to have the courage to stand against #Brexit
What's the EU ever done for #Cornwall?Here are just a few things from a much, much longer list.There's no chance Westminster will make up the investment we will lose with #Brexit, with the economy crashing around its ears.We need a #PeoplesVote!
The herd? Who would that be? The 17.4 million people who voted for #Brexit the promise made in our manifesto and the Brexiteer MPs fighting to deliver on that promise? 
The Tories face a very simple question.Are they willing to betray 17.4 million leave voters by backing Theresa May's #Brexit proposal to leave the EU in name only?If they are the Tory Party will be annihilated.They have no choice but to depose her.
The rest of the world believes in Britain. It’s time that we did too  #Brexit 
Why has Bannon not been arrested for inciting terrorism?#Brexit #StopBrexit
Did @theresa_may's government seriously leave #chequers last Friday with a hop, skip and a jump and think that they would get away with this sellout? Really?Utterly bizarre.#ChequersMeansCorbyn#MAYMUSTGO#Brexit 
WARNING: Bannon is the ultimate Russian asset. He’s the Lord Haw Haw of Moscow funded White Supremacy spreading across Europe to destroy democracy, NATO, & global trade. #Brexit is your doom. Listen to this fool & you will break up the United Kingdom. #SaveDemocracy @Plot2Destroy
think we should call off #Brexit and hold an enquiry into Vote Leave cheating and breaking the law. Right now. 
Theresa's threat is also targeted at 17.4m Leavers. That either we submit to her Chequers cave-in or be denied the #Brexit we voted for. Well Mrs May, now you have revealed your plan to deprive us of a genuine exit from the EU, we will not back you!
After fixing #Brexit with the help of #CambridgeAnalytica and Putin, Bannon continues to try to interfere with British democracy and the rule of law.
Interesting group of people who voted #Leave who regret it - and want a chance to reconsider #Brexit :

So #brexit voters if remain had won with criminal overspending a military grade psy ops campaign by Cambridge analytica the support of tax evading Johnny foreigner billionaires and the interference of a hostile foreign power would you respect the result?
Why are Bannon, Trump and the rest, over here? Because in #Brexit they sense a fertile breeding ground for their creed of hate, division and Fascism. And they’ve spotted the useful idiots like Piers Morgan, @LBC and @BBC happy to give them a platform.

With all the ignorant and dangerous talk about betrayal, why not simply admit that #Brexit is and was always going to be complicated? Pretending that there are easy answers to complex problems and attacking officials and judges who can’t answer back: the essence of populism.
Dear HoC MPs, the majority of you are #Remainers. May has said if you reject her plan, there will be no #Brexit. It is back in your hands. Do the right thing. Reject her childish cakeism plan. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
A message to Conservative MP’s:Do you really think that May’s plan is #Brexit?  If you value your seat (which you will lose if this goes ahead). Then by all means back her and face the inevitable backlash. The dole queue.
WTO is not some comparable alternative to the EU single market which is considerably more sophisticated. Moving to WTO is the equivalent of replacing the most advanced operating system in the world with windows 95. #Brexit

The Conservative party is having a nervous breakdown over #Brexit: 'Theresa May faces her eighth resignation over Brexit plans in nine days, as ministerial aide quits' By @avmikhailova  via @Telegraph
Theresa May has now lost eight members of her Government or party vice-chairmen in the nine days since the Chequers #Brexit agreement was published. a a rate of nearly one a day: two Cabinet ministers, one minister, three Parliamentary Private Secretaries and two vice chairmen. 
I am May. I'm a vote-loser.Last year, I campaigned to lose a 24-point lead and lost my party its majority.This year, I've caved in to Remainiac civil servants and botched #Brexit. My party's dropped 6 points in a week, ooh can't wait to lose the next election!#BrexitBetrayal
Six members of the Government have now quit in the nine days since the publication of the Chequers Brexit deal. Worrying. #Brexit

Heads up Mrs May @theresa_may, #Brexit is not in out national interest, it never was, it never will be. Never was the will of the people. The right deal for Britain is the one we already have.A #PeoplesVote would confirm this.
The governments of this country, left and right alike must shoulder the burden of blame. For a brief time, since 1975, we were doing better but still the governments ignored the causes of Brexit. Now here we are, still ignoring the causes of Brexit while we #Brexit 
#Brexit is now on life support.We need radical action to save it.The 17.4m need to unite behind just ONE candidate in each constituency.We need a #BrexitCoalition to unite behind.One party on its own can't do it.@UKIP got 13% of vote  in 2015  but only got ONE MP.
For as long as people like her and IDS want #Brexit, the Tory Party will head towards defeat. The core of UK politics is not far right or far left. It's time for the moderates to Take Back Control.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #fbpe
We need just one #BrexitCoalition candidate in each seat.The 17.4m can then unite behind & elect a #Brexit Government.It is the only way to get the #Brexit we voted for.This is too important for party differences to get in the way.We MUST break free from the  EU dictatorship. 
Have I got this right?May has now said that if parliament rejects her White Paper proposals there will be no #Brexit.So there, MPs, you have it.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Yes, Mrs May is wrong and @johnredwood is right.  We published 2 articles about the seminar where it was discussed.Distinctive #Brexit research & news daily: 
Ex-minister Steve Baker MP has accused the government of operating a cloak and dagger plot to thwart #Brexit.So it looks like the Department for Brexit is a bluff and the reality is the establishment are doing their best to thwart the will of the people. 
Hopefully @Jacob_Rees_Mogg will replace @theresa_may He should then de-select all the #REMOANER Tory MPs & replace them with Tories who honour election promises.He should then call election calling for a majority to implement #BrexitHe would get a landslide majority#HappyDays
Prof. Alan Sked - "If we walk away then we wouldn’t have to pay them (EU) the  £40billion that Theresa May has promised, and that would really upset them." “Secondly we could just say we are going to exist on WTO rules and perhaps cut taxes." #Brexit

The EU must have bribed a good part of British mainstream hacks and politicians considering they way they betray their country over #Brexit and relations with the US. No wonder they are making up stories about 'Russian meddling' in UK, to distract attention from their treachery.

When those who have pulled out all the stops and spent a fortune to stop #brexit are happy with Theresa May's Chequers deal, you know we are being well and truly shafted. #Brexit #MayMustGo #ChequersMeansCorbyn
Why does the BBC Sunday or Daily politics visit Leave voting constituencies and not Remain voting ones? @BBCNews #bbcsp #Brexit
May does make lot of threats without any real weight; "If I lose just 16 seats Corbyn will be Prime Minister", "If you vote against chequers they'll be no Brexit", and "If you don't take my threats seriously I'll threaten you again". #Brexit #marr
Why are you @JohnMannMP ignoring the Falkland Islands?They did not get a #Brexit vote.41% of their economy is based (94% of their fish catch) is sold using the #SingleMarketThe @UKlabour party is ignoring them & following Tory #Brexit instead.

#bbcsp The #Labour party has already made clear that #TheresaMay’s #Brexit plan, which would tear 80% of our economy out of EU singlemarket and destroy jobs, is unacceptable.  Parliament must take the lead says @Keir_Starmer
1. Our current thinking is that the Chequers plan is totally unworkable. It is impractical and incompatible with EU and international law. The EU will reject it - but not immediately. It will use the time to plan for a no deal #Brexit
Those pushing for ideological version of ‘clean’ #Brexit need to explain how they would deal with the realities of protecting jobs, supply chains & safety. Instead of sabotaging this pragmatic White Paper they shd be honest about the actual risks of their no-deal Brexit

The media is talking about the Chequers 'deal'. It isn't a deal, It's a proposal for a deal full of pie-in-the-sky nonsense cobbled together to stop the govt falling apart. The EU will reject much of it & the UK will stagger on towards a no-deal disaster.#PeoplesVote #Brexit
Deadly, devastating analysis from Nick Cohen on the folly of #BrexitBrexit Britain is out of options. Our humiliation is painful to watch | Nick Cohen 
President Trump is right. We should absolutely sue the European Union. There is a clear legal case to do so. However, I would be happy with a “No Deal” #BREXIT  starting now. @UKIP @realDonaldTrump
Labour Brexiteer @JohnMannMP says @JeremyCorbyn will "lose the working class" if he endorses a second referendum on #Brexit 
"This is what you get when you allow fascists to walk the streets".Still think #Brexit is a good idea? 
Complete nonsense.  Firstly & for the umpteenth time , there is no such thing as a “successful #Brexit”.  So this isn’t “the right deal “ for anyone let alone Scotland - for us this is actually a disastrous deal.  And as for Trump’s endorsement of you as a negotiator……. 
#Ridge John Mann wrong to say only choice will be #theresamay deal or No deal. If May deal is rejected Parlaiament must chose between renegotiating (for a different deal) or reconsidering #brexit entirely.
#marr To elaborate: PM May said she rejected President Trump's suggestion to sue the EU instead of negotiate with them;she added that he advised once you start negotiating, then do not walk away or else you're "stuck". So "no deal" should not be an option in #Brexit 
In a democracy, we can campaign to #StopBrexit. As @Jon_Danzig writes in his blog, ‘There is nothing undemocratic about having a new vote on #Brexit when we know the actual details of Brexit.’ Please RT.  #PeoplesVote
Point being there was never any intention whatsoever under Theresa May of walking away from the table and the EU knows it, what she's actually done is secured a softest of soft #Brexit as the backstop that's still up for negotiation, disastrous.#Marr
Donald Trump's #Brexit advice to Theresa May?"He told me I should sue the EU" #Marr
May on #Marr is defending her common rulebook (aka the EU's rulebook) because she does not believe in #Brexit, she does not want the UK to leave the EU and because she miscalculated that she would be able to hoodwink 17.4m people.
#TheresaMay wrestling with the key dilemma of #Brexit - distance Britain from EU, and take a huge economic hitOR- stay close, but have to follow EU rules without having a say on them. Neither is good for #Britain#ChequersPlan does the 1st for services & the 2nd for goods
Alan Bennett: "If there was another referendum people wouldn't vote for #Brexit because they're now so bored with it."He's right. Brexit is a monumentally stupid waste of time and energy. The worst thing that's happened to our country since the war.#Marr
The marvellous Alan Barnett on #Brexit @AndrewMarr9 #Marr “the idea that with one bound we’d be out was nonsense then and is nonsense now”
No better example of how the BBC is biased for Remain; Andrew Marr describes the fringe and flatlining #PeoplesVote and #FBPE movement as "large and growing". What rubbish! #marr #brexit

Great to be back at @MarrShow where I’ll be speaking about how time is running out for the Government to secure a #Brexit deal that works for business. Watch live here: #marr
What a disgrace, the voters that @SimonClarkeMP represents overwhelmingly back Brexit (his constituency voted by 65.3% to leave the #EU) as does the vast majority of #Teesside. He’s standing up for his constituents by standing up for a proper #Brexit. 
If May seriously believes that her White Paper has outcomes that are “non negotiable” then she is in for a bitter disappointment ....PM Theresa May warns party not to put #Brexit  at risk - BBC News 
Time is running out to secure a #Brexit deal that works for business. I’ve written to the Prime Minister about the misguided Brexit White Paper which ignores the importance of services & risks damage to jobs & our economy. Tune in to @MarrShow for more:

Find me a poll that says a party that opposes Brexit in all of its manifestations will win the next general election. You can't b/c the people don't want that. But what does exist at is Labour polling at 40% to the Tories 36% You don't want to stop #Brexit,you want to stop Corbyn 
Wow. Seems this will be a bombshell interview on many levels when it airs. But in particular on #Brexit - @realDonaldTrump - “Oh I think we’re going to have a great trade deal, I’ve really no doubt about it. We’re going to get it.“ cc @piersmorgan

Polls carried out before David Cameron announced the #EU ref showed #Leave were trailing by up to 13 points. Nobody wanted it.Now, hundreds of thousands of people have signed a petition asking for a #peoplesvote and it is being denied. This is wrong.#BREXIT#FinalSay

I will continue to vote for @SteveBakerHW because his principles deserve supporting but I have rejoined UKIP until we #Brexit as it was voted for! If we cannot make trade deals because still hamstrung by the EU Rule Book then we have left in name alone!
I have no idea how widespread this discontent in #Conservatives grassroots goes but interesting to note. Also not just issue for Tories. Millions of #Brexit voters are traditionally Labour supporters. Do they feel homeless politically too? 
The grovelling sycophancy shown to Trump by Theresa May, the Tory Brextremists and the right-wing press tell us loud & clear that if #Brexit takes place the UK will become a subservient vassal state of the USA.Restore pride! Take back control! #StopBrexit!#TrumpProtest
When our #Conservative association reps stand down because of the PM's #Brexit shambles, it is time that our MPs took note  
Here's what we know:Vote leave cheated.Leave EU cheated.Boris Johnson lied.Nigel Farage lied.Aaron Banks lied.Russians interfered.#Brexit is a disaster.Jacob Rees-Mogg is a time traveller.Sorry, when I say we, I mean just me and you, @BBCNews haven't woken up yet 
We need to talk about #Brexit. If we are going to win the #PeoplesVote campaign, we need to create a vision of a New Britain without Brexit. We need to develop a radical manifesto which includes an overhaul of the UK's crumbling democracy & closing the north/south divide. #gnsbc

A change from my usual posts. The #TrumpVisit, #Russia and #Brexit are all interconnected in a terrible unraveling of western society. @J_amesp wrote about this over a year ago and I watch in horror as his predictions come true.  Read his book and understand the peril we face.
At the heart of #Brexit White Paper is a howling, fundamental economic error. It assumes our prosperity depends on staying shackled to the slow-growing EU. In doing so, we squander the opportunity to unilaterally develop closer ties with much more buoyant economies. Unbelievable.

#Brexit is the poison tree of the eternal #ToryProxyWar over Europe. #BrexiteerUltras  pressured the PM to evoke #Article50,-starting the clock- before she had a Plan. They were scared that it would never happen"You Can't Make It Up" was made for this.#BrexitShambles#skypapers
This is the most important aspect of #brexit. They broke the law. Repeatedly, and with calculation.The referendum result is therefore void. We do not HAVE to do this. #PeoplesVote is now our best option. Get behind it.#brexit #Resist #FBPE
Helen Goodman - The Govt own assessments show the NE would be worst hit by a hard #Brexit.. output would fall by 16% & unemployment would skyrocket by 250,000.. that's more people than in the 80s recession after the steel/coal industries were decimated. #FBPE @HelenGoodmanMP

Since 2007, UK services exports to the EU have increased at about twice the growth rate of goods exports. So it seems perverse that the UK #Brexit White Paper proposes reduced access to EU markets for services industries, while seeking much better terms for goods trade 
Dear friends it seems that we never appreciated what we had until we were on the verge of losing it. The turnouts as the recent marches against #Trump and #Brexit should give us hope. The tide is turning..do not stop, keep strong, we will overcome.
PODCAST: In what has been a tumultuous week in #British politics, I speak to @jongaunt on the #Brexit betrayal', @realDonaldTrump’s visit, and the future of UKIP.
Preparations and contingency planning for #Brexit have been underway for months now across Govt. Of course we continue to negotiate for the best possible outcome, but need to prepare for all eventualities. 
This is one all female panel I’m more than happy to take part in  Well played @JFK_SS #Brexit 
On the #BREXIT white paper state-aid capitulation: "What will happen when we apply to Brussels for permission to spend our own money?"
We need the 17.4m who voted #Brexit to get behind just ONE #BrexitCoalition candidate in each seatWe can then have a #Brexit Gov that will deliver the Brexit we voted forIt would also shake up the tired old two party system forever.The 17.4m must not be betrayed @Arron_banks
We need just one #BrexitCoalition candidate in each seat.The 17.4m can then unite behind & elect a #Brexit Government.It is the only way to get the #Brexit we voted for.This is too important for party differences to get in the way.We MUST break free from the  EU dictatorship. 
"New IRA" has organised the last 6 nights of violence in Derry. Just last night 74 petrol bombs and two improvised explosive devices on the streets.Can't help but think that #brexit is contributing to this instability. 
#Bristol West MP @ThangamMP, whose constituency voted by 80% to remain in the EU, came in for criticism for ruling out a ‘people’s vote’ on the final #Brexit deal@vincecable accused her of “let[ting] down” her constituents to support @jeremycorbyn
The North East cannot cope with another industrial extinction - that #Brexit would cause, argues @MPphilwilson

#Brexit and Trump are the same thing. By backing #Brexit Corbyn is on side with Trump. #TrumpUKVisit #StopBrexit
May’s idiotic #Brexit deal means The City is fleeing abroad:“We are moving to Brussells, full steam ahead  and many other banks and financial services will be moving at that pace now”.A reminder - the City pays for the NHS.  
Ministers intervened over the name Boaty McBoatface because the people had voted for something "stupid".  Why are they not intervening on #Brexit which is a far more stupid thing the people supposedly voted for.
Revealed: Donald Trump's #Brexit advice to Theresa May In essence, "Overshoot your target, be tough and get on with it."May has completely ignored this advice all along, whether by design or default.

Treason May and her @Conservatives remainer lackies think they can deceive the people & lie to parliament. They fatally underestimate the anger across the nation. They are finished as a political party unless they bin May and deliver the #brexit we were promised. @theresa_may
If there was a hard #brexit, why would a company move 2EU where they would have 2pay a WTO levy 2export their products back 2 UK. So 2 all companies threatening 2leave UK, please get management that understand economics & tell them #ProjectFear didn't work last time either. .
#Brexit #MAGA WE ARE FAMILY  #LondonLovesTrump
.@POTUS managed to insult his host @theresa_may within hours of arriving, after @TheSun published this interview .  He slammed her #Brexit strategy, said he would kill a trade deal, and praised her arch rival @BorisJohnson #awkward

Now this is what a Presidential Couple looks like #MAGA #MAGA2020 #Brexit #British #KAG #POTUS #Americafirst
Unionists will resist Scottish independence falsely claiming Scotland can’t be independent because of #GERS while completely ignoring the damage that #Brexit will do to Scotland. Don’t let them avoid the fact that Westminster will sacrifice Scotland #DissolveTheUnion
Tory brexiteers claim to have full number of signatures to trigger vote of no confidence in may. Have given her 1 week (as from 10th July) to ditch #chequers plan or they are going ahead. 3 days will tell the story if they really have the numbers! | #SCOTREF #BREXIT #INDYREF2
The #Chequers plan is a #baddeal – we need to start planning seriously for no deal, says #AndreaJenkyns!  #BREXIT #MayMustGo #BBC #SKY #LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress #ConservativeParty @Conservatives @DCBMEP @andreajenkyns @BorisJohnson @DavidDavisMP #Tory #UK
Despite what Trump said in a briefing w/Britain's Theresa May, @RNicholasBurns says Trump's comments in The Sun were "a direct attack on the prime minister...this was the real Donald Trump" Trump visited the U.K. amid protests + critiqued May's handling of #Brexit in the press 
Theresa May’s personal popularity has been plummeting, especially among Leavers – where it has fallen from a net +10% supporting the PM to net -23%. #Brexit
Thousands of angry leftists protested & threw a tantrum. Millions stayed home & love president Trump. #Brexit
Portillo slams May's #Brexit proposals for leaving the UK with only two possible outcomes."One is a non-Brexit Brexit and the other is Remain... Either to be a colony of the European Union or to be a member of the European Union." Shame on you May!
This is what I don't get..giving the Ppl a #Peoples vote to allow a #FinalSay doesn't overturn #Brexit unless the majority of the Ppl now wish to #Remain in which case it is the Ppl who overturn it.It's a false reason used as an excuse to avoid them forcing their will on the ppl
As a long eventful day comes to a close let’s not forget that our democracy is at stake. @theresa_may needs to go and the @Conservatives need to act quick to save the party.#MayOut #MayResign #MayMustGo #BrexitBetrayal #Brexit #CCHQ
No wonder the Tory Brextremists want a trade deal with the USA in which the US would ensure the privatisation of huge tracts of the #NHS. #BrexitBetraysBritain #Brexit 
.@DavidDavisMP the former #Brexit Secretary, is prepared to join Eurosceptic MPs and vote against the Government next week in a move that could force ministers into a climbdown on the #Chequers #WhitePaper#MAYMUSTGO #BRINO

The EU’s negotiating strategy is to make British success as difficult as possible. They are scared stiff that we will flourish and show the world how misguided the EU project is. #Brexit 
Some time in the not too distant future there will have to be a thorough public inquiry into how the BBC has become a mouthpiece for the Russia-linked far-right. @bbcthisweek#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
I have always been a Tory.I decided last year that I would go to my first party conference this year.  Now, I don’t want to go.I feel so disengaged and angry with the PM after this last week. I trusted the PM with #Brexit and she has really let me down, badly#MAYMUSTGO

51% say Trump is too untrustworthy to negotiate a deal with. That's a big number! 65% want a vote on the #Brexit deal. That's an even bigger number. 
We asked Labour's @BenPBradshaw #HowWillBrexitBenefitMe?Thank you for your honesty Ben - we agree that the people must be given the #FinalSay on any #Brexit deal with the option to #Remain#StopBrexit #SODEMaction
Wouldn't surprise me if May had already decided to support a #PeoplesVote & is waiting for parliamentary impasse. Of course she'll keep saying she doesn't until she judges she must 'change her mind'.I think Corbyn will soon be outmanouvered on #Brexit

#Brexit, #BritainFirst, #farright, #FreeTommyRobinson #altright, #neoNazis #racists, #Muslimhaters  have been on the rise recently but, this day, following #DonaldTrumpVisit the people of #Britain have squarely told your leader “you are not welcome”.
Behind my jovial, laissez faire Twitter persona, I am actually jolly cross about #Brexit.I think a #PeoplesVote is in order. Does one agree?
It is good to see more and more people are waking up to what #brexit and Trump is all about. This is about the rise of Reich. It is about transferring power into private hands, the global corporate empire. So let's hope more people see the truth. Let's help them see. #FBPE
Circa post election 2017: #Brexiteer Louise Mensch expressing her warm gratitude to #Brexit heroes Donald Trump & Mike Pence for their support on the EU referendum.  Farage/Banks/Trump/Mensch/Wigmore/Bannon etc all share same vile racist homophobic ideology. #TrumpUK #Trumpism
The UK is like the United States. It has highly liberal areas and highly nationalistic areas. Don’t forget our #Brexit brothers and sisters who are fighting to Make England Great Again!
The last few days have proved even more that #brexit is a coup. Johnson, Leadsom, Mogg, Wigmore, Mercer, Banks, Hands, Davis, Farage, IDS, Fox, Redwood, Gove, Dacre, Murdoch, IEA, the ERG, Snowden, Trump, Putin, Koch, Bannon, Hintze, Odey, Ashcroft, Hoey, Patel, Raab, Baker...
80% of Kent businesses see EU as main export market. No wonder they're worried as #Brexit will damage their future @Labour4EU @EK_EuropeanMove
EXACTLYNigel Farage played a leading role in #Brexit, which involved some of the same shady characters (Mercer, Bannon, #CambridgeAnalytica) as #TrumpRussia.What was on the thumb drive that Farage passed to WikiLeaks’ Julian Assange 
Support for #PeoplesVote growing daily as polls show govt seen as incompetent & business moving to #EU due to #Brexit. Corbyn needs to get on board. It is our only way out of this Tory created mess #FBPE
We asked Labour's @stephenctimms #HowWillBrexitBenefitM?He is incredibly worried about where #Brexit is heading and agrees that there should be a #PeoplesVote on the final deal#StopBrexitSaveBritain #SODEMaction
All these people turning out on to the streets of London to protest against a man they call a fascist when some of the most active present day fascists are in office in this so-called European Union of theirs. Go figure.#Brexit
Now @realDonaldTrump has completed his visit to and is heading to Scotland for the weekend can we turn our attention back to the betrayal of #Brexit by @theresa_may and the @Conservatives#MayOut #MayResign #MayMustGo #BrexitBetrayal #Brexit #CCHQ

Leftists in #London  hate @Potus. So what? Facts:1) these r the ppl  who banned guns & murders skyrocketed. 2) same people who voted to “dull knives” when gun ban didn’t work 3) #BREXIT won 4) ever see a #TrumpRally?
Portillo on May's #Brexit failure"This is the most dreadful betrayal.We have conducted ourselves in this miserably timid way for the last couple of two years." 
Most people think @RealDonaldTrump was right to make his views on #Brexit public, according to a Sky Data poll #TrumpUKVisitFor more Sky Data results on President Trump’s visit read this: 
A small number of leftie wasters who have nothing better to do. Most are probably on welfare, kept by the state. Trump is well supported in UK and a poll on Sky News is indicative of the support for Trump. #maga #Brexit
(1) Health is not "completely devolved" to Scotland.(2) The UK Gov has transferred powers from Scotland to  Westminster through the EU Withdrawal Act.(3) The UK Parliament can legislate on devolved areas.(4) Theresa May has not excluded the #NHS from a #Brexit trade deal.

“The UK adopting wholesale EU rules on goods makes it very difficult to progress meaningful trade agreements,” @missvhewson of our trade unit gives her verdict on the #Brexit White Paper There is much to gain and little to fear from a US-UK trade deal: 
Do the #Brexit fruit and nuts realise that we are the laughing stock of the world for even contemplating leaving the most successful, sophisticated and democratic intergovernmental association the world has ever seen? If they do they don’t care because they have the Trump virus.

Planet Trump: He is repeating the lie he told earlier saying he arrived & spoke at Turnberry abt #Brexit the day before the vote. It was the day after. Not one person dares to tell the emperor he has no clothes & is a serial liar. #TrumpVisit
May once again takes 26.5% of the Ppl to mean 100% & believes she knows better than them what they were voting for.The maj of the Ppl did not vote for #Brexit & a minority of voters voted for many reasons for various forms.Don't you dare impose your will on us w/o a #FinalSay
In the Brexit White Paper outlining May's Chequers plan the Govt capitulates to the EU on almost every issue. It might as well have been written by Michel Barnier. Perhaps it indeed was?#Brexit

As the son of refugees @Kishan_Devani speaks from the heart with @bbcasiannetwork - where he says the @Conservatives are pathetic in their handling of #Brexit & Immigration has been a force for good in Britain - highlighting how the #NHS has been a beneficiary of #EU immigration.
So Trump supports the majority of British people who voted for Brexit and worries they aren't getting what they voted for. The BBC response - "Trump is turning the whole country against him"Right... #FakeNews #Brexit #TrumpUKVisit
@theresa_may & @Conservatives have stupidly energised the militant wing of the DUP with their self-interested deal which is distressing for all especially the gracious people of Northern Ireland & the Irish Republic. We should kill #Brexit now before Brexit starts killing people.
This tweet hasn’t aged well #brexit 
Piers Morgan BLASTS Remoaner MP's fear-mongering over 'no deal' #Brexit “The reason we don’t trust politicians when they say these apocalyptic things is because every apocalyptic warning has not manifested itself."
Britain’s biggest export earner - the #Financial sector (insurance, banking, etc) - tears into #TheresaMay’s #Brexit #ChequersPlan for keeping them outside #SingleMarket
A report by the IEA says a No Deal #Brexit scenario wouldn’t be a disaster at all.In fact, it should make it easier to strike up trade deals, cut tariffs and save money because the UK won’t be shelling out shed loads of cash to the EU. 
#Trump was doing no more than stating the obvious. As May’s #Brexit White Paper stands, #Britain would indeed remain so shackled by Euro regulations it would be quite impossible to negotiate a meaningful free trade deal with the U.S.  #BestPresidentEver

Dear @jeremycorbyn Trump wants #Brexit because like Putin and Murdoch he knows it will undermine Western democracy. Support for Brexit is support for the kleptonationalist axis that is trying to destroy our democracy. Whose side are you on?#TrumpUKVisit #PeoplesVote
3. For some reason MPs have forgotten their primary duty, putting country 1st. This #BrexitShambles is based on pure party politics & a deeply suspect Ref. There are so many reasons #Brexit can no longer be validated w/o giving the Ppl a #PeoplesVote & a #FinalSay to Confirm it.
On the #TrumpVisitUK you do all realise that with the UK the EU is the biggest market in the world and its population outstrips that of the United States but without the UK those tables are turned? So no, it isn't UK's interests he is thinking of when he supports a hard #Brexit.
Britain did not vote to become another state in the USA. Time to ask the country stay as we are or kiss our independence goodbye along with the #NHS and all we hold dear. #stopbrexit#Brexit#FBPE
1. Anna I have respect for you & share your view of Trump but I'm afraid the PM has brought much of this upon herself by forcing through an unworkable #Brexit after invoking A50 w/o any due diligence, based on a v. flawed process.PM's credibility is shot.
Trump, Putin, Mercer, Murdoch, the Koch bros, Dacre, Farage, the ERG and the far-right are all united in a Kleptonationalist network that sees democracy as an enemy to be destroyed. Currently they are winning and #Brexit is helping them.#TrumpUKVisitSave democracy #StopBrexit

Here's a way of looking at #Brexit that we haven't thought about before. 
No they didn't. Most the country are still unaware (thanks to the BBC) that #CambridgeAnalytica was created by Farage's friend and Trump's campaign manager. The whole @ICOnews investigation is about datacrimes around #BrexitBut the BBC omitted this crucial bit. 
74 MPs & peers believe #Brexit 'could damage UK environment'. Take 1 minute to tell the UK Government to keep their promise to deliver a greener future after we leave the EU. #WhyNatureMatters
Regardless of #Brexit UK/US too far apart on pedestrian safety for trade deal as UK will not drop #EU or #UN regulations. Even the Sun & Daily Mail can’t stomach US cars sold here crushing skulls, chests & legs of British adults & children. See more here

#UPDATE US President Trump launches scathing attack on UK PM May's #Brexit strategy, testing the already strained 'special relationship' as they prepared to meet on second day of his tumultuous trip to Britain  #TrumpUKVisit
This would be in the event of a no-deal #Brexit. One wonders why the Tory Brextremists are so keen on a no-deal. Or perhaps one doesn't wonder. The transformation of the UK into something like Putin's Russia or Erdogan's Turkey could be accomplished within weeks. #StopBrexit
A poll confirms 78% of people believe the Tories are divided. Their bitter infighting on Europe is making us a laughing stock around the world and trashing our chances of a 'good' #brexit  But there is still time for a final on the deal. #FBPE
I’m not a great fan of Trump but on this issue he is right, surely. We cannot strike trade deals independently of the EU if our trade arrangements are closely aligned to it. In this and many other respects, the #Brexit White Paper plan is unrealistic. 
@afneil you’ve been playing to #Bannon #trump #brexit fiddle and only now you realise it’s based on lies?! Welcome to reality. #brexit is pro Russia assault on our country and continent. #BBC has been working against UK interests pandering to #brexit.

So he's only been in the country 5 minutes, and already @POTUS has done more for the British people than Theresa May and the entire cabinet combined. You might as well appoint him #Brexit minister. #TrumpUKVisit
I've had to delete that #Brexit tweet from yesterday because of all the zoomers that replied and I can't be bothered with them in my timeline anymore. So, in summary: I fucking hate #Brexit and I'm proud to be Remoaner.
This (below) was tweeted after the Sun's #Trump #Brexit interview was published - an example of just how decoupled from reality Tory brexiteers are. Utterly unhinged. #TrumpUKVisit

"The Trump visit is going very well," says Tory Lord Duncan as Trump, on whom countless millions have been wasted, publicly humiliates Theresa May and runs down the UK. The Tories, in their #Brexit madness, have turned us into poodles. Our international standing has been trashed.
Dominic Grieve - There is no possibility of a no deal #brexit... it would be so damaging for the UK for that to happen & no rational parliamentarian would allow that to happen.. if no deal was to happen then Parliament would have to intervene & the Govt wouldn't survive#FBPE
So we alienate all of our friends in Europe and have to crawl to a man who cages children and grabs women by their genitals. #Brexit has brought us to a point of national humiliation. How must we look to the rest of the world? Theresa, WTF are you playing at. Stand up to him!
EU SURRENDER! The PM sparked uproar yesterday when it emerged her post-#Brexit plans promised visa-free travel for ‘talented’ EU workersMay has crossed so many red lines that her discredited utterances are now as believable as Tony Blair's
Sarah Wollaston - In the government's contingency planning for a no deal #brexit they should publish very clearly what they're planning for because if the public could see the extent of the disruption a no deal would cause they would be a lot more concerned#FBPE @sarahwollaston
Yet another cost of #Brexit they never told us about:#BrexitChaos#BrexitShambles
If #Brexit is about sovereignty & taking back control why is Alan Duncan so happy about handing it straight over to Trump?In a globalised world the sharing of sovereignty is necessary; sharing it with Trump is not - & nor is is desirable.  #r4today
For anyone who has not yet understood: Trump and international far right oligarchs are trying to destroy the EU and the values it stands for. #Brexit is part of that plan. And they are quite willing to sacrifice the UK to achieve that goal. #StopBrexit now
Indeed. But @jeremycorbyn: in the end, Trump’s policies, his vile populism, have same roots as #Brexit. So please tell me: how can you condemn Trump while simultaneously enabling Brexit? It makes no sense: Brexit too puts lives and well-being of millions at risk. #TrumpUKVisit
An EU law professor gives a damning verdict on the #Brexit white paper  
Trump says Europe is losing its culture because of immigration. It' s almost always uncultured yobs who wail about the loss of culture to migrants - blaming others for the personal cultural wasteland which they  inhabit. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Trumps intervention via “The Sun” confirms that whatever the public backing in June 2016 #Brexit is now in the greatest part a hard right anti democratic attempt to manipulate international relations , the effect of which would be to make most of us much poorer.
Brilliant from @piersmorgan“Already Barnier, Juncker & Merkel are making approving noises... of course they are! This is basically us not really leaving and I’m sorry, although I voted to stay, this is not #Brexit” #whitepaper #BRINO #MayMustGo
The co-ordinated media attack by Trump, Farage and Murdoch is merely the latest in a far-right war against democracy that has been going for several years now.The extensive criminality that tainted the #Brexit referendum was very much a part of that.Wake up, Britain!#r4today
I was on balance (but unenthusiastically) in favour of  #Trump visit. But his patronising put-down of @theresa_may is wholly outrageous, whatever your view of her, her government or her handling of #Brexit.
Blah blah. We didn’t hear anything from these hypocrites when #Obama made a direct intervention in our politics by attempting to bully us into staying in the #EU. #Trump is telling the truth. #TheresaMay has wrecked #Brexit.

paying his respects..#TrumpUKVisit @FinancialReview #Brexit 
Funny how liberals absolutely adored Obama’s “back of the queue” comments - when a US President brazenly tried (and failed) to influence #Brexit vote - yet toys leave pram when Trump correctly states US trade deal with UK more difficult without clean break from EU  
I remember right after the #Brexit vote, then Candidate Trump said: "We're gonna have one hell of a Brexit in November!" As usual, he was more right than anyone could have imagined
Assuming it doesn't get shot down or stabbed, might I suggest to #SadiqKhan that he keeps the #TrumpBaby as a permanent fixture over London. It could replace both the Mayor and the PM, do a significantly better job, and save an awful lot of money. #Brexit 
Actually Gina there is a big difference between Trump sounding off (as he does) two years after the vote and Obama threatening British voters with a spoonfed line from Downing Street in the middle of the referendum. #TrumpUKVisit #brexit #Trump
We should vote EU President Juncker out.He regularly appears drunk  whilst on EU duties.Oh wait.We can't . He is unelected.Like the other EU dictators.The sooner we get the #Brexit we voted for the better.
Theresa May has got to go. Her #Brexit fudge is killing the dream as Trump says UK-USA trade deal is off. 
There's some difference when US politicians are briefed by Barnier rather than by Boris on #Brexit 
Lord Heseltine - Theresa May now has an impossible problem.. the #Brexiters want a hard #Brexit but May can't get a hard brexit or the Chequers fudge through the Commons.. so brexit is now unravelling & I hope this will lead to the collapse of brexit. #fingerscrossed#FBPE

Trump and May yesterday. Her fawning over him clearly hasn’t worked. He is openly contemptuous of May and constantly undermines her. #Brexit demeans us all.

Trump: Brexit plan 'will probably kill' US trade deal - The cold, friendless, post #Brexit world starkly revealed. 
Said before, will say again:Trump is a buffoon and a neo-fascist. Much as it is a joy to watch May blanche as he vomits all over her #Brexit plans, this kind of public intervention in domestic affairs is a warning to us all. Urgent need to rethink Aus-US relationship #auspol

POTUS loves Brexit. He’s not going to let her off easily.  Interesting short read below. She’s already on thin ice with him.  I love seeing a POTUS finally doing what’s best for us first. No more apologies or selfies like Obama’s tenure. #AmericaFirst #Brexit #MAGA 
#TrumpUKVisit 'Boris would make a good PM' - the house is on fire and he's praising one of the arsonists!? Trump says tonight UK won't get a deal if it's a soft #brexit  Leavers criticised Obama for wading into Brexit – they’re all silent now. Talk about double standards!
Why are we even reporting this bollox .. he insults us, our people, culture, proud diversity and politics... He backs Johnson and a hard #brexit but imposes sanctions and tariffs on our products. He’s a bigot .. who cares what he thinks ... he’s a twat! 
You know, I've just realised that May's white paper would leave us in a position to re-join the EU very easily.  #MayMustGo #Brexit 
This is the most dreadful betrayal. If I was one of the members of the cabinet I would have been of the ones that quit says #choochoo, Michael Portillo to @afneil #bbctw #brexit
George Orwell wrote: "“Unpopular ideas can be silenced. & inconvenient facts kept dark, without the need for any official ban.” The BBC's failure to cover the serious criminality that tainted the #Brexit referendum shows just how this is done.

Theresa May's white paper reads like a 6th former has plagiarised a remain white paper. The words inside have been changed just enough to pass scrutiny and the title is different. #Brexit #MayMustGo
Given Trump’s current regressive trade policies, I don’t think there was much of a deal to be had.... also worth noting of course that the breakdown of UK exports is 15% to the US and 44% to the EU #TrumpVisitUK #brexit 
Wonder why #Trump doesn’t want to deal with the EU? Oh yeah - he’s a bully and he can’t bully the EU - it’s a bigger market than the USA. So there he is trying to dictate U.K. policy, so he can divide and rule. Ironic isn’t it? Stop this #Brexit madness! #FinalSay #BrexitShamble

That’s the reality remainers. Theresa May’s whitepaper confirms the Robbins proposal is a dud. Keeping  Britain tied to the EU, governed by their regulatory systems won’t get Britain a trade deal with the US. Proper #Brexit will. 
Dominic Grieve warns of a 'state of emergency' if there is a no-deal #Brexit.  This would seem to be exactly the kind of outcome May and the ERG would want, facilitating a rapid curtailment of the liberty to oppose the government #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Friday's Express: "Tory MPs revolt over May's #Brexit plan" (via @hendopolis) #tomorrowspaperstoday
Today I sat down w/ EU Chief #Brexit Negotiator Michael Barnier to hear the latest on the negotiations. It's absolutely vital that in this process we defend the Good Friday Agreement and don't return to the "bad old days" of a hard border b/w Ireland and Northern Ireland. 
This is worrying, very worrying. The greatest part of #Brexit is the ability to become a new outward looking global deal making nation. 
OK, since this pulls the rug from under the only remaining ‘Brexit benefit’ claim of a trade deal with the US, #Brexit has been killed - by Trump!!! - showing we need to #ExitfromBrexit

The case was made by REMAIN. We voted to LEAVE.#BrExit is about sovereignty, not the economy. We need to make the economy work after restoring full sovereignty, not put the economy, i.e. City profits, first. 
This is NOT what 17.4 million British #Brexit voters voted for ... @Conservatives might as well start cashing in their pensions, because they'll never have our trust again. Just a bunch of selfish, greedy bankers ... scared to death of looking the common man in the eyes.
'Amendments' to the #Chequers plan aren't enough.It needs binned.And the PM needs to close the door of No.10 on her way out.There's no polishing this particular turd.Deliver what we voted for & what you promised. #Brexit.

There are many reasons why people voted #Brexit.  Here is one

The latest UKGov paper on #Brexit is released. As @scotgov Finance Secretary I say again, Scotland did not vote for EU exit and therefore Scotland’s public finances should not be detrimented as a consequence.
There are holes in the #brexit white paper for sure, but it (at last) poses a fundamental Q to EU side: do you want a deal? My latest.

#MayMustGoBlocked a question to Merkel from a journalist.Refused to publish White Paper for #Brexit far in advance of debate.Blocked MPs and Ministers from talking publicly about deal.Coerced MPs to withdraw letters of no confidence.

...Your command of French history seems somewhat skewed, I thought you were in favour of sovereignty, instead you seem unhappy about ending English imperialism in France. Sounds like your understanding of #Brexit is as pitiful as your understanding of the Treaty of Le Goulet...
... John also retained control over significant parts of France and ended a war, which was costing English and French lives, and allowed the Norman equivalent of #brexit from control by a foreign power. "Normexit" perhaps...

The only way May can save her #Brexit plan is to give the country a #PeoplesVote so the people can have their say. The whole sorry mess this week illustrates that we will not be able to resolve #Brexit in Westminster. 
.@Keir_Starmer absolutely tearing this shambles of a Govt apart...and he hasn't even got onto the contents of the #Brexit White Paper yet! What a shower.
We will now analyse the #Brexit White Paper w/ Member States & EP, in light of #EUCO guidelines. EU offer = ambitious FTA + effective cooperation on wide range of issues, including a strong security partnership. Looking forward to negotiations with the #UK next week.
Good meeting with @theresa_may where I got a first impression of the British White Paper.  We will look at the paper with constructive and realistic eyes. A deal must balance rights and obligations. #brexit 
Chaotic start to Dominic Raab's debut as #Brexit Secretary. Commons has to be suspended. Fury because MPs were not given copies of the Brexit White Paper. #bbcnews.
Is this the type of anarchy #MaxineWaters would like to have?Former 74 year old, British Ambassador beaten to pulp.. He had been doing a lot of media about the importance of #Trump visit #Brexit #ThursdayThoughts#WalkAway #DemonCrats what r u hiding?
#BREAKING UK publishes controversial #Brexit plan amid cabinet rebellion 
Total shambles in House of Commons as Government fails to release #Brexit #whitepaper before Raab stands up to present it. Speaker forced to abandon sitting. #Brexitshambles #PeoplesVote
Great start! NOT!@DominicRaab’s statement to the House on the #Brexit White Paper suspended so MPs can actually get a copy - Speaker says "it is most regrettable that this situation has arisen".Disgraceful behaviour from the @CONservatives, sticking two fingers up to MPs.
Globalism is Corporatism#TrumpUKVisit@Theresa_May is an anti democracy Globalist Fascist pushing a fake #BrExit to make the UK slaves to the Corporations

Anyone bollocking @realDonaldTrump for interfering in UK politics and having an opinion ...step outside and have a word with yourselves. What do you think @theresa_may flew to meet Merkel for...she not only interfered she wrote the dammed #Brexit White Paper published out today.
Surprised you didn’t throw yourself forward for his old job Gary, would you like him to tutor you before you lead the #brexit campaign through as the people voted?
#BREAKING @heraldscotland reporting 51% favour a 2nd Scottish independence referendum. @RuthDavidsonMSP this is the result of your u turning on #brexit 
Nobody's buying @theresa_may old banger #Brexit. Government analysis says #Brexit will damage trade & economy. We need a #PeoplesVote
British government is hoping for quick trade deal with US after #Brexit and hails special relationship but public dislikes Donald Trump, according to YouGov poll:-* 77% have unfavourable view of Trump* 63% found him to be racist* 74% said he was sexist

Britain facing 'state of emergency' if no deal reached, Dominic Grieve warns. May's #Chequers plan is still a hard #Brexit, and no deal would be a national disaster. 
BREAKING: The latest polling from @britainelects (via @YouGov) - the #Brexit deal agreed at Chequers is...- Good for Britain: 13% (-1)- Bad for Britain: 42% (+9)#Brexit won't be solved in Westminster. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final deal
Guardian editorial not pulling its punches.They had no plan. They have no plan. #stopbrexit #VoteLeaveCheated #brexit #ToriesOut
While we are on the subject of disgraceful and wrong Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn, when are you going to call for an enquiry into the Vote Leave campaign who cheated and broke the law?#Brexit will ruin lives and your support of the Tory Brexit without a #PeoplesVote is shameful.
New poll makes it clear @theresa_may #Brexit deal is not supported. We need a #PeoplesVote on the final deal to take back control
I think it's clear from the comments that your 'Civil service lead' Deal doesn't respect what people voted for. Please resign and let some one who wants to honour the vote take us into a positive future outside the EU. You clearly are not capable #Brexit #MayMustGo

UK will be at the bottom of the growth pile in the EU this year - thanks to #Brexit 1.3% in 2018 is very, very poor. With economic data like this, it is hardly surprising that calls are growing for there to be a #PeoplesVote at the end of the process @peoplesvote_uk
There are many parallels between #Trump nationalism and #Brexit. Just look at Theresa May's #HostileEnvironment and Trump's migrant detention centres. We need to draw those parallels and mobilise those outraged about #TrumpUKVisit to join our cause. #StopBrexit will meet them.
The #Government plans for a No-deal #Brexit show how utterly stupid and chaotic it would be #BrexitChaos
Over 30% of construction workers in London are EU nationals, who are much younger than their UK counterparts. Apprenticeships have also plummeted since the referendum. Without young & sufficient skilled workers, our aging construction sector is going to be hit hard by #Brexit 
The ultra-right currently have the population in a #Brexit cage. They're not voluntarily going to let us out as they know we'd never get back in, as we know we were corruptly tricked into it. It's up to us to break out, and the clock's ticking. A (now) minority like it in here. 
Not as OK as I thought. If he’s supporting #TheresaMay’s sell-out fake #Brexit, he has picked the wrong side.
Really sad that we're leaving the #EU especially when our politicians lied and acted so deceitfully throughout the referendum campaign. YOU #NigelFarage are a terrible role model for our young people. But your hideous scheme will soon unravel. #Brexit will not come home.  
The Secretary General of the European Commission tweeted a series of football emoticons & EU flags celebrating England losing in the World Cup semi finals- he’s showing the disdain we’re held in by the majority in Brussels, not at all surprising #BREXIT

As @Jon_Danzig writes in his blog, 'If the politicians, and the country, can’t agree on what #Brexit means today, then how could voters have known what Brexit meant in the referendum of over two years ago?' Please RT.  #ExitBrexit #PeoplesVote
More than half of those who voted for #Brexit don’t think Theresa May’s EU plan respects the referendum result. In the same poll Labour have overtaken the Conservatives, another trend that has been seen since May’s unveiling of her Brexit plan. 
How quickly we’ve gone from Europe begging us for a deal, Global Britain and #Brexit dividends straight to “so you maaay have to live on horse dripping; it’s patriotic”.

Even with a soft #Brexit we pay a £50 billion + divorce fee, lose loads of business and jobs, and are subject to EU laws we have no influence over. Who, in their right mind, would swap what we already have for THAT?

All so obvious to #Remain & stated at the start of this #Brexit farce. Most MPs know it but have remained shamelessly compliant to a false advisory plebiscite.The only logical solution; to #Revoke #Remain #Reform & only party self interest prevents it!

The Tories want the economy to die so their mates can buy everything up on the cheap. #BrexitCorbyn wants the economy to die so he can nationalise what’s left of it. #BrexitThe rest of us just want to live in a decent country and have jobs. Who do we vote for?
This tweet encapsulates the difficulty for labour voters. Jeremy Corbyn has said the #Brexit ship has sailed. It will happen. And labour MP Kate Hoey rudely ridicules a politician who is reaching out to the UK. It seems democracy in labour is being  confused with dictatorship

It was desperation by the pro-EU "men in grey suits" who run the party to avoid an election campaign & install a puppet leader who, just like William Hague, was set up to fail. They'll do anything to stop #Brexit. May is out of her depth & deluding herself that she's in charge.

"Our #politicians are on the verge of being loathed" @Nigel_Farage on the depth of anger in the country over #TheresaMay's #fake #Brexit and the #politicalclass who are enabling her betrayal!   #MayMustGo @Conservatives #BBC #SKY
While Jeremy Corbyn and the shadow cabinet flatly refuse to prop up Theresa May and her farce of a #Brexit deal, the Blairite rump on the backbenches are only too happy to offer her their support. Not that AC Grayling has noticed. He's too busy slagging off Corbyn, as per usual. 
I can't make up my mind which disappoints me most.1) The deceit & the con for 2 years, or2) The lack of backbone in Westminster to get #Brexit DONE.Either way, I'll never recover my belief that most MPs are working for the good of the UK, rather than themselves.#DrainTheSwamp
March against #Trump on Friday with @Another_Europe to say no to the government's botched #Brexit: 
This kind of arrogant, obnoxious, condescending and insulting attitude by unelected European bureaucrats like @eucopresident @donaldtusk, only helps to underscore @realDonaldTrump's distrust of #EU & Britain's decision to #Brexit. 
"The government is about to begin stockpiling processed food in case the country is plunged into chaos by a “no deal” #Brexit." But I'm sure we still aren't heading for a 'Mad Max' style post-apocalyptic dystopia... 
Very worrying warning from a leading Brexit expert, that #Brexit could break up our @NHSengland. A future US/UK trade deal would include US pharmaceutical companies looking for access to our health service.

1/2: The investigation into #CambridgeAnalytica is tugging at a loose thread that is connected to the very fabric of our society. This scandal isn't just about #Facebook, #Trump, #Brexit, #VoteLeave etc. It is about the way corporate power subverts our democracy to its own ends. pic.twitter.com/XcIBj5Dnmi
6) As prime minister, #TheresaMay hasn’t got one thing right from the day she took office. She almost threw away a general election she had in the bag, destroying her own majority. She only scraped in because she promised to deliver #Brexit. Now she has reneged on that promise.
4) They know that if #Brexit is thwarted, this country will be mired in bitter division, with battle lines permanently drawn. No democratic vote will ever be respected again. If our vote doesn’t count, then neither does yours.
3) Many people who voted to remain want #Brexit to happen because they’re fair-minded enough to respect the result of a democratic vote. They can see that for the government to renege on the result would be like punching a hole in the bottom of a boat.
I have been told that @theresa_may is forcing MPs to accept her very soft #Brexit #Chequersplan, the one she agreed with Merkel & then forced onto the cabinet.She is threatening people with Corbyn if they dont agree. No Mrs May, you & your plan will give us Corbyn. #MAYMUSTGO

#NATOSummit @realDonaldTrumpYou need to be warned that @theresa_may is a liar.Two years ago she told Brits that #Brexit means we are LEAVING the EU.Now she says #Brexit means STAYING IN the EU.It is the biggest political betrayal in the history of the UK.#BrexitBetrayal
Excellent question from my colleague @darrenpjones calling for a judge-led inquiry into the multiple law-breaking by the #Brexit campaign #BrexitShambles #PeoplesVote
Brexit won't be solved in Westminster. That's why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal so the people can take back control of this process. Join the campaign and sign the @peoplesvote_uk petition today:
No one voted for this. New facts are emerging all the time, & we know #Brexit is not deliverable in the terms it was sold to the British people. There won't be a 'Brexit dividend' for the #NHS. Brexit will impact economic growth and therefore jobs:
This shows just how bad a 'no deal' #Brexit will be for our country & our families. The rhetoric of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson saying "no deal is better than a bad deal” has been exposed as hot air. But hot air won't put food on the table! Pls RT!

Government Ministers are drawing up secret plans to stockpile processed food in case of a ‘no deal’ Brexit - No matter how you voted, no one wanted this! This shows just how bad a no deal #Brexit will be 
Remember tory MP Anne Marie Morris? You know the one that used the N word, she's just popped up on the #bbcdp to give us her thoughts on #Brexit, only a tory could go on this programme and not have these recent comments mentioned, shame on you again @BBC.
So @Kirstene4Angus has recently published an article apparently piling pressure on Theresa May over seasonal workers. Let’s see just what Kirstene actually supports in this list... #Brexit 
Have long believed that there is  around 25%-35% of the electorate who want #Brexit no matter what & that somewhere between 65%-75% who either don't want it or would be relieved if it didn't happen..Yet here we are with Tories & Labour backing the 25-35% & denying a #FinalSay!
Our/my #Brexit red lines:We leave the #EUNo more payments of £billions for #EU market accessRegain control of our borders#UK courts regain supremacy, not #ECJWe can make free trade deals with other countries
#Brexit won't give us more sovereignty. Our need for trade will mean we will increasingly become vassal states of some combination of the EU/USA/China. Free trade means overcoming Non-Tariff Barriers and so interference in domestic policy. EU membership does that democratically.
Britain has less than nine months to organize its place in the world outside the EU. @specialreports profiles the prime minister shaping #Brexit – a detail-oriented creature of habit:

It looks like everyone is unhappy with #Brexit so let's just bin it and focus on getting our country back on its feet. The NHS, education, jobs, security, our position in the world (and many other things) are all more important than this pointless mess. 
Tory Leaver Andrew Bridgen challenged and corrected by @adamboultonSKY for lying about food standards. #Brexit #Trump #Toxic
The referendum was because David Cameron feared losing the election, losing voters to UKiP. He promised a referendum to bring them back to vote Tory. He never wanted #Brexit and fought against it. As much as some hate Blair, Cameron and May will go down in history as worse PMs.
#brexit v #worldcup. UK Cabinet: 23 members - 22 white; one non-white. England world cup squad: 23 members - 12 white, 11 non-white. Which 23 is doing better? Just asking.
Confirmatiion that Cambridge Analytica data was accessed by Russian actors is in FT interview with ICO Commissioner Elizabeth Denham. It gives weight to perceptions of there having been coordination of social media targeting by Trump/#Brexit campaigners & Putin's mafia state. 
It is clear the #EUref result was achieved by massive illegal data fraud & breaking the law in multiple ways by #VoteLeave & #LeaveEUHow long will it take before @BBCNews stops respecting fraud & illegal acts on our democracy?#VoteLeaveBrokeTheLaw #VoteLeaveCheated #Brexit

Powerful intervention this AM from @WalesOnline #ChiefReporter @ShiptonMartin calling for @peoplesvote_uk on specifics of any #Brexit deal. Nothing else will help resolve the current fantasy world of #ChasingUnicorns. Nothing else will give certainty to business & Welsh workers
BEST. THREAT. EVER. “If you don’t give us a good #Brexit deal we’re going to eat nothing but tinned pilchards, spam and angel delight.” They must be quaking in their boots. 
2016: "There will be no downsides to #Brexit, only a considerable upside."2018: "Stockpile canned food now."

They foresee a potential catastrophe, yet remain determined that #Brexit will happen, deal or no deal. Why is Brexit a more powerful principle than national survival? 
This is dynamite.  A MUST-WATCH - President Trump talking to NATO Sec-Gen Stoltenberg in Brussels.Distinctive #Brexit research and news: 
I used to laugh at the rather more excitable remainers who talked of stockpiling tin food for #brexit.It’s now official govt policy. 
Correct if you only consider Labour and Tories.Of course the @LibDems and @vincecable oppose #Brexit and want an #ExitFromBrexit A #PeoplesVote appears to be the most likely route to achieve this.
The gov’t is stockpiling food to keep the food and drinks industry afloat in the event of a no-deal scenario. Read it again. Stockpiling food in case we run out. Still think #Brexit is a good idea? #peoplesvote please.

There's more to #UK politics than #Brexit.#Tories have tried to take free school meals away from poor kids, undermined the #NHS, increased homelessness & tried to send sick & dying back to work.Any #Labour MP calling for a National Govt betrays the people who voted for them.

Sajid Javid has told the Homes Affairs Select Committee that there may never be a post-#Brexit regime that calls for EU citizens to obtain a visa to enter the UK.So May's labour mobility plan is freedom of movement by another name. 
Seems like the week to take this #Brexit cartoon for another walk 
Democracy is having the option to reverse democratic decisions when they turn out to be bad ideas, like you just admitted #brexit is. 
Dear EU27, we are so confident in our #Brexit negotiating position we have decided to stockpile processed food.Yours sincerely,Theresa May and HM Government

Under #BrexitBetrayal any new trade deals would have to comply with EU tariffs and regulations, which is tantamount to still being in the EU.We are being offered #Brexit in name only. 
This is appalling from @jennirsl The Liberal “intelligentsia’s” contempt for working people who voted #Brexit is writ large. 
The Sun, one of the strongest supporting #brexit papers, is now reporting the UK Govt is stockpiling processed food as a Brexit contingency.But apparently we all knew what we were voting for... 
Official campaign Vote Leave spent £2.7m with AIQ; we don’t know what they got for their moneyNow Information Commissioner has blocks AIQ from using British citizens’ dataStrong action should be applauded but what about #Brexit vote? It can no longer be considered reliable
Ministers draw up plans to stockpile food in case of 'no deal' Brexit. I hope the dinosaur #Brexit voters are happy to dig for victory in their flower beds. The younger generation don't own homes, let alone gardens to dig. What do they do? #Peoplesvote

Thank you for welcoming our @POTUS. America loves him. He is helping us take our Country back. I pray that God would give you such a leader.  Stand strong; work to change your leadership.   #Brexit must happen.
Yet another #SHOCKER.And what a "coincidence" that Mercer-backed #CambridgeAnalytica (data firm for BOTH #Brexit & @realDonaldTrump that Steve Bannon helped run) scraped the #Facebook data for MILLIONS of Americans & Britons and allowed #Russia to access it.#TrumpRussia

1. The Leave Alliance is the only campaign to have produced a workable comprehensive plan. Our recommendation is to leave via the EEA. This is not because we are soft brexiteers. #Brexit thread.
So the tories are stockpiling processed food in preparation for a no deal #Brexit, so this is the scenario of no deal is better than a bad deal, the tories should be fucking hounded out of office if they contemplate putting us through this pain, #StopBrexitSaveBritain, #ToriesOut
@theresa_may's political judgement is abysmal, e.g. her appalling 2017GE campaign.I joined the Tory Party to fight the 1979GE campaign. I have been a Conservative activist since. If #Brexit is betrayed, my whole family & me (20 adults) will never vote Conservative again!

Just putting aside the obvious Kremlin assets in the #Brexit referendumThere are now MULTIPLE crimes around the referendum  involving electoral law and dataprotection being investigated by various agencies. That was not a free and fair election. 
Toby Young on SkyNews paper review just made an excellent point. "There's no Parliamentary majority for - (i) a hard #Brexit(ii) a soft #Brexit, or(iii) anything in between."So I think we're going to crash out without a deal."Bring it on, I say!
As a lone crusader @carolecadwalla has prompted at least six investigations by the @ICOnews and @ElectoralCommUK with dozens of articles, around 80,000 words and exposing Facebook, Cambridge Analytica and illegality in the #Brexit Campaign

If you don't like swearing don't read.May was on the TV again saying #Brexit is the will of the British people. No it fucking isn't. It was the will of some of the people and none of them had a fucking clue what it would entail until now.Is that fucking clear @theresa_may
I do not fucking believe this. Labour are helping the Tories push through #Brexit because those in need need it most? I mean COME ON UK?! Brexit is the answer to no question ever asked. It won’t solve Britain’s problems. It’s fraudulent and flawed. Oppose it! #WATON #FBPE.
I'm thinking through the matter of @RuthDavidsonMSP's reappearance on TV news today (BBC & STV). Two pieces to camera - one outside Holyrood, one inside. Both allow her to sound off about #brexit, neither asks her about #DarkMoney and offensive Tory councillors.What's going on?

Alan Morrison has been running his business in Bishopbriggs for 12 years. Last week he told us why the European Single Market & Customs Union is important to his work.  #Brexit #ProtectingWhatMatters
Bigger than #BrexitNow clear we have a political class determined NOT to enact instruction given to it by British electorate & PM prepared to destroy her own party, even democracy, to perpetuate Britain’s subservience to anti-democratic supranational #EU
 TRANSCRIPT: Speech by @MichelBarnier @EACCNY just now - “One thing is clear: we will not change who we are as the European Union because the #UK is leaving. The EU is and will remain the most open market in the world”  #Brexit @EUintheUS
I have done it. It's a long one but I wrote to my MP to say I can no longer campaign on behalf of the Party or the PM. I feel so gutted...#Brexit 
WATCH: Home Sec admits to me today that best deal for our safety + security is current levels of cooperation with EU. So why did his Minister vote against @NickTorfaenMP amendment on police and justice cooperation this morning? Incoherence. #Brexit @peoplesvote_uk @Open_Britain
Tory Party vice-chairman Maria Caulfield resigned over the Chequers #Brexit deal She revealed: “Since the announcement on Friday my constituents, whether they voted leave or remain, have contacted me in large numbers to say they do not support the deal."
#Brexiteer Bridgen:  “The Prime Minister has promised on repeated occasions that 'Brexit means #Brexit'. But it now appears those promises are all a pretence and a charade intended to dupe the electorate, which is an insult to their intelligence."
Seems like @10DowningStreet can continue to enjoy the support of @duponline as we hurtle towards a damaging no-deal #Brexit. The concerns of @the_brc are very serious and should be heeded.
May's plan is not #Brexit - But as Boris wrote, "What is even more disturbing is that this is our opening bid."
Amazing how a nation that colonized almost the entire world is now being marginalised #Brexit
Labour's deputy leader @tom_watson today said a second referendum might be required if Parliament proves unable to agree on a #Brexit plan.But this still denies the British people the right to a #PeoplesVote.  We have no trust in MPs. #StopBrexit
There’s a sniff of revolution in the air.  You can’t betray democracy without consequences.  The @Conservatives need to be extremely careful & would be wise to get rid of May ASAP & deliver #Brexit properly.  Ignore the electorate at your peril.  #MayMustGo #BrexitBetrayal

If Theresa May ditches all the ultra #Brexit loons and adopts an EEA plan she will carry the majority of the country and be thanked for her service. If not she will go down as the worst PM in history.
Ben Bradley has also quit as Tory Vice Chair. He's the charmer who once described working English people as a "vast sea of unemployed wasters" who should have vasectomies in order to stop them having several children. A proper man of the people our Ben.#BenBradley #Brexit

Tired of Theresa May being insane, Boris Johnson calls it quits, threatening the continuation of her ability to govern. #BorisJohnson #UKIP #Brexit #Chequers #Politics #UK
Most hypocrtical/treacherous part of sudden support for May by #LibDems & #Blairites is that her #Chequers Brexit plan is far 'harder' #Brexit than anything Extreme Centrists have criticised #Corbyn & #Starmer for. So, ignore #LibDems & NO re-selection for May-backing Labour MPs.
There's one thing you have to say about these Bullingdon Club boys: they are very good at walking away from a mess they have created. #BorisJohnson #DavidCameron #Brexit
In the Dáil Leo Varadkar had just indicated that he is willing to negotiate the backstop as different from that agreed in Dec. At the time he said it was a cast iron guarantee. #brexit
Theresa May's Chequers plan is "the biggest loss of British sovereignty since Britain's accession to the EU in 1973" - Sir Ivan Rogers, UK ex-ambassador to EU, and very stauch remainer.Why are self-professed Brexiteer MPs with May on this one?#Brexit 
You have INSULTED the British peopleAll we have asked from PM is that she sticks to what she has promised.Now it appears those promises are all a pretence & a charade intended to dupe the electrorate, which is an insult to their intelligence.#Brexit #EU
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said EU should be flexible on red lines in response to the the Brexit deal worked out in Chequers  #Brexit 
May has survived the resignation of high-profile #Brexit heavyweights. Could this be a blessing in disguise? @WJames_Reuters reports from Westminster: 
.@Peston using classic propaganda tactics calling those MPs who want to carry out the #Brexit we voted for "Rebels" and those who want May's soft Remain effectively loyal. Thus creating bad v good scenario. 
You are utterly deluded if you think there are still 17.4m people in this country who want #Brexit. This is yet another lie in a long, long litany of Brexit lies. At some point you people are just going to have to start dealing with reality.

Blairites find the idea of a socialist Labour government under Jeremy Corbyn so repulsive, they'd rather prop up Theresa May as she pushes through a terrible #Brexit deal. Meanwhile, millions suffer as a consequence of Tory austerity. These people are truly devoid of principles.

Britain got used to imperial decline post WWI, then economic & political decline post WWII.With the rebirth of London, importance of services, EU membership - the UK turned back the tide on its historical descent.#Brexit will see the return of the politics of declinism again.

It's about time the media educated the general public about what 'No Deal ' means and it's potential catastrophic consequences. Perhaps then we might have fewer people coming out with imbecilic pronouncements on Twitter. #brexit
I don’t buy the Corbyn line on #Brexit. If there was a public vote against something he fundamentally believed in (take your pick) he would ‘respect’ the vote but campaign tirelessly to change public opinion. That he doesn’t do this with Brexit is revealing.
This is serious. And totally expected.The UK shouldn't be threatened-by anyone.The political Parties need to come together on behalf of the nation and make a joint statement and #StandUpToTrump.#Brexit is OUR business Not his.#TrumpVisit

It’s hilarious to see all the politicians who championed the #FBPE movement come out to support May in delivering #Brexit It goes to show that they jumped on the movement to criticise Corbyn alone and not to actually stop Brexit as they claimed.#Hypocrites
Better still a brand new party that welcomes pro European, business and progressives from across the current party spectrum. So many of us ’48%’ feel politically homeless right now. Party representation would be game changing and get us out of this sorry #Brexit mess.

I know it is not for an American to say but nevertheless I believe the #Brexit decision was the most harmful vote taken in this century by the U.K. and was no doubt influenced by Russian interference. It is being used by partisan politics when this issue should transcend politics
Speaking at meeting with young people, German Europe Minister @MiRo_SPD says that "the door always remains open for the UK" - good to see. If British people want to change their mind on #Brexit, they can. #PeoplesVote provides this option. @peoplesvote_uk

Well done, Theresa. You have done as much to harm the UK as Blair. No mean feat. #EnoughIsEnough of you and your #BrexitLies. As I suspected when you were made PM, you had no intention of leaving. Resign and let more honourable democrats lead us out of the EU darkness. #Brexit

My question to the Prime Minister in @HouseofCommons yesterday. Her proposed #Brexit deal does nothing for services which make up most of the British economy. It will reduce market access & add complexity - as @techUK have said. Why is the PM ignoring important industries?

#Brexit is dead in the water.  Gee, thanks Theresa May.  Take a bow.
The EU cannot and will not accept May‘s #Brexit plan. The Single Market has rules which its members obey like the 4 freedoms. These cannot be cherrypicked to suit the whims of individual countries. If that were to be allowed all those participating would demand bespoke deals too
So @theresa_may is threatening her party to show unity to ensure @jeremycorbyn doesn't get into power? But if we're effectively controlled by the EU & its "rule book" & ECJ jurisdiction does it then really matter who the illusionary UK Govt is? UK democracy has died! #Brexit
Er...your MPs owe allegiance to their constituents not Mr & Mrs Murrell. And Scottish independence would damage Scotland's economy worse than #Brexit. So stop talking nonsense.

The EU had cancelled the results of three referendums on its future in Europe when the vote went against it. It has now effectively cancelled a fourth one in Britain. The communist in Brussels won't take no for an answer. #Brexit

Theresa May is openly working for the EU. To go and agree the #Brexit plan with Merkel in Berlin before submitting it to her cabinet as an ultimatum is treachery of the highest order. In a civilised country she would be impeached by now.

6) it is supremely ironic that those complaining about the UK capitulating on #Brexit today fully expected 27 other sovereign nations to capitulate, because we're Britain & they're only Foriners or something.Well, they aren't going to, and Brexiters are left with nothing else
Betraying BritainMay has ignored the Referendum, her own manifesto & British electorate.We elect our representatives to follow through on their word, manifestos & pledges.May has broken this & does not deserve to lead British Govt any longer#Brexit #EU
Given that it has taken two years for the government to formulate some sort of #Brexit plan, how can anyone claim they knew what they were voting for? The government didn't even know until Friday night.
5) when you cut through all the bluff & bluster of Philips & other Brexit leaders the "plan" came down to one idea - 1 country would bully 27 others into bending to its will, using a catastrophic "no deal" as a threat.There was nothing else, no other great #Brexit plan
Britain has gone to huge trouble to humiliate itself. Best possible #Brexit outcome is the worst of both worlds, a state neither in nor out

A plea to @UKLabour @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer: Please stop your dangerous flirtation with #Brexit. It represents the most illiberal, pernicious threat to the values we hold dear. History and the voters will judge you harshly if you continue to support it.

For two years pro-EU centrists have wrongly accused Jeremy Corbyn of siding with the Tories on #Brexit, demanding he ignore the referendum result and #StopBrexit. Now Brexit appears to be on the rocks, centrist Labour MPs like Tom Watson and Mike Gapes want to help Theresa May.
Morning, I know its hard not to gloat at #Brexit mess in the UK, but we need them to be coherent, they are our largest market for many things, our closest neighbours and room mates in this awkward flat share that is this island. That said, I've just found my inner  #Croatian!
What is needed now is a Grand #Brexit Coalition to ensure there's just one Brexit candidate in each constituency at next election.We can then elect a majority of MPs who will actually deliver the Brexit we voted for.What a novel idea, politicians respecting a democratic vote !!
‘When you take away all the heroic elements of #Brexit, all the epic thrills of throwing off the oppressor and beginning a new history, what you are left with is just this – a country that has gone to enormous trouble to humiliate itself.’ Coruscating from @fotoole

May seems to have tried to genuinely respect the full referendum result; deliver leave for the 52% while acknowledging the 48% exist too. She's tried to find some sort of balance and compromise in an issue mischaracterised as binary. This is surely a good thing. @JuliaHB1 #Brexit 
Why oh why can’t we be good at sport and politics at the same time? Reminds me of being at Uni when I couldn’t be thin and clever at the same time as both took such effort ! Life eh? See you at 6am @GMB talking #brexit #BoJo #WhatHappensNext
We all know what a bunch of duplicitous self-serving hypocrites politicians are so why should they worry if they simply decide to ignore the 2016 referendum result and abandon #Brexit ? They'll only upset a minority and that's what happens all of the time.
An extended #CNNTalk today, live from Westminster w/ @IainDale, @NinaDSchick & @brianklaas. Is #Brexit impossible, following the Prime Minister’s cabinet ‘crisis’? 
Whether one favors or dislikes #Brexit, he/she should acknowledge that if you cannot leave a system, it will harden the authoritarian nature of the system and greatly increase the likelihood of a catastrophic failure, when the system is hit by a shock.
A woman has been mudered, likely by leftover nerve agent from a Kremlin assassination attempt on UK soil, but response from UK government, mired in #Brexit shambles, so far zero. #Brexit proving huge success for the Kremlin. 
Time for Midlands Tories to decide if they will back the #Brexit their electorate overwhelmingly voted for or prop up @theresa_may and her Brexit betrayal .
Headed for a hard landing #ChinaDailyCartoon #Brexit 
#Brexit Ministers drew up plans to #LEAVE.No 10 drew up a totally different Brexit plan and presented it like a rabbit from a hat at Chequers.It is no wonder #Brexit Ministers resigned.They were totally shafted by their own PM.The PM acted despicably.#MayMustGo

In the midst of the fall of #Brexit, the chaos of the Tories and the lack of an opposition front bench when the country most needs it, #FBPE continues to gain strength because it is organic, grassroots, transparent and cross party. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things 
Rees-Mogg might look like an amiable cartoon character toff, in reality he's an extremely dangerous, self-serving, racist zealot with an eye for the top job, he's also going to make a shedload of momey on the back of #Brexit 
#BREXIT is not a valid word. Apparently. 
Remainers calling those who voted #brexit "extremists"/"hardline brexiteers" is incredibly insulting to millions of people. YOU voted remain, YOU lost. Do not attempt to take OUR clothes & claim to know what WE voted for & what's best for us
As #Brexit pulls British Government apart, @duponline find time for a bit of Irish language bashing ......"There will not be an Irish language Act, and the quicker people catch on the better."Jim Shannon, DUP 9/7/18
Walking out of the government won’t make Brexit go away, but as an optimist by nature, I hope that it creates some unity needed to find a parliamentary majority for an agreement that works. #brexit #BrexitShambles

Well done @IainDale for pointing out the lack of ‘balance’ on @BBCNewsnight bash #Brexit panel. Knocked Evan Davis slightly off balance...good stuff.
#BorisJohnson letter not first time Brexiteers insulted true history of colonialism. At Chalke Valley, Gove spoke of imperial domination & self determination. Not in the context of acnkowleding Britain’s past, obv. But claiming this for #Brexit. I wasn’t having then, either. 
I think - I hope - #Brexit will destroy the careers of a whole generation of UK politicians. May, Johnson, Gove, Mogg, Corbyn, Gardiner, Thornbury, Starmer. You name them. They are ignorantly and maliciously taking an axe to our society. They should not be forgiven.
#Brexit turmoil leaves UK in political chaos days before Trump visit. 
2 years 3weeks in and Vice President of the European Parliament Mairead McGuinness @MaireadMcGMEP laments that the UK has given them no proposal to vote on!!! That underlines the incompetent disasterous crazy bonkers UK approach to #Brexit . Imagine zero zilch nada
Secret video of #Brexit weekend talks at Chequers leaked . . . . 
Threatening us #Brexit supporters with a Corbyn govt doesn't cut it anymore btw.When Brexit is screwed up, the electorate WILL punish those who let them down & the Corbyn govt that results is not the fault of voters.
Over 12 months there have been no fewer than 35 opinion polls carried out, with about 60,000 participants. How many of these have shown a lead for #leave?That's right. Two. Out of 35.No longer the "will of the people"#PeoplesVote#NoConfidence#Brexit#BrexitShambles
#Brexiteers who remain in the Cabinet have put their careers before the country and before #Brexit That includes Fox, Leadsom, Braverman, Raab and Cleverly. RT if you agree.
When a politician says that this is his last job and then he will step away from politics And another says he will see #Brexit through to the endAnd another that he will fight any 3rd runway plans... Oh,. They didn't really mean it!!!#politicsgonemad
I see Emily Thornberry on the news trying to give people the impression that Labour could negotiate a 'good' #brexit.There is no such thing, where are the grown-ups in politics at the moment? What was promised can't be delivered.#StopBrexit #FBPE #PeoplesVote
The events of today should have happened BEFORE the EU referendum.There should have been a very clear definition of #Brexit and a detailed plan for its implementation before it was offered as a choice to the electorate.This almighty mess warrants a #PeoplesVote.     #Newsnight

There’s only one man for the job; we need a pro #Brexit PM and that has to be @Jacob_Rees_Mogg #MoggMentum
Reality for any remaining Leave supporters:You just can't have your promised land #Brexit, Johnson & co couldn't deliver itYou can't have "fuck it" hard Brexit, there's no public support for itYou *can* have soft Brexit if you insist, but honestly, what's the point?
Let the record show that it was the globalists who threw democracy on the fire, not nationalists. #Brexit #BrexitChaos #BrexitBetrayal
The 'common rulebook' May promises Britain will follow has existed since the founding Treaty of Rome 1957.It's called Acquis Communautaire, or, 'membership of the EU political union'Without this rulebook there's no EU. With it, we haven't left the EU, We've had no #Brexit. 
I voted to leave the #EU in 2016, mainly because I felt the UK was strong enough to go its own way without Europe. Over the past 2 years, I can now see the EU for what it really is. A vile, petulant, undemocratic bunch of bullies, who stand for nothing but themselves #BREXIT 
Trouble is Mrs May, time and time again you say one thing and then deliver something else which is entirely different. So when you SAY you will deliver #Brexit - we no longer believe you that you will. 
"The will of the people is the will of the government and vice versa." Goebbels after a Nazi referendum victory in 1933. The notion of the "Will of the People" as used in #Brexit politics denies the core democratic right to oppose. And where that right is denied, democracy dies 
Tuesday's Guardian: "May loses Johnson but faces down #Brexit rebels - for now" (via @AllieHBNews) #bbcpapers #tomorrowspaperstoday
Even in his resignation letter Boris Johnson can’t tell the whole truth on the EU.  He claims the EU stopped the UK legislating to improve lorry safety.  What he fails to mention is that the UK Govt was one of the Govts that sought to block the legislation #Brexit # fbpe
From a sitting Tory MP to another MP, this just is a bad look. Don't do this anywhere, especially not in public. This whole #Chequers/#Brexit proposal has bought out the worst in everyone. 
70% of #Conservative voters in last election wanted the #Brexit that was promised over & over again. To now change that in this dreadful #ChequersPlan is electoral madness. MP's & members who support this are signing up to a certain Corbyn gov next time. Do not do it!
Taxi for Theresa May! She had her chance.#Brexit  
“If the Conservatives forsake their election pledge to deliver a clean #Brexit, they don’t only risk losing future elections, but may for decades struggle to shake off the image of betraying the largest democratic vote in British history” @LowTaxChloe
Backing @theresa_may  means agreeing to do everything Merkel says. Shame on you. On the plus side it'll stop you causing more harm to the NHS. #Brexit #BrexitBetrayal #BrexitMeansBrexit
Another plus point of #Brexit . Theresa May says Tory dissent could send Jeremy Corbyn into No 10. #CorbynsComingHome
The problem all along with #Brexit negotiations has been that #Brexiteer @DavidDavisMP was never in charge. Chief remoaner @OllyRobbins was. That’s why we are where we are.

I have actually brought the Withdrawal Agreement (and #EUCO #Brexit guidelines) on holiday with me... 
Jeremy Hunt as Foreign Secretary? You are kidding me...?!? #Brexit #Bonkers
Remainer PM calls in/out ref - doesn't allow civil service to plan for #Brexit. Resigns after referendum, to be replaced by remainer PM. New remainer PM makes a balls up of negotiations, under immense pressure from remainers in HoC/HoL..but yeah, Brexiters didn't plan 
Tonight at a German Chamber of Commerce event in London, our CEO T. Enders said: “The Chequers statement appears to show that HM Government are going in the right direction.We are not shy to request that Brussels & our other home countries are similarly pragmatic & fair” #Brexit 
You think the LibDems were punished over tuition fees? That’s nothing compared to the fate that now stalks the Tories over #Brexit.

If there was an election tomorrow who would you vote for? #brexit #conservatives #libdems #ukip #green #labour
And yet another Tory Minister goes:  I & many others predicted #Brexit would destroy the union. It looks like we were right!
The speed at which this #reshuffle is happening, and the switching of senior people, shows that #BorisJohnsonResigns has been priced in by @10DowningStreet for some time. #brexit @LBC
Well, at least Jeremy Hunt has some experience for his new role. He was once culture secretary & the arts was all foreign to him. #Brexit #JeremyHunt
The #EU has made their position clear. No four freedoms? No deal! What the Tories are doing is offering a deal to the EU they know they won't accept so the only choice is a hard #brexit and the tories can do what they've always done- make the EU out to be the boogie man. #scotref
Here is what happened since the UK voted in favour of #Brexit in 2016 
.  @sajidjavid So upset you didn't stand up and fight for the rights of ord ppl re #Brexit.  So so disappointed.  @BorisJohnson
.@Jeremy_Hunt has been appointed as the new foreign secretary after @BorisJohnson quit the role over the governments #Brexit plans- Get more on the latest on the government twists and turns here: 
Not a single Remainer in Cabinet has resigned over Theresa's May's Chequers statement Again that confirms the Prime Minister really wants #Brexit in name only.
Quite the day for polishing turds. Just when you thought you'd read it all - Jeremy 'bell-end' Hunt appointed Foreign Secretary! #Brexit 
Two resignations: Boris Johnson quits over Prime Minister Theresa May's #Brexit plans 
. @theresa_may pretence she supported #Brexit is most cynical fraud ever imposed on a free nation!  PM lacks all morality! @BorisJohnson
Spent all day working with people I respect and admire, pacing the room and making pronouncements. Just noticed a massive rip in the seat of my trousers. #brexit
So for all those @UKIP People voted for the Tories based on 'only the Tories can deliver #Brexit' how's that working out for you.
Imagine what growth we will have in an Independent EU Scotland. #Brexit 
Shame on all the (fake) Brexiteers in Cabinet - Preparing to sell out the country and #Brexit
I’m truly disillusioned with all our politicians. #Brexit is an opportunity that could bring out the best of #Britain. Unfortunately, our politicians have made a laughing stock out of our great nation. Westminster needs clearing out and cleaning up - with a brand new broom.
There comes a time when you have to realise that the nation no longer wants you, and do the decent thing, leave. Better depart in dignity that hang on hopelessly?#MayMustGo#Brexit 
The fundamental reason the British Cabinet is in turmoil over #Brexit strategy is that all the alternatives are bad. Leaving “cold turkey” gives Britain independence, but is costly to business and British workers. It also divides Ireland.
Dear friends in the #UK. Do you realise that the future & dreams of your entire young generation (maybe your kids or grandchildren) is just destroyed by some hands full of egomaniacal gamblers without any plan (see ) supported by the +75 generation? #Brexit 
Theresa May Bio:• Campaigned for Remain, but without conviction• Became Tory leader and PM without contest• Reduced Tories to a minority govt without compunction• Is breaking her own Brexit promises without conscience.Time to take a(nother) walk?#MayMustGo#Brexit 
Apologies - unfortunately @theresa_may & her @Conservatives party are making us the laughing stock of the world. We assure you we will continue our fight against this devastating #Brexit. #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
#UKIP vanished because people temporarily gave their vote to the conservatives to try and make sure we got what we voted for with #Brexit. We have been betrayed by traitors and enemies of democracy.
For the first time in ten years Peter Bone's local Conservative activists refused to go out campaigning for the party because they were so disgusted with the Prime Minister's #Brexit plan - Expect more of this discontent while May remains in post. 
Give it a rest, Julia. Even Thatcher thought referendums were "the device of dictators & demagogues." She'd have given the #Brexit Ref short shrift if she knew about the gerrymandered franchise, lawbreaking and foreign interference. Stop pretending it was democracy's finest hour!
As #Brexit implodes with politics and power. I really hope this Island will once again empower....... United we are stronger........ 
Suella, there is not and cannot be a “successful #Brexit”  . It is utterly impossible , like pigs flying or Tories being comradely.  The only question remaining is the degree of damage this ill begotten , backward looking, fantasy mired adventurism will cause unless stopped. 
Resignations of the key #brexit ministers do not happen because of PM May’s plan would be bad.They happen because a Brexit they advocated was unattainable from the beginning.Promises of the brexiteers were an illusion and a huge scam to the British people.Only Putin wins.
Whilst the Tories implode over #Brexit a show of solidarity by Councillors from @WestHamLabour & @easthamlabour united against Islamophobia, racism, anti-Semitism & the 45th visiting the UK this Friday. #BringTheNoise
Meet Gove, the Tories' Knifer-in-chief.He knifed fellow Vote-Leave lead Boris Johnson who was set stand for Tory leadership to take charge to deliver #Brexit.And now, Gove is on board with Remainer May's cynical ploy to deliver a half-baked Brexit.Knifing 17 million Brits?

How long do you think #TheresaMay will survive in Number 10? #Brexit RT once you have voted.
How is it that the Tories have always maintained that the public knew what they were voting for in the #Brexit referendum, yet have never known themselves, and still don't.Maybe they should ask the voters again.
It's in the bag guys... Don't doubt it - #Brexit is HISTORY But our campaign should never have been to #StopBrexit... The #Tory government will do that for us - our campaign must be to promote the #EU and its values and there is a huge amount of work to do! #WeAreEurope

Wouldn't it be nice to see #brexit supporters wake up and declare if we can't leave the EU without destroying the economy, then maybe it's time we stopped being afraid, stood up and played an active role in leading and shaping the #EU. A brexiter dream we could all get behind.
Why am I angry some ask?@OllyRobbins & the PM worked on their own #Brexit proposal & paper for Merkel.They excluded the #Brexit team of @DavidDavisMP & @SteveBakerHW who were working on the paper based on talks to date.They didn't even know about it.
We LOVE YOU British Patriots  #brexit
Old Nige wants to shout from the sidelines, he has never actually wanted to take responsibility for anything that resulted from his rhetoric. Hence him running away to America when the #brexit referendum result was announced.
History will look back on the Britain in 2018 and wonder why on Earth it wrecked itself to keep a distinctly moronic nonentity called Peter Bone happy. #Brexit
Did anyone ask @theresa_may if she actually wanted #BrExit to happen before they put her in charge? She really had one job and she has yet to deliver. She clearly doesn't want it to even happen.
You know, #Brexit came about simply to settle an old Bullingdon Club schoolyard rivalry between Boris and Dave, and both have now run screaming from the consequences #BorisJohnson
It's not hard #UK. JUST LEAVE!! #WalkAway. The people voted. @theresa_may is clearly not capable of executing a full separation from the #EU. #Brexit must happen... now!

Finding it hard to convey just how depressing it is to be Brit working on #EU enlargement these days. As someone who has seen at first hand the enormous economic, political and social benefits of membership for so many countries, #Brexit simply defies all rational explanation.
I'll say it again. Myself and fellow leavers @HughNorris7 @jdlarwood @Will_DryOFOC did not vote for brexit just to drag the country into a weird tory melodrama over Europe. End this madness with a #PeoplesVote and govern in the national interest. #Brexit

UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson resigns amid internal division over #Brexit plan. 
Boris: 'We are heading for the status of a colony and many will struggle to see the economic or political advantages'. Now you see what your former colonies have been banging on about.  #Broxit #Brexit
The rules and regulations which leavers get so worked up about are what create the level playing field for trade. They are the basis of our prosperity. #brexit

#Brexit increasingly looks like a game of chess being played by ducks. They don't understand the rules, have no idea what they're doing, can't even really move the pieces properly and everyone around is asking "why are those ducks trying to play chess? Whose idea was that?"

May offered a face-saving fudge. Worse than the status quo but not actually insane. Now it will be sunk by #Brexit jihadis like Rees Mogg and opportunists like Johnson. Tories can't do it. Corbyn's Labour won't oppose. Neither can govern.
The “dream of #Brexit “ is a hallucination brought on by too much looking backwards by those susceptible to vainglory & historical fiction. It is however becoming a nightmare  particularly for Scotland which was never , and is not, seduced by it. 
If #Brexit were a real thing rather than an inchoate yearning, wouldn't someone have proposed a deliverable plan? All the architects have run away, like schoolboys who smashed the tuck shop window.

#Brexit #BorisJohnsonResigns I have found a solution for Mrs May. She needs to go to Tatters. I don't know where that is (is it in Brussels?) but I have been reliably informed that that is where her future lies...
If May isn't already toast she certainly will be when Brussels rejects her plan. If indeed they actually say anything about it. Brussels might conclude that serious negotiations are over and will use the time to prepare for no deal. #Brexit

To summarise: Conservative PM tries to see off Euroscepticism by promising In/Out referendum.  Government spends millions to get a Remain result.  Government loses.  Government delays implementing #Brexit.  New PM is Remain.  PM offers BINO.  Cabinet dissolves. GE 2018 imminent
My #Brexit plan:1. Withdraw Article 502. General Election3. Properly investigate Russian links to leave campaigns.4. Prosecute where necessary.5. Deport Nigel Farage.6. Cancel Brexit.7. Life gets back to normal.8. Woohoo.

Who’d have thought that a visit from @realDonaldTrump would actually provide welcome relief for Theresa May #Brexit
The Chequers proposal is a bureaucratic nightmare that’s riddled with complexity and ambiguity. Surely the PM must now stop trying to re-invent the wheel, and commit instead to an #EEA-based #Brexit? 
What is needed now is a Grand #Brexit Coalition to ensure there's just one Brexit candidate in each constituency at next election.We can then elect a majority of MPs who will actually deliver the Brexit we voted for.What a novel idea, politicians respecting a democratic vote !! 
1. This whole debacle is stupid. This is all on the Tory phobia of being a rule taker. This is the issue illiteracy that both sides suffer from. the fact is that unless you are a regulatory superpower you are a rule taker. The only question is how and from where? #Brexit thread

Absolutely right. There is no leadership in either the government or the opposition. We are in big, big trouble, and it really isn't clear how we are going to get out of it.  #Brexit is just insanely stupid (or genius if you live in the Kremlin). @Conservatives @UKLabour

Poor Theresa May choosing to be stuck with "the will of the British people" no matter how illogical... Luckily Scots SNP politicians dancing to the tune Scottish people who seemed to intuitively understand the approaching mess. #brexit
President of the European Council openly agitating for the real #PeoplesVote of 17.4m Brits to leave the EU to be overturned. They don't respect us, and they've got no intention of working constructively on a mutually beneficial #Brexit deal – it's time to man up and walk away.

I was in FCO 1984-2013 - & wd put G Howe on list of best.  But I agree w this view of Johnson. As journalist in Brussels he did huge harm to UK interest, helping to create false image of #EU that led to #Brexit, then chose Leave camp for selfish ends, & was dilettante ForSec. 
Oh, Gawd! Emily Thornberry on the Beeb still rabbitting on about leaving the Single Market. #Labour leadership as clueless about #Brexit and its consequences as May's chaotic government.
Boris Johnson is a f*cking clown.As I've previously stated, the blithering idiocy of Britain's Brexit is only exceeded by America's election of criminal con-man Trump.In both instances, Vladimir Putin and Russia win, and the 'free world' loses — BIG TIME. #Brexit

Isn’t it incredible that Boris Johnson, who only a matter of months before the 2016 #Brexit referendum wasn’t sure which way to vote, now finds his principles strong enough to resign from Government just as May is at her weakest? The Poundshop Machiavelli.
I just can't believe it's this chaotic. I always knew #Brexit would be a trainwreck, but calling the current state of #BrexitShambles a trainwreck feels like an insult to trainwrecks everywhere. Can we please finally have a #PeoplesVote to stop this nonsense?
Because Teresa the Appeaser and her coterie of #remainiacs have always wanted to frustrate #Brexit. Its the Tories own fault for electing someone who didn't believe in a policy to enact the most important policy for 50 years.

Boris Johnson has resigned as Foreign Secretary. I fully support him, David Davis and Steve Baker. The PM's #Brexit deal does not take back control of our democracy and is not what the British people voted for.
 I’m proud of both @DavidDavisMP and @BorisJohnson for standing by their principles. The decisions we take now will shape Britain’s relationship with the EU and the rest of the world for a generation. It’s imperative we do #Brexit right no half measures! #ChequersPlan
Boris Johnson resigns, Theresa May right now..... #byebyeboris #Brexit 
Jean-Claude Juncker on Boris Johnson resignation:"This clearly proves that at Chequers there was a big unity of views in the British cabinet" #Brexit 
Following @DavidDavisMP and @BorisJohnson's resignations from the Cabinet over #Brexit, should @theresa_may be next to resign?READ MORE: 
The Brexiteers in this country have been far too quiet. It’s time to stand up and be counted. Be loud and speak with passion! #Brexit
BREAKINGBoris has resigned.Four ministers have resigned in one day.PM will now be challenged.The #BrexitBetrayal cannot be allowed to stand.If the Tory MPs do not deliver the #Brexit we voted for, they are finished.
I know your minds are focused on #Brexit but this is important. 
Everyone working in PR in any field outside of #Brexit and #WorldCup2018 is hereby given the rest of the week off.
A chief champion of #Brexit just resigned, joining several other pro-#Brexit people in the UK government who abruptly resigned. After 2 years, they STILL did not have a plan how to implement Brexit. 
Whoa. Conservatives in the UK must reverse course on their soft #Brexit or lose power. @theresa_may has to go.Do elections even matter?Boris Johnson resigns as foreign secretary
Currently in most surreal meeting ever - a dry civil servant presenting a cabinet plan to opposition MPs that’s already fallen apart while news that Boris has quit circulates room - totally bizarre. Government falling apart before our eyes. Time for GE or @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit
Get in! Senior sources linked to UK intelligence told me there “was a problem” with Boris Johnson in relation to Russia over #Brexit. I took that to mean that Johnson had contacts with @RussianEmbassy during the referendum.
This really isn’t funny. Scotland... get out of this sinking ship. #brexit #indyref2
"The rebellion is underway" - @BorisJohnson has resigned as foreign secretary just hours after his fellow Conservative @DavidDavisMP #BrexitFollow live updates here: 
#brexit nationalist irony:1. Sees tweet explaining benefits of globalism and immigration.2. Drinks tea imported from India.3. Uses phone made in China, designed by a Korean Company. 4. Opens social media platform designed by an American 5. Claims that UK can do it alone.
OK @NicolaSturgeon what do you need? Neon lights? A giant pointy finger on a stick? A telegram from the Queen? #Brexit is a disaster, a shambles and a clear and present danger to Scotland. Call #indyref2
UK: Foreign Minister Boris Johnson (CON-ECR) resigns. #Brexit
Lord Callanan, one of the last #Brexit ministers standing, is at despatch box. As he trots out the usual line that govt is still clear it’s leaving single market, customs union etc the whole House roars with laughter.
A Downing Street spokesman:“This afternoon, the Prime Minister accepted the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. His replacement will be announced shortly. The Prime Minister thanks Boris for his work.” #brexit
Boris Johnson resigns to spend more time with his hairdresser.#Brexit #BorisJohnson
.@Femi_Sorry - If we get a deal that people don't want then it's not the will of the people... a #PeoplesVote on the terms of #brexit is the only democratic way forward.#StopBrexit #FBPE
The silence from @BorisJohnson is speaking volumes. Is another resignation imminent? #Brexit #TheresaMay
By inviting labour and LibDem MPs to her #Brexit briefing, a remainer PM breaks cover, gives up all pretence of delivering brexit and seeks remainer support to deliver a #BRINO over the heads of brexiteer opposition. Meanwhile voters look on.
From what I can gather, David Davis and his team were writing a white paper based on Theresa May's speeches. At Chequers May produced a different white paper, one knocked up by her team of remainer aids. The #Brexit team were totally blindsided. Davis was right to walk.
Labour's @hilarybennmp tells Sky News that parliament 'could find itself' rejecting the government's #Brexit dealFollow the twists and turns here: 
Tory #Brexit chaos at Westminster matched by lack of Tory leadership in Scotland. Ruth Davidson and Mundell missing in action and unavail for interview but Scottish Tory MPs taking sides. @RossThomson_MP taking his cue from Rees Mogg while John Lamont still backing a burst PM.
Oh, and needless to say Dominic Raab turns out to have multiple links to climate denial organisations. And, of course, the Taxpayers Alliance., as detailed here by @DeSmogUK. The full #Brexit Monty, in fact.
After good meetings in #Ireland, I am now on my way to #London to meet PM @theresa_may this evening. Our discussions will focus on #Brexit, bilateral relations & #eu2018at. Tomorrow I will attend the #WBSummitLondon.
Common Rulebook = customs union Ongoing harmonisation by treaty = single market, ECJ controlWorker mobility = freedom of movementWe knew that May was a dubious Remainer,We now know May's also a devious Renamer?#Brexit 
This is no way to run a government on such an important issue as #BrexitMay is simply not up to the job. She is one of those foolish people who grossly overstates her own leadership skills (which in reality are completely lacking). 
Constitutional crisis thickens. The referendum campaign is over, yet clearly it is not. Dilute our democratically chosen new status as an entirely independent and self-governing nation, and you'll dilute our democracy forever. #Brexit #bbcdp
"Hi, I'm MP Dominic Raab. You may remember me from such clusterfucks as "You don't need human rights" and "Let's bring back the workhouses".#Brexit #Brexitshambles #DavisResigns #DExEU
Chair of the #Brexit Select Committee @hilarybennmp 'seriously doubts' the EU will accept the government's plan for a customs agreementFollow live reactions to the resignation:  
Blairites accuse @jeremycorbyn of supporting Theresa May over #Brexit with no evidence whatsoever. @jessphillips literally tweets support for Theresa May over #Brexit and Blairites kiss her arse, simply because she hates Corbyn. Says everything you need to know about Blairites. 
Read our new report on the fantastic contribution of #EU workers to both adult social care and childcare in Scotland: @scotgov is committed to #ProtectingWhatMatters for EU citizens in Scotland throughout the #Brexit negotiations. 
It's been clear for a while that #Brexit is a hard-right/far-right coup executed by illegal means in the interests of the ultra-wealthy. Dominic Raab's appointment as Brexit Secretary merely confirms this. 
If the Brexit Secretary couldn’t back the Government’s #Brexit vision, how can the rest of us? Indeed, how can the remaining #Brexiteers in Cabinet back it? via @BrexitCentral
.@DominicRaab is excellent cabinet material, but the smart move would have been for no #Brexit MP to accept the job. May is still chief negotiator, so the job is really only that of a tame eunuch.
Remember when @BorisJohnson said that we must be stronger in #Brexit negotiations?We are looking to you to stay true Boris.RT if you think he must stay true to his principles and let him know. 
#Brexit is a treasonous betrayal of our country. It’s Russian and the #Brexit vote was acquired by criminal activity.#Corbyn’s failure to be on the right side of history will mean eventually people will see him for what he is, a traitor.
It’s time to say to the #EU - we will move to #WTO global #tradeterms from  March 2019. This will give certainty to business and allow us to embrace all the benefits of #Brexit. @JLongworthLML on @BBCNews  #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress #Tory

Tories now fighting open turf war, 3 weeks of front & back stabbing to the summer recess & 3 months of plotting to follow. Meanwhile, the clock ticks on #Brexit. This never about our country & all about their careers. We must stop it. #FBPE
Dominic Raab, the new #Brexit Secretary, has history of dog whistling against EU citizens of the worst kind. Here is my thread from April on his claim that EU migration pushes up house prices. It turns out to be hyperinflated tosh. 
"The return of control to parliament is more illusionary than it is real."David Davis explains why he quit as #Brexit Secretary today. He will be replaced by @dominicraab  
Would you vote for @UKIP if Nigel Farage was back in charge ???  #Brexit @Conservatives
1. Chris Philp MP: We've had a Ref...we can't keep on having Refs until we get the result the EU wants.ME: That's odd I would think MPs would be considering what the majority of UK Cits want? If a maj now want to stop #Brexit & #Remain then this #BrexitShambles must be stopped.
#Brexit drama worse than anyone imagined 
As #Brexit unravels and it is clear it was never deliverable, more MPs are suggesting giving the vote back to the people. They're washing their hands of it. #Brexit is too toxic and none of them now want the blame.  Rats and sinking ship comes to mind.
But apparently, according to Baker, this wasn’t misleading people, because - WAIT FOR IT - the Remain side warned people about it, but that was project fear and it was lies, but also it was true and people believed it and they chose #Brexit knowing there would be “some pain”. WTF
Baker, who just resigned from DExEU. This just makes me seethe with anger.@Jo_Coburn: “Why didn’t Vote Leave warn people that this would all be much more difficult?”@SteveBakerHW: “In the course of a campaign people must select the argument that they think will win.”#Brexit 
Your semi-regular reminder that the #FBPE people who complain about there being no opposition to the Tories are the ones who voted Lib Dem, enabled #Brexit and austerity, and want to maintain a status quo that benefits them.Well jog on, the lot of you.  Your time is done.
Wow. That new #Brexit proposal really glitters and sparkles, said nobody ever. Even the USA trade deal has gone belly up now. 
I'm in Frankfurt today. Fantastic city growing at a rapid pace because of the brexit exodus. A colleague tells me that around 10k jobs have been created in the city in the last 6 months as a directy result of #brexit. The UKs loss is the EUs gain. 
The Government’s approach to #Brexit needs to be part of a strategy to create the best future for our country. It has been clear for some time a) that it isn’t b) we don’t yet have that strategy. Good to discuss latest developments on today’s @daily_politics
Phillip Lee(Tory MP) - The public vote took place & it was a narrow vote for #brexit... so the public have put us in this place... so I think it is beholden on all of us in Parliament to put this back to the public. #PeoplesVote#StopBrexit #FBPE #bbcdp
#SteveBaker: explains why he resigned over @theresa_may's #Brexit policy: I didn't feel I would be able to go off around the #UK & #Europe wholeheartedly defending it.. that leaves you in a position in Government if you can't do that then you must resign!
What is needed now is a Grand #Brexit Coalition to ensure there's just one Brexit candidate in each constituency at next election.We can then elect a majority of MPs who will actually deliver the Brexit we voted for.What a novel idea, politicians respecting a democratic vote !! 
The Conservatives - the Business and Unionist Party - looks set to have to abandon one of their core beliefs in next few months, will it be business or unionism?  #DavidDavisResigns #Brexit
"She said she was going to do it properly, and then decided to have a #Remain approach to negotiations" #JacobReesMogg on @theresa_may's #Brexit betrayal. Time to put country before party and evict her from #DowningStreet!  #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome
Critics of @DominicRaab - the new #Brexit Secretary - won't let him forget that he once admitted not knowing how much the national debt was. 
The @Conservatives are playing a very dangerous game by briefing and begging opposition parties to help her push this non #Brexit through parliament against many members of her own party. If people do don’t get the brexit we voted for the people WILL vote further to the right.

Dear Mr @BarackObama , we Are in bit of a pickle re #Brexit. If you’re not too busy with the children and @MichelleObama Would you consider becoming our #PrimeMinister ?
The public voted for Brexit; it’s narrow but clear. We need to put this back to the public. I do not feel we have the informed consent of the public to push #Brexit through. I don’t believe the public were fully cognisant of the intricacies of Brexit when they voted. #SuspendA50
Neither #Conservative nor #Labour can deliver #Brexit for broadly the same reasons. It's damaging the country for both parties to go on and on and on pretending otherwise. 
I resigned because it was inevitable that the #Brexit process would end in this sort of disagreement. This isn't in the best interests of our country. I would rather Remain on a new immigration policy. #SuspendA50 @daily_politics #bbcdp
Do you think it is time for the people to have their say? Sign our #PeoplesVote petition below calling for there to be a @peoplesvote_uk on the final #brexit deal 
I could not agree more with @sarahwollaston on the need to refer this back to the people - there is growing momentum building behind a @peoplesvote_uk to resolve the #Brexit shambles and chaos at Westminster 
BREAKING: Our petition demanding a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal has hit 200,000 signatures!This issue is too big to ignore. Brexit is being botched, with even its chief architects turning away in despair. We need a People’s Vote. Sign & RT now:
Wait, us Tories are to review our #Brexit policy with the @LibDems?Insanity.
At a time of rapid change in relation to #Brexit, we're delighted to announce Lord Adonis will address the issue of a "People's Vote" on the final deal here at Queen's, Thursday 19 July. Register here: #LoveQUB
When it comes down to it. #Brexit is coming.The laws needed to bring it are passed. The date is set.If the deal doesn't happen, the default is No Deal.It's not Remain. 
I just want #Brexit to be done properly. If we're not going to do it properly, let's not do it. #SuspendA50 @Daily_Politics
I can’t believe @David_Cameron still has not deleted this tweet. It really does not age well!Launches a massive constitutional crisis in an attempt to resolve internal party issues! #Brexit #suspendA50
@mrjamesob The last 2 years of David Davis summed up.... #Brexit 
Appointing @DominicRaab as Brexit sec is a further kick in the teeth for working people. This is the man who described the need to protect workers' rights after #Brexit as red tape and described foodbank users as having cashflow problems. Could @Theresa_May get it any more wrong?
Who is Dominic Raab, Britain's new #Brexit minister? 
Every day there are new facts of the impact #Brexit will have. Today the boss of Asda has warned that a hard Brexit could leave food rotting at border and British Retail Consortium says food prices could rocket if the gov't botches our exit.
David Davis clearly isn't impressed with Chequers plan. But how is the UK government's latest #Brexit proposal seen across the channel? A short thread looking at reactions in the German(-language) media:
This thread on new Tory #Brexit Secretary Raab’s terrible record on protecting human rights is worth a read. Very worrying to have him determin by policy & negotiating on issues critical to @The3Million  & @BritishInEurope
Dominic Raab was member of Facebook group calling for workhouses for the poor'As an Ultra, your duty is to pressure Conservative Party on: privatisation of healthcare, sale of all council housing and workhouses for debtors'A safe pair of #Brexit hands
Live @ Westminster#SteveBray of #SODEM @SODEMAction makes the most of his non-speaking part. Outstanding positional play with #Brexit ‘Is It Worth It?’ Credit 2 @SDoughtyMP 4 pushing #PeoplesVote too, a very clear position explained @ValeforEurope It’s NOT a Done Deal
Very grateful that Austrian Chancellor @sebastiankurz took the time this morning to visit the border between Co Louth and Northern Ireland to see first hand the importance of maintaining the status quo here #Brexit 
It looks like Mrs. May is retreating on her #Chequers agreement, she's appointed ultra hard brexiteer Dominic Raab as the new #Brexit Secretary, this tory govt is all about clinging to power, even as it wrecks out country while doing so #StopBrexit #GE2018Now #bbcnews #SkyNews
4/ Dominic Raab, along with Boris Johnson & other Tories was calling for Union strike ballot thresholds to be raised to 50%. #Brexit gained only 37% of the votes of a rigged electorate. Thanks to @MarkBrierley1 for this.
Looks like Corbyn has played another blinder. Despite pressure from Blairites to oppose #Brexit, he respected the result of the referendum and gave the Tories enough rope to hang themselves. When Brexit finally crumbles, I'll be expecting apologies from the #FBPE brigade. #bbcdp
Stephen Doughty - It's absolutely extraordinary to have one of the key architects of #brexit, David Davis, jumping off the ship... this shows the shambles the government is in... the only way to resolve this is to put it back to the people & lets have a #peoplesvote#FBPE
A new #Brexit secretary was a chance to incorporate an understanding of how trade & immigration policies, along with their impact on the public purse & on carers, affects women differently. Somehow I doubt this appointment will bring that perspective. 
How true are rumours that there is a shortage of Popcorn in Brussels and 27 other Euro capitals? :) #BrexitShambles #Brexit #MESS
Congratulations on your appointment @DominicRaab . If you'd like to differentiate yourself from your predecessor from the word go, how about meeting @BritishInEurope and @The3Million to hear what a no deal #Brexit would mean for us? #DavidDavis #DominicRaab
Breaking: Angela Merkel appointed #Brexit secretary. PM claims it will save a lot of time travelling to Brussels for orders. #MayMustGo
What a day to launch @CommonsWelshAff report which took ‘overwhelming’ evidence that Welsh farmers ‘best served by retaining membership of the Single Market and Customs Union’  #Brexit 
Why would an intelligent, Brexit supporting man like Raab take a job as @OllyRobbins’ puppet? #Brexit #RejectBRINO
Dominic Raab is the new face of #BrexitMichael Gove is the two face of #Brexit
Theresa May is clearly trying to form a National Remain Government, with Labour + Lib Dem support. This is a complete betrayal of the British people. Brexit MPs must form an alliance to contest general election. #MayMustGoNow #Brexit

More and more of us can see that #Brexit has no clothes. It stands naked, forlorn and shivering before us, dying and gasping for breath, with nothing to offer the nation but years and decades of misery. Read and RT @Jon_Danzig’s commentary. Link: 
Brexit fan Dominic Raab is the new #Brexit Secretary. The same Dominic Raab whose father fled to the UK from Europe to avoid persecution from the Nazi's. Now in a position to stop Europeans from coming to or staying in the UK.
I once told the new Brexit Secretary @DominicRaab to turn his music down when we shared a corridor at uni. I shall be adopting the same approach with him in interviews obvs...#Brexit
We writers aren’t supped this be political on twitter but on its current course #Brexit is going to damage our country for decades. What’s happening now is a shambles. It’s time to #StopBrexit take stock and re-think.This isn’t just about Politicians careers, it’s about ALL UK
"I'm more concerned about the policy than the personnel" - @Jacob_Rees_Mogg tells Sky News that @theresa_may's latest #Brexit plan is more of a 'handbrake turn' than a 'u-turn'.Follow the twists and turns here: 
‘You can imagine them in Brussels, rubbing their hands.’On @BBCr4today John Humphrys feeds the British myth that the UK’s neighbours see #Brexit as a contest they can only win at the UK’s expense.Reminder to our British friends: this was your idea, not ours.#DavidDavisResigns
Who will be the 200,000 person to sign the #PeoplesVotePetition?  And as the government's #Brexit strategy goes into meltdown can we reach 300k by the end of this week?
There was no mandate for no deal. Therefore if that even looks like a possibility there must be a #PeoplesVote with choice #NoDeal or #Remain in #EUI can't believe we've let the #Brexit extremists lead us to this utter chaos. We need to put an end to it #StopBrexit
Just had invite with all Labour MPs to discuss Theresa May’s plan with her chief of staff Gavin Barwell. Not entirely sure how a discussion on a non-existent plan that’s already fallen apart is going to go...? Time for a @peoplesvote_uk #Brexit
Scottish Tories saying nothing about #Brexit or #DarkMoney this morning. No surprise of course. #Hopeless
Has Angela Merkel given us any indication yet on who might replace @DavidDavisMP as #Brexit Secretary?#AskingforAFriend
Ideological attachment to hard Brexit was never going to survive contact with economic - or parliamentary - reality.That’s why hard Brexiteers are throwing their toys out of the pram. Prime Minister should have forced them to confront this before triggering Article 50 #Brexit
I just turned on bbc 5live to see if any #Brexit latest. There’s a radio phone in. Caller just said EU is ‘a communist dictatorship’. The will of the people...
The fact is that #Brexit was sold on a false prospectus. As Parliament is not now going to have a meaningful final vote, people should be able to give their own verdict on the deal. #peoplesvote
Now is the time to bring Theresa May down. Although David Davis failed to walk away in a proper way and call on the party to get rid of her this is the moment for the #Brexit rebellion. May is working against Britain. An EU stooge and an NWO fanatic. .
#BreakingNews #DavidDavisResigns@DavidDavisMP chucks in the towel as #Brexit secretaryThat’s SIX resignations since the AutumnSo much for #StrongAndStable @theresa_may !This govt is in complete chaos and it’s time we had a #GeneralElection to finish them off
"Govt policy is an absolute stinker" on #Brexit - Tory MP Marcus Fysh."If @Theresa_May wants to break her manifesto pledges that is up to her ... these things have consequences"
Theresa May is to inform the HoC today about the much vaunted #Brexit plan agreed by Cabinet at Chequers. She is now struggling to contain rebellion orchestrated by JRM. Then May goes to 1922 committee to brief backbenchers some of whom reject it. Leadership contest is in the air
David Davis's resignation has caused further uncertainty regarding #citizensrights. Many fearing a no-deal #Brexit. Please read our initial statement on steps we are taking and legal status in case of no-deal for EU citizens. We are worried but no need to panic. 
The picking of David Davis’ successor will be like some sort of grotesque Cinderella - it will go to whoever the clown-shoe fits. #their #crazy #chaotic #brexit
folks - let's get behind the #PeoplesVote petition - #Brexit is on the ropes and more and more people are calling to have their say at the end of the process @peoplesvote_uk
Many people who don’t usually engage with politics voted in the #Brexit referendum, and now they’re watching their vote being rendered worthless. Why should they ever vote for anything again?
The Conservative chief whip has invited all Labour MPs to a briefing on the disasterous Chequers #BrexitBetrayalOMG @theresa_may has got to go. Using the commie party to push through treasonous #brexit policy whatever next....#fbpe
David Davis grew up on a Tooting council estate. His stepfather worked in Battersea Power Station. Unlike Boris & Gove he has an underlying respect and knowledge of ordinary people. He actually believed in Brexit and didn’t see it as part of a career plan. #DavidDavis #Brexit 
.@DavidDavisMP was the government minister responsible for leading the #Brexit negotiations with the EU - but he's just quit. 
#brexit is undeliverable except in a 'hard no deal' way which will cause huge harm to the economy and lives.  Squaring the circle now proven impossible. Scotland - cut the cord - rejoin the EU and prosper #IndyRef2
John Redwood: Resignation of #Brexit SecretaryThere are only 2 sensible options:1 - Comprehensive Free Trade deal with #EUOR2 - Exit EU on WTO termsWe need to #Leave on 29 March 2019.Do the EU want Free TradeORDo they want to trade under WTO terms?
Just to be clear when Tim Martin from Weatherspoon pubs said unchallenged on @BBCr4today that #brexit makes sense because EU is “only 7% of world mkt” he was confusing population with economy size.In fact EU is 22% of world economy.BBC presenter didn’t bother to correct him.
48% don’t want to leave on any terms and there was clearly a strong difference of opinion on the type of #Brexit among the 52% who voted to leave. The serious unintended consequences of hard Brexit however have become increasingly obvious over the past two years
in 2 years since article 50 was triggered, we've spent more hours rehearsing for one of our brexit big band concerts than david davis spent negotiating with the eu. #brexitbigband #brexit #wehaveaplan @brexitbigband
The parable of David Davis and #Brexit: 1) Overpromise2) Win3) Underdeliver 4) Resign
Appalled by Theresa May’s behaviour, which has ruined my ability to triangulate Labour members’ support so that I can look like I’m Remain but get #Brexit. #Spoilsport
Brexiteers promised this would be easy. #DavidDavis failed to deliver a ‘cake and eat it’ #Brexit & now walks away. Reality is that hard vs soft Brexit was not on the ballot paper & there is no majority in the Country or Parliament for a walk-away, no-deal hard Brexit.
We're mired in a politics in which the Tories show us daily that #Brexit is a disaster any way you cut it, Labour keeps insisting it can somehow deliver a good Brexit and the SNP continue to pretend that wrenching apart a 300-year embedded union is a solution. Cross-party idiocy.
Brexit was always about managing the internal tensions in the Tories, nothing has changed.The risk to our economy and jobs is significant and it won’t be Boris, Gove, Davis, Mogg or the rest who will pay the price.Complete shower. #brexit
Jeremy Corbyn: Theresa May & the Govt are incapable of delivering #Brexit.ME: Sounds as if you're vying for the job...when actually you should be admitting no one can deliver it because it can't be made to work in the National Interest.Time for a Rethink.#PeoplesVote #Remain
David Davis’ resignation shows the UK Government’s complete and utter disarray over #Brexit. With time running out we are heading towards an unnecessary and damaging Brexit which isn’t what anyone voted for and why we need a @peoplesvote_uk @Open_Britain
All seems right with the world: a glorious summer, England World Cup success, Jos Butler and Jason Roy hitting sublime sixes & all fine & dandy.  And then I remember we’re in the middle of #Brexit.  To ape General Gamelin in May 1940, we have no reserves, no plan & no hope.  Grr!

The problem with #Brexit has always been that it's a stupid idea. There's no way to vandalize your own economy "well" or "successfully," no good outcome from shooting yourself in the foot. Of course there's chaos. Of course it's a shambles. Time to stop this lunacy. #ExitBrexit

So David Davis having threatened to resign numerous times has now resigned *after* signing #chequers deal and at 11.30pm on a Sunday. There’s a symbol for his ministerial tenure in there somewhere, I’m sure.... #brexit
The single most important & complex moment in Britain's history since WW2 & we've had someone leading it clearly not up to the task, despite 100s of 1000s of jobs & livelihoods on the line. I'll be in Brussels today with colleagues to discuss what is at risk for the NE #Brexit

Brexiteers want1) Out of Customs Union & Single MarketBUT2. Also want frictionless trade with CU & SM3. Promise no border in Ireland&4) Need a Transition Deal to stem economic flight from UK[2&3 can't happen cos of 1][4 unlikely if 3 (border) cos of 1] #Mess #Brexit
Thank you @DavidDavisMP and @SteveBakerHW for being men of principle and guts and standing up for #Brexit. You’ve so done the right thing: May has lost the support of the country and her party. #MayMustGo
I’m really sick of thIs ‘principled’ BS.  For the final time people with principles check their facts and don’t lie #daviddavis #r4today #Brexit
MPs must reject the @theresa_may @OllyRobbins #Brexit proposal. #RejectBrino
In addition, we have further proof that our PM is delusional: "I am sorry that you have chosen to leave government when we have already made so much progress towards delivering a smooth and successful #Brexit" She'll be saying "Smooth and stable" again soon...bwahahahahahaha
David..#Brexit can't be determined in a multi issue GE unless Labour stands clearly to #Revoke #Remain #ReformIt has to be a Single Issue, Simple Majority Binding, Binary #FinalSay to either Accept a Deal/No Deal or Reject & #StopBrexit.
David Davis and two of his minions have resigned from the #Brexit dept (good) everything the tories touch ends in disaster, think #NHS reform, Welfare reform, they are toxic, we need change, b/c we'll end up with a  devastating no deal #Brexit #GE2018now #ChangeIsComing
The #Brexit #DavidDavis wants, as opposed to the  17M other imagined Brexits in the minds of #Leave voters.   The people need to be given concrete options to vote on, and it needs to happen now #PeoplesVote
David Davis resignation has thrown #brexit into chaos, after meeting only 4 times in 2 years with Michel Barnier, #brexit could now be put back by at least 4 hours...@bbclaurak @BBCNews @LBC @bbcnickrobinson #r4today
David 'smiler' Davis didn't resign on a point of principle, he resigned because he's a lazy b#stard who's done nothing as Minister for Exiting the EU to formulate a #Brexit policy in the 2 years since the referendum 
David Davis resigns in order to blame everyone else for the turd that is #brexit 
It was reprehensible for @theresa_may to show & discuss this #Brexit proposal to Merkel & the EU before her cabinet. She tried to leverage that because she knew it would be a difficult sell to cabinet. Who wouldn’t object to it. Mrs May you must resign.
If you vote for something and discover there is no way of it being achieved in the way you envisaged, at what point does it become something that needs voting on again?When does it become not a matter of democracy, but common sense?#Brexit#secondreferendum
When will people finally get it? Tories don't give a fig for the country. They're completely wrapped up in their own careers. May has appointed buffoons to key roles, so that when they fail, the threat to her is neutralised. This is tantamount to treachery! #brexit #BBCNews
Support the call for the European Union to support Scotlands independent membership of the EU if independent before the end of #Brexit negotiations. #Scotref #Indyref2 #ClaimofRight #EU 
This is delusional - a “smooth and successful “ #Brexit was never possible and isn’t happening.   The rest is gobbledegook and gabbling.. 
THREE #Brexit Ministers resignThere must now be a challenge to the leadership of @theresa_mayThe #BrexitBetrayal is a watershed moment for British politics.If the Tories don't deliver the Brexit we voted for,they will be voted OUT by the 17.4m Brexiteers at the next election.
Breaking: David Davis resigns. If the person reaponsible for delivering #Brexit has lost faith, it is clear that it is now undeliverable. A #PeoplesVote is now essential to kill off this failed #Tory experiment once and for all.
.@SkyNews #Sunrise reporting that #brexit itself is now in jeopardy. Good to see mainstream channels recognising this. The tide that turned sometime ago is turning into a large wave!#StopBrexit
Jacob Rees-Mogg will slay May’s #Brexit Plan?(A future Prime Minister? - Part One) 
.@Andrew_Adonis captures it perfectly on #Today. "This farce has gone on for two years, it can't go on any longer." Let's have a #PeoplesVote and resolve #Brexit for good.
With his resignation, David Davis puts ego before  country. The Tory psychodrama is dismantling the UK's reputation and economy brick by brick. The need for an exit from #Brexit is now undeniable.
WEAK .@theresa_may MUST GO!Will of the #British people MUST PREVAILNo #treachery on #Brexit will go UNPUNISHED#EU = #SLAVERY#BREXIT = #FREEDOM pic.twitter.com/kBINAaxs09
Another Monday morning @BBCr4today program & Tim Weatherspoon is unchallenged as he claims we needn’t worry about what car companies think of #brexit as “Weatherspoon pubs create more jobs than BMW”.I despair of this country & the level of idiocy we’ve reached.Incredible.
The point of the #ToryCivilWar is that the Brexiteers have had a chance to come up with a plan that implements #Brexit their way and has genuine economic and social benefits for the UK. They simply don't have such a plan, and now they'll all resign and be grumpy for 30 years
Here is the letter #Brexit Secretary David Davis sent to Theresa May resigning from government. 
"Liam? It's Theresa. What are you up to today? I need you to clean up something called #Brexit for me. Look, I don't care if #ItsComingHomeor not this can't wait!"#DavidDavisResigns #MondayMotivation
Praying for all tweeps and esp for wisdom and right judgement for our politicians. #prayer #Brexit
What a shambles. What a mess of a government. What an ineffectual PM. Meanwhile the clock ticks towards an unnecessary & damaging #Brexit
"Never waste a good crisis". As #DavidDavis resigns, it is more vital than ever that @UKLabourunites behind a #PeoplesVote and the case to #Remain in the EU.#Labour can stop #Brexit and turn this country around. Join us.
Far from perfect but the Cabinet Brexit plan (& forthcoming White Paper) marks grown up steps in the right. Not the time for egos, grandstanding and blind ideology (& interestingly no #Brexit plan of their own..) it is time to put the interests of our country first & foremost.
David Davis resignation unsurprising but leaves Theresa May critically wounded, provides new rally point for her Tory party enemies, raises chance of leadership challenge. With just 260 days to #Brexit, yet again May’s energies now narrowly focused on survival/party.
In case anyone has a hint of sympathy for @DavidDavisMP just remind yourself where he started from. His #Brexit forecast - provided with clear undeniable certainty - was always an absolute fantasy. 
Following David Davis resignation, what happens next in the Westminster #Brexit drama is anyone's guess. But what is clear is that the uncertainty for business continues, with just 8 months to go until the Brexit date. Expect more moves to divest, and divert business to EU27.
Three resignations later, Gove looks even more like the #Brexit sell-out quisling that he is. 
Now that 9 Brexit ministers have resigned since the referendum — 3 of them overnight, unless I have lazily overlooked one of them — the most interesting question is when will Boris Johnson resign? #Brexit
Britain's #Brexit Secretary resigns, delivering a major blow to PM Theresa May 
While you were sleeping: David Davis resigned as UK's #Brexit secretary 
#Brexit secretary David Davis resigns plunging government into crisis.  The prime minister is facing a growing backlash from the pro-Brexit wing of her party, with MPs warning they are prepared to trigger a leadership contest 
⁦@DavidDavisMP⁩ says latest #Chequers plan would ‘leave U.K. in a ‘weak negotiating position’- shows how little he learnt as #Brexit Minister. UK was always in a weak negotiating position as it is leaving club but wants to retain club benefits. 
Davis resignation is a crisis for Theresa May’s leadership and #Brexit policy.    The only question is how deep a crisis! That now depends on whether other senior ministers resign and whether Cons Brexiteers believe they have numbers to both get rid of May and get hard Brexit.
There is no joy to be had watching rats leave a sinking ship, when you are watching from the sinking ship.#DavidDavisResigns#Brexit
So this is real... #DavidDavisIsGone... Huh. But #brexit was so EASY... what happened?! 
Time to put an end to the #Brexit lunacy. The reason it’s proving such a shambles is that it’s a really stupid, stupid idea. 
Personally I found David Davis an engaging and always civilised  opponent .  Politically his resignation letter , if his advice were to be followed , would inevitably lead to the disaster of a “no deal” #Brexit.   That is what the #Brexiteers are now fighting for.
Well, @BorisJohnson did say @Conservatives were going to make a “titanic success” of #Brexit. 
Your time has come, Jacob. #PMinwaiting #brexit #moggmentum #DavidDavis
Way to hijack the #TrumpBalloon! I'd LOVE to see twitter FLOODED w/memes like this... telling the world what's REALLY happening in Londonistan. @POTUS #FreeSpeech #FreeTommy #Brexit #MAGA #TrumpBaby
Leading #Brexit campaigner who ran UK’s negotiations w EU on Brexit is out. Brexit campaigners lied to the voters, broke election law, met repeatedly w Russians & lied about it, & now jumping ship. The UK can still reverse course and stay in the EU. 
So @Theresa_May #Brexit plan appears all but dead, 3 of her ministers in @DExEUgov resign, 2 years on from vote - UK position far from clear and EU hold upper hand. #Brexit not quite 'easiest thing in human history'! Did any Brexiters predict this much political chaos?
David Davis resigns. Mind your step on the way out there David#daviddavies #Brexit 
#DavidDavis and at least two of his junior ministers have quit the #DepartmentforExitingtheEU. Who is actually happy with the #Brexit plan which was agreed on Friday? Not any #BREXITEER likes it! #MayMustGo #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome @Conservatives #ConservativeParty #UK #EU
Chequers worked out well then eh. #Brexit #Brexishambles
ALERT!!Important unrolled thread by @carolecadwalla about how #Brexit was facilitated by Russia and @Facebook; the same way the US  presidential election was stolen by ⁦@realDonaldTrump⁩ and the ⁦@GOP⁩ with Russian interference.
Labour has its best manifesto since 1945 on standby.Key messages:1) Only Labour can deliver #Brexit 2) Tory austerity and lack of investment has doubled the national debtEverybody ready? Good.
DExEU's Midnight Runners: David Davis, Suella Braverman and Steve Baker have all resigned tonight... with only 8 months until the #Brexit deadline. What a shambles.
It’s time to do the right thing for your members and the country @jeremycorbyn, time to oppose #Brexit, not just take tribal political advantage of the situation. Can’t you see that now? 
BREAKING: #Brexit Secretary David Davis Resigns Over May’s ‘Turd’ Deal, ‘Couldn’t Sell Out His Own Country’  
Just remember, those on all sides of the argument, @Conservatives : A fate worse than any #Brexit : 
Suffering #Brexsomnia Davis out-Time for Super Mogg. The voice of #Brexit! #MoggForBrexSecLikeable Logical Non negotiableGet him on a plane to Brussels with some English Tea & Scones & lets get this deal or no deal done!!
So The Brexit Secretary has made an Exit ..... and so it begins - He’s lit the blue touch paper. What happens next ? House of Cards or House of Cowards ?#Brexit #Europe #BreakingNews #DavidDavis
Six. Weeks. Left. For the UK to get a #brexit deal agreed in time.Those celebrating tonight's resignation(s) and calling for a GE better be planning a speedy one or we risk walking into No Deal by legal default. The clock don't stop.
Hey Scotland! At this rate, we won't even need an #indyref2! Number 10 will be empty and we just walk away! LOL! #Brexit
BREAKING Theresa May Appoints David Davis’ Successor #Brexit

The question now is not whether or not Donald Trump should be coming to the UK, but whether or not he'll have a Cabinet to meet with... @DavidDavisMP @SteveBakerHW #Brexit
And so Scotland, where 62% of the population voted to remain in the EU, looks on at how its British Government is behaving/imploding over #Brexit. #ScotRef
. @theresa_may loses her #Brexit lieutenant a week before presenting demands to Brussels 
#DavidDavis #SteveBaker &no doubt others will walk out of Govt . #Brexit was clearly not as simple as they promised. These are dangerous times as tonight’s news on Russian State terrorism makes clear. As a Nation we should not walk away from our EU allies.
They’re all jumping ship I see... #Brexit
“I can’t blame David Davis for being extremely frustrated… this is ceding to the EU essentially everything… we are going to stop all of the benefits of Brexit... that’s their starting point?!” says the @iealondon’s @KateAndrs on the #Brexit Secretary’s resignation  
Let us be clear; there is no politician, and has never been a politician, who could make a success of #Brexit. Even so, #DavidDavis was an utterly incompetent minister, who was prepared to do incalculable damage to the UK; all in order to pursue an ideological project.
And so the end of @theresa_may she has no power #brexit is why Scotland must TAKE BACK CONTROL and vote YES #indyref
The #BrexitFantasy slowly unravelling...#DavidDavis resigns as it is becoming painfully apparent that the #Tory government can't even unify themselves behind a clear #brexit strategy never mind the countryOr maybe he has finally realised that unicorns don't exist?  
On Friday Theresa May presented her latest unacceptable-to-the-EU cake-&-eat-it #Brexit plan.The cabinet signed up for it to save their jobs.Then, late on Sunday evening, David Davis - always a bit slow on the uptake - twigged it was his job to sell this to the EU.So resigned.
David Davis @theresa_may 's #Brexit Secretary resigns:  The UK union is effectively over. I & many others have been predicting this since the result of the EU referendum was announced. Happy days for Scotland!
.@DavidDavisMP has shown himself once again to be a man of principle and the national interest.#Brexit 
wow this #BrexitShambles just got real as @DavidDavisMP resigns, I wonder how many more rats will leave the sinking ship as it drags us deeper into the abyss of a no deal #Brexit, time for #ScotRef before #Scotland is dragged down with it #indyref2 now please @NicolaSturgeon
Telegraph reporting that Baker has resigned too #Brexit
In addition to David Davis resigning as Britain's Brexit secretary, junior Brexit secretary Steven Baker is also understood to have quit Theresa May's cabinet #iestaff #Brexit via @Ocionnaith
As resignations go, this is a big one. Not because David Davis is a particularly significant figure but because of the context and the chain of events it is likely to set off. In terms of impact on @theresa_may, it’s massive - as she’s finally going to face her #Brexit crisis. 
UK #Brexit Secretary David Davis has resigned from the government, BBC reports 
I still remember when David Davis MP ducked out of #Brexit talks in Brussels after about an hour. Government papers show he had to dash off back to London, for a meeting with Daily Mail Editor, Paul Dacre. Now you know who's pulling their strings.
With @DavidDavisMP resignation do you feel #brexit is a huge mess and nothing like what you envisaged when you voted leave. Is making you think it’s not worth it? It’s ok change your mind, be a #remainernow So many others have. You will be far from alone!#DavidDavis #resign
Great to have @IainDale with me on @LBC responding to the news of David Davis resigning from the Government. Always a pleasure to interview a colleague! #Brexit
Davis' resignation could cause a domino effect in Govt that leads to a leadership challenge & thence a general election. The #Brexit bus is juddering to a halt. If you think the UK should remain in the #EU, vote for a pro-EU party:@LibDems@TheGreenParty@Plaid_Cymru@theSNP
Not good, May’s chief #Brexit negotiator has resigned with less than four months to October Council meeting deadline. We haven’t even seen the white paper detailing the third option which is due in the coming days and #backstop remains unresolved. @fiannafailparty
Brexit is 6335 hours away. #brexit
UK #Brexit Secretary David Davis resigns – reports 
I thought we were in the middle of July but it seems that we are at the end of May#Brexit
No doubt #DavidDavis flouncing out of (in part) his own #Brexit mess will dominate. But the far more worrying story tonight is the murder of #DawnSturgess by the deliberate use of a nerve agent on British soil & the risk to European security from Russian aggression.
#Brexit Secretary David Davis has made a runner for the Dexit... #resigned #resignation #jobfairy
David Davis gone ... hard line Brexiteers really f**ked up the UK ... all they’ve done is say no to every compromise whilst being unable to come up w any kind of solution themselves ... they are the DUP of England  #Brexit
David Davis resigned..1 more down...more please...in fact could the whole Govt resign please then we must play the Get Out of Jail Free Card...Give us ALL a #FinalSay with a #StopBrexit option & give us a chance to#Reject #Revoke #Remain #Reform There is no #Brexit that works!
Rumours that David Davis has resigned will be flying around EU diplomatic circles as fast as across U.K. #brexit
Don’t get me wrong, I have been always backed Theresa May up until now and I am sure that she is a very nice person. I just feel that the time has come to reinvigorate both #Brexit and the party.
After battling with my party loyalty for the last 48 hours, tonight I say that I believe that the PM should stand aside or be replaced after her latest #Brexit fiasco.The will of the people must be respected and Friday’s proposal falls short of the #Brexit that we voted for.
DD put country before Party. Agonising decision. #Brexit
Breaking: @DavidDavisMP resigns as #Brexit Secretary at @DExEUgov.With chaos and division appearing in the cabinet every day, this reinforces the need for a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal.
With David Davis resigning, now is the time for calm and cool heads. Those heads belong to Brit Pol academics who must immediately dive into the fray with speculation and historical comparisons. #DavidDavis #Brexit #Dissemination
David Davis resigns- here comes the shit show #brexit
Hearing @DavidDavisMP has resigned. If so another principled decision by a principled man opposed to #BrexitBetrayal and for a positive #BREXIT
DD wants to honour manifesto promises to Britons. Couldn’t collude with civil servants and Remainers to undermine #Brexit
Even before the referendum we said the politicians would never allow us to leave the EU.Since the result we have had to sit and watch #brexit being slowly eroded and repackaged back into remaining. We didn’t trust them then and we don’t trust them now.Get these traitors out ! 
Believe it or not, I was quite a reluctant leaver. I supported #Brexit , not because I was against all things EU. It was simply & purely about sovereignty for me. Thats it. But promises to me & rest of the UK mean alot. You cannot tell people things repeatedly then go back on it
We therefore fully support @MichelBarnier and all his efforts and we are confident that the #Brexit negotiations will run smoothly. 2/2
In the press conference together with PM #Varadkar @campaignforleo in #Dublin today I underlined that #Brexit negotiations are a key priority in our EU-Presidency #eu2018at. We will do our best to avoid both a hard Brexit & a hard border between #Ireland and #NorthernIreland. 1/2

The way so-called Brexiters in May's cabinet have betrayed the people who voted to leave the EU is spectacular. The revulsion on people's faces when they hear the names 'Boris Johnson' and 'David Davis' says it all. Their political careers are over. #Brexit

It’s good that the Government has a common approach to #Brexit; we needed that before triggering Article 50. Now we need a strategy to get the best outcome for our country. That’s the only way to reunify it...

Great #Brexit trade deals outside the EU?The EU & USA count for around 2/3 of our trade, they are much more powerful economically than us. As we are finding with the EU, they will have the whip hand in any negotiations & will set the rules. The same will soon go for China.#FBPE

#bbcsp Mandelson the Blair mouthpiece does not want you to remember that Blair pushed for a referendum to leave the EU.  Blair made promises of a referendum in both 2004/05. This is another attack on Corbyn and has nothing to do with #Brexit. 
Baroness @SayeedaWarsi tells @BBCNewsnight how the @Conservatives are in reverse & why @Kishan_Devani left them because of this devastating shift to the right. #Brexit has also played a part in this very uncomfortable lurch to the right. Let us unite not divide ourselves.

#Brexit deal will condemn Tories to landslide election defeat, MPs warn 
Absolutely this. Our campaign to stop #Brexit is definitely not a campaign to revert to the pre-referendum status quo. We are the change makers. Remainers must create an exciting vision for a new Britain without #Brexit. We are going to be working on this. Watch this space.

“The so called “common rule book”, doesn’t appear to be a common rule book at all but the UK accepting the EU’s rule book for all existing regulations... including bad regulations that many small businesses want scrapped” @IDuncanSmithMP#Brexit #BRINO
Michael Gove is basically saying "We might not be able to ruin our trade in goods quite as comprehensively as I'd hoped, but we can still ruin the services economy that makes up 80% of GDP." #Marr #Brexit
The fake #Brexit just underscores the fact that, in a democracy, NO ONE gets what they want. #BrexitBetrayal
Why would #Brexit voters vote Lab?Lab are signed up to the #BrexitBetrayal too.
#Brexit #May told us that no deal was better than a bad deal - now we learn that no preparation has been made for a no deal - either #May is a total incompetent or she has attempted to make a 'no deal' impossibleThe British Electorate will have noted - Tories will be eviscerated
As the plot thickens on @Arron_banks dealings with Russia, we are perhaps starting to see who would benefit from #Brexit the most. Not the people. Only the super wealthy. Wake up, #Leave voters. You have been duped
March 9: Jeremy Corbyn says Brexit will stop cheap foreign labour undercutting British workers’ pay. Numerous studies have shown that EU migration does not hit UK workers' pay. But Corbyn preferred to parrot a far-right lie. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Far too little comment on huge gap on EU services trade in #Chequers text. Why is it “in our interests to have regulatory flexibilty”?  Dream on if you think it opens way to big services trade deals. Real reason: govt know there is little they can salvage here from #Brexit
Mogg stands to gain financially  with a hard #Brexit 
Theresa May is a Neocon Globalist Fascist Remainer who is selling us out to get the worst possible deal for #BrExit to protect the #EU and screw the UK.She needs to be fired asap and impeached for TREASON#marr#Sundaymorning
“One month after the EU Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive was presented, David Cameron announced the #Brexit referendum.”“It was undoubtedly at forefront of the minds of those driving the [Brexit] movement.”
#marr The .@BBCNews is still excluding Progressive voices from the #Brexit Debate  #libdems  rarely invited.#BBC presenting the #Chequers  meeting as a "Deal" it's  no such  thing & likely to be rejected by EUTreating this whole thing as Internal Tory warfare is a disgrace
What can the @BBC do about it...get rid of a National Treasure? Think what you want, Say what you want...Shout it out Loud Sir David.#Brexit is a Dead End in Evolutionary Terms...
WTO is No GoWe want EU trade to FlowSay No Way to NorwayWhy Pay & Obey with No Say So then Theresa MayGive us ALL a #FinalSayAnd make this #Brexit GO AWAY! 
Longworth: “May left it as late as possible to reveal she remains a stubborn Remainer. She personally deceived us by promising in the Conservatives' election manifesto that #Brexit means Brexit when, in fact, May's Brexit means 'Brexit In Name Only'”
Tory #brexit Explained ...When we said that we are going to leave the Single Market , we really meant we are going to stay in the Single Market...And When we said that we are going to leave the Customs Union , we really meant we are going to stay in the Customs Union... #marr
There are a few Tory & Lab MPs who respect the #Brexit vote, but the vast majority of MPs think they know better than us 17.4m plebs.All the #REMAINER MPs should be voted out at the next election.We need a House of Commons full of MPs who will deliver the #Brexit we voted for. 
I woke up today and there’s 62 million Turks in my garden.Why didn’t I listen?FFS#FBPE #Marr #Brexit #Bollocks
Theresa May is nothing short of a deceiving DISGRACE, in my eyes. Now crystal clear she has ABSOLUTELY NO intention of removing us fully from the EU & its institutions. She still doesn't believe #Brexit. Fine! Have decency to make way someone who does.  She now makes me sick @LBC
Why are you selling this as if it's a done deal? You know it's the equivalent of offering a fiver for a £500k house. You lot are setting us up for a hard #Brexit, most of us are on to you and we think you're all lousy skunks putting party before Country. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Typical. May capitulates to the point of grabbing her ankles and the EU still says no. Get rid of her and get someone in who really believes in #brexit and has a backbone!
I'm angry you don't understand basic mathematics:1. Tory MPs+DUP>all other parties.2. No Tory can 'rebel' on manifesto promise.With no General Election until 2022:1+2= Nobody can stop #Brexit other than Tories/DUP. Nobody, 
Any #European leader who values the nation state should vote down any #Brexit deal that sees #Britain #leave in name only. #Eurosceptics across #Europe need to help each other in the fight against the elites like the #LYING @theresa_may! #MayMustGo #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome
I never in all my years thought any politician could be hated as much as Tony Blair is...I was wrong. Well done @theresa_may and the @Conservatives#BrexitBetrayal #MayResign #MayOut #MayMustGo #Brexit 
Well, Tory infighting has reduced us to a laughing stock #Brexit  while they steal everything we collectively own & divide us beyond repair for years. Greedy, thieving charlatans. What a monumental disaster from a government full of self-promoting pricks. Patriots, my arse 
Max’s cousin was a passionate #brexit backer but having seen the complex negotiations he considers there is nothing to gain from leaving. He is also concerned about Cambridge Analytica involvement in EU ref.How many of us have friends and family like Max who are #Remainernow?
Seems like the solid matter is now hitting the ventilating system over the so called Chequers agreement #BrexitBe interesting to see how the Sunday political programmes cover it !
I just got this almighty stink, I've assumed it was the ship pumping sewerage into the water so I've gone to customer services & complained.... Wasn't the ship, just the stench of betrayal from @Conservatives & @theresa_may  Join #BREXIT 
First on the list of unpolishable turds @BorisJohnson, are #Brexit and you. Both should be expeditiously flushed down the toilet pan of politics.#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
So now the Tory Brextremists never called for a no-deal #Brexit...#PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
Remember, #Brexit support was strongest in the older age groups. These are the people who will turn away from the #Conservatives following their treachery.
BREXIT: May’s plan is in nobody’s interest. It’s increasingly clear that we must not leave the EU /#EU #Brexit 
Christina Patterson insulting the public's intelligence over #Brexit.1) Job losses? Really? We're up 400,000 since EURef. What was the forecast?2) Rich Brexiters? Kicked JRM for having dosh, yet Remain funded by big banks & pushed by Blair, Branson, Soros, etc.#SkyPapers
BREXIT: After May’s deal, many people will ask, does Brexit have any point? /#EU #Brexit #PeoplesVote
With regard to #BREXIT:Free trade agreements are the opposite of free trade. Genuine free trade is marked by the absence of government interference. For free trade to happen governments have to do nothing.
Jessica voted leave at the #euref as she thought it was the best choice in the information at the time but now she’s seen #brexit reality she is a #Remainernow.@JessicaTooze you say you want your voice heard @remainernow campaign can help with that & agree @uklabour must listen!
#BrexitBetrayal#Brexit In Name Only totally unacceptable Get chopping 
Sunday Times: 'Boris brands PM's deal a turd'.So May's reinstated collective responsibility lasted just 24 hours. #Brexit #bbcnews #tomorrowspaperstoday
Legal Advice Kills Cabinet PlanProposals lead directly to worst-of-all-worlds “Black Hole” #Brexit where UK stuck permanently as a vassal state in EU legal & regulatory tarpit, still has to obey #EU laws & ECJ rulings across vast areas inc & trade policy.
Tories have delivered #Brexit in name only.Tories have betrayed  the 17.4m who voted for BrexitTories will pay a heavy price for their treachery.Tory MPs think they know better than usTory MPs will be voted out at the next General Election.Tories will get their come uppance. 
Let’s be honest: it says something that the EU can keep 27 countries broadly in step on #Brexit whilst a single party in the UK is in a jumbled heap.
Very perceptive thread here from @paulrey99 on May's simultaneously cynical & naive #Brexit 'negotiating' strategy. 
This is my petition to the EU to allow the 20 million remain voters to keep their EU citizenship. The petition is now live on the europarl site.  If you want to keep your rights in spite of #Brexit please register and sign #FBPE 1 of 2
Yet another Leave supporter having second thoughts about #BrexitThis time it’s journalist @GeorgeTrefgarne No wonder support is growing for a #PeoplesVote and an #ExitFromBrexit 
Poor stuff coming out regarding Prime Minster and UK position on freedom of movement in latest "plan". The UK government position is completely against Scotland's economic interests. But anyway, can't see how EU can agree to such a boorach. #Brexitboorach #Brexit
Hello@Jacob_Rees_MoggBeing a #Brexit leave voter, should you be experiencing a difference between the unicorn #Brexit of your dreams: and the cold, hard light of day #Brexit I can recommend #PeoplesVote for those who would like to think again.
I tell you what’s coming home, you clown. The chickens to roost #brexit #moron
Andrea Leadsom tweeted this two weeks before she acquiesced in May's #Brexit fudge. 
Its amazing what you can achieve with competent leadership and a decent team in place.......something you obviously know nothing about. #Brexit 
After #Brexit, there should be no discrimination in favour of EU citizens & against non-EU citizens (including #Commonwealth). '
It seems Corbyn is on side with the Trump-Brexit-Putin attack on Western democracy of which Brexit is just one part. He supports #Brexit regardless of the right-wing cheating and press hate and lies which won the referendum.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Ikea give away £1 fish and chips full meal to anyone tomorrow to congratulate us on englands win and England fans go and trash a their store. It’s so #brexit it’s not even funny.

.@Telegraph cartoon#ChequersPlan #TheresaMay #Brexit #Fieldsofwheat
Being an #EU citizen opens up more than just borders across Europe. It means we have the right to build a life in another EU country, whilst retaining our British citizenship. We lose that right after #Brexit. RT this short video. We want our continent back. #ExitBrexit
If #UKLabour had not betrayed millions of their own supporters who voted #Leave in the #EURef, and backed the Government from day one, #Brexit would be delivered by now.Corbyn's lust for power is more important than honouring @UKLabour 2017GE promises.#APlagueOnBothYourHouses
Dear @bbcnickrobinson, why are you using the word "excuse" here? You know that the EU could not negotiate with a government which was furiously negotiating with itself. So why are you using a misleading Brexiter way to describe the EU's stance?#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
people tweeting that we won because of #Brexit; i'm not even gonna start with all the ways in which that's nonsense and Brexit will make everything to do with football harder & more expensive if Brexit goes ahead, but i will say this: WE ARE STILL IN THE EU!!  #ENGSWE
Responding to the British government's three page Brexit document, @moneillsf said there can be no hardening of the border in Ireland and that the rights of citizens and Good Friday Agreement must be protected #Brexit 
#Brexit means #Brexit. And after two years the Brexiters can't agree about anything else it means.Can't say we didn't warn you that would happen!It would be funny if it wasn't fucking up all our futures. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
As far as I'm aware the EU never did me any harm, never stopped me doing anything, never made my country Poorer & me worse off & never Removed my Rights & Protections.However this is pecisely what my own Govt is doing by forcing an insane invalid #Brexit upon us!#StopBrexit

Cabinet has agreed to May seeking Britain to share a 'common rulebook' with the EU after #Brexit.Guess what, that rulebook already exists. It's called Customs Union. A customs union by another name is still a customs union - May thinks Brits are too thick to see through this?

If accepted by the EU, May’s plan would do nothing to deliver the best #Brexit for the United Kingdom. It would be another betrayal by the political establishment over the people. It is clear why so many people are disenchanted with mainstream politics. 
Why bother anyone forming a pro-#EU political party in the UK, when you already have an anti-#Brexit Government.  Save your money.
The whole world is turning a blind eye Bette. We are even holding the flipping #WorldCup there The British Govt KNOW there was foreign interference and electoral fraud in the #Brexit referendum yet there is no investigation whatsoever.  We are Putin and Trumps puppet. 
German MEP TEARS into May's soft #Brexit proposals and demands EVEN more alignment with EU.May has made so many unreciprocated concessions, the EU know that every time they say no, May will come running back to them with more watered-down proposals. 
PM confirms that free movement will continue.  Mass uncontrolled immigration is here to stay. A betrayal of #Brexit. Tories must be made to pay at the ballot box. 
Well there you have it. The collective minds of the government have worked hard on it and they've come to the conclusion that there are no benefits to #Brexit whatsoever. Just down sides to ameliorate the best they can.
I’m not surprised the #Chequers fudge  is causing more people to sign the #Petition for a #peoplesvote on the actual #brexit deal, when there is one.

“That is not something that this country voted for, it is not what the Prime Minister promised” @Jacob_Rees_Mogg#Brexit
The highest #Brexit votes were in areas with the lowest immigrant populations. One can point to ignorance breeding fear, but we may also note that migrants tend to avoid areas with weak economies, and weak economies can exacerbate fear of competition from incomers.#StopBrexit
Totally myopic. I started out my working life (aged 15) on building sites and in factories and voted @UKLabour for over 40 years, until #Brexit. Labour really has lost the plot. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote #FBPE
UDI isn't an option. It only applies to colonies. The Union is the product of a Treaty just like EU. A country can always secede from a treaty as in #Brexit. The tricky bit is international recognition (cf. Catalunya). #ClaimOfRight resolved that. Now we can #DissolveTheUnion.
You are wise to never trust a Tory, what they 'say' will not be what they do or write.Your duty is to ALL EU  Citizens please protect US all from a BAD #Brexit#ScotlandforEurope
“Putting @JeremyCorbyn into 10 Downing Street is more important than #Brexit”
Compared to other EU countries the UK has profited immensely from an influx of highly educated migrants. #Brexit is losing us this huge advantage in an age when a talented workforce is the most importance economic resource. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
A slightly camp and OTT response if you don't mind my saying!There is a 120 page #Brexit document that has to be read first.  It hasn't been published yet.  Until that has been studied and analysed in detail, the hysteria is probably best saved 'til later. 
Is it just me or do you think #Brexiters in Mrs May's cabinet have set out this #Brexit deal for it to #fail - in order to get a #NoDeal situation? As the #EU will surely reject this absolute #fudge - wont they?#BrexitShambles #BrexitFudge
This is a really really good point. One thing you have to say about @Nigel_Farage is he has the absolute ability to be ahead of the curve politically wise. Maybe this is why he said he can do more for #Brexit in Brussels than he could as a MP. Food for thought. 
Rant time.Hey #Brexit people, or those who don't like #immigration, those who think that immigrants are #TakingOurJobs, I have words for you;They're not. Those jobs were never going to be yours anyway.Really want to know why they get all the great jobs and you don't?#FBPE
Rees-Mogg on May’s #Brexit proposal: “As with eggs, an egg that is very softly boiled isn’t boiled at all.”1. Huh?2. Yes it is. It’s softly boiled.3. You have no mandate as to cooking method. You don’t even have a mandate for eggs. 52% voted for a free breakfast.4. HUH?
We launched the only campaign to mass-email ministers BEFORE the meeting.  Please back #Brexit by backing us. Hard facts, original analysis, read by MPs & decision-makers.  Hardest-working, least-funded.  Please help!
Just remember, the majority of the MPs in government and the opposition have been in office long enough to have played a major part in delivering the causes of #Brexit. The same people now unable even to define it, let alone deliver it.

It has taken #Brexit to expose how totally fucking useless most of our MPs are, how corruption can be overlooked in the name of democracy. Only Brexit could have put the spotlight on the need for electoral reform and to proove how we already have the best deal. Thank you Brexit.
#Brexit is on the ropes. The result is void. The only thing stopping a judge declaring it so is that it was *advisory*. @UKLabour have one chance to put this behind us all *and* gain power in the process.Now or never @jeremycorbyn: Give me a #PeoplesVote and you get mine.
.         #Tory Dirty Tricks & Lies Tory cabinet has pulled together over a deal they know will fail the EU test, all just to make their PM Nay look strong and in charge However they are still planning a hard #Brexit                        -You Just Can’t Trust a Tory- 
Here's what we know from #Brexit: That too many people in this country are f....king gullible.That we have a lot more racists than we thought.That our gene pool is so piss poor we desperately need mass immigration.
If Theresa May was England manager she'd be offering Sweden a 3-0 win and claiming it was the best we could hope for. #brexit #worldcup  #ENGvSWE #engswe
2 ways to do #Brexit1 As a technical issue to be solved soberly through consensus & compromise2 As a high emotion rhetorical high stakes game of bluff with 27 other countriesTurns out spending 2 years doing the 2nd option has led to us having mere weeks to do it the 1st way.
Vote Leave broke the Law.Brexit was built on lies. It’s time to turn this sorry ship around.#PeoplesVote #Brexit #BrexitShambles
TOTAL CAPITULATION: Theresa May Proposes Sub-Norway #Brexit Deal – Concedes on Goods, Rules, EU Court, and More 
We have no actual detail & vision of the new #Brexit proposals.All we have is a high level brief & media spin.I'm waiting on details & then reacting. In the meantime George Soros & our anti Brexit news would love it if you fight with each other. Dont fall into the trap. 
Basically UK now sticking to all EU laws but have no say in drawing up said EU laws not only do they look like total muppets ... they are total muppets #Brexit ... The lying brexiteers sold them a pup

#Brexit stopped being about the Will of the Ppl from the point the PM chose to press ahead & circumvent Parl on the basis of a non-Binding opinion of only 37% voters.This's all all about imposing party wills on the Ppl hence the denial of a #PeoplesVote & #Remain option.
So, the nonsense David Davis has been peddling for two years on trade deals had final nail in coffin yesterday. #Brexit 
All that #Brexit is going to prove is that democracy is a charade. I will never vote for a mainstream party again, we need to get behind #UKIP, we need to be loud and angry all 17.4 Million of us.My ancestors fought and died for the democracy they are denying us.
From an EU perspective the #Chequers 'deal' is nothing but a signal that #TheresaMay @10DowningStreet has finally put her house in order and is ready to negotiate properly. This does not mean that EU will accept this proposal. Division of 4 freedoms remains unlikely. #Brexit 
The cabinet’s agreement on #Brexit is a betrayal of the referendum result and shows the Conservative government puts itself before the country. Shame!

Tory backbenchers and Cabinet at loggerheads over Theresa May's #Brexit fudge. Government's farcical #Novichok narrative unraveling before our eyes. OPCW interim report finding no evidence of nerve agent in Douma. It's almost as if Jeremy Corbyn knows exactly what he's doing.
This #Brexit deal is not just a bad deal but the worst possible deal being portrayed as the will !!! I feel physically sick to my core.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg
I actual feel sick, this #Brexit negotiation is soul destroying, depressing. Theresa has completely trashed my believe in democracy. . but the hardest fact to swallow is that it's happening here in the United Kingdom.
"Could" is something. But not much. "Will" is what is needed - the only democratic way forward on #Brexit. There was no destination specified in 2016 - people have to say if satisfied with it 
Twitter suspends 1 Million a day.#FakeNewsCNN says ‘Russian Bots’We all know, most are Conservatives, #Brexit, Orban, Salvini, Le Pen, Wilders, Tommy Robinson and Trump Supporters.
“WHAT’S THE POINT OF VOTING? - Perhaps Mrs May Might Enlighten The Public?” Brilliant summary of what the PM’s done to #Brexit & democracy: 
Co-author of 'Clean Brexit': 'If the Cabinet agrees to the newly fudged variant on #Brexit it will be a fraud on the 17.4million people who backed ¢Brexit. These new proposals would leave the UK in the EU’s Single Market and Customs Union in all but name.'
“IT’S SOFT REMAIN - May’s Remainer-Majority Cabinet Decides To Ignore The People.” We have the official govt #Brexit document.  Read it & weep: 
Why are Leavers complaining about May’s fudge?  They knew what they were voting for, right? #Brexit
The #BBC has silenced #davidattenborough on #Brexit, so let's RT this to air his views for him. @peoplesvote_uk @LabPeoplesVote #waton
Dear all. As a NIrishman, the govt’s new #brexit position doesn’t allay my border concerns. It’s as clear as mud except to say it’s a red tape nightmare existing on the basis of “trust me”, not rules. Someone please ensure it is properly rejected as nonesense. Thank you.
No end to free movement, a 'deal' so restrictive that it cripples our ability to trade internationally, ECJ becomes our guiding light ... Next they'll be telling us it will cost us more too. #Brexit #Brexiteers #ToriesOut @Conservatives
1. So that #Brexit plan.I won't be wasting a nanosecond examining the detail because it isn't a serious proposal, it doesn't address the core issues, it's issue illiterate and Brussels will refuse it because it violates their major red line.

I think the Conservative party has just signed it's own death warrant. I can't vote for them anymore. I put all my trust in them and the have betrayed me. I will be not voting in any election until a real Conservative party comes back. #brexit Shameful cowardice by the government
As a student I pissed some serious time away but nothing in my or anybody else's life has ever been such a grotesque waste of time and energy as #Brexit.
#Brexit #UKIP #ForBritain Tonight, as brexit hangs by a thread, I make a direct plea to:@GerardBattenMEP@AMDWaters Put any differences aside. Have a meeting. Discuss how best our very similar parties can:1. WORK TOGETHER2. EDGE TOWARDS A FORMAL MERGER#unity
Your leader has just sold her party members and the wider #Leave electorate out, in an epic betrayal of #Brexit. @theresa_may is taking orders from #Merkel. There is no #EU 'negotiation'. You lied and people found out.
The softer the #Brexit, the less the point of it#PeoplesVote
We're fucked. And I don't say that lightly. #Brexit #Chequers
Here’s the #Brexit position that was agreed by the Cabinet today. 12 key principles that we will underpin our negotiations with the EU and get the best #DealForBritain
Two years ago, after the MADNESS of the ADVISORY #EUreferendum, many people said that the #Tory Party would TEAR THEMSELVES APART deciding what #Brexit actually meant.For those who wondered WHEN this will happen - IT IS HAPPENING NOW!! #Enjoy#PEOPLESvote #PEOPLESvotePETITION
Putting aside your view of the #DealForBritain, @ajcdeane makes an important point on #skypapers - Theresa May’s resilience is very impressive and her ability to unanimously unite such a divided cabinet to one position on #brexit is remarkable
Remember the backlash against the LibDems over their betrayal on tuition fees? Theresa May's betrayal of Brexit voters will have far more impact & is more serious. This is not about how we voted in the referendum - it's about trust and democracy itself #Brexit
#Brexit is like knocking your house down, building a smaller, crapper version in the exact same spot, having to use expensive, unreliable builders, then moving back in - only to find the huge unnecessary disturbance you caused means your neighbours no longer want to talk to you.
Sorry Brexiters but it's time to put on the big boy pants. You didn't want a plan. You ruled out all the alternatives. You fawned over Rees-Mogg. You didn't want to engage with the issues on an adult level. That has consequences. Deal with it.#Brexit
It is easier to give up an empire, and the outward trappings and symbols of empire than to give up the deep-seated and almost unnoticed habits of thought & emotional dispositions of empire. And so the former imperial power becomes increasingly lost in its current world.#Brexit
Cabinet source says arch Brexiteer @BorisJohnson stood up and toasted Theresa May at dinner after a successful #brexit meeting at #Chequers on. Although some chuntering, crucially NO Cabinet ministers objected to the plans laid out.
One thing about any #Brexit deal - it doesn’t just need to look and smell like Brexit, it needs to be BrexitIf it isn’t, I fear there will be a lot of angry people and an awful lot of damage to democracy - not to mention irreparable damage to the #Conservatives
On hearing @theresa_may and the @Conservatives new #Brexit plan who will you vote for at the next General Election.Please ReTweet for a big sample and to send a message to Theresa the appeaser. #Brexit #MayOut #MayResign #BrexitBetrayal #BRINO
Strangest thing about this whole #Chequers nonsense today: it’s the level of thinking and agreement UK should have reached the day before triggering #Article50. This #Brexit step is 15 months late.

Leaving was always going to be impossible with a remainer at the helm, the clue was the apparent lack of enthusiasm to promote @Jacob_Rees_Mogg into #Brexit negotiations or the cabinet.
@IainDale is right on #newsnight re  public disillusion with democracy after this. I know there'll be smug complacency & sigh of relief amongst soft status-quo Brexit-in-name only types. Simply confirms- again- they haven't a clue what #Brexit vote really meant to people Shameful
So, we now have a #Brexit plan which is little different from what we already have as #EU members. Big difference is we will no longer have a voice inside the EU and Brexit will cost £billions. Please @Theresa_May stop this nonsense now and scrap #Brexit. #Chequers
So we're heading towards pointless #Brexit rather than painful Brexit I suppose that's good news but can't help thinking what an utter waste of time & energy to be slightly worse off economically & a ton worse off diplomatically, for reasons that still aren't really clear

PM once again wins the prize for cooking up #Brexit fudge and euphemisms. I think her cunning plan is to make everything so complex that nobody has a clue any more what she’s on about. #EEA remains the only viable option, as she will learn to her cost.
The Chequers fudge, if it survives the weekend, and if agreed to by the EU, would leave the UK a rule taker not a rule maker. No one will find this fudge to their liking. Time for a final 'say on the deal' and a chance to exit from #Brexit
This is not so much fudge, as part cherry picking, part fantasy, part pointless. Did anyone vote for this absurd damaging mess? #Brexit 
“Millions of #Brexit voters across the country will be perplexed that ministers have not resigned in the face of this betrayal. They’ve allowed the Government to produce a fraud on the electorate, dressed up as a success & flying in the face of democracy”
Just saw Theresa May on the news there and she said #Brexit is all sorted and we've not to worry. Phew!
No other words needed...#traitor#BREXIT 
Even tonight the Prime Minister continues to peddle the myth of a “good”, “successful “ #Brexit for “all of the UK” .  There can be no such thing.  Every respectable study has shown that only thing at issue is the degree of damage that will be done to each area by each option
Millions who work in the UK’s services sector - financial, creative, tech, transport, health etc - will feel totally abandoned by Government’s #Brexit proposal to leave them out in the cold in future relationship with EU #ChequersBetrayal
Even if acceptable to them ( which is very doubtful) the  #Brexit  agreement at Chequers cannot be relied on by #EU27 as it covers devolved areas  ( agriculture, fisheries & others) which are the responsibility of @ScotParl  & @ScotGov with whom there has been no consultation.
Peel split the Tory Party on principles. May is about to do it because she's weak and wants to save her skin. And the cabinet has just agreed to it. Not one of them has a backbone. #Brexit

The state of this“common rule book” ?“new institutional framework” ? It sounds familiar. They’re creating an inferior (and more expensive) version of what we already have. We’re being sold a pup. #Brexit 
The Cabinet have agreed May’s #Brexit fudge plan. So what the **** have they been bickering about for 2 years when they can agree this plan in less than 12 hours? Brexit is less than 9 months away and we’re totally unprepared because of these 2 wasted years.What a shambles! 
I despise every member of the current cabinet.#Brexit #Chequers #Bastards
So, after 2 years, May’s actually managed to find a position that both her party and the EU will reject? Impressive feat #Chequers #Brexit
The end of the @Conservatives party happened today as @theresa_may and her cabinet including the so called #Brexiteers in there agreed to a vassal state soft #Brexit. Looks like we will have to suffer a corbyn government next GE. Will never vote Conservative again. RIP 1834-2018
"Crucially what we have agreed is the creation of a UK-EU free trade area" - UK PM Theresa May on "collective" #Brexit agreement reached by her cabinet 
Following the consideration of #Brexit conditions at #Chequers, I am disgusted by the regulatory protectionism that the Prime Minister has approved. I will not be renewing my membership at its expiry date. I will not vote for the Party at any election under her Leadership.

Like the RMS Carpathia Mr Starmer @Keir_Starmer you are going to 'come to the rescue' too late. The government's 'Titanic success' will have already sunk many businesses without trace. A plan that is right for the country is to reverse this madness and fix the causes of #Brexit 
If #Brexit is the democratic will of the people, why is it being discussed in secret?

BREAKING: First press photos emerge of Theresa May's crisis #Brexit meeting at #Chequers this morning
Dear @Jacob_Rees_Mogg, what you really want to say is #Brexit means a #BrexitTaxHaven, with taxes on business and the rich slashed, a bonfire of safety and environmental regulations and workers rights, and the #NHS sold off to US private healthcare. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
This would equate to millions of votes lost if May continues on her chosen path towards a fake #Brexit. The irony is that it will have little effect on Labour even though they, even more than the Tories, have been actively campaigning to betray the result of the referendum.

Theresa May has said Cabinet have "a duty" to reach agreement on Friday, amid splits over how closely the UK should stick to EU rules after #Brexit.Actually Theresa, they have a duty to act in the best interests of the country. 
I don't remember voting Airbus at the last election. I wonder how long it will be until 'Big Business' is telling our governments that slavery would be much better for their bottom line ???  #Brexit
Lots of interest in our #Brexitometer in #StAustell today - and the results from this Leave-voting town speak for themselves. Many who voted Leave saying they are disappointed by broken promises, and strong support for a #PeoplesVote.#Cornwall #Brexit 
This week's #ScotlandinEurope update covers copyright reform, a people’s vote, and Gibraltar’s existential threat. Meanwhile the UK Government takes credit for EU work while struggling to find its own #Brexit solution

This unaware party leader hasn't grasped that sister parties elsewhere in the EU aren't listening, because he's bent on making sure the UK leaves the EU. #Brexit 
While #TheresaMay continues to negotiate with her own divided cabinet on #Brexit , the real question about any fudge she finds is whether it will be taken seriously by the other 27 EU members....

By design or (more likely) default May is letting the #Brexit clock tick down. She has zero intention to say no deal. All of this plays into Barnier's hands and betrays every single person who voted to leave the EU.
PM Cameron got President Obama to tell Britain we'll be at the 'back of the queue' for any US trade deal. Is PM May going to be telling President Trump that she's removed us from the queue altogether by keeping Britain shackled to EU customs?#Brexit#NoCustomsTrap
I hope there is nobody that really believes today's tory love in at #Chequers is about the national interest, they govern in the interest of their party, they always have, it's about tory interest, not the wider electorate, the tories care nothing #ForTheMany, remember #Brexit.
I’m glad @UKLabour find the #Chequers #Brexit summit hilariousGiven that they continue to try to play both sides whilst satisfying no-one, I suppose an A-Level design project is about all we should expect Meanwhile the country actually care about the outcome  
The Bullingdon Boys are going up in the world. Not content with trashing restaurants, they’re well on the way to trashing an entire country. #Brexit

May's secondary goal is clear. She wants to bully and blackmail #Brexiteers in Cabinet into backing her #Brexit betrayal or if they resign they will be replaced by compliant Remainers.
For those of you who don't understand what is going on at #chequers. The tories are deciding the entire deal strategy for #brexit based on the needs and vested interests of their  party rather than the wellbeing of the electorate.....behind closed doors.  | #Scotref #Indyref2
'Worst of both worlds': @BorisJohnson and @David_Cameron have savaged @theresa_may's #Brexit plan 
"Last year, the number of EU nurses applying to work in the UK fell by 96%. This year, there are 3,000 fewer EEA nurses working in the NHS. And a BMA survey in 2017 showed that more than 40% of EEA doctors were considering leaving the UK." #Brexit #NHS70

Barnier: EU ready to adapt offer should the UK's red lines change...UK's proposals will facilitate both domestic political debate and negations with EU... "My objective is to find agreement with UK, not against the UK." #Brexit
Important discussions taking place today within U.K. Cabinet on #Brexit - while Irish and EU position is clearly understood and remains consistent - let’s hope we will see a clearer and more realistic UK approach to BREXIT negotiations emerge from today. 
At Chequers: Back May to Sellout Britain or take a Taxi!Team May are calling Cabinet Brexiters’ bluff, publicly attacking them as “narcissistic” & threatening to take away their ministerial cars for 40 mile trip back to London.So childish ...#Brexit #EU
"Your MP owes you, not their industry only, but their judgment; and they betray instead of serving you if they sacrifice it to their cowardice."The 'worst of both worlds' is a betrayal & has no mandate.Demand a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. 
The #BBC, our ‘impartial’ public broadcaster, is anti-#Trump (as well as anti-#Brexit and anti-#Israel) and we’re paying for all that bias through a compulsory poll tax that hits the poorest hardest.
Two years on from an historic vote and finally the govt are getting round to a Terms of Reference to scope out their #Brexit project. There's nothing like having a project with a fixed end date and not a bloody clue how you're going to deliver it. Fail to plan, plan to fail.
Crunch or fudge? That’s the question at Chequers today. More than 2 years since the referendum vote, PM’s still no closer to knowing what #Brexit is. All the more reason for a #PeoplesVote on the final deal.
It's amazing how 52% of the country could vote LEAVE and 82% of the country could vote for #BrExit manifestos yet somehow LEAVE ministers in cabinet are described as a lunatic fringe. Well done, #BBCDP. You are excelled yourself with your bias.
I'm out for the day #havingfunLabourcampaignWhen I log in later - I expect to hear Cabinet has *imploded* - the #Brexit team *fired* - and a GE has been called !Twitter replies:#DreamOnClareClare replies:" What's the point of being a #dangerousradical if I can't dream !!

Many of the corporate lobbyists – used to decades of operating within the EU's bureaucracy – are only thinking of their narrow, short-term vested interests instead of the long-term future of the UK:  #Brexit
Has Number 10 given out a taxi number that does not exist to Cabinet ministers who have not yet resigned? This is symbolic of the #Brexit chaos engulfing the PM. 
I take my hat off to you. Well done. The generation that would have to live longest with the dire consequences of idiotic #Brexit deserve to be heard - and taken seriously.
As the Chequers meeting gets underway a new poll reveals voters will turn away from the Tories if they fail to implement #Brexit. Pressure is on.

The whole problem with the Tory approach to #Brexit - both wings of the party - is that they view the Brexit process as an administrative managerial chore rather than a geostrategic opportunity to reshape Europe and enhance the global multilateral system. All we hear is rhetoric.
If this article is accurate the Conservative party would be buried for a generation with the blame lying squarely with @OllyRobbins & the PM for again allowing advisors to take complete control#Brexit #Chequers
The Tory aversion to the EEA speaks to their lack of vision. Here is a golden opportunity to turn Efta into a serious global player, counterbalancing the regulatory hegemony of the EU - and all they can think about is tariffs on cheese.#Brexit
At least three hurdles that PM has to overcome this weekend - not just keeping her Cabinet intact but also fashioning a #Brexit proposal that is credible to #EU27 whilst reassuring business that they are not going to face a “no deal” disaster either deliberately or by default.
Just to add.So as you all know. I am not against anyone protesting him - I am against people protesting him & not what is happening in the UK - that is hypocritical & it annoys me.#brexit is for life, not just 4 years.#VoteLeaveCheated #Stopbrexit

Hopefully, if all goes well, by the end of this #chequers Cabinet meeting the U.K. Government will have finally negotiated its starting position for the #Brexit process.Then we’ll be ready to activate the Article 50 process. 
Can we forget any talk that today’s cabinet meeting is about a good #Brexit deal? This is all about damage-limitation from a foolish move that, however done, is very harmful to British interests.
From the moment the referendum was announced to today’s #Chequers summit, #Brexit has been about keeping the Tory party in power and nothing to do with the future of Britain

I fell asleep in the car half-way through #BBCQT. All I can remember is ignorance, simplicity, verbosity and two quotes on #Brexit - "We are where we are" and "People 'just' want out of the EU". I understand neither. Good night.
I hope ministers hold firm during tomorrow's #Chequers gathering. The British people want the government to honour their pledges & deliver the #Brexit the country voted for. That means taking back control of our money, laws & borders & embracing our free-trading future! #bbcqt
It's a shame Mathew Parris wasn't the tory leader and in charge of the #Brexit negotiations, actually he's sensible, he'd have told us it's a monumental act of self harm and abandoned it, in other words he'd put country before party, unlike the odious Priti Patel #bbcqt.
To all those in England with a Scottish Parent or Grandparent. I'm using #bbcqt to let you know that when Scotland goes independent through #scotref, after #brexit you will be entitled to naturalisation and dual citizenship which includes passport and #EU freedom of movement.
The outcome of the referendum and last year's General Election where 80% of the votes cast were for parties committed to full Brexit must be respected. Not discredited nonsense about non issue of the Irish border and ridiculously overblown business scaremongering #Brexit 
So 2 years on #Brexit comes to this: the British government locked away in a country house with their telephones confiscated to argue about three unworkable customs arrangements with Europe... #laughorcry
Matthew Parris appears confused and thinks that the majority of referendum voters instructed the government to negotiate a #Brexit deal. That wasn’t on the ballot paper. If they can work out a deal then all well and good, but the options were simply to leave the EU or to remain.
“You wait till tomorrow. It’ll all be sorted out” #gammon #brexit #bbcqt

Hey @UKLabour, the whole point of a campaign is to influence the outcome of a result. How the bloody hell can you overlook this? My only conclusion is that you want #Brexit as much as your leader does, there is no other reason to ignore a campaign which broke the law.

What an extraordinary hour of radio on #Brexit from @IainDale. His personal despondency at #TheresaMay's obvious incompetence was echoed by angry callers who feel betrayed by a weak #Tory government. Killer radio from @lbc !
Look, if you wanted to see where #Brexit was always heading, you only needed to read a few fairly accessible blogs written in plain English. The boo-hoo from Leave Ultras now just won't wash.
It speaks volumes that Theresa May showed Angela Merkel her customs plan before she showed her own Cabinet:  #Brexit
Tory Brexiteers 'Will Reject Soft Brexit Proposal'Jacob Rees-Mogg tells Telegraph:“If this correct this is NOT #BrexitThis common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state.The Prime Minister should imitate Mr Gove & tear up this paper!”#EU

Bottom line on #Amesbury; Mrs May is furious that the #WorldCup is going so well for #Russia (and #Brexit so badly for her), so, driven out of her mind by the prospect of #England reaching the final in front of #Putin, she turns two victims of bad drugs into victims of Vladimir.

In many sports if a title winner is found to have cheated, they are stripped of their title and banned for several years. Let's apply that to #Brexit.
You're having a laugh aren't you...there are so many reasons why millions of us will never accept this flawed #Brexit coup which is more to do with the imposition of political ideologies & party wills than the Will of the Ppl. denial of a#FinalSay + #Remain option = Autocracy!
May cannot even persuade her #Brexit Secretary that her latest customs fudge is workable. She seems stubbornly determined to press ahead with it. If only the customs plan and the Prime Minister could suffer a common fate and both be ditched by the Tories.
UK’s so-called ‘special relationship’ with the U.S. was one of the most enduring alliances of the 20th century, though #Brexit and Trump's election have raised questions about its future 
When you’re watching the TV news and trying to work out what’s the biggest pile of illogical, contradictory nonsense, the latest Novichok explanations (vs what was said in March) or Theresa May’s latest #Brexit “plan” for a deal with her Cabinet... 
If you withdrew support for a #Brexit process that is alienating talented staff and a migration policy which has ensured many doctors can’t get visas your constituents would be better served. 
Good to see three #Devon Tory MPs sign this letter to the PM urging her to listen to the concerns of British businesses about #BrexitShambles but where on earth are the others? Devon will be very badly hit by a hard #Brexit. 
. @ScotGov has offered  @GOVUK  the realistic & workable proposals they need if a disastrous #Brexit “no deal” is to be avoided.  Prime Minister needs to see sense and recognise reality......Scottish position on EU relationship

A reminder to the Prime Minister and N'o 10 Downing Street, in case they've had a bout of amnesia: the Govt promised not to cede any single market / customs arrangement that prohibits Britain having an independent trade policy: #Brexit

Well fancy that. In May DExEU and other govt depts drew up scenarios for a no-deal #Brexit:  Using FOI I asked which ministers had seen these documents. Govt now claim neither the documents or scenarios ever existed. #BrexitShambles

This should lead to #Brexit getting more political attention in Germany. Wait until German politicians find out that the EU's inflexible "offer" to UK is to either "split up the UK" or "become a vassal state", to sort out the Irish border and thus the future EU-UK relationship: 
Rees-Mogg: Mrs May’s “foolish policy” is “not Brexit” as it would stop UK being able to trade deals freely with other countries.If Cabinet agreement is we give EU £39bn merely on good faith of #EU negotiating a trade deal, I will vote against that#Brexit
#Labour MP Ben Bradshaw on May's new #Brexit customs plan - 'Its aimed at holding the Tory Party together, not on best interests of country.

This is a party that has consistently sold out the w/c. Corbyn could have been different, but his lily-livered rejection of his principles on #Brexit shows he’s more interested in middle-class remainers than standing up for the change that w/c voters have demanded. (4/4)

Informative thread on @theresa_may latest #Brexit plan. Verdict seems to be - why bother? And, #EU won’t buy it anyway 
Paterson is ideologically driven, deliberately ignoring business and economic reality and demonstrating a shocking disregard for the jobs that rely upon the free movement of goods to and from the EU. #Brexit
And to suggest that #automotive will thrive outside the #customsunion because it will be able to access cheaper components is ridiculous. The devasting impact on integrated supply chains would render any unlikely drop in prices meaningless. #Brexit
And only the combination of #customsunion & #singlemarket can deliver friction free trade. It is not enough to deliver trade that’s “as frictionless as possible” when manufacturing is just-in-time and any delay costs millions. #Brexit #Automotive

1. They say the leave side lied in the #Brexit referendum. As it happens, everybody did. That's what politics is. Lying. It's a fight between you, me and the swamp. It's always a battle for the disengaged middle. This is why Jacob Rees-Mogg lies so brazenly.
Rees-Mogg is clearly concerned that May may be about to give up this "big economic gain of Brexit" - If only he were our chief #Brexit strategist and negotiator 
Another warning. Another company not wanting to leave the U.K. but they will if they need to after #Brexit. 100s of thousands of jobs at risk. Government needs to put common sense before ideology. The people should decide on the final deal @peoplesvote_uk
What part of this does #BorisJohnson fail to understand? Britain’s biggest carmaker, Jaguar Land Rover, has warned that hard #Brexit would cost £1.2bn a year in trade tariffs and make it unprofitable to remain in the UK. #Brexit means economic meltdown

Sarah Smith has misled @BBCNews with her reports on lies by @michaelgove about UK fishers’ #Brexit expectations. Facts are that 50% of English owners have sold their quotas to continental skippers, Wales 88%. And UK sells over 70% of its catch to other EU states#FBPE
How often must it be said…you can’t “make a success of #Brexit “. The best you can do, short of staying in the #EU, is to find the best way to mitigate the inevitable damage to everyone , including Mr Gaffney’s comstituents. Single Market & Customs Union membership is that way.
Whatever the outcome of this #Brexit clusterf*** I know I'll be able to look at myself in the mirror & know I was on the right side of history in seeking a more open, tolererant, diverse, outward-looking liberal future for our young ppl.How many MPs can say the same!#StopBrexit
Accurate & damning indictment of the damned but if she were to fall & an election follow, Labour must stand with an option to #Revoke, #Remain & #Reform to offer the Ppl a fair choice, or the country may yet be damned to a #Brexit that leaves us Poorer, Weaker & with Fewer Rights 
I am sure that this latest Novichok incident is in no way related to the Prime Minister's attempt to unite her cabinet on the #Brexit "deal".
How many people have to tell YOU #Brexit is a scam before you stop supporting it?
Today Michael Gove was proudly telling the UK fishing industry how the government were going to improve the fisherman’s futures by taking control of territorial waters after #brexit, he failed to mention most of the fish they catch is sold to the EU, so no trade deal = no market
Seventy years ago the Tories voted against the NHS because they wanted private doctors to continue to charge patients a fortune.Seventy years on they want to use #Brexit as an excuse to sell the NHS to the Americans, so that private doctors can charge patients a fortune.
Aaarrgghh. I could scream with frustration.Even if you voted #BREXIT it’s blindingly obvious now that the leave campaign was a pack of lies & it will cause irreparable harm to the people of the #UK.Then in a few years we’ll rejoin the #EU, diminished in every sense.

Jacob Rees Mogg - because he's the most articulate Brexit supporter in the HoC and (more importantly to me) he isn't a member of the current government that has shown its total incompetence in all matters - not just #Brexit#JRM4PM
Our #Brexit worked out much better. 
Boris Johnson/Michael Gove/Priti Patel all big players in the Vote Leave campaign, all of them usually have plenty to say on #Brexit, but these cowardly bastards wouldn't face scrutiny tonight on #C4News, they'd have walked to the biased #bbcnews no doubt, again fucking cowards
#Labour’s Lesley Laird criticises SNP for using their opportunity to introduce a debate on the matter of Scotland’s self-determination.On the same day that her leader used his opportunity at PMQs to overlook Tory #DarkFunds or #Brexit, and used all of his 6 questions on buses.
Also, it is hard to imagine the anger that will poison British politics for years to come if millions of people believe #Brexit to have been won by cheating, crime and hostile foreign interference. #Brexit must be stopped.
If such cheating is rewarded with the greatest prize that post-1945 politics has offered, then we can be assured it will be repeated, and that to all intents and purposes our democracy will be dead. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
When it transpires a result that swung on 2% was interfered with in so many ways - breach of electoral law, CA data manipulation, foreign interference - a vote on the deal becomes a democratic imperative. Forced constitutional change based on an illegal mandate is junta. #Brexit 
MEP: For Gove to say British fishers will get a 'fairer share' of fishing is ridiculous & smacks of Stitch-Up.Giving inshore fleet a few extra fish while #EU flagships take the rest, is NOT what fishers voted for & NOT what they should be getting.#Brexit
Vote Leave’s Matthew Elliott wasn't at all keen to do an interview with #C4News, perhaps thinking that BBC #r4today offered a much more congenial and reliable platform from which to rubbish the Electoral Commission.How right he was.#Brexit #BrexitGate
Andrew Rosindell also got caught spinning myth that we could spend £20billion a year on NHS post #Brexit. He can't represent London, the capital city of remain. 
It is clear that #Brexit not only hits the poorest regions hardest, but it hurts the poorest individuals most, because increased tariffs on essentials such as food will mean a greater proportion of household income would be spent on weekly shopping bills:
.@TheresaMay has been warned the Tories will be "toast" if they fail to deliver on their #Brexit promises 
So @jeremycorbyn wants Britain to withdraw not just from the EU but also the single market & the Customs Union. He is also against the #PeoplesVote. In other words, he is more committed to hard #Brexit than Teresa May & his position is identical to UKIP's.

The basic mistake has been to assume that Britain is negotiating with a rational entity capable of reasonable deals. The EU isn’t that:  #Brexit
Imagine the Tour de France organisers had said ‘Yes, we know Lance Armstrong cheated, but we cannot be certain he wouldn’t have won anyway, so we see no reason to strip him of his victories’, that’s what’s happening in U.K. politics now. #Brexit
I think prospects for #Brexit talks are looking very grim indeed
12,000 EU doctors work in the NHS (7% of the workforce). Half are planning to leave post #Brexit. What's the gov't doing to retain them?
European Parliament is branded 'outrageous' after refusing to reveal how MEPs spend their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded expenses  #Brexit 
Whatever your views on #Brexit, it is clear that it offers Scotland’s fishing industry a “sea of opportunity”.  The White Paper shows we are well on the way to seizing it. 
If a second referendum was opened.... What would everyone vote? @BBCNews @itvmeridian @SkyNews@BorisJohnson @jeremycorbyn @theresa_may @MayorofLondon#Vote#Poll#polloftheday#brexit#BrexitFrauderendum#Brexitfraud#brexit
Weeps. Not sure if laughing or crying.#Brexit 
Feeling nervous boys?.. The banging of the prison doors and clanging of keys gets ever louder, doesn't it . #Brexit #VoteLeave
V Bad!Gisela Stuart: The fudge on offer is we are not staying in THE single market but A single market.We no longer have THAT freedom of movement but a DIFFERENT form.People are left thinking we haven’t really left – it only looks like that!#Brexit #EU
So the line Leavers are going with now is ‘We cheated but it didn’t influence the result’.  If that defence wasn’t enough to protect Lance Armstrong, Ben Johnson etc, why is it enough to debase our democracy? #Brexit
The #EU are FINALLY worried but if May crumbles then EU will WIN #Brexit 
Just asking: if this fraud invalidates the official campaign and therefore the Referendum result, surely that means #Brexit is off? 
John Redwood: Should be 2 options for Friday's Chequers meetingWorld Trade option which does not require consent from EU & allows us to take back control of our laws, money, borders & trade policy.Free Trade Agreement option much in #EU interest.#Brexit
The on-going UK #Brexit shambles. Five years to develop a Customs system and a decade for one suitable for small businesses in supply chains. This hard Tory Brexit will destroy jobs and businesses. It's time for Independence. 
A cautionary note to @UKLabour : if the Tories go to the country as the #Brexit party thwarted by a coalition of Labour and the metropolitan elite it will be a #KhakiElection in which Labour will lose a huge number of safe seats.
Steve Baker, #Brexit Minister & former chair of the secretive ERG, is at the heart of Vote Leave's abuses of electoral law.Yesterday, Baker signed 1st of a series of statutory instruments enabling govt to bypass parliamentary scrutiny of new legislation.This a right-wing coup. 
We now know for sure that Vote Leave and it's Tory MPs in government cheated.The referendum is null and void, just as the parliamentary election of an MP would be if he/she cheated.#Brexit should be cancelled and a new referendum held.
#Brexit negotiations update: no change over this time last year. New balls please? #Wimbledon
So it's official. Britain is being ripped apart by fraud. #brexit
#VoteLeave cheated. Along with the news of the #BrexitBigShort, the #Leave campaign was "dirty". We need the Official Opposition to be a watchdog re: #Brexit. But they are not on the field. So we have to do this ourselves.
When does a campaign based on lies and funded by dishonesty cease to become “the will of the people”? #VoteLeave #Brexit
Let us remind ourselves of the links between #Gove #Johnson and #voteleaveLet us prepare ourselves for the court case judgement.Then let us watch as NOBODY RESIGNS! #stopbrexit #brexit 
The #VoteLeave campaign broke election law! It’s time for another referendum. #Brexit
Hilarious. Germany refuse to contribute fully to an supranational organisation because they feel they don’t have enough overall say in it, deciding instead for an option closer to home that places them fully in controlSound familiar? #Brexit #EUArmy #Hypocrites
When athletes are caught using banned drugs they are disqualified and stripped of their medals.When Vote Leave & Leave EU are *both* found to have broken multiple electoral laws, we proceed with the deeply damaging #Brexit they fraudulently promoted?#r4today @MollyMEP
#Brexit would hit #Yorkshire and other regions outside London the worst
Assume @BBCr4today will focus Gove interview on its lead story that the Leave campaign he headed broke the law rather than simply letting him spout more false #Brexit promises - this time about fishing.
Just heard on the news that the British remainers want the #EnglandvColombia match replayed as the Columbians didn’t really know what they were getting into or what the outcome would be if they lost.Oh...and they were racist. #Brexit 
'What we can't do is still pay in, still be tied down... and have none of the advantages because then neither 'Remainers' nor 'Leavers' will be happy' - Labour MP Gisela Stuart on #Brexit 
Wanted to bring this to your attention .@Farmers4EU - just in case you haven't seen it. Latest result: 70% of farmers say they expect #Brexit to be harmful. Time to stop #BrexitShambles:
The #brexit referendum has caused so much cabinet infighting about what kind of withdrawal the people voted for (whilst ignoring what kind of deal is legally and politically acceptable to the EU) that it genuinely makes democratic sense to hold a people's vote on the terms.
BBC News - Vote Leave broke electoral law, Electoral Commission expected to say  - note, this has no consequences for #Brexit whatsoever, exactly as I have been telling everyone.
No surprises there then. Looks like Vote Leave broke the law. #Brexit #FBPE
It’s here at last! Excited about the #WBSummitLondon next week. Expecting big results on politics, economy, security... Perfect proof that the #UK will remain a positive partner in #BiH and #WB region beyond #Brexit. 
If, instead, the Remain vote had marginally won, & then it emerged they'd lied, broken campaign law & the 'will of the people' had reversed, what do you imagine Brexiteers would now be saying? Why is the Remain voice not louder in challenging the basic validity of #Brexit?
Let's be crystal clear, if Greenland hadn't voted to Leave, they'd now be entangled within a €uro, lost her fishing grounds & locked out of the free market.The Greenland Treaty formalised their exit.#Brexit 
Despite fact that  UK  fishing industry is overwhelmingly a Scottish industry & that fishing is devolved to @ScotParl , @GovUK failed to engage with @ScotGov in any significant or meaningful way before producing its White Paper on Fisheries post #Brexit  published today. 
“So many people who voted #Leave, having seen that #BrexitReality is very different from what they thought they had voted for, have changed their minds, but #journalists & MPs seem to imply no one changed their minds.” @RemainerNow in @PMPmagToday. #Brexit 
"This, folks, is why #Brexit happened, nations want to be responsible for their own actions, not to pay the price for the mistakes of others!" powerful stuff from #NigelFarage in the #EuroParliament.   #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome
Any #Brexit proposal must be put to the British people with rejection as an outcome if unsatisfactory. #Brexit affects everyone and everyone should have their say, not just the wealthy,self-centred and self-entitled benefactors of the #Conservative Party.@jeremycorbyn @UKLabour
Originating from puerile rivalry between @David_Cameron and @BorisJohnson #Brexit has become UK's wrecking ball as decades of complex social, industrial, scientific and legal infrastructure collapse into nothing.  A #Tory disaster from start to finish.
Rees-Mogg: Customs 3rd way is "a muddle" & "deeply unsatisfactory Non-BrexitIt would be a cheat on the electorate to stay in Single Market & Leave in name only.This isn't hard Brexit or soft Brexit, it's just being honest with voters.#Brexit #Leave #EU
Breaking news: The SNP are to lead a debate in the house of commons tomorrow on the CLAIM OF RIGHT for Scotland. This is a critical constitutional debate on the key document of Scottish constitutional law. | #Scotref #Indyref2 #Brexit #EUwithdrawalbill #PowerGrab
The fact is, the SNP is using the rule book and the Government doesn’t like this sudden realisation that the boot is now firmly on the other foot but it comes back to the point that the #Brexit powergrab was *their* making.
Programming of business - was used to minimise debating time for the #Brexit powergrab against @ScotParl. Government programmed in votable motions tonight knowing fine well some MPs might prefer to be otherwise engaged. They set the timings for tonight’s proceeding’s, not us.
Marsan is a pompous arse. Labour's policy on #Brexit has been clear from day one: accept the result of the referendum, but oppose the final deal if it fails Labour's six key tests. Which it will. Marsan doesn't like Corbyn because he isn't a neoliberal warmonger like Tony Blair. 
Labour MEP @SebDance: “If you want an example of dearth of leadership, look at the United Kingdom. A country that is chasing a fantasy now, whose politicians are not owning up to the truth.”Hope @jeremycorbyn is listening.#Brexit #PeoplesVote
I guess, in one way, they did cancel #Brexit after all. #England :)
If #Brexit is not delivered as has been promised for so long then neither @UKLabour nor @Conservatives will ever see a vote from me or my family again. Anything other than the two main “players” will have to do - except for @LibDems of course.
183k! Let's keep it rolling folks!#peoplesvote #Brexit #FBPE
Engaging, motivational and honest talk by @Andrew_Adonis  tonight on #brexit and #thePeoplesvote Thank you @obhampstead
If you're for Remain but not condemning the EU for their 1930s approach to the refugee crisis, it means your vision of the EU isn't my vision.   #Brexit
May has completely ignored the concerns and objections of #Brexiteers in Cabinet. She has reintroduced her customs partnership albeit under a different name. Her plan involves tearing up all of her #Brexit red lines. This Friday #Brexiteers need to put country first before career 
#ProjectReality post #Brexit customs system could take five years to develop.Oops.....
Paterson should be a #Brexit negotiator. His approach: "We should be offering the EU reciprocal free trade with zero tariffs and if they won't accept that, then we go to World Trade arrangements which tiny little countries like the United States and India struggle to trade on." 
The EU want clarity on the British Government's position on #Brexit.This is actually going to be very easy. All it needs is for Mrs May @theresa_may to click her heels three times while chanting 'Let me be quite clear', while riding a bucking Unicorn.
Tory Remainers are trying to use blackmail to browbeat #Brexiteers into accepting May's customs fudge. How many times have we heard the PM over-promise and woefully under-deliver on #Brexit fudge after compromise after damp squib? She clearly wants #BRINO
DUP MEP: Backstop for NI wholly unacceptableNI sells more goods into UK market than all other markets.75% of goods/services into NI are from UK.We will never accept such interference in constitutional & economic well-being of our part of UK.#Brexit #EU
Incredible drama in #ENGvCOL game at #WorldCup18! Can feel some positive patriotic feeling in he air.I love being half English, half Scottish, British and European! Let’s keep those proud patriotic juices flowing and save UK from damaging #brexit#stopbrexit #remainernow
Well done #England a #Brexit bounce
Remember this summer. Our nation was struggling. It was all so dire and then... - Danny Dyer called the former PM a twat #Brexit- Dani Dyer showed us all what love was #LoveIsland- Eric Dier won England a penalty shootout #WorldCup#COLENG #ThreeLions
Ireland is none of the EU’s business, according to James Dyson - patience is really wearing thin with this garbage #dyson #brexit 
Govt says EU students will be treated as UK nationals re fees etc even after #Brexit.Will Govt accord the same treatment to Australians, Canadians etc?Brexit means no discrimination based on national origin, unlike the racist EU.Does the Govt understand what Brexit means? 
A lot of Tory MPs furious that the SNP is forcing them to stay in the Commons and vote through budget estimates instead of watching the big #ENGCOL match.Guess you shouldn't have pissed them off by rail-roading the #Brexit #powergrab debate and then :D
One thing you can guarantee with England, when we have a good thing (this goes for everything not just football) we will always always always fuck it right up. #Brexit
I think we should put this ref in charge of talks at Chequers on Friday #ENGCOL #Brexit
'Have the British people got the backbone to rise up' against this #Brexit betrayal. 
If this is true, it is treachery. There must and will be public revolt, and May’s government must fall. The Tory party had better wake up, fast. The Europhile elite must not be allowed to triumph. #NoDeal #Brexit 
Farage: “The deal which everybody said would hold had fallen to pieces within the space of a few hours. What you saw was the rebirth of the nation-state. That is what #Brexit, that is what Trump, that is what the Italian elections are all about" 
Responding to news that the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) has announced that it backs giving people the final say on the #Brexit deal“@Conservatives & @UKLabour MPs who claim to support our hardworking NHS staff now face a dilemma” says @thomasbrake
Has anyone given thought to how much of Ireland’s trade with EU countries is freighted via Britain and the Channel Tunnel? In the context of a “no deal” #Brexit that Leo and Simon are playing with, cos like, there’s no chance of it? I’m sure the EU will put Ireland first… #2008
Except @Nigel_Farage we don't believe a single word that comes out of your mouth. Not a single word. I dearly hope for your extradition to the United States.#Brexit #Trump #TrumpRussia #CambridgeAnalytica #EUref
Wife just said Sterling looks very small. I replied it's because he has shrunk against most other currencies since #Brexit! #Eng #ENGCOL
What about the large European company planning to move out of our constituency that you've heard about but obviously won't be tweeting? #Brexit
McKluskey & Unite are open to the possibility of a #PeoplesVote - welcome news indeed. But they need to go further & understand that the big question for voters isn't 'Hard or Soft Brexit?' It's 'Brexit or No Brexit?' Opposing #Brexit entirely is #Labour's best chance at the GE.
Excellent report of @PGibsonSNP Westminster Hall debate today on Scotland & #Brexit @theSNP @PeterGrantMP @DavidLinden SNP MP: ‘Dismiss Scottish people’s voice on Brexit at your peril’
MEP: “Under cover of darkness, our PM & EU seem to be preparing us to still be members of #EU come April 2019.Whole Article 50 process designed to delay & obstruct & the end game is revealing itself.We should have left the day after referendum.”#Brexit
Good news that @unitetheunion has agreed this afternoon to keep open the possibility of a @peoplesvote_uk on the final #Brexit deal and will back @UKLabour to vote against a deal that doesn’t protect jobs with access to the Single Market and Customs Union.
Oh do behave !The Labour Front Bench #brexit Team have a very clear view.BTW  the weather is far to hot to bother with #clickbait or even #amateurtrollsGo well.
Surely any decent PM would have the guts to show leadership and tell the country that #brexit is not in its interests and would not back a harmful policy! 
Except with current Labour policy an election won't solve anything. Labour & Tory positions on #Brexit not substantively different & similarly opaque. Only democratic way is #PeoplesVote. Then can #StopBrexit & keep #freemovement
Adding Dyson rubbish vacuum cleaners & Wetherspoons pubs to the list of crap #brexit businesses I'll be boycotting 
APPALLING TO WATCH Europhile Tories savage Jacob Rees-Mogg & @Borisjohnson simply4 insisting @Theresa May keep promises she has repeatedly madeon #Brexit.  Trolls & smear merchants foul mouthed on twitter.  #May  planned whole thing with @OllyRobbins.  
Why do Irish people support a person working so hard to damage our interests?Buy some other vacuum cleaner. The #Dyson isn't any better than the competition.#Brexit 
Just had a sobering discussion with @ABPI_UK. On day one of #Brexit, it's essential patients can still access the medicines that they need, and when they need them. I sincerely hope the Govt can deliver - no one voted in 2016 to make medicines harder to approve & access. #NHS70
BREXIT: Brexit turning into a nightmare, says McCluskey /#EU #Brexit #Labour #PeoplesVote
Trading with the EU on WTO terms would devastate our economy and inflict massive suffering on the British people. Only a traitor, a fool, or someone who cares nothing for the British people would advocate such a policy. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
Sting talks #Brexit - it's a disaster.. I haven't heard one coherent argument in favour of brexit.. it's totally insane.. why are we leaving the EU as it's to our advantage & to leave is to our disadvantage.. it's complete madness.Shaggy - I'm with him.. F*ck brexit#FBPE
Thanks to @AlynSmith for hosting a chance for me to speak to the Press in @Europarl_EN about Scotland  & #Brexit . He is playing a blinder here - always speaking up for Scotland 
For those that think Jeremy Corbyn and Labour should vehemently oppose #Brexit ;, you forget the two parties that are exclusively against Brexit in any manifestation are the Lib Dems and the Greens who consistently poll well below 10% in the popular vote after EU ref.
Reminder: Senior Tories including Liam Fox accused of accepting money from former Soviet states. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #StopBrexit
The UK government will soon realise that negotiating with the EU is a pointless exercise & step into WTO, leaving us free to strike deals elsewhere.#Brexit
Labour slips backwards in the polls as it continues to sit pathetically on the fence in the face of the greatest political issue since 1945. In 2 years Labour has gone from being a party of principles and hope to a party of nothing!#StopBrexit #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Every MP who hasn't read the treasury #Brexit impact assessments should be named, shamed and deselected. The biggest upheaval in the history of a nation and a bunch of overpaid under achievers can't be arsed finding out the facts. They don't deserve their jobs.
The greatest achievement of the #EU is the #Peace it has brought to a continent historically at war.If there is one utterly unforgivable consequence posed by #Brexit, it is that some form of conflict returns.If this happens @BorderIrish it will be on the Brexiters's conscience.
After all her no deal better than a bad deal crap, the PM finally asks what the impact of #Brexit will be, in a number of scenarios, compared to remaining.How the hell has she framed any decisions without the effin data to hand?FFS this is #Pathetic
Had a good meeting with @theresa_may in The Hague about #Brexit state of play. The UK continues to be a valued friend. Therefore, I’m delighted that King Willem-Alexander & Queen Máxima will be paying a state visit to the UK in October. 
Rees-Mogg: We know Greg Clark has been making speeches saying we should remain in Single Market & Customs Union.We know Treasury consistently trying it’s best to frustrate #BrexitSadly, parts of British establishment never accepted referendum result.#EU
1. What has completely escaped our moronic MPs (and most of the #Brexit commentariat) is that, by leaving the EU, we assume the status of a third country. This is not something the EU does to us. We voluntarily place ourselves in this category. Something we have actively sought.
The net closes ever tighter on Merkel.She though she had dodged a bullet, she hasn’t.Another blow for Merkel, another blow for Germany And France.They no longer control the future of the EU.That is if the EU has a future left.C’mon #Brexit 
Actually I don't believe #JacobReesMogg wants the best for our country. Anyone who turns a blind eye to business and jobs leaving the UK, condones the growing split in the United Kingdom (and its Government), and the trashing of our economy thanks to #brexit isn't a patriot. 
Lovely chap came to fit my Smart Meter today. He's Italian, wife English. We chat abt Brexit. He lists all the negatives incoming. I nod. I add some. I ask how ppl treat him. 'Some ppl are lovely, others ask me what r u doing here?' I fucking hate #Brexit and all who sail in her.
This Brexit deal is screwing up our future. We need make more noise.Join the movement and RT this video. #PeoplesVote #Brexit #TuesdayThoughts
Depressing to see that in answering my Treasury Question even @philiphammonduk has been lent on. He is now pretending there will be a #Brexit dividend. There won't be and, from the PM and Chancellor downwards, they need to admit it. #FBPE
Great quote from #SirJamesDyson on #Brexit“I would just walk away. We’ve offered lots, they’ve offered nothing” 
The @UKGOV's deeply damaging approach to #Brexit doesn't serve Scotland well and exists purely to satify the whims of Tory backbench MPs.Earlier today I spoke in a debate on the implications for Scotland of leaving the EU. Here's a clip of my speech.  
If you haven't checked out @MollyMEP's #BadBoysofBrexit site yet, go ahead and check out the vested interests in #Brexit, it's almost unbelievable: the Regulation Burners, the Money Men and the Russia Connection  
Looks like @jeremycorbyn's ever changing #Brexit strategy is working out well then  
The reason @theresa_may has taken 2 years to decide her #Brexit approach is because she intends to bounce us into #BRINO at the last minute when it's too late to stop it! This MUST NOT happen.
Labour must put the potential damage to our #NHS front and centre of our critique of the Government's approach to #Brexit. My piece today for @LabourList
Very informative discussion with @gualtierieurope regarding the possible outcomes from the present #Brexit negotiation difficulties.  Considerable worry accompanied by, as I also heard from @ElmarBrok_MEP earlier, a strong  & urgent demand for clarity & realism from the UK .
What a job... based in Brussels and reporting on everything to do with #Brexit for @BBCScotland's forthcoming nine o'clock news programme. The programme will be launching on the newly green-lit BBC Scotland channel in the month before the UK leaves the EU. 
#Brexit debate kicks off at #UPC2018 with ⁦@LenMcCluskey⁩ moving the unions Executive Statement ... looking forward to an honest dignified debate among delegates who will determine our policy .. not the press or outsiders interfering in our union ⁦@unitetheunion⁩
The UK has already had to create 50 new diplomatic posts, at a cost of £4.1million, to counter the UK's declining global influence because of #Brexit:
1. The ultra brexiters are going all out for their WTO option #Brexit. They are gradually pushing the narrative that anything including a withdrawal agreement is a betrayal of Brexit and their thicko followers are buying it. This is dangerous.
One thing that unites Left and Right in the UK: neither could give two fucks about Northern Ireland. If they did, they would be fighting to stop #Brexit on that basis alone.
Oh, and another thing, don't come all class warrior if you're happy to leave working class communities in Northern Ireland at the mercy of something that could fan the flames of sectarian paranoia and division. #Brexit
Europe is waiting for a detailed UK Gov White Paper on the future after #Brexit, but I fear England's match against Colombia this evening could be easier than the fight at Chequers on Friday as I read it.
Great response in Beeston so far this morning. Most of @Anna_Soubry's constituents that we have met completely disagree with her on #Brexit. 
V excited to be launching the new Parliament and Treaties Hub (PATH) @HouseofCommons. 6-month p/t project looking at options for Parly scrutiny of treaties for #Brexit and beyond. Int comparisons, past proposals, committees, CRAG, devolveds, new ideas etc /1
Just arrived back in Dublin to focus fully on #Brexit - flying to London tonight after a busy Dail session today. Important #Brexit meetings with 4 UK Ministers tomorrow. Be assured #Brexit is the number one priority for Govt until we get a deal done. 
"There will be the most terrible shattering disillusion with the whole political establishment and all our institutions if we refuse a #PeoplesVote and #Brexit makes everyone (except of course JRM, Farage, Banks, Redwood, Johnson, hedgies) poorer’ 
 Doh Je-re-my Cor-byn Tories have a five point lead over Labour despite #Brexit uncertainty. Imagine what will happen to Labour when the negotiations are complete. 
The Leave Alliance was formed by some of the oldest eurosceptic campaign groups in the business, active since before Ukip - and we say unequivocally that the UK should not contemplate a WTO option #Brexit. It would be a disaster. 
#DUP acted against their own long term interest in supporting #Brexit-neither #EU nor #Ireland engaging in bullying- just want workable solutions
.@TheresaMay is being warned that businesses are running out of patience on the lack of #Brexit clarity 
Brexit is the best #trade union we’ve ever had - nothing will improve the rights and wages of #British workers more than leaving SM. Happy to meet with ⁦@LenMcCluskey⁩ one on one in the North West to have a discussion on this. #brexit 
Oh Anna, you’ve done it again. Only last night you called out others for squabbling, and look, here you are, doing just that. Cake and eat it springs to mind.@BroxtoweCons must be embarrassed, as must be your constituents, the majority of whom voted for #Brexit. 
Up to now, the #pharmaceutical industry has preferred not to endanger its cosy relationship with the #Tory government by speaking out about the devastating effect of #Brexit on plants and jobs in #Britain . Now, might they dare follow #Airbus ‘s lead?
In response to all those Corbynites, Corbynistas, Corbyphants who claim Mr Corbyn @jeremycorbyn cannot do anything about #Brexit? Meanwhile he sits back while major employers start to implement their one way exit strategies. Fucking disgrace. He will not be forgiven. 
Excellent article busting the #Brexit naysayers myths about trade on WTO terms @BrexitCentral
Penny Mordaunt @BBCr4today: I remain optimistic we will get a good deal.ME: Which good deal would that be? And why are we going through this #Brexit hell which can only leave us Poorer, Weaker with Less Control & Fewer Rights unless you can get a BETTER DEAL?!!#Remain #Reform
Just been informed that I have the "wrong opinion" about #Brexit, I am obviously "forrin" & should "go home". Now that I have been "told", I shall return to Surrey forthwith & console myself at being 1st "forrin" ever to be born in Epsom hospital. #PeoplesVote #WATON
Mrs May @theresa_may, please accept the resignations of Johnson, Fox and Davis on your away day. Your government will survive for now, it isn't like there is a viable alternative waiting in the wings. Stop #Brexit and get back to running the country into the ground.
Can you hear it? The slow death of #Brexit ......Brexit: MPs must get Bank of England advice on any economic damage before voting on deal, says Treasury Committee - The Independent 
1. Yesterday our gifted PM once again ruled out the EEA while still claiming we can have frictionless trade. The old dear is clearly off her rocker. There is no way #Brexit won't be an utter pigs ear if we leave the single market. I don't think the withdrawal act is going to work
Blair  took us into illegal war that killed millions.Gordon Brown broke his promise to hold a referendum on the EU Constitution.Cameron got Obama to put us at the back of the queue.@theresa_may is delivering a #Brexit in name only.We've had four traitor PMs in this century.
Pleased to have joined other members of the Professional and Business Services Council in signing this letter to the Prime Minister. #Brexit 
Finally, two years after the referendum, Theresa May asks Treasury for #Brexit analysisToo little, too late. #Pathetic
What many Brits don’t get.....brexit in an age of Clinton & Obama was a problem for the EU to mitigate caused by those quirky independent minded Brits.#Brexit in the age of Trump is an existential threat not just to EU but to a rules based global order. 
Does this means @theresa_may has not been in that room in @HouseofCommons where the #Brexit impact papers are kept under lock & key?...you know, the impact assessments reports only 83 out of 650 MPs have read  #PeoplesVote
So we are back to “eating cake and having it”.  That didn’t go well first time round......#Brexit  customs plan will offer 'best of both words' - BBC News 
The guy who said to Putin that he can be more flexible after the  , said to the British Public that he won’t put them to the end of the queue, if they  #Brexit down.Who is the serial colluder here?#TyrantsUnited
A historian explains how Putin targeted his people's prejudices to tell tailored lies to segmented audiences, lies that certain segments might believe. And how that method was exported to the UK for #Brexit and to the US for the #Trump campaign  @davidfrum
We have a paralysed Prime Minister ‘presiding’ over a #CabinetofChaos. They are not fit to govern & their game of #Brexit Russian Roulette will have a major impact on all of our lives & livelihoods. This is all about Tory interests & nothing else. Scotland deserves better. 
Tory MP: "We could find Govt collapses on Friday night.If she crosses Brexit Red Lines & it looks like she's going to, then Brexiteers will withdraw support for her & Boris, David Davis & other #Brexit ministers will walk."Friday could decide May's fate.
The #Brexit Story So Far:1 UK votes for Brexit2 No agreed Brexit3 May says 'Brexit means Brexit'4 Tory Ultras demand Hard Brexit5 Tories cant join 3&46 Corbyn aids Tories out of their own mess7 Brexit happens without anyone knowing what Brexit means
Dear @RuthDavidsonMSP we might not all support your u turn on #brexit but this must be dealt with ASAP ". @ScotTories are up to their necks in dark money"
Sigh. We’re now 25 months on from #Brexit & still no one in the UK seems to have a clue what it’ll look like. But y’know blue passports etc 
Matteo Salvini: "We will try to comply to European regulations, but we are ready to ignore them for the good of Italians.It was once deemed impossible to bring down the Berlin Wall.The next wall we will tear down will be the one of Brussels.”#Brexit #EU
"The bag itself goes directly in the bin"James Acaster's #Brexit teabag metaphor still the original and best  
Theresa May has signed a EU council document that means Britain will continue to send MEPs -- and remain in the EU, if Brexit doesn't happen in March 2019. That's it folks, the reversal of Brexit is underway, and it's Mrs May that is leading us back into the EU.#Brexit 
Sinister foreign leader caught trying to overturn democratic vote in UK…  #Brexit
I’ve been thinking a lot about the grief, dislocation & emotional impact of #BrexitLatest design honours that sense loss that I’ve felt and I know others have too. Leave will tear us apart. #StopBrexit@cliodiaspora @Ferretgrove @ali__samson
Cabinet fighting like cats in a bag over #Brexit. Meanwhile not a single mental health bed in the country. It’s gross dereliction of the most basic duty of care 
Pleased to support, say a few words and sing at the Big #Brexit Party this coming Sunday. @artists4brexit Well done to the fabulous Brexiteer Michael for organising this. Hope you can join us all to celebrate Brexit Britain.  Troubadour, 263-267 Old Brompton Rd, London SW5 9JA
Hey @carolecadwalla I've found the proof of foreign intervention in the Brexit referendum that you've been looking for. #Brexit 
Members of @unitetheunion, please vote tomorrow, bearing in mind all the things we've learned about #Brexit reality since the Referendum - job losses, NHS damage, diminished rights, crooked electoral practice in the campaign. Vote for jobs and for future generations. @UKLabour 
REVEALED: David Cameron did personally request Obama to tell the British nation that the US would push Britain to the 'back of the queue' for a trade deal if we voted for #BrexitWith prime ministers like this who needs enemies? 
A very good news day: Tory civil war as Rees-Moggy threatens the Maybot with a coup unless she delivers a truly hardcore #Brexit...May the civil war be long, blood with lots of collateral damage, resignations, sackings, bad headlines in the Daily Heil & pain, lots of tory pain... pic.twitter.com/fdwyNJxjX9
Mr Speaker, this is a #Brexit Toastie! (Loving the #Budget2018 Memes) (PS: wish I wasn't on a permanent diet and I could actually demolish a couple of these!)
Delighted to continue as Justice & Home Affairs Spokesperson for the Westminster @theSNP team. #Brexit is a considerable threat to justice, security & #HumanRights in Scotland & to the current constitutional settlement & I will continue to fight it
#Germany in crisis. #DeutscheBank on the brink. Slowdown in China. #Quitaly. #Trump pulling FDI home. #Brexit. #Ireland ranked number one economy with most to lose from global trade war. The perfect storm is brewing
I welcomed members of the French Assembly working group on #Brexit to Meath today & thanked them for their unwavering support for Ireland and the Irish border issue. Next stop the border,to see for themselves the challenges ahead #factfindingmission
Blimey, if Andrew Neil was facilitating fundraising for Brexit campaign, by introducing Aaron Banks to donors, then his time working at BBC in any impartial journalistic / broadcast / interview context is surely over, as he's a player and participant in Brexit campaign. #Brexit 
The jeering from the Tory benches whilst @jeremycorbyn speaks is painful to witness. Don’t these laughing fools realise they are taking their country & mine to the brink of disaster? Oh for the statesmanlike approach of the Irish Govt #Brexit #EUCOstatement
Jacob Rees-Mogg has so many Tory Remainers presently worried and hysterical as he intensifies his masterful #Brexit campaign.
VIDEO: The strawberry  season is in full swing in Kent, the so-called 'Garden of England'. But with a shortage of seasonal labourers to pick the fruit, a trend exacerbated by #Brexit, there are growing fears many may be left to rot on their stems. 
Interestingly, on 28 June 2016 Reuters quoted Sberbank saying that "#Brexit could theoretically influence the timing of Alrosa’s privatisation". Shortly after this, Arron Banks' mate & Brexit bankroller Jim Mellon bought into the Russian diamond miner. Nice "timing"!

Leavers don't seem especially worried about the details of #brexit, but just want to "feel" outside the EU, as David Davis puts it. It's all rather farcical when you think about it. via @guardian

May crosses any of her three red lines at her own peril. We voted to Leave the EU. Anything less than a clean #Brexit is wholly unacceptable and would unleash an unprecedented wave of anger across the UK. 
Dear #tories #conservatives, i don't recall voting for this guy. I voted LEAVE to get rid of unaccountable EU politicians making decisions that effect me. Please explain why he seems to be in charge of this process? #Brexit 
Here speaks a man who, along with his #Brexit mates, is advising people to move their money abroad. When everything goes tits-up, he'll be safe, as his kind always are. It'll be the rest of us who'll be in the sh*t 
"A record 75% of major British companies are now pessimistic about #Brexit, a survey showed on Monday, adding to signs of anxiety around the economy as Britain's divorce with the European Union draws near."
What is the point in publishing a #Brexit White Paper that we already know will be declined? Please someone, bang their heads together. This gets more frustrating by the day. UK's latest Brexit proposal is unrealistic, say EU officials 
These unionists who keep droning on about the catastrophe of an independent Scotland, while ignoring the REALITY of how destructive #Brexit will be, are utter hypocrites.
Letter from 30+ MPsDear Prime Minister,Our departure must be absolute.We must NOT remain entangled with EU’s institutions if this restricts our ability to exercise our sovereignty as an independent nation.Britain must stand firm.#Brexit #Leave #EU

I voted no in 2014 but I'd vote yes today. Given that in 2014 #DavidCameron convinced me that if I voted 'yes', an independent Scotland would lose EU membership.  Because of this,  #Brexit hurts all the more. Next time, I'm #YES.
Replace Theresa May now, kick out Robbins.You have no time to waste.If this Tory Govt doesn’t give the country the #brexitThey voted for they will never be elected in Govt forAnother twenty years minimum.We are not fucking Norway.We voted to leave the EU and ECJLast chance
Proud to have been a signatory to this letter in the Guardian - we should not underestimate the rights for women and minority groups that are at risk because of #Brexit. We need a #PeoplesVote as more and more of these facts come to light.
Jeremy Corbyn was fighting to protect the NHS from crippling PFI debt and increased privatisation when these three former Health Secretaries were doing the exact opposite. And how exactly is Corbyn supposed to stop #Brexit when Tory "rebels" keep voting with the government? 
Trump is working to destabilize  Europe:Questioning NATO: “NATO is as bad as NAFTA.” Pushing #Frexit Supporting a hard #BrexitSuggesting that America should leave NATO. Attacking Angela MerkelEuropeans who want a prosperous & democratic continent must fight his vision.

Arron Banks' business partner Jim Mellon bought into Alrosa at a discount to the market price shortly after the #Brexit referendum. Sberbank, in which Jacob Rees Mogg's SCM has a major stake, managed the deal.#BrexitRussia - a small but lucrative world.  
.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg is threatening @theresa_may with a #Brexit rebellion 
@afneil is so utterly compromised by his business dealings with #Brexit backers and affiliation to Banks, it is astonishing that @bbc allows him anywhere nears news & current affairs.  @BBCNews  turned into the British Fox News
Off to Strasbourg  to meet with MEPs and others to update them on Scotland’s position with regard to the chaos and damage of  #Brexit - and what preparations we are making to keep our strong links with Europe.
I've been looking over Theresa May's proposed Customs Model and conclude we'll all be made to queue like dogs at the Port of Dover! Thanks #Brexit 
Jacob Rees-Mogg is a backbench tory MP, this extreme Brexiteer is holding the country to ransom, ffs he has no govt job, why is May bowing down to his threats? His dream of a no deal #Brexit will destroy our economy, tory ideology has screwed us big time #bbcnews #SkyNews
Or, conversely, imagine being a Scottish voter who contributed to a massive majority against #Brexit which will be disastrous for your country, only to be told you have to leave the #Eu anyway...and then you find out about the chicanery and deception that rigged the vote ?
Only 6 *working weeks* before a key EU meeting - YET the PM & her #Brexit team are NO further forward on the UK's positionWHY  trigger A50 so quickly - when there was NO plan ?Why appoint incompetents to lead the negotiations ?Why did she set out impossible* red lines* so soon
I hope there is no truth in what we are hearing about the UK signing up to a Norway style model. The Prime Minister ruled out this arrangement in December saying a Norway style deal would mean "no Brexit at all". #Brexit 
Wealthy Etonian investment fund partner and MP who has just bought a second family home near Downing Street attacks the "metropolitan Establishment" and yet some forelock-tugging, cap-doffing morons are still taken in by him. #Brexit #bbcnews #r4today

It's hard to imagine President Trump persuing a more pro-Russian foreign policy. Questioning NATO, pushing #Frexit and a hard #Brexit. Europeans who want a prosperous and peaceful continent must unite to reject his vision! 
I voted remain, I support Corbyn, I am a 52 year old father of 4, I am not a cultist (which is very insulting). To 'stop #Brexit' you need to appeal to leavers, remainers who accept the ref, and remainers who do not accept the ref. FYI Corbyn and I are in the middle category. 
As three former Labour Health Secretaries state, if @jeremycorbyn does not change his stance on #Brexit the NHS will suffer  a huge blow. Over to you Jeremy. #FBPE
If May thinks #Brexit is a mistake but is pressing ahead anyway she should resign. Does she have no scruples at all. That is like ordering an execution knowing the person to be shot is innocent. 
Let's be clear, when @Jacob_Rees_Mogg threatens a revolt it is a coup. It is the same #brexitcoup that has been behind #brexit since the start. Whether it is sooner or later he will try to lead a revolt against the government in order the #ERG sieze power and install fascists.
On the eve of #NHS70 we need to put the danger to our #NHS from a hard Tory #BrexitShambles at the heart of the debate on #Brexit. 
The majority of the #British electorate support the views of those you try to label as the "ideological right", men and women who are merely trying to ensure the PM delivers the #Brexit they voted for!17.4 million are not going to "pipe down" until that promise is honoured!
#Brexit is unsustainable. Unrealistic promises of cake have made it a policy with an empty core. I don’t see the bloody British question ever going away until #Brexiters admit that they’ve promised unicorns.
'May privately thinks #Brexit is a mistake'. On this point and judged by the Prime Minister's conduct, Dominic Grieve is probably right. If only we had a committed #Brexiteer in number 10.
Nobody from the BBC - or indeed, the @metpoliceuk - has questioned #Brexit funder @LordAshcroft about why he hid information that harms Britain. Why not?

“Any EU agreement that restricts the UK’s ability to make trade agreements with other states, restricts our ability to control our migration policy, makes us pay to trade or interferes with our fishing waters couldn’t be accepted” @Jacob_Rees_Mogg #Brexit

Labour could win simply by promising a #Peoples Vote on the final deal which included an option to remain. They would get 90% of the Remain support and be home and dry. If voters didnt then like their policies they could be out in next election - while #Brexit is for a generation
Can anyone come up with a meaningful thought-through viable, evidenced reason as to why any #Brexit scenario makes sense?Please list reasons that aren't total bollocks like to take back control of our borders or we'll be better off..

British Government’s last gasp #Brexit strategy involves sidestepping Michel Barnier in an attempt to influence individual European leaders #BraceForImpact

My interview on #bbcdp about why the government’s position is causing deadlock in the #Brexit negotiations:
This column by @MollyMEP asks some truly disturbing questions about the agenda of @Nigel_Farage and other #Brexit warlords. It could be even worse than we thought:
No deal is better than a bad deal and the Prime Minister should stick to her promise:  #Brexit
We, the People, can stop #Brexit…. Yes, we can! 
The anti #FBPE sentiment comes from fear. We have the facts, we have the truth. They have lies and empty slogans.#brexit is crumbling therefore they either take responsibility or pass the blame.Guess which they doing.
The #FBPE "crowd" have one common objective and only one. That is to stop #BREXIT Others may describe this tag as something other, but quite simply they are wrong. So please, just stop these broad generalisations. You make youself look foolish.
So @realDonaldTrump wants a hard #Brexit too.   Incredible that a senior US official has such meetings but when will the penny drop that #Brexit isn’t about ordinary people ‘taking back control’ but about giving control to right wing millionaires ? 
Remember all those #Corbyn fans who turned on Tony Blair Labour supporters? Well it turns out Jez is very much a Red Tory. His support for divisive Tory #Brexit has been a disgrace to the party. Get him out and fight for the EU.
Too bad your Party supports #Brexit, which makes the NHS completely susceptible to privatisation. 
The time is fastly approaching for a full-on #Brexit leadership challenge @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @DavidDavisMP @LiamFox
Those Corbyn supporters attacking Remainers for being middle class are cynically pissing on the poor & vulnerable who will be the hardest hit by any #Brexit. They are also playing the same game as the right with its 'liberal metropolitan elite' rhetoric. #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit
NHS having to plan for a no deal #Brexit because UK Cabinet is split. May claims the country is behind #Brexit but her own Cabinet haven't agreed what it wants yet.How the hell can the UK be two years down the road and still bloody clueless about where it's going.#Shambles
No clue, no plan and no hope. That's the govts #Brexit strategy so far. Never have we witnessed such incompetence and mendacity from a British govt...it's time me for everyone to get behind a #PeoplesVote. Please sign the petition...and tell everyone you know..it's up to you now.
Media coverage of #Brexit in Britain is an absolute disgrace. The #BBC is leading the way in this appalling exercise, making it look as if leaving the EU poses a lethal threat to Britain. The militant liberal mafia that runs the media in Britain has lost all shame.
THREAD : #Brexit ain't what they promised: 1. It's costing us a fortune - not saving the £350m they promised we’d save and give to the #NHS
Another 6,000 jobs & £10m+ of #NHS tax revenue to go because of #Brexit we need a @peoplesvote_uk @EK_EuropeanMove @Labour4EU
Investment in UK car factories has nearly halved over the past year, as manufacturers react to prospect of being locked out of the single market after #Brexit. This is the true cost of a govt without direction #FBPE
This tweet says plenty about YOU. I'm a normal middle-aged English woman living in Edinburgh who thinks #Brexit is a disaster for Britain and will vote YES to Scottish independence if I get the chance.
Would point out to anyone dependent on medication such as insulin, it would be wise to start building a reserve stockpile. If we leave the EU without a deal then there is a very serious risk supplies could be interrupted. Don't bet your life on Tory dogma. #Brexit #diabetes
Some of my fellow remainers tell me these #brexit promises were lies but I say the promises if vote leave were a sacred pact with the British people which I would bet Boris Johnsons life on and any other #Brexit would be sacrilege
Yet more gobsmackingly incoherent #Brexit nonsense from IDS. Did having a trade deal with US (NAFTA) stop steel sanctions on Canada & Mexico? And if trade EU is “the critical issue” why leave customs union and single market? @dailypolitics

A very clear result on our #Brexitometer at the @UKLabour rally in Barry where @jeremycorbyn was speaking this afternoon.Labour supporters overwhelmingly think #Brexit is a disaster and want a #PeoplesVote on the final deal.#StopBrexit
Rational #Leavers, we respect your right to have voted to leave the EU, based on the information you were provided with. Now it is clear #Brexit is going to damage the UK,why not join us in asking for a final vote on the deal. You didn't vote to be poorer
Nurse! Nurse! He’s gone berserk and he’s got a phone!!! #Brexit
Mother of All SelloutsMrs May to propose Norway-style option with cabinet this week to keep UK tied to EU rules, grant EU citizens right to live & work in UK & obedience to #EU Court of Justice.AND 6 month Article 50 extension to delay #Brexit yet again.
The warning that #Brexit uncertainty threatens @Airbus investment in the UK should send alarm bells to the Govt that their chaotic approach to Brexit is costing jobs. It isn’t too late for @theresa_may to rediscover her inner Remainer, and grant the people a final #VoteontheDeal
Ahh yes, Kevin Hague. The man who spends weeks and months creating graphs to demonstrate how rubbish an independent Scotland would be. Yet completely ignores the economic catastrophe staring us in the face with #Brexit.  
A hollow promise, as it turns out #Brexit 
.@guardian: Unite members put pressure on @jeremycorbyn to support remaining in single market after #brexit as poll shows 3:1 thinking leaving will be bad for jobs, and well over half supporting a #PeoplesVote on final deal.

Waiting for #TheresaMay to come up with a coherent position on #Brexit is like waiting for Godot ...
My father has had two #NHS surgeries in the past 3 years - one for carpal tunnel syndrome & another for painful varicose veins. Both procedures vastly improved his quality of life. Neither will be available for free on the #NHS anymore. That's the #Brexit dividend at work.

#Brexit has damaged the Labour Party just as much as the Tories. Both main parties are currently paralysed, whilst our economy stutters, our public services fall apart and social tensions and intolerance are on the rise. This is tragic for our country
Labour leader @jeremycorbyn speaks to @SophyRidgeSky about #NHS funding, #Brexit and even #WorldCup fever. Tune in at 10am, @SkyNews #Ridge
Those rocking the boat should be careful what they cause. A Corbyn Government - with all is disastrous consequences - is never far away. #bbcsp #marr #brexit

“Now, against a background of an almost certifiable US president who has started a 1930s-style trade .. with his henchman Steve Bannon fomenting far-right unrest in eastern Europe, the very idea of our leaving the EU is, quite simply, baffling.” #Brexit 
Looks like @SkyNews & @BBCNews are basically @jeremycorbyn’s puppets now.That @SophyRidgeSky piece is appalling propaganda.The lengths that our "media outlets" will go to in the name of #Brexit is something else  
The fact that @theresa_may chooses to use the insulting language of @anna_Soubry against Ministers who are merely trying to ensure the Government delivers the #Brexit people voted for, is very disturbing.Unfortunate, May doesn't use the same type of rhetoric to #EU negotiators!
Theresa May’s Europe adviser was involved in a security breach that threatened to derail Britain’s negotiating position on #Brexit,

Forget the PM’s rhetoric on employment rights & protections post #Brexit. This is what the Tories are really up to  
This completely undermines the government and they shouldn’t be tolerating it. #Brexit

Blessed are the cheesemakers. Oh dear, this is #Brexit. 
The only detriment would be to the government's ability to lie flagrantly & repeatedly to the British people about the effects of #Brexit. 
Russia tried to influence US election so what about #brexit 
Apparently UK Govt’s current #Brexit plan is to go to individual  countries to try to explain  position:  (1/7)
My thoughts on the nonsense statement that #Brexit voters were less well-educated 
Why are these clowns seeing Barnier about #Brexit? Why is Barnier meeting them? 
Eh? Case to not amend Repeal Bill to give Parliament meaningful say on #Brexit in autumn 18 bcse it’ll topple May? 
The irony is, we know for a fact that the EU tried to influence the  #Brexit vote.
There’s not a hope this works. The UK isn’t offering enough. Trying to circumvent Barnier isn’t going to help. He’s not the problem. #brexit

Here's a screenshot of how it was going. Another Leaver deleted theirs the other day too. People no longer want #Brexit. 
There was so much fearmongering about what would happen to the UK if they pulled a #Brexit but they are thriving!
This is the subject list of Government #Brexit impact studies. They’re still refusing to publish the studies themselves. 
Leave voters really need to ask if this is what they wanted from #brexit. The EU protects your rights. Tories want to remove your rights.

Theresa May & David Davis issue a joint statement to clarify if MPs will or won't get a meaningful vote on any deal before #Brexit happens 
If #Brexit turns out badly, future electorates will, I think, be very unwilling to forgive our present Parliamentarians. /5
So MPs are not merely responsible to the current population, they are responsible to the generations their #Brexit decisions will impact /3
This is because unlike an election whose effect can be undone in 5 years, #Brexit, if it happens will affect people for decades to come. /2
Wrote about David Davis’ shenanigans on #Brexit for @independent
We asked @DExEUGov Sec of State @DavidDavisMP earlier to clarify when the Govt hopes to agree a transitional agreement with the EU  #Brexit

Excuse me Donalda/Sarah, but where are your @BBCScotlandNews piercing interviews with @RuthDavidsonMSP and @DavidMundellDCT on #Brexit mess?
Yet another example of the Government trying their best to avoid basic levels of Parliamentary scrutiny when it comes to #Brexit.

I've tabled a question demanding an answer on whether MPs will get a vote on any deal BEFORE #Brexit. Hoping @DavidDavisMP misspoke. #PMQs
Quite frankly the EU's attitude to the #Brexit negotiations is making a "no deal" the only option. 
Disappointed that despite numerous opportunities, SoS for Scotland couldn't name single power that's going to be devolved after #Brexit.
Despite asking Mundell 5 times to name a single power that will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament after #Brexit he failed to do so
In Scottish Qs, @DavidMundellDCT given six opportunities to name a single power coming to Holyrood after #Brexit, but cannot answer.
Do you think there is a problem with bias against #Brexit in Britain's Universities?Please vote in this poll:

Always felt that #Brexit campaign was based on outdated nostalgia, seems D Davis wants to re-create now defunct nations- what next, Prussia? 
We don’t know who pays IEA, Legatum, News-watch etc but clear they want no deal #brexit. These aren’t neutral think tanks. They’re lobbyists

#Brexit EU president @donaldtusk says the 27 countries must be united or be 'defeated'. So it's official. EU is at war with us
Let's face it, we are so deeply integrated in the EU that #Brexit is too complex. Like trying to sever a foot and hoping all will be well.

#Brexit is about reducing the prices of everyday items and improving the lives of people all over the country  
So it is not only me hitting a wall with that message #Brexit 
Plenty of reasons to cry over #Brexit, writes Michael Emerson. This "tyranny of the masses", for one thing.
Theresa May and her group of experts. #Brexit 
Not only that but #brexit supporters absolutely claimed we'd be better off, the nhs would get extra cash etc, all utter lies! 
Here is my brief interview with @rtenews talking about the impact of #Brexit onto @the3million & the #NHS 
#Brexit negotiations on financial settlement - priority issue, more progress needed #EUCO
The EU has given the "green light" to preparations for the second phase of #Brexit talks, dealing with trade 
today I had lunch with @MichelBarnier to discuss the latest issues re #Brexit - full admiration for his skilful handling of negotiations 
Talk of no deal has apparently spooked our friends on the continent, and rightly so.#Brexit
Yes, 17,410,742 people already voiced their decision loud & clear...That's 51.9% of the total vote to Leave all aspects of the EU and take back control of our economy, our borders & our laws.#Brexit #EU

Our #Brexit negotiating hand is very strongWhen @DavidDavisMP goes to negotiate with @MichelBarnier, he should remind him of the following

Agree. Decades of bile directed at immigrants, resulting in people believing it all to be true then thinking that was all #brexit was about
Juncker: No one explained to the British people what #Brexit really meant - Correct
EU Commission President @JunckerEU to reporters: "Nothing on #Brexit - because there is nothing to say."

Merkel calls #Brexit transition period "interesting idea, without any doubt". Let me translate: She's not convinced.
I ask Angela Merkel what effect UK political instability has on #brexit negotiations Not her job to comment on UK domestic politics she said

1. More astute observes will have noticed a subtle but significant shift in Tory rhetoric on WTO option #Brexit
1. Too much is being read in Merkel's #EUCO #Brexit comments. For balance let's see how the German/EU press is reporting today. (Thread)
£90 Billion to leave: EU cannot be serious!Picking a very large number & doubling it is an insult to UK taxpayers.#EU says it won’t negotiate a trade deal until UK coughs up a lots of money.I think that's called Blackmail...So glad to Leave#Brexit

What the OECD are criticising, very specifically, is #Brexit an identical policy of both Labour and Tory!! 
The #OECD is only stating the obvious. Calling off #Brexit would be good for the economy. Shot down by Brexiters as 'EU-funded'. Pathetic.
Can we just 'April fool' it? Or is it too late??? #Brexit

Don’t worry #Brexit will be fine. Boris and David Davis know more about economics than  the OECD. #SaidNoOneEver
The reason #TheresaMay can’t sort a deal on #brexit is because the #Brexiteers are deliberately stopping her:
Many Tories seem to think the government should be above the Law, whether the ECJ, ECHR or our own courts.#StopBrexit #Brexit #Remain /1
We have a PM who thinks seeking to test the legality of a govt action in court is subverting democracy. Fascists think like that. #Brexit 
Many Britons believe that there is no such thing as a successful #Brexit - or is it that we no longer count as belonging to the 'people'?

The @Telegraph on the £490bn hole in Britain's finances. Nearly HALF A TRILLION POUNDS. If this is anything like as bad as it looks, it's catastrophic for #Brexit 
Never forget. This man created #Brexit chaos because of an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all his mates (and f***ed off) 
People trying to blame @UKLabour for #Brexit seem to forget the FACTS exist. Lies won't work.Blame for #Brexit is w/ @Conservatives!
England is taking itself into the abyss with #Brexit. They cannot afford to worsen their predicament by losing ScotlandExpect dirty tactics
#r4today Humphrys keeps interrupting Ken Clarke. but sat open mouthed in wonder as John Redwood shook the #brexit bullshit tree

Theresa May heads to Brussels for talks with EU chief after #Brexit talks deadlock  via @WJames_Reuters @macdonaldrtr
Shocking indeed. This report from the @Telegraph reveals the perilous state of #Brexit Britain. Time to think again. 
Hillary Clinton: “Looking at the #Brexit vote now, it was a precursor to some extent of what happened to us in the United States.” How true.
The UK will grow at just half the global average and the euro area. The IMF says #Brexit means the outlook is now “highly uncertain” @Brexit
March of the patriots. #Brexit 
A look at Monday's paper: Foreign students exit after #Brexit; #Somalia aghast after truck bomb kills hundreds

Due to #Brexit, #Ophelia will not enter Northern Ireland until the British Gov. puts forward a suitable solution on cross-border travel.
"The apparent resilience of FDI flows shortly after Brexit was an illusion..." says normally loyal @Telegraph #Brexit #Truth @Open_Britain
Repeat after me.No. Deal. Hurts. The. UK. More. Than. The. EU.So no deal is an empty threat. Labour thankfully realises this. #brexit 
Unless this #Brexit Government is put out of its misery, the people of Britain will begin to see misery wreaked across  all sectors.
Well done Johnson, Gove, May, Leadsom, Fox and #brexit voters.£490bn - words fail me#StopBrexit #remain
Forget #Brexit worries - Ireland's just about to join Iceland... #StormOphelia
If you think the UK right didn’t use tools like that during #brexit and #indyref you’re out of your goddamned mind.
I am a @UKLabour voter. .@jeremycorbyn's position was "REMAIN & REFORM". Blame for #Brexit is entirely with @Conservatives. They own it.
#BREXIT Leave voters are you up for footing the difference in the UK's now diminished economy? How about a Leave voter tax?
The #Brexit border really is a hard border. Not even #Ophelia can get through.
In a strange twist #Ophelia has taken a position on the #brexit issue. Expecting customs checks it has decided not to cross the border 
Bad storm has accepted #Brexit and the new hard border. Shocking. 
On #BrexitPM position is "no deal is better than a bad deal."Labour’s ="A bad deal is better than no deal.”#Itsanegotiationstupid
"Britain is a legend in its own mind, and, to a great extent, the world lets it carry on dancing to its delusional beat of grandeur" #brexit 
To me #brexit still seems so absurd that I actually believe #superhero @albawhitewolf might be up to smth
The fact that #FailingGrayling is predicting no rise in food prices post-#Brexit should lead to a stampede to stockpile provisions.
Britain should not be intimidated by the EU’s empty posturing  #Brexit

In #Brexit news, there's this which is horrifying, for several complicated reasons 
Sainsbury's chairman David Tyler told the Sunday Times that a no-deal #Brexit could result in a 22% tariff on all EU food bought by Britain.
If @GladiatorsTV did #Brexit... *so* much more fun! #TheLastLeg
Crossparty MPs move to block May from signing ‘no deal’ #Brexit and throwing the UK over an economic cliff edge. 
EU negotiators do not seem concerned about the damage they could do to EU exporters  #Brexit
How mad is a #brexit no deal? Just imagine if Salmond said in 2014 "We can't agree with the UK, we'll crash out &  just grow more food"

#Labour admit today they would accept any #Brexit deal offered by the #EU, however punishing. Great negotiating. 
Just ask yourself, does #Brexit help or hinder?  
Europeans I spoke to all universally thought #Brexit was mad, bad and sad. But they all also moving on without us. What a waste of the UK 
BREAKING: Chris Grayling Unveils Radical New #Brexit Strategy 
Sainsbury's #Brexit food price warnings assume UK would choose to impose tariffs on EU imports, rather than cut them on imports from RoW.
UK universities need clarity on #Brexit research now, says @aberdeenuni v-c Ian Diamond
UK imports 40% of its food - that's a lot of digging #Brexit 
So shopping for food at Sainsbury's could be 22% more expensive if "No Deal" #Brexit & WTO Tariff's. What bit don't you get .@theresa_may ?
Richard Tice - "The economy is doing much better than people give it credit for. We need leaders in the Cabinet to sell the story." #Brexit

We are truly boned unless we stop #Brexit or go for #ScotRef before we leave the EU. Important lessons to learn too.
Nerves fray as the #Brexit clock counts down, negotiations stall and the possibility of a no deal scenario grows 
Real possibility of the Tory Party collapsing in next few yearswith perfect storm of #Brexit, failing public services & falling membership

The complexity of #Brexit negotiations lie within the EU not wanting a viable solution, such is their worry about the UK succeeding outside. 
Boris Johnson tells EU:"We're looking for some urgency from our friends and partners, time to put a bit of a tiger in the tank and get this thing done!"Sounds Grrrrreeeat!Let's get this #Brexit thing done!Sooner the better...

For the avoidance of doubt:.@jeremycorbyn is not to blame for #Brexit. It belongs to .@David_Cameron & the .@Conservatives. Their mess.
Failed #brexit talks: there are 27 of them and 1 of us. Their market is 435m, ours 65m. EU is super powerful. That's why we are better In. 
What #EU super girl (@albawhitewolf) says happened in the #Brexit presser earlier. [Disclaimer: I am wearing a boring suit today] 
'We are not asking for "concessions". #Brexit is not about concessions on citizens' rights, Ireland or financial settlement.' @MichelBarnier
In the light of today's statement by @MichelBarnier @theSNP Westminster leader @IanBlackfordMP #PMQ yesterday was particularly apt #brexit

My cartoon Thursday @TheTimes...... #TheresaMay aka Dr Dolittle faces both ways on #Brexit and #Remain
Leaving EU without a trade deal will cost £400bn (£11,500 per person) by 2030#brexitwontwork#stopbrexit#brexit
‘Go ahead EU - make our day!'74% of Britons believe no deal on Brexit is better than a bad deal.Not surprising as we are leaving a corrupt, dysfunctional & obsolete protectionist regime.Sooner we are out, the better...#Brexit
I’m “fanatical” in putting our country’s interests first & foremost - #Brexit deal with economy & our children’s future at its heart
Remember Remainers anytime you embrace #annasoubry to the cause, she thinks the Daily Mail a responsible newspaper. #Brexit
Why shouldn't they be published @theresa_may @Conservatives we have a right to see the #Brexit Economic Impact Assessment reports. 
"We've reached a state of deadlock which is very disturbing". — EU's Michel Barnier on #Brexit bill. 
Thursday Morning Briefing- NAFTA discussions continue- #Brexit talks stall- Delta refuses to pay CSeries tariff
Meetings between Legatum and government ministers and DExEU officials. Thanks @JXB101. #Brexit 
Nigel Lawson says that what Hammond is doing is 'complete sabotage' & that Anna Soubry is a 'complete fanatic'. Well said. #Brexit #bbcdp
.@richardbranson's #Brexit strategy: Wait for Leave voters to die, then rejoin EU. 
Legatum a tax-haven based 'charity' plugging hard #Brexit & advising the government 
If UK does escape (hard) #brexit @MikeH_PR will deserve some kind of medal for his work on exposing Russian bots. An almost infinite task
Nick Clegg's wife on the #BBCDP actively trying to undermine the UK's #Brexit negotiations.Which I'm willing to bet is exactly what the #BBC called her on to do!
"We need to break the deadlock... then can make progress fairly swiftly on other matters" - @MichelBarnier  #Brexit 
#Brexit deadlocked. EU will not make concessions on Citz rights, NI border, EU bill. Ball still with the UK. 
"No deal would be a very bad deal" - EU's chief #Brexit negotiator @MichelBarnier 
"We're ready and well prepared to start those discussions" on future relations after #Brexit, @DavidDavisMP says 
Help us to #StopBrexit! Support our crowdfunder for the East of England rally against #Brexit this Saturday 
"Disturbing deadlock" over Britain's financial contributions - EU's chief #Brexit negotiator @MichelBarnier 
Leader of the House refuses to make time available for a debate to allow Ministers to set out the cost to taxpayers of #Brexit. Shameful!
#Brexit  Michel Barnier  We have done a lot of talking this week and as usual we are no further forward despite the great expense.
Suggestion: Stop calling it "No Deal." Start calling it "No flights," or "No cancer treatments," or any of the other things we lose. #Brexit

The Guardian view on the return of PMQs: a microcosm of what’s wrong (with #Brexit) 
The harsh reality of #Brexit becomes clearer every day. Nearly every recent poll shows a majority against leaving the EU. 
Brexiters will be celebrating talented EU migrant musicians are leaving. #Brexit means a small minded narrowing view of the world. 
WTF is "enhanced equivalence"?#Brexit 
Currently in Australia, the supermarket shelves are stacked with British products, malls filled with British shops and products. Hard to see what benefits will a post #Brexit trade deal with Australia bring, especially as Aus has a population smaller then metropolitan Tokyo.

Caught end of  for 1st in many, many years. Strikes me this way of framing life (and politics) is part of #brexit problem
I like @PeteNorth303's factual tweets. He's knowledgeable and unsentimental about #brexit. His disinterest in the human effects is chilling.
Calm down Jezza. You’re never getting in mate #Labour #Brexit 
The Government's own forecasters says #Brexit has already cost the Treasury £900 million in lower tax receipts 
#Leave voters have been deceived on the cost of #brexit .    It’s wasting money, not bringing it in for the #NHS or anything else.
BREAKING:#TrumpRussia probe investigating #CambridgeAnalytica.Mercer's #BigData firm also probed for #Brexit !
Opportunity to erase the #Brexit  stain; history will show 'the will of the people' was nothing more than a right-wing gerrymandered lie.

A blindly defiant PM, Mogg & handful of backbench loons will be only ppl left who think #brexit will actually happen.The end game has begun
Wow. This is what happens when Political parties feed voters BS. Britain could get *very* unstable in coming years #brexit 
#Brexit never shot anyone. IRA killers hiding in Republic of Ireland shot people. Take that plank out of your eye.
Hoping once again to wake up tomorrow to discover that #Brexit was nothing but a very bad dream. Very bad.
Beats me how anyone can think it's worth wasting 1 more second on the madness that is #Brexit. Total insanity. #StopBrexitNow @theresa_may
Two minutes ago, right in the heart of Cambridge, right across from University centre, v middle-class white guy in big flash car exitin Doubletree Hilton trying to get past my tiny Micra on a narrow road: '"Why don't you go back to your own country?"  No doubt #Brexit #LeftBehind
Bottom line. A Leader would risk being unseated  as Leader of her Party & no longer PM . Share the #Brexit #RiskAssessment with The People.
Just realised there's a Barnier/ David Davis presser tomorrow. So..that'll be another day of non stop Brexit. Nooooooo ! #brexit #overload
I'm selling this house. No more information available. You can't see it before you buy, but trust me, it's good.Bit like #Brexit really  
Quit the Single Market & how do we attract foreign investment? Answer, low tax, low regulation, low welfare. Right wing Tory heaven!#Brexit
Total chaos in Government over #Brexit with successive Ministers contradicting each other about no deal contingency planning #Brexitshambles
With 120 MPs I've written to @DavidDavisMP asking him to publish the economic impact studies of leaving the EU. #Brexit #EdinburghSouthWest
Everyone, no matter how pro #Brexit knows that #nodeal is economic suicide, except Russian Agent #farage#StopStupid #StopBrexit
I'd suggest that unless you personally will be impacted, you don't really have the right to say "#Brexit has a price worth paying"?
Do you think that Brexit will affect the UK commitments on climate change as part of the Paris Agreement? #Brexit #climatechange #COP21
Funny, #Leave campaign said #Brexit would SAVE money (which wld all go to the #NHS).Turns out it costs a fortune...
Bbc reporting ‘victory for brexiters’ over funding for no deal rather than ‘chancellor says Uk flights could be grounded’. Once more journalism focusing on #brexit theatre over detail
This shouldn’t be a big ask: MPs, forget about your career ambitions & political tribalism for a moment & vote for the country, end #Brexit!
There are hundreds of EU funded improvement projects, like this one in #Margate, all over the country. But you’d never know it. #Brexit

Pity you support #Brexit as much as the most ardent Tory Brexiteers. @johnmcdonnellMP
Nicky you serve no purpose to #Brexit other than to thwart, your refusal to acknowledge the will of the people is evident to all. 
Tories are in meltdown over #Brexit. Seeing it unravelling, they're blaming the electorate for making a binding decision, when it never was.
#LordsQs Is govt preparing British farmers for the flood of competing products in wake of no deal on #Brexit? asks @SarahLudford
Predictable that #brexit from CFP not as simple as #Brexiteers portrayed: 
The idea that the Tory right are fanatically pushing hard #Brexit in the interests of ordinary people, is mind blowingly stupid.#StopBrexit
If you want a low-tax, low-welfare, low-regulation paradise for the rich, then back #Brexit, otherwise fight it!#StopBrexit #Remain
I make no bones about it. With #Trump, #Brexit and inequality rising like flood water, I am afraid for our futures. 
Very pleased to support @DavidLammy & @SeemaMalhotra1 demanding to see the Government's #brexit impact studies. Time ministers come clean.

Can we spend the money on a second #brexit referendum instead?

Once again, it's left to @IanBlackfordMP to hold the PM's feet to the fire on #Brexit... #PMQs
Thanks @IanBlackfordMP! At least someone is questioning govt on #Brexit and a second referendum #PMQs

Disgraceful that the Government threatens a no deal #Brexit without preparing the NHS for the consequences

How can anyone trust the Tories with #Brexit? May’s Deputy says UK would have been better off voting Remain 
PM won't confirm if she'd vote for #Brexit. Let's have a Vote on the Deal, then she'll be forced to make up her mind. #exitfrombrexit
It is clear now that #UKIP is the only party that can be trusted with #Brexit. 
PM refuses to say she'd vote leave. Chancellor won't budget for 'no deal' & 1st Sec of State says this. Gov't can't be trusted with #Brexit! 
This is , in a nutshell, the core #Brexit problem - the belief in the British right wing establishment that the world revolves round them. 
Mrs May's second in command, Damian Green, told Newsnight "it would have been" better had the country voted Remain. So why support #Brexit?
The new Government White Papers underline just how far from ready we are for a #Brexit no deal 
Brexit is a chance to unlock politics. Britain will be a better place to live. #Brexit

If people are still doubting @Theresa_May’s commitment to #Brexit then they should remember that she just suspended two Conservative MEP’s for voting to block progress. She’s 100% committed to implementing the will of the people & the media needs to stop playing silly games.

4) pain free #Brexit was always a fantasy, but the real complex, phased, compromise based #Brexit that they supported would never have won
2) However, #Brexit was *always* about populism, because no-one was ever going to vote for the reality

Before I'd even noticed Shetland #Brexit piece was live, @Daily_Express had ripped the story off, selectively quoting for headline 'We want freedom!’ Shetland fishermen urge Remainer authorities stop seas being plundered
It was more centralisation, more socialisation, which led to the #Brexit referendum in the first place. 
#Brexit: not enough progress on citizens' rights, Northern Ireland and money, #EPlenary tells European Council 
Davis is already planning to jump ship as #Brexit is such a complete disaster.

Today's vote in #EPlenary on #brexit negotiations isn't binding but shows political temperature of EP which needs to approve final deal. 
So are millions of us. If UK Govt don't even know what #Brexit is then why are they doing it to us?

I'm really worried about the lack of clarity & disunity on the other side of the negotiation table. #Brexit

As predicted the Tories want #Brexit to undermine things like environmental protection, employment rights, building standards, food safety.. 
#BBCNews blaming #BRexit for the Monarch collapse despite the CEO of Monarch saying it was the loss of their Egypt and Med markets.
.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg extolls the benefits of #Brexit at one of the busiest fringe meetings of the @Conservatives' Party Conference. #CPC17 
This is why the political left who voted for #Brexit have made a very serious mistake. It's a libertarian's dream ticket 
Apart from being the arch defender of #Brexit, my earnest wish is for UKIP displace Labour as the party to represent all hardworking people. 
Please RT if you love Jacob Rees Mogg! #Brexit 
For #EU, calling #Brexit referendum was bad idea. Catalonia showed squashing referendum cd be worse. @POLITICOEurope
The appalling attitude in Brussels towards Britain leaving the #EU has created such a toxic atmosphere of distrust that leaving is inevitable and reversing #Brexit impossible.
John Redwood MP: Commiserations to #Catalonia"Today I am proud to be British and to be leaving the #EU."#Brexit
Not a single tangible benefit of #Brexit in this, just a lot of jingoistic, nostaligic drivel: blah blah, Agincourt, blah blah Waterloo. 
Peter Bone MP - “The only people who really think #Brexit should go 2 years are those people who are trying to keep us in the EU." 
Boris Johnson was justified in laying down his #Brexit red line. What Britain needs is boldness, not prevarication. 
#EPlenary debate on #Brexit talks tomorrow morning. Live  from 9am CET
Michael Gove has claimed that Britain will be able to export more unpierced pigs’ ears after #Brexit…This is priceless#NeverTrustaTory
Gerard Batten MEP - Britain's establishment is seeking to draw out the #Brexit process for as long as possible 
Monarch failed largely as a result of falling pound post #Brexit vote. 1,858 staff redundant. Well done #Leavers
@theresa_may makes her crucial speech tomorrow. I say be brave, bold and make #Brexit work. Prepare for no deal. 
We declared war on Germany, assembled alliance, fought global campaigns, secured victory in a shorter time than #Brexit! @theresa_may????
It's all the predictable remain MP's calling for Boris to resign. They will never forgive him for delivering #Brexit to Britain
For Andrea Leadsom, #Brexit is a great opportunity......to create a deregulated, low-tax environment for hedge funds. 
Monarch blames the collapse of the business on the collapse of the Pound #brexit idiots at least we have got our country back innit 
This would be merely laughable if it wasn’t a serious thought from one of the key UK Ministers demanding a hard #Brexit.

The majority have yet to grasp that the govt is mishandling #Brexit because you cannot do a good job implementing a mess of lies & delusions
The #Leave option was a catch-all slogan which covered a huge mess of incompatible and mostly completely unworkable proposals.#Brexit /1
1. Another cornerstone of Toryboy #Brexit folly is the assumption that the world has been in stasis for thirty years.
Shocking #revolvingdoors: Lobby firm hires ex-EU official for insider know-how to support businesses through #Brexit

This really is worrying -- that NI peace process should be considered a price worth paying for #Brexit.

Is it, though? Spain claims Gibraltar, harasses its residents, and hasn't said anything helpful on #Brexit – so why sell out on Catalonia? 
#Monarch selling return flights to European destinations for 30 quid and go bust .... but, hey let's blame #Brexit

#monarchairlines : the fall in the exchange rate of the £ after #brexit referendum was a factor in its demise  #Monarch #BrexitReality
Perhaps the first of many #Brexit casualties - working people paying a high price for an argument between two wings of our ruling class! 
Hammond is essentially saying #Brexit will damage Britain so let’s put it off as long as we can @BBCr4today
We should be under no illusions. The devaluation of the £ following the #Brexit vote is a direct contributing factor to #Monarch's demise.
Now #openaccess: Paper by @Nickf72 @martinmckee et al on likely impact of #Brexit on UK health / NHS. Grim reading.

How is this an "EU crisis"? Any opportunity to blacken the name of the EU by desperate & mendacious rightwing press. Sad & pathetic. #Brexit 
Strange how the #Brexit demonstrations have received more coverage in the press and on the TV in Europe than in the UK. #ToriesControlMedia
#Brexit is a tragedy, made worse by an incompetent PM. But the real tragedy is having an opposition leader as wedded to Brexit as the gov.
#r4today #Monarch collapse due to falling pound. In other words, because of #Brexit. I wonder how many customers voted Brexit?
NOW #MONARCH GOES BUST!One of Britain's largest #airlines @Monarch is reported to have ceased trading, apparently put out of business by the government's #BREXIT and the massive fall in the value of the #Pound since the #UK's #EU #Referendum

It's a democratic right to campaign to change any policy. Leavers who can't respect this should kindly leave the country. #Brexit

Italy has been governed incredibly badly for the last twenty years. Its economic woes are due to its own mismanagement not the EU nor the Euro. Britain has now joined Italy in both the bad government and poor economic performance league.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
@acgrayling on #CarryonBrussels shaming himself with behaviour truly beneath him. Horrific example of self serving, sanctimonious, I know better than the little people mentality that led to #Brexit in the first place
Quite. Brexit wasn’t debated properly, lies were told, rules were broken. So much we know. But that’s politics. What really matters is that the Brexiteer fanatics have failed to make ONE positive step forward or name ONE benefit of #Brexit. The game’s up. It’s failed. Cancel it. 
It was tough but it was wonderful because so many of the working class had experienced Europe because of the war and understood, it was better for Britain to be part of the continent than an island onto herself. #Brexit 
Dear #IainDuncanSmith We will not live with your #brexit. We will not find somewhere else to live (this may prove tricky since you are intent on removing our freedom of movement. We will fight to save our country from the insanity you & your ilk seek to impose on us. #StopBrexit

Untrue to say that France is blocking “#Brexit deal on security”. 1. Future relation is negociated by @EU_Commission, with full support of -all- EU27.2. France wanted the UK to opt-back-in the Prüm system in the past. Absurd to think we would like the UK out of it now.

Prior to the EU referendum, @hmtreasury warned that we would face an unprecedented recession if we voted for #Brexit. Now, Graham Gudgin and I argue, HMRC has overstated the cost of being outside the customs union by £18bn. Our analysis for @reactionlife.
I think #GeorgeSoros is confusing what's best for Britain with what's best for him. The Brits have already chosen their menu: a full English & a viagra #Brexit. Don't like it, you know where the door is. 
If #Brexit is negated there will be a collapse of faith in democracy and probable civil unrest beyond anyone’s experience. The EU is the enemy of democracy. Its contempt for voters will prove its epitaph.

#Brexit has completely divided  the country on the most important event in Britain in the last half-century and Labour’s answer is to copy the Tories’ policy. What.
Well worth a read- the final sentence is oh so true! @ConHome #brexit

1. I get irritated by people saying the #Brexit referendum was too vague. It was a simple vote on EU membership. What is vague about that. If you don;t know what it entails then it's your obligation as a citizen to find out.
The Telegraph is trying to sell Italians disagreeing with Italians as a “European coup”. There is no end to the dishonesty of the #brexit tendency. 
When I think about #Brexit, which I try not to do, because it's depressing, I think about the appalling politicians who are backing it, the nasty far right parties in Europe who back it and then. most frighteningly, the 51.8% of British people who voted for it.
Nicola Sturgeon has violated the devolution settlement and the constitution?May we ask, has the Holyrood Opposition @ScotTories raised this matter?What does the Govt say, @10DowningStreet?The British people need answers.#Brexit 
Never forget. This man asked people to vote on #Brexit. Without defining what Brexit meant. Without carrying out any projections of consequences. All in an (unsuccessful) attempt to settle an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted his mates and f***ed off into the sunset.

My take on the deep difference between the #Irish referendum #RepealedTheEighth & the #Brexit ref- the contrast between both exercises in direct democracy could not have been starker

"PEOPLE ARE GETTING ANGRY" - We've just published a reader's letter to his MP about @theresa_may and #Brexit.  Do you agree with him?  Read it here: 
The choice was either #Brexit, or, #Indyref2.Now it’s about @RuthDavidsonMSP as PM.If there weren’t enough reasons to go Independent there are now!Never been affiliated to any Party but signing up with the #SNP now.
Tory MP's are running scared of #Brexit If the Chair Northern Ireland Select Committee @AWMurrison  can't answer this simple question then let the people answer it. #PeoplesVote@terrychristian @acgrayling @dontbrexitfixit @damocrat @lunaperla @WriterInPyjamas
1/ Another thing which was part of this #repeal campaign and which upends the whole #Brexit #Trump campaigns is that knowledgeable, dare I say expert,voices were heard. Women told their stories of experience under the 8th and were heard, lawyers outlined the chilling legal effect
The tide is turning. The British people won't be fooled forever. Dr Andrew Murrison, MP for South West Wiltshire, is just the first - all parliamentary Brexiters will be running away, denying they're MPs and washing their hands of #Brexit before long. #StopBrexit .@SODEMAction
Great news from the courageous @Anna_Soubry . I’m asking if my MP will join us on #peoplesmarch on Saturday 23 June. Why not ask if your MP will ? #FBPE #WATON #Brexit 
Sturgeon claimed Scotland was being "dragged out of Europe against our will" Funny in the #GrowthCommission report there is NO COMMITMENT WHATSOEVER TO APPLYING TO JOIN THE EU STURGEON IS AN OPPORTUNIST, ANTI-DEMOCRAT FRAUDSTER,  OF THE VERY HIGHEST ORDER #indyref2 #Brexit
Dominic Lawson correctly points out that #Brexit is being led by Remainers.We have a PM who doesn't believe in Brexit, we need a full-on Brexit leadership challenge, not another general election. 
#RETWEET & #SHARE If you think like me that the time has come for our PATHETIC #PM @theresa_may to #RESIGN! #TheresaMay is undermining #BREXIT & #BRITAIN! This #POLITICAL #LIAR & #FRAUDSTER must GO! #MayMustGO #BBC #SKY #LBC @LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress #Tory #ConservativeParty #UK
Daniel Hannan and Nigel Farage are kryponite to journalism. They are where truth goes to die, and where decades of lying have no real consequence. Why? Because they have done nothing with their political lives. Until #Brexit. Which they have royally fucked up 
Can we please stop dissing twitter for being an echo chamber? Looking at #8thref hashtags during debates showed huge support, just like looking at #brexit hashtags during UK debates revealed large Brexit support. If you know what you are looking at, twitter is extremely revealing
Fantastic to speak just now to 400 young #Brexit and #Nexit supporters in Amsterdam. And what a pleasure to reach the venue by canal with my friend @thierrybaudet.
After The #Brexit vote split the country in two and arguments could be heard loudly up and down the country, it’s taken Liverpool to reach the Champions League final to finally unite everyone again in the desperate hope that they lose to Real Madrid.
This #Referendum was so different to the #Brexit exercise. It was proceeded by debate in a Citizens Assembly, followed by  a thorough deliberation in a parliamentary committee & only then did the Gov go to the people. Medical experts played a big role. Proud to be Irish. 
John Mills:We had a referendum in 2016.We were told by Govt parliament would respect result.Now they want to reverse it.What is democracy about if it is not taking a decision & then implementing it.Customs Union is effectively in Single Market#Brexit
Having been lucky enough to work and travel extensivley through Europe I can say that sharing EU citizenship is wonderful.Fornm those that doubt me. I suggest jumping on a plane and going somewhere other than the Costa del sol.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
To all patriot Brexiters. Serious questions.Why are you persisting with your desire to leave the EU when it is clear that this route is causing economic harm? Aren't you all patriots. Why do you want to hurt the country and fellow citizens so much?#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
A matter close to my heart ... we've got a good, thriving #film industry in Britain. We can all take pride in its achievements. It does a great job showcasing British imagination, creativity and technical skills. Why on earth would we want to sacrifice it on the #Brexit altar? 
You've got a fucking nerve @jeremycorbyn - even your own members have no voice on #Brexit because of your thick-headedness.. What Ireland needs is for you to do your job and oppose this madness.

Michael Portillo:Govt allowed Irish issue to dominate Brexit"This suits British civil service, who never wanted to #Leave EU in the first place, it suits EU & it suits the Irish.I also think it is now beginning to suit the Prime Minister!"#Brexit #EU
I hope the #hometoveote hashtag has inspired young people that voting is a precious thing, and that they absolutely must make the effort if their voice is to be heard... reference the #Brexit referendum.
In a very crowded field this #brexit article stands head and shoulders above the rest in its insanity.Oh & btw Prometheus ended in eternal torment... 
This is why us supporting #Brexit must keep the faith. Message sent to me from a #Remainer 'Can you imagine being so thick you're still cheerleading brexit after all we know now? You wonder if there's some kind of mental impairment' #BrexitBritainsBestYearsLayAhead
The UK has dropped from the top of the G7 to the bottom & is hovering just above recession at 0.1% growth. #DespiteBrexitThis has nothing to do with #Brexit, of course. All the blame must be placed on couple of days of snow. The wrong type of leaf will be blamed post-Brexit. 
EU says #Brexit talks going nowhere - are we really surprised? This government is out of touch, out of ideas and out of time #FBPE
We have a prime minister who can't even bring herself to say that she believes in #Brexit.
Is it just me or is May's government creating chaos and economic meltdown in Britain in order to derail #Brexit  ? People from all over the place are telling me about a break down of  law and order, rocketing crime, dramatic fall of living standards and  growing racial tensions.
Great to be in Lisbon meeting w/ President @marcelorebelo_, Prime Minister @antoniocostapm and FM Santos Silva. Time is running short. Need to finalise the Withdrawal Agreement w/ an agreed backstop for Ireland/Northern Ireland. Realism is needed on future relationship. #Brexit 
New polling analysis shows big swing from Leave to Remain across almost all demographic groups.People have changed their minds.This is why the #Brexit fanatics & the right-wing media backing them will fight tooth & nail to prevent a #PeoplesVote.
Another crazy #Brexit week! Bozo wants a new jet but his blue passport & leaving without a deal means he won't be able to fly it! The yearly cost of Brexit per household is 15 times the cost of EU membership & STILL no money for the #NHS! Time for a rethink? #FridayWisdom #SODEM
After two years of uncertainty across all walks of life in the UK - of course #Brexit is the cause and Brexit politicians must be held responsible, it’s time for all MPs to wake up and smell the coffee.   
Great analysis of #Brexit and the Media: summary "the EU debate and vote was not one about democracy, but one about who controls and disseminates the information." 
One million Labour voters who backed Leave in the #Brexit referendum are having second thoughts. Exclusive analysis of 23,000 respondents polled by YouGov in my latest blog for @prospect_uk
Michael Portillo - "The British Government has managed to allow itself to be convinced that the Irish issue has to dominate #Brexit."This suits the British civil service, who never wanted to leave the EU in the first place, it suits the EU and it suits the Irish." 
Note that Labour blames austerity, but not #Brexit for the poor economic performance. Labour is shamefully colluding with the Tories in pretending #Brexit isn't harming the economy. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Michael Portillo - "It is the Government's duty to deliver #Brexit and apparently it’s the idea of the Lords and lots of people in the Conservative Party to frustrate that."Beware the wrath of the electorate if you do frustrate it." 
UK growth confirmed at a 5 year low of 0.1% in the first quarter, with business investment falling by 0.2%. As predicted #Brexit is hitting both growth and investment  #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
But @jeremycorbyn you advocate quitting the Single Market which would mean a hard border. So are you just spouting pleasing but incoherent drivel or is it that you're pushing for a united Ireland? #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
Seeing how recalcitrant EU has been in the #Brexit talks,the best thing the PM can do to restore trustwith the British people is to walk out of the talks,giving her huge popularity among voters.Or is May's real aim the destruction of the Tory party and British democracy? 
'Who reads the papers?' #YesPrimeMinister #Brexit 
Fantasy thinking from the Govt over #brexit. You cannot be out of the customs union and single market and have frictionless trade across the Irish border #bbcdp
The man who wrote Article 50 confirmed today that it can be revoked. If you are one of the 73% of #Labour supporters who think #Brexit was a mistake, there is still time to change party policy and the direction of the country. Join us:

More people are coming out in support of a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. This time? Lord John Kerr, the architect behind Article 50.
Do you think that your future should be in YOUR hands, not those of MPs? @Anna_Soubry thinks so, even though she's an MP! That's why she will march for a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal on June 23Pledge to march with us at . It's OUR turn to make history
Question on ballot paper was unambiguousCampaigning exhaustive, lasting 6 monthsWe knew exactly what voting #Leave meantWe would retake control:OUR bordersOUR lawsOUR territorial watersOUR national destinyProject Fear did its worst & Failed#Brexit
Wasn’t Brexit going to help fund the NHS? So why all the talk from the Gov about £2000 tax per head to keep the NHS afloat?  ANOTHER one of those shitty promises the Brexiters made to the public that’s now been abandoned? #Brexit, #StopBrexit

Just for clarity, every #Brexit supporting minister has been dead wrong on pretty much everythingHow can anyone with any sense still support Brexit? 
great intervention by the man behind #article50 Lord John Kerr - #Brexit is reversible - and the people should get their say @peoplesvote_uk #PeoplesVote
Brexiters claim to be non-elite. And they're right, what ordinary chap wouldn't have a nanny, ponce around in a top hat and have a wife who is going to inherit around £150m. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
One of the many things I don't get about, #brexit is how brexiters manage to 1/ live in a manifestly deluded fantasy world 2/ be so angry bitter and unhappy. Surely living in a fantasy world should make you happy
‘Britain must remain in a customs union to avoid devastating job losses’ Yawn!! More, boring, Project Fear predictions from employers, car makers & aerospace. Where’s their sense of adventure? #Brexit #LetsGoGlobal etc etc
A hugely impressive contribution to a debate not caused by, but made sharper and more urgent by, the #Brexit process and the damage it will - beyond doubt - do to Scotland . We can do better but #Brexit will make things worse. 
“Chinese academic forced to leave Oxford as Home Office refuses temporary visa for her baby”.It’s not “global Britain” but rather post #brexit UK increasingly mean smaller place.What have we done?

Met true heroes of the peace process in NI tonight:  community workers engaging for a still fragile peace. Deeply impressed by their enduring commitment to building trust & relationships. They are worried about future after #brexit and feel not sufficiently heard where needed.
#bbcqt  oh dear @Anna_Soubry you say the cabinet is divided, along with the opposition, on #Brexit . So what. The citizens of the uk gave you a mandate, a clear majority mandate, to leave the the EU. Just do it will you or resign.

We are Europe. I can’t get over how many British politicians have smirked, scoffed or been aghast when I’ve said that to them. Once they accept this is an EU-UK negotiation & that the EU is one, we might get somewhere on #Brexit 
No supporter of the Conservative Party #Brexit policy on #BBCQT tonight. They don't even try to hide their Remainer bias anymore.

I'm afraid so many normally sensible colleagues seem to have lost their grip on reality. If #Brexit isn't working out as you expect surely you need to stand back and think what to do next rather than bullying everyone to follow a failing course 
EU officials tear into UK’s ‘fantasy’ Brexit negotiating strategy as talks turn bitter There's no way the EU can let May get away with a #Brexit fudge & no way sensible citizens should either. There's no compromise in this #BrexitShambles. #StopBrexit

THE UK should remain in the Galileo programme after #Brexit because they have contributed a tremendous amount to the development, a Hungarian minister declared
Because of the #GDPR, we need to re-consent to all important issues. For this reason, there will be a new referendum on #Brexit, to ensure that it still has the consent of the people.
Behind the scenes and political cover of a huge row over Galileo, the government is preparing a big #Brexit U-turn
Fascinating slide published by the EU #Brexit Task Force on Tuesday.  It shows all the checks and controls needed for goods entering, transiting or leaving EU.  Scored out are the issues that a #CustomsUnion alone would address.   Shows that the #SingleMarket is essential ….
So the Russians didn’t fix it for Brexit but the Hungarian is putting £6.5 million into wrecking it! #Soros #Brexit

For once in a generation the British people made the right choice and voted for #Brexit , in the face of a ruthless propaganda against it waged by their government in cahoots with the EU, and still traitors who are infesting the British political establishment refuse to accept it
#Brexit costs update. Cost of settlement: £39 billion. Bank of England lost growth to date  estimate: £25 billion. Hmrc estimate of no customs union deal: £20 billion. Estimate cost of relocation and resupply deals ( oliver wyman) £27 billion. Cumulatively these are huge numbers!

#Brexit Can the usual crybabies stop crying  about Brexit everyday FFS. We voted 17 million voted leave the EU. We’re leaving  The Customs Union & The Single Market OK. It’s never ending morning noon & night. Stop trying to derail Brexit. Your boring 17 million to death. 
Michael Gove says #Brexit has made Britain more welcoming to migrants. Back in the real world it has given succour to racists who use the vote to shout 'Leave' to anyone who debunks their bigotry 
17) finally, much of what has been said about #Brexit, but particularly by Brexiters is nonsense.In leaving we trade one set of "upsides" for a significant set of downsides. Only by confronting those as a nation can we get to a realistic and worthwhile decision
The headlines in the right-wing press are not about facts, they are about creating the fear, hatred and paranoia that will stop people listening to reasons and will make them automatically distrust Remainers. They are headlines that destroy democracy.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
On my way to Dublin. Straight forward agenda: #Brexit consultations and border visit. Curious to see the invisible. 
It’s Thursday.Arthur Schopenhauer:“Mostly it is loss which teaches us the worth of things.”Let’s not go that far, let’s call off #Brexit now.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote
9) ... there are 3 major standard setters in the world today, the EU, the US & China.  Pretty much everyone else has to align with one or more of those to trade.We will have to align with the EU, regardless of what #Brexit we undertake, but we will have no say in those regs.
Please let’s not jeopardise Mo’s achievement #brexit 
‘Brexited out’ - the phrase used by a father to describe the hollowing out of the nursery my child attends. Today’s news at the gate - a Spanish family leaving for #Frankfurt because of #Brexit - our everyday lives less joyful and rich for it. I am profoundly sad. #StopBrexit
Mathematics is not my strongest subject, but it seems to me that if you want #brexit and an effective #nhs you will have to pay at least £2900 a year extra tax.That #bluepassport is quite expensive isn't it?
This needs wide coverage. The cost to UK businesses of the #Brexit customs arrangement favoured by the Brexiters would be £17bn to £20bn a year. It's the head of HMRC saying this!That means a squeeze on incomes of families, job losses and less money for the NHS.#ExitfromBrexit
#Brexit can't be allowed to undermine the Good Friday Agreement - the easiest and sure way to avoid a hard border in Ireland and help preserve peace, is to stay as we are! 
Soros, Soubry, Juncker etc have proven Tony Benn right.The EU is anti-democratic. That's why people voted #Brexit - to get their Country back  
Each day brings us closer to #Brexit with no meaningful progress on critical issues. The decision to trigger #A50 with such indecent haste - with no consensus, preparation or plan - is surely the most catastrophically stupid political decision of our lifetime. #PeoplesVote
Cheerful news to wake up to this morning: "Scottish court told #Brexit could be unilaterally halted" #StopBrexitSaveBritain!  via @telegraphnews
The latest ComRes Poll shows the House of Lords are not popular right now - particularly after their attempts to reverse #Brexit. 
Dear @DailyMailUK There’s no plot. We’re doing it openly. A van driver spoke to @mrjamesob on @LBC he lost his job directly due to #Brexit which hasn’t even happen yet. Tax Dodgers like you and #Tories won’t understand this. Why is your newspaper registered in Bermuda 
Good morning all...the news today is #Brexit is the biggest act of national harm the UK has ever undertaken. The news will same tomorrow and the day after.. 
Complex thread at first but worth reading. Indicative of MoD Remainer mentality infecting serving officers.  BZ to @VeteransBritain for keeping up the fight.  We must not leave our forces behind when we (eventually) #Brexit.Original daily #Brexit news: 
#Brexit is all over. All over everything that has ever been held to be true or worthwhile. It must and will stop. It is madness. "One man's Civilisation is an another man's Jungle, Yeah!" It is absolute "Monkey Business" - as the Marx Brothers understood so well... #StopBrexit
One person *not* named to me as bad: @DanielJHannan.Analogy: @Vote_Leave was the Clinton campaign and contained a couple of bad actors who will be prosecuted. @LeaveEU was the Trump campaign. Bad from stem to stern. Get the difference? #Brexit
Once you’re passed the annoying Cameron stuff, this lecture by Ivan Rogers is excellent - basically a catalogue of why the way #Brexit is being done can’t work  Q of course is: *how* could it be done?(Link via @stevepeers)
The YouGov poll lead for those who think it was wrong to leave the EU continues to grow. How could it be democratic to force through a massive change like #Brexit when the majority believes it to be an error? #PeoplesVote #StopBrexit #FBPE
Former EU ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers attacks #brexit red lines and dismisses UK's 'buccaneering blather' trade policy: 
The one thing #Brexit has revealed that no one expected was that a vast chunk of the British political establishment and the whole of the British mainstream media are serving Brussels and Berlin and not Britain. It was worth finding this out.
“Germans behaved appallingly.They're very keen to tell us about £40 Billion we supposedly owe them for #Brexit, not to mention countless Billions we’ve already paid in, but they REFUSE to pay for the terrible destruction they caused to this country."#EU
How’s #Brexit matching what was promised?-No extra £ for #publicservice (incl  #NHS)-No new #tradedeals in sight,rather we’re losing ones we already have-Risking a hard #Irishborder &jeopardising #GoodFridayAgreement -Barriers to our main export market, losing jobs&prosperity
Fact: Scaremongering just isn’t Working..."People have woken up to the FACT they have been lied to by Remoaners, scaremongering, this that & the other.Of course Britain can be successful after #Brexit, we were before & we will be again.”#WTO #Leave #EU
EU commissioner: "The UK spent all of its time opting-out. Now it wants to opt-in." #Brexit#EU27
So let me get this straight.Brexiteers proposing customs scheme that costs business £17-20 billionso we can save £8.6bn pa we pay to EUall of which and more is paid for by tax & NI payments of other EU citizens who work in UK?It must be time to think again about #brexit?
If the EU continues to mistreat Britain re #Brexit, European nations won't fail to see the EU for the bully it is.Anti-EU feeling will only increase. The EU thus only hastens its own demise.Anybody remember the Soviet Union? In 1987, anybody imagined it would cease to exist? 
Only 17 mins in and I can already see why we want out of the EU... #CarryOnBrussels #Brexit
Intellectual heavyweight and lead Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg Vs Intellectual non participant #Brexit#Moggmentum
Can it be? Is this the moment we've been waiting for? Is this the symbolic child pointing out that Emperor #Brexit is stark bollock naked?
‘The fact is one country can’t out-negotiate 27 others.’Delighted to be featured in the latest issue of Monocle Magazine discussing my ‘front line’ views on #Brexit and how we ended up where we are. 
Killer facts in Alice in Wonderland #Brexit 
Not being funny here, but if the #Remain camp are serious about blocking #Brexit, action needs to be ramped up  very shortly. Forget demonstrations, take a leaf from the French. Blockade Ports, block Motorways, burn the odd tyre etc. #Getserious.
Finally the right wing press will be able to declare HMRC 'Traitors' and 'Enemies', which, one suspects, is precisely how Rupert Murdoch, Lord Rothermere and the Barclay brothers have always felt...#Brexit #brexitshambles

The HMRC warns that the "max fac" customs arrangement favoured by cabinet Brexiters would cost £20bn per year, which is more than double the UK net contribution to the EU. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
At what point do we say enough is enough? Johnson, Fox et al didn’t put £20 BILLION cost for business on customs alone a year on the side of a bus. Yet another reason why we need a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal as more + more facts come to light. @peoplesvote_uk 
Germany demands more #Brexit money from us whilst refusing to pay for war reparations to many European countries. @PolandMFA @foreignoffice @GermanyDiplo
. @CarolineFlintMP doesn't want democracy on #Brexit. She wants a deal that has not yet been made, let alone voted for, forced down the throats of the British public. She's content with a slim majority for a vacuous 4 word slogan won by right-wing press hate & lies.#StopBrexit
.@DanielJHannan : Listen to this , Dan. Just listen.I make no comment.This is an ordinary guy. Not a politico, just a man with a van trying to make a decent living.Hear what #Brexit has done to him...and it hasn't even happened yet.Just hear him.Thks @mrjamesob  and @LBC
Happy to take stock of #Brexit talks w/@EmKaranikolov & our partners in #EEA Council #EriksenSøreide, @GudlaugurThor, & Aurelia Frick. The EU’s very close partnership with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein is based on a balance of rights and obligations.
Remember when Brexiters used to claim #Brexit was about cutting red tape for business? Want to know HMRC's estimate of the extra cost to business of Fox, Gove and Johnson's 'Max Fac' customs solution? A cool £20 billion a year! #FBPE
I'm stepping up efforts to obtain the #Brexit Impact Studies by writing to the ICO urging them to act to ensure the studies are publicly available in their entirety and take action to expedite the many FoI requests I and others have made.@ICOnews
EU gets on with #trade talks with Australia & New Zealand - while UK government simply spouts hot air about fanciful post #Brexit trade “opportunities”

The Brexiter favourite Max Fac - would cost business between £17 and £20bn a year- that's almost 1% of GDP- just for filling in formsThanks #Brexit
If your constituency voted leave, but your MP is attempting to stop or frustrate #Brexit Let them know how you feel and hold your MP to account. 
More good #Brexit news for the UK - government borrowing is at its lowest level since 2007. The Remoaner doom-mongers were wrong again!

One of the Brexiters’ major sales pitches is that a trade bonanza awaits the UK once it leaves the EU.There are seven clear reasons why this global trade bonanza beloved of Brexiters will not happen soon - if ever. Read them here: #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Britain has always sought a middle ground between full integration and national sovereignty. The only difference after #Brexit is that as a Member it had the sovereignty to choose its opt-outs but as an outsider the EU will be choosing its opt-ins.
Hard #Brexit folk like Rees-Mogg worse nightmare is that Corbyn is deposed as Labour leader - with virtually any other MP as leader - Labour would be holding Govt to account on Brexit & using numbers to banish hard Brexit.Corbyn & Rees-Mogg are essentially in coalition now.
And in move that comes as a massive surprise to Brexiters, Commonwealth nations are looking to align themselves with the world's largest trading bloc after #Brexit, rather than the UK...
Nice to see Vince Cable, whose party enabled the weak David Cameron to take government, which ultimately resulted in the EU referendum as a means to appease the right of the Tory party, having a pop at Corbyn about enabling #Brexit.Salty.#PMQs
More ways in which the #BrexitShambles are very different from what was promised. Doctors reveal too much #Brexit is bad for your #health
But does #JeremyCorbyn seriously believe that the #NHS will survive in its present form after #Brexit?It is a key asset...and Trump has already said that he's coming for a piece of it. If a trade deal depends on that.. how will he be stopped? And who/what can stop him?#PMQs
Corbyn avoiding mentioning #Brexit at PMQs. Perhaps the news that the shadow Brexit committee hasn't met since FEBRUARY being leaked put him off. 
Andrew Neil - Mark Carney said the economy is about £40billion smaller than it would have been without #Brexit.. which amounts to £15billion in lost tax revenue.. how much is that a week?George Eustice - I don't know @afneil - It's £300million a week.#FBPE #bbcdp #PMQs
It seems that #Brexit has had the exact opposite effect of what Brexiters predicted. According to the latest #Eurobarometer the support for EU is now higher than ever before in many EU countries, more than 90% in Ireland. People are also better informed. #TheBrexitEfffect
Boris Johnston says he would like a #Brexit plane to allow him to travel the world , telling everyone how great things will be in the post EU UK.  I think I have found the perfect candidate , which is presently sitting on an Icelandic beach ….

The UK has 4 million people who are under-employed due to unlimited cheap labour from the EU. This is bad for British workers. Britain needs a full #Brexit and to become self-sufficient in skills.

Average UK household income takes a hit of £900, largely because of #Brexit, says Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney. That’ll show “the elites”. 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "Gradually it looks as if we still get very fine words, but we're not getting the action that follows those words."People like me are becoming cautious about what the Government is really trying to do." #Brexit

At #NorthernIreland affairs select committee, hapless immigration minister Caroline Nokes admitted that she had not read all of the Good Friday Agreement – as she was 'probably giving birth' when the agreement was first published. In other words, too long; didn't read. #Brexit
I disagree with Blair on this. Corbyn's and Labour's current position on #Brexit pleases Theresa May. It provides cover for the divisions in the Tory party. He's letting her off the hook. 
Full house for #NIBrexit meeting today on implications of #Brexit for island of Ireland. Big thanks to organisers for invite. Prof Brendan O’Leary nailed it when he branded failure to convene British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference as violation of Good Friday Agreement. 
Would it be possible to explain how the outcome of the EU Ref is considered democratic during #NationalDemocracyWeek given that it was only an advisory vote, in which only 17,410,742 (pop 65 m) voted Leave, the Leave campaign lied & no one is representing none voters #Brexit
As #BankofEngland Governor @MarkCarney_BOE confirms that #Brexit is already costing families £900 a year each, even before we leave, a little reminder of some of  costs already incurred (bigger ones will come later): 
The Theatre of the Absurd: #Farage just "questioning" #Zuckerberg at the European Parliament. Maybe he should just thank him for #Brexit and #Trump?
Contrary to predictions from before the EU referendum, the number of people in employment since the Brexit vote is at a record high. There are 32 million people employed in the UK. #EU #BREXIT
It was Tony Blair's expansion of Thatcher's neoliberal domestic policies that destroyed the post-industrial towns that voted for #Brexit out of desperation.

Roughly half our trade is with the EU. Even if we get the best trade deals other countries have to offer, they won't make up for the losses to our trade with Europe caused by #Brexit. 
The EU could end up on better trade terms with Commonwealth nations than the UK after Brexit. Where are the amazing trade deals that Liam Fox, David Davis and Boris Johnson promised? Hold them to account! #Brexit #Trade
Is it any wonder the people of the regions are so disenfranchised (ref #Brexit) with the Establishment when issues outside of SW1A - like #SaveSheffTrees - are ridden roughshod over with this sort of utterly supercilious disdain!?  @natalieben @ChrisGPackham @BiancaJagger
Is the #Art50 notice unilaterally revocable? We are trying to get the answer to this question by referring it to the #CJEU in Luxembourg. Today a Scottish judge heard the arguments & will give a decision at a later date. Thanks to all who supported us #Brexit 
It's time for Mark Carney (Project Fear) to stand down as Governor of Bank of England & let's get someone who is willing to look to the future instead of Carney's constant licking of his #Brexit wounds. The UK needs to start looking forward again.
.@BorisJohnson’s attempt to force the Government into adopting a hard #Brexit stance, less than 12 months before the terms of Brexit must be agreed upon, has left many of our friends in Europe astounded by the lack of unity and purpose shown by the UK Government. #ExitfromBrexit
Mark Carney - The UK economy today is more than 1% below where it was before the #Brexit referendum + “Real household incomes are about £900 per household lower than we forecast in May of 2016, which is a lot of money.”#StopBrexit #FBPE
1) #Brexit dirty secretThere's a worrying little issue at the heart of brexit which is keeping the Brexiters awake at night.  They want out of CU, but don't really care about SM, but their supporters are largely the opposite.  This helps finish BrexitWhy? Pull up a chair

Someone pointed out earlier, this tweet from Ian seems to suggest that the whole #Brexit/Antisemitism issue was being used as a weapon to target #Corbyn and discredit him, his supporters and the Labour party by some in Labour such as Progress.#JC4PM #Corbyn #chickencoup
That's £900 per household for 2 years of farce, empty slogans, greater social tensions and ALL of the #Brexit promises being shown 2 be lies. "Take back control" indeed. #leave #LeavEU #PeoplesVote 
This really was a heartening image to see. On #Brexit it's great to have ppl reach across party lines. 
Oh look - it's an upcoming trade deal that the UK won't have access to if #Brexit happens. And there we were thinking that these countries were actually lining up to do deals with the UK. Not. #StopBrexit.
In case not seen, Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England telling like it is on #Brexit so far - economically the UK worse off than what it was forecast to be prior to the #Brexit vote. Is this really what the UK wants? A #peoplesvote the end of the process is needed!
Arlene Foster:“Quite disgraceful using Northern Ireland in that way.I see no logic or rationale for hard border being created between NI & Rep of Ireland.People stirring up myths of border checkpoints are those committed to unpicking the Union"#Brexit
#Brexit has cost each UK household £900, Bank of England governor Mark Carney says. The pounds devaluation has also cost UK retirees in the EU a minimum of €6,000 since the vote.
“The issue of #Brexit will not just affect unionists or nationalists or others but will impact every single person in Northern Ireland,” says Alliance Leader @naomi_long as she follows up today’s Joint Statement between parties on the EU exit.
Mark Carney from the Bank of England has just confirmed that household incomes are now £900 lower than forecast just before the EU Referendum. Can't remember that being written on the side of that red bus! #Brexit

More students are speaking out for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal!
Michael Gove claims that #Brexit has made the UK less divided and more open to migration – what nonsense! 
The reason #Corbyn opposes a #PeoplesVote & #Labour members having a say isn't because he 'respects the result of the referendum' as more democracy & giving voters a say on the terms of #Brexit disrespects nothing - he opposes it because he wants Brexit & always has - simple
The #Brexit monster created by the likes of Johnson, Gove, Davis, Fox, Farage, Hoey, Stuart, Rees-Mogg will one day turn on them and hound them out of town.

Some interesting thoughts on #Labour ‘s evolving position on #Brexit when faced with a costly damaging Tory #brexitshambles :
A friend just suggested 2nd #Brexit vote would be a dangerous precedent: "Do you want to keep going to the electorate until you get it right?" But (though I want the 1st vote run fairly) HELL, YES. Democracy *is* constant vigilance and re-evaluation. Doesn't stop after one vote
Tell that to the NHS which is haemorrhaging staff due to the #HostileEnvironment, and can't hire new staff because of the arbitrary immigration limits imposed by the #Brexit headbangers.  
Figs show French firms registered 48% fewer businesses in UK in '16-'17 than prev financial year, Belgium 38% & NL 52% fewer. #Brexit means they won't build new factories or buy UK businesses. OECD says foreign direct investment fell by 90% in '17. No wonder majority want 2nd ref
Oh dear ... #brexit = increased phone charges !- Phone companies have to give advance warnings- There is no hiding this !Any comment from @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @michaelgove @DavidDavisMP or @BorisJohnson or @LiamFox on the cost of doing international trade ??? pic.twitter.com/UDUSr8GnVN
BSOS karen Bradley says north will NOT remain Custom Union says it on day survey shows 70%  ppl want 2 stay in custom union & single market Tory Gov & DUP don’t represent the views of ppl on #Brexit.Time to chose which union you want to be a part of - Union with Britain or EU 
There is growing evidence that the 2016 #brexit referendum was not conducted fairly. @carolecadwalla  and others are doing some sterling work exposing apparent funding, coordination and data protection irregularities. Time for a fair #PeoplesVote #FBPE
.@michael_chessum from @Another_Europe: "Jeremy's quickest path to No 10 might be to block Theresa May's deal and by putting the question back to the people, derail #Brexit altogether." Michael is right, but it's not just the quickest route to power, it is the principled one. 
Delighted to have spoken today at the @IPPRNorth #BrexitNorth conference, looking at the multiple problems that #BrexitShambles would cause in all northern regions — and why so many people are asking for a chance to reconsider #Brexit once the actual withdrawal deal is known ... 
#honestpoll Has Corbyn's stance on #brexit made you leave the labour party (or change your voting intention if originally labour?) Please #vote and #retweet.Stories welcome.
This is more nonsense from David Lammy. Countries across the World sign free trade deals with other countries without any free movement of people being part of the deal. Once we've left the protectionist Customs Union we can actually sign deals. Inside it we're stuck. #brexit 
As sophisticated as the corporate branded campaigns look...They consistently fail to engage people.People aren't going to change their minds until they see how #Brexit will directly affect their lives.We need to bring the argument down to a personal and emotional level. 
UUK has welcomed the Prime Minister's comments today that she would like to see the UK associate fully with the EU's next research and innovation programme. See our response here  #Brexit 
Will #Brexit end up #Engxit ?Change in the air in Scotland today.
Unbelievable, the Tories want so many peers in the upper house that they can ride roughshod over democracy. #Brexit doesn't mean taking back control, it means imposing a dictatorship. 
If Corbyn opposed Brexit, Theresa May would have a 100-seat majority and #Brexit would be done and dusted by now. 
'Hatred is the sea that terrorists need to swim in.’ No, exactly the opposite is true: hatred is the sea our Government needs to start swimming in. Hatred for the Jihadis & the anti-British sentiment which prevails over our shores. #Terrorism #Brexit 
In the EU referendum in 2016, 56% of people in NI voted to remain. New report out today shows that 69% would vote to remain in the EU if there was another referendum. More reason for a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Full report here:  pic.twitter.com/XdoX5FhZ34
Delighted to join @M_AndersonSF at @sinnfeinireland #Brexit campaign meeting in Co Meath. Clear that only, to quote Michel Barnier, “specific proposals” for North can prevent calamitous outcome for economy & citizen rights. Special Status demand also recognises vote to Remain. 
Guy, please ask questions that our government cannot ignore the answers to and show the #Brexit vote to be the fake we all know it to be. We want to remain, all polls show the UK people want to remain for nearly a year now yet our right wing government are ignoring the truth.
Our search for a #BrexitBenefit continuesWe caught up with @DUPleader Arlene Foster & asked her #HowWillBrexitBenefitMe?As you can see she gave us a detailed briefing of the Government's #Brexit plans so far & how it will benefit the British people!#StopBrexit #SODEMaction
Glove claims today #Brexit “has made Britain more welcoming to immigrants”.This is the sort of statement that reflects badly not just on Gove but also on the UK as a whole.Gove must have a reason to assume Brits are congenital idiots to fall for this. 
Irony is officially dead. My comments in today’s @DailyMirror on #Brexit Tory Michael Gove’s speech attacking ‘identity politics’ 
The real purpose of #Brexit is not migration. It is a vile attempt by Gove, Fox, Farage, Rees-Mogg etc for a bonfire of EU regulations, which spoil their ambition to transform the UK into an ultra-Thatcherite stateLet us remind ourselves. Frequently  #fbpe #stopbrexit #WATON
Failure to guarantee #Insurance contracts post-#Brexit will cause problems across Britain and also create even more chaos on Irish border @EuroLabour

Does Robert watch the news? #Brexit is being opposed tooth and nail by the ppl who lost the referendum - each and every day and his programme has taken a side 
#Italians threaten to defy #EU rules by kicking out 500,000 immigrants, tearing up spending plans and forging links with #Russia  #Brexit 
I'm getting pretty sick of the conceit that the Corbyn groupies exhibit in trying to blame us; how can we #Remainers support a man who backs a #Brexit that can only leave us Poorer, Weaker, with less Control & Fewer Rights..if the Tories get back it will be because of him not us.
Under #WTO we would leave Irish border as it is now, soft & sensible.If Republic of Ireland is fool enough to put hard border on its side, it must bear the consequences.Under WTO, Irish beef will compete at world prices & would be the loser.#Brexit #EU
The post-Brexit opportunities of CANZUK are considerable – and should be especially attractive to young people  #brexit
Corbyn is a stinking hypocrite whose policy of quitting the Single Market would make the lives of the many harder. And his talk of a "jobs first Brexit" has added to the mountain of #LeaveLies perverting #Brexit democracy. #StopBrexit #PeoplesVote
Brexit is 7500 hours away. #brexit
Brexiteers are treating Ireland with contempt - Excellent article in which inter alia we learn that “membership of EU has allowed Ireland to reduce its economic dependency on the British market.” #Brexit #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope -
To say the government is in chaos on #Brexit is only a statement of the obvious: "Negotiations are yet to begin on a post-Brexit security treaty". #StopBrexit
Dear @jeremycorbyn....the majority of British people do not want #Brexit...give them what they want.. a #FinalSay. Oppose #Brexit and be our voice. Please RT so he gets it!
See that #Japan is seeking better (for Japan) trade deal from #Brexit Britain than from .@EU_Commission under prospective EU-Japan agreement. More visas. Same as #India. Supreme irony that Brexit may force .@theresa_may to adopt looser #Immigration policy.
This is a huge admission on your part: "Perhaps Brexit isn’t the done deal I’ve been taking for granted." Didn't you know it was an advisory referendum? Didn't you know #Brexit wd mean disaster for the UK economy, international relations  and political system? What DEAL  exactly?
A gentle reminder.@Jacob_Rees_Mogg @DavidDavisMP @LiamFox#Brexit 
A no-deal #Brexit with UK-EU trade on WTO terms is the best hope for Brexiteers  via @BrexitCentral
Because she thought that, amidst the wedding build-up, the world would be too busy to notice her filfthy little trick. She was wrong. #ToryPeers #HouseOfLords #TheresaMay #ToriesOut #Brexit

Hey everyone you know those much better trade deals the UK can get outside of the EU?Apparently other countries are planning on giving us a worse deal than what we have now.It’s almost as if #brexit is really stupid isn’t it? 
The UK is a beautiful place but it is marred by UK government incompetence, racist immigration policies, an austerity obsession, and a PM who does not care about the horrific cost of #Brexit to the people because it suits her party's donors and voters.
There is no such thing as a soft or gentle #Brexit - everything less than we have now will damage us in so many ways for years and years. Its not fair on the younger generation as it’s they who will pay. @OFOCBrexit
#Brexit is like a kidnap of a family member! Not like a divorce.The 2016 EU Ref was a raid, a trick, by a group of Russia-funded billionaires using stolen private big data, breaking campaign spending rules, hiring Cambridge Analytica for mass manipulation. #StopBrexit #StopLies
Every night Theresa May must count her lucky stars that Jeremy Corbyn continues to support #Brexit. Because if he opposed it, she would be toast. #MakeJCStopBrexit
Precisely...why give up the Best Ever Possible Deal which is membership for an unachievable #Brexit that can only leave us Poorer, Weaker with Fewer Rights & less Control. MADNESS.#FinalSay stop the #BrexitShambles #Remain#FinalSayForAll #PeoplesVote
I’ve concluded that #Brexit voters cannot have experienced the awesome beauty of Europe. Quite why we think the UK is so marvellous in its isolation is beyond me. Utter nationalist delusion. Meanwhile I’m loving #Girona !
For 2 years Remainers have been warning that #Brexit could break up the union. This country is being wrecked by a government of incompetents, cowards charlatans, liars and fanatics. If only the main opposition party were much better. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Wow,First time I've seen this.Consistent, almost all responses saying "forget Hard #Brexit @Keir_Starmer , just stop messing around and stop brexit full stop"Don't think a lot of people are buying "jobs first Brexit" any more
ANY #Brexit must be defeated. And ANY #Labour leader who promises to #StopBrexit WILL be PM. So if you want office, you know what to do
If you are a @YoungLabourUK member who wants our party to stand against #Brexit and stand up for a #PeoplesVote - come and join us! Members across the country are coming forward to propose the @Remain_Labour & @Labour4EU  motion in their CLPs.
To defeat #Brexit we now need to win hearts and minds that #EU membership is good for Britain and not a threat. But where is the nationwide campaign to explain that? So far, there isn’t one that’s at all visible to the public. RT @Jon_Danzig’s commentary: 
Did you vote leave because those advocating #brexit pledged it was a great opportnunity for British business? Well the last 10 secs of this clip is #brexitrealityWhen the facts change, I change my mind, what do you do?Why not join so many other leave voters as a #remainernow?
With rumours that the Tories are set to call a snap General Election because their #Brexit plans are so shambolic & the Scottish independence campaign all set to restart:  I reckon Scotland is set for the 'Perfect Storm' to win its freedom!
Hearing this you can see why McDonnell & Corbyn actually want a bad #Brexit They clearly hope that the economic damage created by Brexit will create an opportunity for them to ‘overthrow capitalism’.To avoid this ‘dogma whatever the cost’ approach we need to #ExotFromBrexit
The boss has clarified that the debate on #Indyref2 WILL start within a couple of weeks once she has analysed the outcome of #Brexit. Bring it on Comrades.Nicola Sturgeon says she's going to ‘restart’ the Scottish independence debate 
Genuine question: can someone who voted #Brexit please tell me how the #EU has negatively impacted on your life personally, and how leaving the EU will improve things for you specifically?
I'm not sure how I feel about being trolled by "Artists for Brexit"... #Brexit is about as artistic as road kill.Any artist claiming to be "inspired" by #Brexit has probably lived their entire lives with a poker up their arse, reading nothing but the Daily Mail. 
Nigel Farage - "I have been saying for years, I want us to leave the EU before the whole thing falls to pieces. I would lose a great sense of satisfaction if we could not do this." #Brexit 
The UK could be "less London-centric" by not engaging in a #Brexit  grab of Scottish powers. Oh wait a minute, @RuthDavidsonMSP was isolated in backing that, and her wee Tory chums in Westminster voted for it. #voteSNP
Since Theresa May does not appear to understand what #Brexit means, here's a little tip from someone who understands it slightly better. 
“pollsters asked: “What if there was confirmation of cheating during the referendum campaign?”, 49% wanted a 2nd vote & only 30% opposed.If the trolled public should realise it’s been cheated, the future will be up for grabs.”#Brexit #CambridgeAnalytica
After I performed my "Brexit Dividend" song in Maidenhead @BerkshireforEU someone said I should get this line printed on a tee... "There is no #Brexit Dividend"  awesome idea! #StopBrexit #EUsupergirl 
That's the exact same number of jobs that would be lost in a Labour #Brexit.#Brexit isn't a @Conservatives problem, or a @UKLabour problem, it's just a problem - an unsolvable problem at that.Stop lying to yourselves and to voters. Stop losing jobs. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
#Brexit madness continues and yet  @UKLabour  are behind in the polls against the most incompetent govt of my lifetime which is in the midst of civil war. Sorry @jeremycorbyn it's just not good enough. Back a #FinalSay, back democracy.
Time for @theresa_may May to go and the @Conservatives to put a real leader in charge of the the party.Ready for change? Ready for @Jacob_Rees_Mogg Then Retweet and send them a message.#JRM4PM #MoggMentum #Brexit 
I’m sick of how the average working class man in this country, who voted #brexit, ignored the genuine concerns of average UK millionaires who live outside of the country.
2/2: This is seen as an attempt to overturn a 300-year-old tradition of parliamentary privilege, which preserves MPs'   freedom to speak out in Parliament without fear of being sued.More evidence that #Brexiteers hate Parliamentary Sovereignty.#Brexit
As part of the EU, the UK receives only 9% of English Channel cod catch limits, when based on most catches being in British waters it should be around 70%:  #Brexit
Gang, get ready! Tory MPs 'preparing for another snap election' amid #Brexit splits 
You take:The two worst PMs in history in succession The worst Foreign Secretary everThe worst bunch of cabinet ministers everThe worst idea ever: a binary referendum.What do you get?The worst policy ever: #Brexit.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Labour's #Brexit Policy...#BrexitShambles
Watch an exchange between @LenMcCluskey and Lord Mandelson on #Brexit. 
Dear Len McCluskey, The TUC says #Brexit threatens 100,000 jobs  in the North-East alone.The same number of mining jobs were lost in the NE between 1981 & 2004. The effects were devastating.Your magical thinking isn't getting us anywhere.
On @pestononsunday, @NicolaSturgeon says the #GrowthCommission is due to report shortly, and we will “restart” the debate in the next few weeks on why Scotland should be an independent country based on ambition & hope and not “despair”, as #Brexit remains based on.
Today's @thesundaytimes cartoon #RoyalWedding #Brexit 
More #brexit grief the #Brexiters tried to keep quiet about:
No pro-#Brexit voices on . Again.
More utter drivel from Barry Gardiner The best way to ensure you retain full access and all the benefits of the #SingleMarket is to STAY IN IT - as most #Labour members and voters want btw Norway and Switzerland are in the Single Market but not in the EU#Brexit #Marr
.@Emmabarnett showing her brilliance on #Marr this morning @BarryGardiner couldn’t help but reveal the ridiculousness of @UKLabour ‘s #Brexit position
This interview is a disaster for @BarryGardiner. It's not about Barry, it's about current #Labour policy on #Brexit and the single market, which is incoherent and doesn't have the support of our members, or our voters. It is time to change it. #Marr
Sky Views: It's time to put Brits abroad out of their #brexit misery 
All it would take to end this #Brexit farce is for one prominent leaver to have the courage & patriotism to say publicly "we got it wrong, this is not the best route for the country, we need to stop"
After living more than half my life in the UK there are no words to explain how I feel about #Brexit The day of the referendum my then 11 years old daughter asked me this - “Daddy, do we have to leave now?” This is the bottom line. We can’t be both hostile and welcoming.
As far as I can tell the best plan for #brexit we have come up with is staying in EU without a vote until 2021 and then staying in customs union indefinitely. It’s a lovely morning to wake up and smell the coffee.
#RoyalWedding was so beautiful, inclusive and full of hope. It made the world stop and reminded everyone what the UK is and stands for. How can we turn our back on what we are, waste our precious time to pursue bigoted and hostile politics of division #Brexit is beyond me.
#Corbyns approval ratings amongst 18-24 yr olds - plummeting. Why?Casual indifference to #BREXIT & cold lack of emotion towards #LabourAntisemitism. #Marr  #Ridge
Rees-Mogg: Things we were told would not happen are now happening.Sequence of #Brexit talks: we gave in.No large sums to EU: we give #EU £40bn“Now talking about extending Customs Union 2.5 years BEFORE deadline...It seems to me, preparing for failure”
A reminder that the real 'project fear' was ruthlessly whipped up for years by the #Brexit press and politicians.- Fear of a EU superstate- Fear of a EU army- Fear of immigrants- Fear of refugees- Fear of Muslims- Fear of millions of Turksand so on... #StopBrexit #FBPE
We can’t say we weren’t warned about what a Post-Brexit US Trade deal would look like #Brexit #whisky #Scotchwhisky #trade
Great to see these 5 @uklabour politicians from Merseyside joining the calls for a #peoplesvote on #brexit. With so many leave voters nationwide changing their mind and becoming #remainernow it’s vital MPs stand up and offer U.K. a way out. 
Oops.... "EUROZONE EXPORTS FALL" Full #Brexit story: Roll on our independent United Kingdom!
"If a General Election elects a Gov on a 'leave ticket' I would abide by it."In 2017 General Election 90% of MPs were elected on a manifesto that promised to #LEAVE.Tory Gov, & DUP who support them, were both elected promising to deliver #BrexitWhy not abide by the result Jon? 
If you want updates on everything #CambridgeAnalytica, Dom Cummings, #Brexit, and the dodginess of the #Brexit campaigns -  you'll want to hear more from @carolecadwalla. If you're anywhere near London in 10 days time...
May threatens Brexiteers with referendum on Ireland’s unification if they push too hard.Damian Green:“she is certainly not bluffing”Yet more irony!She bluffs everything else with #Brexit, except threats to destroy British Union in order to save #EU !
#Corbyn Couldn’t hit a Cows arse with a shovel. Oppose #Brexit and clean up 
'One Suffolk quayside handles £80 billion of trade a year — that is £77 billion more than the entire Irish border — without a glitch.'  #Brexit
Wonder what #brexit voting Chelsea fans think when their manager and star players are working in the UK as a result of using EU freedom of movement rules. Just a thought.
Wake up @UKLabour. This supporting #Brexit is clearly not working. Start opposing this appalling government on #Brexit and you will destroy it. It’s an open goal - start taking some shots into it. 
Street art that is critical of the #EU is increasingly manifesting all across Europe!As awareness grows of the ever increasing tyranny of the EU, democratically minded artists are making their voices heard on the streets!#brexit #democracy #streetart
I watched a fair bit of #RoyalWedding today. I like #HarryandMeghanHarry, has done a lot for the UK including two tours of Afghanistan.And Meghan, even before she was a future princess she was looking out for UK’s best interests by actively opposing #brexit #StopBrexit
That is one of the many problems with Americans. I do so wish we had the openness and acceptance of immigrants and people of color that everyone has in the U.K. #Brexit
When politicians talk of the "Will of the People", they mean whatever they have decided the people to have meant by ticking a box next to a short phrase on a ballot paper, and that no-one has a legitimate democratic right to oppose them. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Tories have lost a shed load of votes in the House of Lords on #Brexit.So what does the #PM do?She puts FIVE ex Tory MPs in the House of Lords who are #REMOANERS,to make the defeats even bigger in future.#Madness
"Go back to your own fucking country" was what I heard being shouted from a car, at some guys earlier today.This is what #Brexit has done to our country. Given power and voice to the vilest in our society.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
BRUTAL SHOCK for @theresa_may. MPs tell her dump #Brexit talks, walk away from EU, save 40 billion. DUP agrees. @BorisJohnson #borisjohnson
EU dismisses May's latest Irish border plans. The only acceptable solution is for the UK to remain the Single Market and #Brexit in name only.Imagine if she'd thought it through before triggering A50, she wouldn't look such a chump now.RIP #Brexit
The idea that a handful (& that’s what it would be) of @theSNP peers in the Lords would make a blind bit of difference to #ScotlandsPlaceInEurope is laughable. On #Brexit the one thing they couldn’t be bothered to rebel on was protecting Scottish #devolution
The results of our street stall survey today in Leamington Spa:For a #peoplesvote:Yes: 176 (80%)No: 38 (9%)Don’t know: 5 (1%)In our poll, Leamington Spa overwhelmingly want a #finalsay on the #brexit deal.
Delighted to see the Africanisation of the Queens household at the #RoyalWedding. The service had black everything. #Brexit Brits will be frothing at the mouth. Congratulations to the happy couple. We want throw back babies. 
That awkward moment when you remember #Brexit is still a thing. #royalwedding
Our street stall in Leamington Spa is nearly over. It was hugely successful on this sunny day. #brexit #finalsay
Multicultural Britain throws a multicultural wedding for a multicultural couple.That was Britain at its best, the way it used to be, the way it was before #Brexit legitimised racism and xenophobia.
#Brexit is a crime to democracy and the people of the UK/EU. The EU Ref and what followed was a silent coup by a group of billionaires supported by the Alt Right and high-tech. Before Theresa May takes us out Erdogan-style, MPs need to take her out.MPs do your job!#StopBrexit
Proof the #Remainer row over EU Customs Union is claptrap: There's barely a customs officer in sight at Felixstowe which handles £80 billion of goods a year... so why all the hysteria about the Irish border with its £3 billion trade?  #Brexit 
Dr. Jordan Peterson has suggested he backs #Brexit in an appearance on the BBC. "If you try to build a homogenous, totalitarian structure that usurps the transcendent, it will begin to badly fragment from within." 
If I get another corbynista tell me the #RoyalWedding stands for everything terrible in this world with an African American Pastor  preaching love & Martin Luther King quotes while Jeremy demands a hard #brexit in order to keep the immigrants out - I’ll vote #LibDems.
It’s so blindingly obvious that the problems that led to #Brexit in the first place are only going to get worse after # Brexit. Mind-numbing that those in a position of responsibility are not explaining why it must be stopped.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Eddie, please will you propose that Labour opposes #Brexit, as most of it's voters want. We need a #FinalSay, the ref was only advisory, influenced by Russia & was fuelled by lies. Brexit is about tax avoidance & will lead to a race to the bottom for many- please help prevent it.
Dominic Grieve - The problem of #Brexit is that the referendum was a binary choice on an abstract subject. The argument for a #PeoplesVote is a compelling one & interestingly when it's put to people it's clear a majority of people see the rationale behind it.#StopBrexit #FBPE

We asked @CharlieElphicke one of the most important questions of our generation #HowWillBrexitBenefitMe? His reaction & attitude was disgusting - especially for the people of #Dover represented by such an arrogant man with no regard for how #Brexit will effect them & us all! 
Bigotry and hate have always existed in Britain, the difference now is that a ruthless kleptocratic elite has decided to use them as tools to get itself a #BrexitTaxHaven, regardless of the damage that inflicts on our society. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
From being a prosperous nation, to 2nd bottom of table.. Even Greece are stronger. Not project fear ppl.. Just cold, hard reality! #Brexit 
There's been talk of a "backlash" if #Brexit is reversed.Picture the backlash if it goes ahead & these car factories start closing. 
#FBPE friends. This article sums up the utter disaster #Brexit is causing  to our country. I just read this to my wife & we were both in tears. It makes me redouble my resolve to fight for a #PeoplesVote. Let's send this to every MP! #StopBrexitSaveBritain

I’m delighted today to be in Malmo with leaders of other European feminist parties to discuss how feminism can counter the rise of nationalism. Whatever #Brexit brings, WE will work with our sisters in Europe to safeguard human rights.

There has been a clear shift in public opinion that #Brexit is bad for UK since Aug 2017 & the latest figures in May its increased again.So many people who voted leave or abstained in 2016 have changed their minds & are #remainernow Brexit reality is a long way from promises!

Morning all! Time for my daily #brexit realisation:"#Brexit only makes sense when you realise that these people really, REALLY just don't care."
In all my years I have never seen a Tory govt so desperate that they will dispose of convention and precedent in order to force through legislation that will harm the peoples of the UK and lead to its fragmentation and end. They are the barbarians at the gate. #Brexit
#Brexit is ALL about the #Tories. Manufactured by the Tories.Delivered by the Tories.To serve ONLY the Tories.
Exc: Three former cabinet ministers plan to tell @theresa_may she has numbers in @HouseofCommons to face down @Jacob_Rees_Mogg on #Brexit 
Delighted with debate at @selbylabour tonight. Two-thirds of the (small minority) of those who had voted for #Brexit in #referendum say they would now vote to #Remain
Don't like losing votes @theresa_may? Is that why you are creating more #Brexit supporting peers...atleast have the decency to admit it. #TheresaMay #ToryShambles
Hiding this devious act in the shadow of a Royal Wedding. All done to bolster her numbers in the Lords ‘cos they keep voting down all things #Brexit. #Underhand
Theresa May has appointed 9 new obeying tory peers to help deliver the hard, disastrous, economy busting #Brexit she so desires, it's there now for all to see, it's in the interest of the @Conservatives not the country, this tory Brexit will wreck our nation for a generation.
#stopbrexit2018 column of march on 23rd! It's got to be huge! Bring your work mates, bring your neighbours, bring your parents, kids, pets! Say it clear: we want no #HostileEnvironment, #Windrush OR #BREXIT here!

5. Scratch away all that stage managed politics and what you find is governance that is dysfunctional to the core. #Brexit has pushed our political class well out of its comfort zone and we now see just how inept it really is.
The latest Government #Brexit Update was published today and is available here: To receive the next Update directly into your mailbox sign-up here: 
The 15th serous defeat for HMG in the Lords and even the Labour leadership are wondering if they backed the wrong horse supporting #Brexit. Many Labour election targets increasingly remain #FBPE
Some EU achievements such as the customs union are in the spotlight w/ #Brexit. Good explainer here on what customs people (and dogs!) do and why.  
As the June #brexit deadline approaches what #onething about Brexit worries you? I’m asking people to make a short video on social media and let people know their concerns @M_AndersonSF
Unbelievable that both Leave and BeLeave campaign groups used identical datasets to manipulate the #Brexit Referendum. When will the madness stop?
At @Remain_Labour, we're clear that  we want @UKLabour to stand against #Brexit and support a #PeoplesVote. We believe @JanetDaby is the #LewishamEast candidate with the strongest Pro-EU  credentials and if we had a vote tomorrow, it would be for her. Good luck Janet!
Never forget. This man asked people to vote on #Brexit. Without defining what Brexit meant. Without carrying out any projections of consequences. All in an (unsuccessful) attempt to settle an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all his mates and f***ed off into the sunset. 
Who cares what someone mutters under their breath? My sense is the gov’t is desperate to replace an independent rebellious Speaker, with a compliant Brexit-friendly one, who will ignore backbenchers and not grant emergency debates. The whole Bercow thing is to do with #Brexit.
When #Brexit finally collapses into a heap of rubble under the weight of its own false promises, we need to look seriously at constitutional reform, in particular:- A fair voting system- A 2nd chamber that can't be gerrymanderedPerhaps we can salvage some good from this mess.
Two things are happening in Westminster right now. The first is that the #Brexit carnival is grinding to a screeching parliamentary halt, and second, our nation’s two political parties are showing all too clearly that they are no longer fit for purpose. 
The House of Lords isn't fit for purpose in a 21st century democracy when a PM can change its balance of power by inviting more political lackeys to feed at its trough.  #brexit
 The agenda for next week’s round of #Brexit negotiations @EU_Commission is now available on our site: 1) Withdrawal Agreement, 2) Ireland/Northern Ireland, 3) framework for future relationship  
It's the end of another #Brexit week. Students & Nurses came out in favour of a #PeoplesVote but were quickly silenced by the right wing press & politicians citing #WillOfthePeople. The irony-a people's Vote would be just that. Stay strong - we're winning! #FridayWisdom #FBPE
Theresa May is considering packing the Lords with new Tory (and DUP!) unelected Peers, after a string of #Brexit defeats over customs union membership, the Irish border, environmental protections and removing the precise 29th March 2019 date of Brexit...
We have incredible chance to avoid a hard #Brexit by coming together across the parties and supporting the Lords EEA Single Market amendment to #EUWithdrawalBill . But it can only succeed if @Keir_Starmer & @jeremycorbyn seize this chance too. Please let all MPs know your view!
Spot on. British business and people throughout the UK  would be delighted that #peaceandprosperity were finally winning the arguments that further the divides of #Brexit. Let’s unite behind #EFTA #EEA #CustomsArrangement
Did you catch this week’s Guardian #Brexit briefing? The top story; ‘Brexit is still a steaming mess going nowhere fast.’ #ExitfromBrexit
Very significant tweet by @GeorgeFreemanMP . Further proof of the fact that there is strong and growing cross-Party support for an #EEA / #EFTA based #Brexit. Absolutely vital that our Labour leadership and front bench understands and reflects the importance of this. 
Language of #Brexit has been changing, subtly but inexorably, from great optimistic possibilities of sunlit uplands to damage limitation. Never forward, upwards & onward any more. Now all about managing expectations, climb downs, retreats & compromises. Why bother? #StopBrexit
It’s Friday.And on a flying jolly to Berlin David Davis is adamant that there will be no second referendum, claiming “people now just want us to get on with it”.No, Sir, most of us want you and the whole incompetent #Brexit crew to get lost.#StopBrexitSaveBritain
Be in no doubt #Brexit's a COUP..it's no longer about the Will of the Ppl, if it ever was, it's about which ideology gets to impose its will on the Ppl. May's an Autocrat. FGS #Labour, back a Binding #FinalSay in the Autumn + #StopBrexitSaveBritain option to Confirm the Will.
SO!It seems Theresa May is to pack the Lords with Peers - to get her#Brexit legislation through !*tut tut - those pesky Peers and their sensible amendments - Jakey is soo not happy*
@mrjamesob a far more interesting topic than the wedding in Windsor is the Panelbase poll yesterday that shows voters in England would be happy to see Scotland and N Ireland leave the UK as a price for #Brexit 
This cannot be repeated enoughBrexiters caused the failure of #BrexitThey promised a pain free, cost free Brexit- Any meaningful Brexit will be painful & costly- Any painless brexit is meaningless- Either will be seen as a betrayal by LeaversThat's why Brexit is frozen 
 @Albert_Rivera "Spain has to be decisive in the European Union: #Brexit presents us with an opportunity to raise our role to the level of Germany and France" #RiveraenGranada
Labour wants a medium-hard #Brexit which would have an impact similar to an average recession, though spread over more years. That means pointless and entirely avoidable Labour austerity piled on top of Tory austerity. Labour Remainers, please pile the pressure on. #StopBrexit
The economy is booming, exports up, nations want to trade with us & #Brexit hasnt happened yet. The PM however is not keen for Brexit but it will happen. You are free to leave if you want. Best wishes if you do.
Theresa May is going to pack the House of Lords next week with more tory and DUP lackeys in a bid to force through her disastrous version of #Brexit, remember this the next time this odious, wretched woman preaches democracy, she's a dangerous far right zealot #ToriesOut
#Brexit may not happen for another 65 YEARS as Britain ‘won’t be able to wrench itself free from Customs Union’ 
When all four major farming unions agree, we should listen. #Brexit is going to hurt our farmers and cripple small farming communities here in Wales. We need to #ExitFromBrexit and stop all this madness and protect peoples livelihoods.
(Insert #Brexit joke here) 
There’s no agreement on what #Brexit means. As @Jon_Danzig writes in his blog, “It’s time the government asked 'the people' what is their will today, rather than relying on what they think it was yesterday (i.e. two years ago).” Please RT.
Shameful that the assessment & views #Brexit of people running vital British businesses like #pharma which employ thousands of workers are routinely ignored by media. These great firms will shift production (jobs) when we #Leave #EU unless we secure #CustomsUnion #SingleMarket
I’m one of them, sadly. @BBCr4today was my drive to work staple listen, until their unbalanced #brexit pro-Tory coverage became obvious. John Humphris particularly is just impossible to endure. 
EU has a fund to "challenge Euroscepticism" and "combat the stigmatisation of migrants". You may not have heard BBC mention this propaganda fund, but at #Brexit Facts4EU we will. Read: 
Utterly shocking & disgusting. How is this legal? - #TheresaMay set to appoint new peers in bid to avoid further #Brexit defeats

Great to see Liverpool’s brilliant Labour MPs standing up for the future of their city - and for all our futures - and demanding a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal.  
If all of the money that is being wasted on #Brexit was diverted into police and other public services this country would be a better place with fewer problems. #bbcqt
I hope the DUP withdraws support for Theresa May and the Conservative Government. Withdraw support and force an election! #DUP #BREXIT 
But @andrew_lilico if Brexiters are not capable of organising their own #Brexit without Remainer help, that suggests that Remainers are the cleverer and more knowledgable bunch, and they are therefore more likely to be right about #Brexit.So let's just #StopBrexit!
Kate Hoey:“I find it really disappointing Irish Govt is in hock with #EU Commission to use Irish border as a weapon to try to get UK to stay in Customs Union & Single Market.There's a border already, it may not be very visible but it's there."#Brexit

Which makes the UK look worst?1. The arrogant exceptionalism that led to #Brexit; or 2. The dogs dinner we’ve made of trying to implement it?
MPs in Parliament must honour the will of the British people & not obstruct the will, a clean Brexit.#Brexit 
lol...Anna Soubry blames Labour because her party is full of right wing Little Englanders......you really are a joke Anna...still I'm sure your bosom buddy @ChukaUmunna will love you even more for having a pop at Corbyn #brexit 
1/ Why why why on Earth should anyone who voted against #Brexit or for that matter has changed their mind get behind something they do not want? Why? Have we now lost the right in this country to democratically oppose policies we disagree with? #FBPE #StopBrexit #Remain
It was the first step in a process which could result in a finding of contempt of Parliament. And we're meant to accept the #Brexit that these crooks are forcing on us by unjust means, and just "get on with it"? Get real.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote

Another week, another group of brilliant Labour MPs come out in favour of a #PeoplesVote. Thank you to @Alison_McGovern @lucianaberger @LouiseEllman @meaglemp for having the courage to stand up for what you believe is right. #Brexit is not inevitable.  
Great to see 4 Labour MPs from my part of the world, Merseyside, calling for a #PeoplesVote on the final Brexit deal. And the Mayor of Liverpool as well! Let's see more politicians and public figures have the courage of their convictions on #Brexit. 
Well done @GreenerUK team and all peers holding government to account on environmental protection post #Brexit. This is important for our environment, countryside and wellbeing. Environmental principles must be enshrined in law. #greenwatchdog

Tories are after young blood. But their schemes to turn the youth blue will come to nothing while they push through a damaging hard #Brexit, writes @Lara_Spirit from @OFOCBrexit
UK now planning on leaving the Customs Union by not leaving the Customs Union until ready to leave the Customs Union. #Brexit just took ridiculous to new heights.
Strange that a former Irish diplomat who never worked seriously on Europe is offering comfort & deeply flawed analysis of Irish position on #Brexit to the hard #Brexiteers who do not have Ireland’s interests at heart. Why he bothers when he has zero influence in Dublin. 
Both @hayward_katy & @DPhinnemore are giving evidence to Oireachteas today on how #Brexit is likely to impact the #GFA -  stressing that the EU's credibility (notably vis à vis its small states) would be at stake if it stopped supporting Ireland  
Amazing response from Karen Bradley when faced with Ireland’s most eminent defender against #Brexit @M_AndersonSF “let’s just have a nice day” She should tell that to all the farmers, producers, students & industry experts she meets at #BalmoralShow18 today see how that goes.
Christopher chandler paymaster of pro brexit think tank @LegatumInst made a fortune buying assets for a song when the USSR collapsed and seeks to a hard #brexit precisely  because he hopes it will cause economic chaos he can profit from 
Andrew's the last person in Europe to realise it isn't remainers who are obstructing #BrexitBut rather its realityBrexit is a dream of nostalgic old men & a wedge issue for Tory party. It was never meant to actually be done as its based on a fantasyLike voting for sunshine. 
Brexiters rant about great #Brexit trade opportunities. The reality is that there are only 3 trading partners who really count and they are all much bigger and much less desperate to get a deal. They will crush the UK in negotiations.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
Must-read thread on Customs Union situation #Brexit 
The only word to describe the Government's handling of #Brexit is shambolic. They are more interested in infighting and ideology than doing the right thing for our jobs and businesses.That is why I am in favour of a new Customs Union with the EU, here's my speech: 
'When you walk away from the largest civilized trading bloc in the world, the consequences are predictable: you end up shackled to the uncivilized.'#Erdogan #SaudiArabia #Trump #nhs #theresamay #brexit 
Even remaining in the Customs Union for a few years won't solve the Irish border problem. That would require staying in the Single Market.  #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
In recent months, I have found great interest & concern among Irish Americans about the implications of #brexit for Ireland. Here’s how I respond to their questions on this subject.

Good news for all those suffering from chronic air pollution. And a powerful reminder of just how much we’d miss the EU enforcement powers when it comes to environmental protection if #brexit happens.  Gove’s toothless “watchdog” just not up to the task.  
Just wrapping up a bilateral meeting with @theresa_may on #Brexit and other issues here at the #westernbalkanssummit in Sofia, Bulgaria
A deeply disturbing remark from Theresa May last year. A government that curtails human rights laws for any reason is one that is very likely to abuse human rights.#Windrush@guyverhofstadt @The3Million @DavidLammy#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Just spoke to a Commission expert about this. The upgrade to the EU's visa system will take 2-3 years. Original roll out in 2011 took 5-6 years. Just to give you an idea of how long visa database systems take to put in place #Brexit 
"We voted to leave two years ago, why haven’t they worked this all out?" says MEP @Janice4Brexit as @theresa_may re-commits to 'frictionless' trade with the EU after #Brexit. 
Irish PM @campaignforleo: Ireland + EU stand by back-stop. UK alternatives welcome if "workable and legally operable...If we're not making real and substantial progress by June we need to seriously question whether we are going to have a withdrawal agreement at all" #brexit 
The truths of #Brexit...1. Most politicians want us to remain shackled to the #EU. 2. A remainer PM was replaced with a remainer PM.3. The EU is terrified of us succeeding as a free nation.4. It was never the intention of many MPs to respect the outcome of the referendum.
Today I have cancelled my direct debit for the membership of @UKLabour over their stance on #Brexit. Looking forward to their follow up phone call to explain my reasons in detail.
You'll recall when Obama was attacked for saying post #Brexit Britain would be "back of the queue"You may have been one of those celebrating when Trump said we'd do a "great trade deal"Well, this is reality. Trump looking to push up NHS drug prices
Why is @theresa_may always trying to gain the approval of the EU? When they say no we can't agree with that her answer has to be "I answer to the people of the UK, not the EU - take it or leave it" The fact that she won't speaks volumes. #Brexit
So thankful we have @POTUS because he always has our best interest in mind. I really hope in my heart the UK can find someone like President Trump to lead them. Maybe then the people can have their voice back. #MAGA #USA #BREXIT #UK #NewRight
The time is fastly approaching we need a full-on #Brexit leadership challenge @Jacob_Rees_Mogg @DavidDavisMP @LiamFox
great move by @GaryLineker coming out in favour of a #peoplesvote at the end of the #brexit process. Takes real courage to do things like this. Thanks a lot! @peoplesvote_uk
It’s called political survival. If they don’t deliver #Brexit, the voters will punish them at the next election and what happened to Labour in Scotland will sweep south. Loyalty to their voters- check it out... 
Excellent resource on #Brexit with links to studies, statements, quotes and organisations : 
Had dinner with a friend not seen for ages last night. On #Brexit, he said the information was poor or non-existent and he made up his mind in the polling booth. He voted Leave. He knows the EU isn’t perfect. He’s a #RemainerNow. #PeoplesVote
Discussing #Ireland & the damage #Brexit will do to the GFA with @AlexSalmond on his show @RTUKnews
After #brexit "We need a powerful environment watchdog that can speak up for our nature and countryside and hold the government and public bodies to account.” 
Adam Tompkins is not stupid.  He knows that no one can ‘make a success of #Brexit”.  Every respectable analysis, including those from @GovUK itself,  shows the damage that will be done by any #Brexit.  And he knows that too… 
“With friends like that who needs enemies” says unelected EU Pres Tusk.  With what authority and under what democratic mandate did Tusk slam the UK's No.1 ally yesterday?  Read #Brexit story here: 
The Yanny / Laurel debate is a metaphor for the current state of divisiveness in Britain. A country that is split in two by only hearing one thing and then completely refusing to recognise that the other half hear things differently.#yanny #laurel #brexit
You know the @CONservatives have lost it because they are more concerned with what @UKLabour are doing. The way they’re going on anyone would think Labour is in Government. We will be after the next GE! For now, remember: Tories, with DUP, have a Maj. #Brexit is theirs.
Another #brexit casualty, everyone. German humour now officially outranks British. 
Many with the #FBPE tag would like to see a left wing government but we believe that #brexit is the defining issue. We know that #Brexit is and will continue to hurt the most vulnerable in society. This is why we attack Labours stance on the issue. #FBPE #StopBrexit
How can any #Remainer still want to be associated with such a #bullying organisation ?#Brexit means that the UK had the scruples to take a stand against tyranny once again. We are a proud nation with righteousness on our side.

BREAKING - Tory and Labour leaders reach agreement on a common environment policy.In a joint statement, Prime Minister May and “opposition leader” Corbyn confirmed that their post-#Brexit policy will be to insist that busines owners to switch the lights off as they leave the UK
When you're in the pub playing forfeit jenga and you pick up the block instructing you to shout "Brexit means #Brexit"  this is so 2018!  #StopBrexit
The Government has 2 options:1 Remain in the Customs Union for the time being, not sign global free trade deals and remain a member of the Little Europeans Club...or2 Call the EU's bluff on the non issue of the Irish border and walk away. Pick this one#Brexit #CustomsUnion
Don't you think those trying to push through #Brexit must be reaching a state of mind now where they are just like: "what's the point?!" By this stage EVERYONE knows it's bad for the country. The task is now damage limitation. The majority don't want it. It is political suicide!
No Bets Please, We’re British!Brussels on Red Alert...“Italy were already fancied to be the next country to exit EU at 9/4 & recent coalition talks have only extended their lead at the front of the queue to 6/4.”Ok, Great - Next!#Brexit #Leave #EU
I'm suddenly confident that everything will be OK on the @BorderIrish after all. You see, people who run businesses along it don't really understand it, but people who write columns for the Telegraph and Spectator do. Especially if they've never been in Ireland. #Brexit
Martina Anderson MEP at Guardian Offices in London, for Brexit Ireland debate. She has been the strongest representative voice for Irish citizens, in the face of #brexit. Fact. She has dispelled Tory cabinet myths & works daily to protect fundamental rights of Irish citizens 
Tell me.  how does one  spend  three decades obsessing about leaving the EU and manage not to give one iota of thought about actually implementing #Brexit in all that time
This is massive. Facebook shows Vote Leave, the official leave campaign, broke the law during the referendum ... we need a full, and transparent inquiry now! The referendum viability is in tatters. #Brexit #StopBrexit
This great Chancer of the Exchequer said there would be 820,000 jobs LOST within 2 years of a Leave vote.At least 609,000 NEW jobs have been added to the British economy since the referendum vote in June 2016, per ONS.Oh, but there's still a month to go, #Brexit lies bla bla? 
Tories can run all they want but they can't hide - their #Brexit wheels are coming off!  
Guardian/ICM #Brexit poll.Leaving the customs union is the most popular option as is no extension to the transition period. 
UK Labour's cynical attempt to undermine #Brexit was defeated. 
There'd been plans to convert this former police station in Warrenpoint into a much-needed community centre.If it is instead used for a post-#Brexit #border 'facility' - for customs or security purposes - the symbolism would be too bloody crushingly obvious.#progress #peace
Theresa May has lost 15 votes in the Lords on #Brexit which means she should do the honourable thing and call a general election as she can not longer govern with any confidence in either house.
We have a #SODEMaction exclusive! We managed to get our hands on the Government white paper on the #Brexit deal - it shows all the progress that has been made in the #Brexit negotiations so far - remember - you saw it here first! #BatshitBrexit #stopbrexit2018 pic.twitter.com/mhfE7I8V5u

Why has the govt NOW promised a #whitepaper on #Brexit some 2 YEARS after the #EUreferendum ? A As a smokescreen to mask its divisions?B To set out an impossible vision that is unacceptable to the EU, hoping people will then blame “Brussels” when it all goes pear shaped?C both

Yet again the Tories claim that we are too stupid to understand the complexities of #Brexit. I'd say that it is @Conservatives who are too stupid to understand what Scotland needs & desiresDavid Mundell claims Brexit Bill is too 'technical' for MSPs
Breaking news: Huge thanks to the 294 lords who believe our #environment deserves proper protection after #Brexit. Today's debate brings environmental principles (and the demand for a watchdog to enforce them) into the #WithdrawalBill. Great outcome!
Peter Grant - "The company's delusional directors drove Carillion off a cliff & then blamed everybody but themselves." I hope the PM has registered that remark for royalties because it's going to be used a lot in the future to describe the cabinets handling of #Brexit#FBPE
The British people are being treated with utter contempt: #Brexit reneged on, #freespeech shutdown, war on our streets & now the Lords petition ignored. If the government wants a civil war, it's going the right way about it.
Another serious #Brexit problem emerges only thanks to a leak... 
Nigel Farage - "In Hungary, Poland and Italy, political parties that are winning elections are saying we don’t want to be governed by unelected bureaucrats. "Remainers want us to stay part of something that is literally crumbling before our eyes.” #Brexit 
A very significant defeat for the Government. Peers from across the parties are demanding that serious environmental protection in the #Brexit process. It's time for Ministers to think again. 
I love this quote on #Brexit by Rafael Behr: ‘Neither side will cherish May’s messy deal and, because it will be unloved in the country, few MPs will have much incentive to defend it. Brexit is the adopted child of a whole generation of politicians. It will be an orphan one day.’
The forthcoming #Brexit White Paper - a Twitter User's Guide /1

As a trade 'expert' let me tellThere is not such a thing as "soft #Brexit" that would cost less than the EU membership (in net) #stopbrexit #FBPE
So, to say the CTA existed pre-EU, therefore all will be fine post- is a nonsense. It would only apply if RoI were exiting at the same time as the UK. Post-#Brexit is the first time one country will be in the EU and one will not. How difficult is this to grasp?
Once again, Jeremy Corbyn excellent at #PMQs , once again, Theresa May refuses 2 answer a single question, no answer as 2 how many extra HMRC staff have been recruited to deal with #Brexit, as always, narrows her eyes & spits out vitriol, a despicable, disreputable, cowardly PM pic.twitter.com/T30XA0NjA6

Mr. Corbyn nailed it again, May has absolutely nothing to offer apart from when @UKLabour were in power or what JC said last week etc, she's ineffective, partisan, with no personality, charisma, charm, who's leading us to a #Brexit disaster, ffs May just go #PMQS

Most people don't like being lied to. That's why we research and publish truthful pro-#Brexit articles like this: 
Theresa May's own #Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has now threatened a legal challenge to the Prime Minister over her customs partnership plans... #BrexitShambles
Personally, if I had voted to remain because I trusted the Govt/forecasts & their fear campaign then I'd be pissed off now that I was being lied to. The strange thing is despite proof of those lies many remainers are still falling for version 2 of the same fear campaign. #Brexit 
This is just the design stage.As Windrush, Carillion, Universal Credit and many other examples show, the UK has no chance of successfully implementing the hugely complex and interconnected changes associated with #Brexit.
Britain's #Brexit economy is BOOMING - more Brits in work than ever despite PROJECT FEAR  
We're calling for an early deal for science in #Brexit  negotiations to give much needed certainty to UK researchers and businesses. Most importantly, this should include association with Framework Programme 9 (FP9). Read our Brexit briefing here  
This is hilarious. Turkey seeks FTA with UK in exchange for Freedom of Movement. Ah, those post #Brexit trade deals with the rest of the world.#Leavers will be apoplectic

The @theRCN have come out in favour of a #peoplesvote on the final #Brexit deal."If the deal isn’t good enough we should have the democratic right to reject it" If you agree, then join us to march on Parliament on June 23rd and demand a People's Vote.
When you're on the same side as 'Jacob', you have to ask yourself some serious questions.The 'Lexit' stance is the most embarrassing and infantile of all.You really think we're going to get some kind of socialist #brexit? Pure fantasy.
This #Brexit interview with David Lidington on #r4today is a classic of its sort:‘I’m glad you asked that question Martha, because it’s a very important question to ask, and it’s a question to which a lot of people want to know the answer.... I’m sorry what was the question?’

So many of the #Brexit warnings, dismissed glibly by #Brexiteers turn out to have substance & are likely to have impact :  Trump threatens to use US trade talks to force NHS to pay more for drugs

"LIES, DAMN LIES, AND REMAINER POLITICIANS" - Get it this wrong and if you were normal you'd resign.  New jobs data makes fools of remainer MPs & peers. Full #Brexit story: 
“Eastern European workers head home over Brexit fears” Yet another dodgy headline- in article the key reasons for returning home 1) less attractive job offers 2) lower earning differentials with home & 3) exchange rate. Finally #Brexit gets a mention
Simon Johnson (Daily Telegraph) punts ‘Nicola Sturgeon accused’ same guy who promoted the 2015 #Frenchgate exclusive that turned out to be a complete fabrication. #Brexit #PowerGrab
Ken Clarke - I've never seen anything as chaotic as this... #Brexit is the maddest political situation I've ever seen.... we're taking decisions that will have a big affect on the prosperity & well-being of my children & grandchildren.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Here’s the future of the #NHS post #Brexit. At the mercy of rapacious politivians like Trump. 
The more of these #brexit ramifications that become clear make me truly gutted I voted #leave. @RemainerNow & @peoplesvote_uk crucial
EU: We don’t agree to your post #Brexit customs proposals. Just do as we say. UK: But we want a deep and special partnership. EU: So do we - we tell you what to do and you do it.UK: So will we be independent? EU: No. Just fool your voters.UK: OK then. Thank you so much!
government disagree with govt but agree with Labour who disagree with Labour and Labour who disagree with themselves on but agree they disagree with the cabinet which also disagrees with itself on . #Brexit
Been saying since 2016 that #Brexit would lead to a re-unified Ireland & a united Scotland!

It's the uncompromising extremists on both sides who are the threat to peace in Ireland. If Brexit undermines the Good Friday Agreement the extremists will seize the moment and that will be the end of peace.If #Brexit threatens the GFI, Brexit must not happen.#newsnight
In the early 1970s there were football hooligans & skinheads who used to go paki-bashing, queer-bashing and student-bashing, and 'mindless hooligans' who vandalised phone boxes. For some obscure reason #Brexit makes me wonder what has become of them.#StopBrexit #FBPE
Consent refused - decisively. A constitutional first but now what? Will Westminster force #Brexit on Scotland? Let's call the whole thing off!  
 to @twickenhamclp - who passed a motion last night calling for the country to be given a #FinalSay on Theresa May's #Brexit deal through either a referendum or a General Election. Inspired to do the same? Get in touch with @Remain_Labour / @Labour4EU
This evening saw the #Scottish Parliament vote for the first time in its history to refuse legislative consent. Passed 93 to 30 to reject European Union (Withdrawal) Bill. Write to your MP NOW & tell them to tell the Tory Govt #HandsOffHolyrood. Plz RT  #Brexit 
RT @Jon_Danzig’s commentary on the need for a new and massive ‘Campaign to Remain’ to persuade Britain to consider a democratic U-turn on #Brexit. Link:

Delighted to be in Westminster for new MP @OrfhlaithBegley’s first contribution. She will bring a youthful dynamic to our team. Robust and lively discussion on #Brexit and other matters. 
BREAKING: The @theRCN - with over 430,000 members - has already warned about the affects of #Brexit on the NHS. Now they are backing a #PeoplesVote on the #Brexit deal. 
We’ve always been clear that one part of the country can’t hold a veto over another when it comes to protecting the vital interests of the whole: Remainers, Scotland, NI, the young etc. Seriously, can the govt hold up a mirror? Or, well, listen to itself? #Brexit 
We are going to stop #Brexit. Whatever it takes, we must do it. We cannot gamble away our children's futures on a gerrymandered weak mandate based on lies and criminal acts.  Time for a #PeoplesVote
Shocking that Theresa May has left her Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, out of negotiations regarding the Customs Union for #Brexit. Even more shocking that Johnson called the PM’s own proposal for a union ‘crazy’. #cabinetinchaos #ExitfromBrexit
As things go from bad to worse for Tory Brexiteers, blame game starts. Current scapegoats; House of Lords. Before them judges, @BBC, Civil Service, CBI, IOD, @FT. @JananGanesh in today's FT gets it right - they’re looking to absolve themselves of responsibility for #Brexit chaos
#HandsOffOurParliament because if Scots cannot be allowed to consent or dissent after #Brexit on matters that affect them and where power is already devolved then Devolution is not worththe paper it’s written on
Well there you have it #Leavers. Your £350m/ week saving promised if you voted for #Brexit not only isn’t a saving at all,  but opens the #NHS to be held to ransom by #Trump. They didn’t put THAT on the bus.
I don't give a flying monkey about the Royal Wedding. What i do care about is the Scottish Parliament being overruled on #brexit. It's time, we're ready. 
One-third of the world's population live in the Commonwealth and this is where we will find future growth. #Brexit provides us with an exciting opportunity to establish new trade deals in these markets benefitting all. Today I was very glad that the Foreign Secretary agreed 
#Brexit Minister @Feorlean said the decision of @ScotParl to withhold consent from the #EUWithdrawalBill means it must now be adjusted to respect the vote : 
The result of the @ScotGov European Union (Withdrawal) Bill Debate is in – yes 93, no 30. The motion is therefore passed and means the @ScotParl does not give its consent for the EU Withdrawal Bill. #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill
Scottish Parliament has formally refused to give consent to the UK Parliament’s Brexit Bill. I am pleased that all parties in the Scottish Parliament, with the exception of the Tories, have done the right thing and choose to defend the 1998 Scotland Act. #Brexit #HolyroodLive
BREAKING - Just moments ago, MSPs rejected the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill. We stood against the extremist #Brexit obsessions of the Tories and their plans for a #DevolutionDemolition as part of their disastrous #Brexit.  Share @Ross_Greer's video to show your support
MSPs have voted 93 to 30, refusing to give consent to the UK Government's EU Withdrawal Bill. #Brexit #DevolutionDemolition
Very glad to see the #PeoplesVote movement building with the trade unions. The more weight we can throw behind this from the grassroots and the unions, the more chance we will get to have the #FinalSay on the #Brexit deal. #FinalSayForAll
Delighted and proud that my union @theRCN will lobby for a #PeoplesVote on any #Brexit deal #RCN18
When Leavers say that a #PeoplesVote is undemocratic just remind them that Farage and the Tory Brexiters were calling for a second referendum - a straight replay, not a vote on the final deal - in the event of a Remain victory. #StopBrexit #Brexit 
Kate Hoey MP - "There are huge upsides of not being in the customs union."We would be able to actually import food at a much cheaper price, we would be able to make trade deals that are going to give us a long-term, better economic future." #Brexit 
In need of romance? Fancy a love story? Check out the love-in between Labour, the Conservatives and UKIP in the National Assembly for #Wales. When it comes to negotiations with UK to protect Wales post-#Brexit, don't just give in... give your whole heart. 
The professional forager we were using is refusing to work with us any more because we're anti-#Brexit. Does anyone know of someone who might want to take their place? We have quite a bit or work for them between now and October.

A wonderful speech from Axel Scheffler about What he, Judith Kerr and all the other Europeans in the UK bring to the arts, culture and education of this country. And after #Brexit? Who knows? Will the Kerrs and Schefflers of the world be turned away?

Tmw (Weds 16 May) is a big day for the public’s health. It’s Third reading of the #EUWithdrawalBill and we’re hoping for further Govt reassurance that the #DoNoHarm duty will remain on our statute book after #Brexit. Here's a reminder of the organisations supporting it  
#Brexit insanity nr. 3962We've now reached the stage that a hard Brexit member of the infamous Tory "European Research Group" wants a significantly softer Brexit than the leader of the Labour Party - Jeremy Corbyn.Reflect on that for a minute. 
Bottom line May has to go, any PM willing to entertain an EU Customs Union or 'Partnership' has no place in high office.God bless the DUP.#Brexit 
As so often, when English runs out of adequate words to describe a disastrous situation, German is on hand to describe what UK Govt wants from #Brexit:  an 'eierlegende Wollmilchsau' ( /ˌaɪ̯ɐ.leːɡəndə ˈvɔl.mɪʊ̯/)

 Scottish Greens believe Scotland’s future is in Europe. We are standing against the extremist #Brexit obsessions of the Tories and their European Union (Withdrawal) Bill.  Like and share and help us say no to the #DevolutionDemolition squad 
Big for Dublin. #Brexit 
Your never ending shit show of mysoginistic bollox isn't stopping me it's just a bloody distraction. So now I've called it out, please go and stew in your own cretinous juices because I've got better things to do  like stopping #Brexit.  
Another type of Cambridge Analytica abuse of customer data will be fineable from 25 May 2018, to the tune of up to €20m or 4% of WW turnover. Was the #Brexit Referendum manipulated by tech giant technology?
'Losing free movement will be a huge blow to young Brits (in the UK & EU 27). I’m from Gloucester and, as things stand, Old Spot Pork and Double Gloucester cheese will be able to travel more easily across EU borders than I will'. #Brexit #brexodus
We should stop using #Gammon and start being straight.  These people are hate filled xenophobic racists who don't give a fig for the negative consequences of #Brexit,  so long as they don't have to hear Polish spoken in Greggs when they buy their lunchtime pasties.
Thanks for your hard work. Sorry to see you go #Brexit 
His father was a communist who hated Britain. Despite being a refugee from the Nazi terror, he kept praying for Britain's defeat. The sneer on his face says it all. #Brexit 
Today Labour and the Lib Dem’s will vote with the SNP to further the nationalist interest rather than the national interest. Only the @ScotTories are defending the integrity of the UK. Nicola Sturgeon has refused to compromise and prefers to pick a fight than make a deal #Brexit 
#Fisheries having second thoughts about #Brexit ? 
It is amazing that any country is willing to watch so many of its brightest and best opt for citizenship of different countries. I see so many young now doing this as well as many business owners on top of the EU staff. #brexit #braindrain is real.
#NigelFarage: ‘Dishonest #DavidMiliband should go back to #NewYork’. “He now defines a hard #Brexit as anything that isn’t full regulatory alignment with the #EuropeanUnion. “That is a completely dishonest interpretation of the Brexit result.”  #BBC #SKY
If Scottish Parliament votes to withhold legislative consent to Clause 11 of #Brexit Bill, then Westminster over-rules it to proceed with #PowerGrab @IanBlackfordMP should lead all @theSNP MP's out of HoC in protest (& consider staying out)Then @nicolasturgeon declare #indyref2
Remainers have loved to claim that any UK economic slowdown is #Brexit related without realising that it is a global issue as poor German data shows 
Looking forward to working closely with @FedericaMog on a new partnership with the UK on foreign and security policy after #Brexit 
Scottish Parliament set to formally refuse consent to key UK #Brexit legislation in unprecedented move 
#brexit Where is the guardian pipsqueak weasel  crybaby  today. Stop putting him on  &  everyday OK. Owen Jones backed Labour lost, Hillary Clinton lost, stay in the EU lost. Never got prediction right ever. No one gives a monkey’s what the crybaby, says about anything. 
Anyone I hear say they could live with Border checks post #brexit don't;1 - do business across border2 - travel across it3 - live near it
Joining the European Economic Area is the least-worst #Brexit. But it is still far worse than remaining a member of the EU so we can democratically decide the rules we operate under. #StopBrexit #PeoplesEurope
We put the question #HowWillBrexitBenefitMe to @TulipSiddiq. Her reply was very familiar, almost 2 years since the vote, we're still waiting to hear one way in which #Brexit will benefit the people of the #UK. #SODEMaction #StopBrexitSaveBritain #WATON
‘Unbelievable’ that former head of civil service thinks that May’s Brexit plan “undeliverable”. Who’d have thought it, Whitehall trying to stop #Brexit. 
If #Brexit happens, the only people smiling will be a handful of racists and a small group of fanatical or indifferent billionaires. The rest of us will be poorer: financially, culturally, socially and spiritually.Time for a #PeoplesVote
Exclusive - Jumping ship: Brexit-hit EU staff ditch UK passports  #brexit #braindrain
No-one voted to be poorer and no-one voted for this shambolic mishandling of #Brexit either.It's time for MPs to step up to the plate. 
Don’t kid yourself, it is time to wake up. #Brexit is a con, a distraction. There is no upside to it. Just look at the so called £350m for the NHS  We are wasting time rather than working on the real issues we need to face in this country. 
“The Brits are perfectly capable of managing the Brits and don't need Brussels telling them how to manage things. I just don't believe in the concept of a United States of Europe. It's not viable." #BREXIT 
Wrote this article about the EEA Agreement and why Britain should stay away from it after #Brexit. @BrexitCentral
Extraordinary threadA string of personal attacks & accusations against David Miliband because he happens to take a different view from Corbyn on #BrexitEverything twisted into a perceived attack on the leaderOnce they get going it's indistinguishable from UKIP back in the day 
Take heart people of Britain: however great #Brexit’s demonstrable harm may be, it is easily outweighed by the many benefits that we are mysteriously unable to specify.
Honey Goombs had to get one more thing off her chest before bed... she likes a long schmacko #brexit 
Bring your second referendum Remainers. I will destroy every argument you have.#Brexit
4. The strongest argument for #Brexit is not a left wing argument nor a right wing argument. Michael Foot whose politics are a million miles from my own is as relevant now as ever. 
If what is attributed to Theresa May is accurate it would suggest the British government should call a border poll? #Brexit 
For failed politicians like David Miliband, conspiring against #Brexit is a chance to have power again, writes @timothy_stanley
It seems very unfair to me that there are potentially millions of younger voting age people in the UK, who had no say on whether we leave the EU. They are the ones who will suffer the most from this #Brexit balls up, yet they are absolutely powerless to stop it.
Until 2016, Sergey Gorkov was a senior executive at Sberbank, overseeing the Kremlin-linked bank’s acquisition of foreign assets.Jacob Rees-Mogg's firm Somerset Asset Management has a £57m stake in Sberbank.Trump, Russia, #Brexit - it's a small world.@Byline_Media @peterjukes

Somewhere out there there's a village missing an idiot.#Brexit 
NOTHING to see here, but (as predicted some time ago) the #Brexit talks on Gibraltar have hit buffers over Spanish demands for police at the airport. Spain might not be using Brexit to make sovereignty claim, but it wants a lot. 
Well done @nick_clegg, @NickyMorgan01 & @DMiliband! Politicians of conviction not consensus! We must continue the fight to stop this disastrous #Brexit regardless of personal political affiliations. Very brave from @NickyMorgan01 whom I personally know is a principled politician.
It is imperative our leaders led Britain out of the EU within the next couple of years.Barnier's Article50 clock may be ticking,but when the time-bomb of Britons' patience explodes,the electoral carnage for the Tories and Labour will be catastrophic!#Brexit 
What #brexit priorities? Who set them? Where they on the ballot? Have they been debated at a Labour conference?  Are they in any manifesto?No.  They're Corbyn's hidden "socialism in one nation" siege economy priorities 
Bora here voted leave in protest against govt and establishment but now he has seen the effect of Brexit has had on the economy and does not see how #brexit will make life in the U.K. any better.@therealjonshaw  to you. Many others feel like you but great to talk about it! 
The majority of @UKLabour members oppose any form of #Brexit. If Corbyn cannot represent those members he should go. 
When 80% of the press by circulation peddles the same pro-ERG & pro-Brexit propaganda, we do not have a free press, we have a manipulated press serving one political faction. Britain is well on the way to becoming a failed democracy.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
During the referendum, Nick Clegg was clear that #Brexit meant leaving the single market. As was David Miliband. Their attempt today to pretend they never said this is why people hate politicians. 
Labour frontbencher @PreetKGillMP deletes tweet backing fresh referendum on #Brexit deal‘I hear you and agree that a people’s vote on the deal is an absolute must’ Where are the brave & courageous MPs we need during the greatest crisis for the nation since 1945?#StopBrexit
Fascinating thread on the reappearance of "Taxpayers alliance" right wing/#Brexit think tank all over @BBCNews programs.Why? What are their qualifications? Who do they represent? Reality is, there's a small pool of those willing to support #Brexit so BBC will have anyone on 
Unsurprised to hear that #Brexit has lead to a 26% drop in professional migration to the UK, according to LinkedIn. The Government is preventing the UK from accessing the skills we need to grow our economy! 
I can only imagine the volume of #Brexit hate mail & worse being sent to the office of @NickyMorgan01  V well done Nicky for having courage to share cross-party platform & say publicly what many of your Tory MP colleagues will only say privately (for now).  Country before party.
Ever heard Humphrys ask Nigel Lawson: "You live in France. You're even a “Mousquetaire d’Armagnac”!  What's #Brexit to you?"#r4today
There is a #Brexit option that doesn't damage the economy, where the UK decides how to spend its money, where the UK controls its borders and makes its own laws and also retains its sovereignty.It's very simple option and it saves billions.....It's the #StopBrexit option.
Excellent piece by @eloisetodd on  how MPs can serve democracy and stand up for the national interest - by telling the truth about the ‘disaster’ that is #Brexit

Speech by @MichelBarnier today, together with @FedericaMog, @EU_ISS on “The future of EU foreign, security and defence policy post #Brexit” 
New polling from @YouGov. 69% of all Brits think #Brexit is going badly. Half of all Leave voters think Brexit is going badly. The case for a #PeoplesVote could not be stronger and #Labour MPs can play a huge part in making it happen. pic.twitter.com/nGFrGCteDR
#Brexit - @MichelBarnier together with @FedericaMog delivered aspeech on the future relationship with the UK in foreign, security and defencepolicy, @EUISS conference. Full text here: Key messages to follow.
‘Dame Tessa Jowell was everything the Boris Johnsons of this world are not: loyal, committed to the greater good and a team player. How Mrs May must long to look around a cabinet table of people she can trust.’ - Andrew Vine in tomorrow’s The Yorkshire Post. #brexit 
The EU appears to have thrown any and every obstacle in the way of Britain's smooth departure. They fear that Britain outside the union will thrive and so encourage other members to follow suit. #Brexit 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "What makes the Lords think they know better. What is the superior mystical wisdom that gives them a greater insight than the British people?" #Brexit 
Barnsley lady says "they should be sent back to their country - but not in a bad way". Such is the banality of evil. This is one more reason why we must fight to #StopBrexit. Such thoughtless evil (and I  can find no other word) should not be rewarded. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Daniel Hannan MEP - "The Customs Union pushes up food bills and clothing bills for people who have to spend the highest percentage of their income on those basic commodities."It is an immoral and inefficient system." #Brexit 
Here’s Owen, he voted leave but like so so many others he’s now changed his mind. He now regularly replies to tweets on #brexit opposing it.@OwenTomkins respect to you for speaking out. #brexit is not inevitable & UK can change course, have you written to your MP?#remainernow
Glad to see Dan Hannan calling for a #PeoplesVote at the end of the #brexit process. @peoplesvote_uk
I oppose a hard Brexit & always have but there is a difference between getting the best workable arrangements and undermining #Brexit by mirroring EU membership. But still friends @BarrySheerman
Thx .@TulipSiddiq. Every day @SODEMAction protests against the madness of Rees-Mogg's ERG (Economic Ruin Group), which is pushing for the harshest hard #Brexit with Taliban-like fervour, in complete disregard of the national interest & our future generations.Time to #StopBrexit
Today #EU27 ministers discuss progress in #Brexit negotiations.Withdrawal agreement, political declaration, future relations… Confused? Here is a brief sum-up More info: 
@FedericaMog and @MichelBarnier discuss the future of #EUdiplomacy and #EUdefence after #Brexit 
What second referendum? David Miliband cannot call for one because he disagrees with the outcome. Enough of this anti-democratic and offensive nonsense.The Government was clear it was a “once in a lifetime” #Brexit referendum 
So Damian Green proposes we tack on a 'bolt-on' period of a few years on top of the current transition period before we Brexit.And then an extension, a prolongation & a protraction... till we leave the EU in what 2080? Can Britons ever trust politicians again?#Brexit 
Anyone else see it ?  .... Pinko & Berky !!!#Brexit #LeaveEU
“Almost two years after the #Brexit vote we need no more stalling, no more play acting and no name calling. We need to hear solutions to Brexit from British Gov.” @MaryLouMcDonald
The #EEA option - Norway Plus - is seen by some as a #Brexit lifeboat; but it is still far inferior to #EU membership. In typically lucid style, @GuitarMoog explains #EU withdrawal is by no means a done deal; there is a definite path to its being avoided.
Brexit is a complete and utter mess. Remainers know it. Brexiters with buyer's remorse know it. Even the government knows it. So @jeremycorbyn - in the national interest of protecting millions of jobs, can you now please call for a second EU referendum? #FBPE #Brexit 
1. So the Norway option is back in the game. It's the one #Brexit approach that can work without a body blow to the economy. It's the only real way to avoid a cliff edge. Without it we will probably see an implosion of regulatory systems and this will simply stop working.
In his inaugural lecture ‘And then there was #Brexit: EU law before and after the referendum’, Professor Phil Syrpis discussed the role of a Professor of #EU Law in the light of the referendum. Listen to the full lecture here: 
WHY is the PM issuting a statement saying that " the Uk has no plans to move it's Embassy from Tel Aviv "OH I get it !It's to distract our attention from the chaos of #Brexit, the shambles of her Cabinet - and to appear *strong & stable* !We are NOT fooled Theresa  !
"The prospects that were dangled in front of people at the time of Brexit, I think, look very different today" - ex-Labour foreign secretary David Miliband urges MPs take back control of #Brexit
This is #Brexit Britain. A mean spiteful inhospitable narrow-minded little country on the cold grey northwestern fringes of Europe.Bring back humanity and care to Britain #StopBrexit!
People all over the UK are coming out in support of a #PeoplesVote on the final #Brexit deal. Here's a photo of campaigners in Norfolk talking about @peoplesvote_uk at the weekend.Join them, and thousands more, on the March for a People's Vote on June 23
Look at this photo below.It’s the new high tech Japanese robotics factory in Slovenia.It’s just being finished in order to transfer production from Cumbernauld “back into the EU”.We were told this would happen.It’s now happening.Thanks #brexit voters. 
David Milliband doing what Jeremy Corbyn should've been doing & has failed miserably to do.STAND UP FOR THE COUNTRY & OPPOSE!He's demonstrating how this #Brexit is unworkable & can only fail...he's not complicit...he's not an ideologue..Binding #FinalSay #StopBrexitSaveBritain
“I voted Brexit because I thought it would hurt OTHER people, not me!” has not (yet) become a flourishing genre. Could it? #Brexit 
The Minister responsible for implementing the "hostile environment" policy during her 6 years as Home Secretary is now asking us to "trust" her on #Brexit!
Kier Starmer:"What’s the future of the relationship with the EU?What should it look like?”It will look like being OUT of the #EU !NO EU feesNO EU Customs UnionNO EU Single MarketNO EU lawsNO Freedom of MovementUK fishing waters returned#Brexit
Nearly two years after the #Brexit referendum, Business Secretary Greg Clark visits the Norway/Sweden border, to see how it works. You have to admire the urgency of the Tory government.
So the #Brexit debate is now about which part of our foot to shoot ourselves in versus shooting the whole foot.This is ludicrous.To not shoot oneself in the foot at all is by far the best route forward.We must have a #PeoplesVote and #StopBrexit
The #Brexit flight has begun!We need to #ExitFromBrexit via a #PeoplesVote referendum sooner rather than later.
The country's being quietly shorted.And guess who'll suffer the most?Workers.#Brexit 
A.C. Grayling - Now I'm going to be entirely neutral about #Brexit & just say I think it's a bloody stupid idea & most people would agree with that sentiment & probably say I'm expressing myself rather mildly...#StopBrexit #FBPE @acgrayling
For more on the #Brexit money men and their extensive offshore interests, see this site from @MollyMEP.Their veneer of patriotism is a fraud, as is their pretence that Brexit is a revolt against the global elite.

.@NickBoles we’re representing views of British business & TUC. It’s time for realistic solutions to deliver #Leave whilst doing the least harm to our economy & maintaining peace in N Ireland. As #DavidMiliband observes we cannot he held to ransom by Hard #Brexit ideologues 
Head of MI5 says closer cooperation with EU countries essential, because of threat of Russia and Daesh. Tories press for disastrous hard #Brexit. Insanity rules in Government.
The state of John Humphrys.Asking David Miliband why he has a right to comment on #Brexit as he works in New York.Has he ever asked Nigel Lawson, domiciled in France for decades, such a question?Or asked Rees-Mogg about why he conducts so much business offshore?#r4today

Let’s not forget that #Brexit problems are not just big things like the #CustomsUnion , but also a whole load of little things that will hurt, annoy or cost us in many different ways:
BBC News - Store footfall in 'unprecedented' decline. The U.K. economy could rapidly re-bound if we abandoned the failed #Brexit idea. It is costing the country dearly and we haven't left yet. #PeoplesVote
#brexit David Miliband joining up with Nick Clegg & Nicky Morgan. To stop a hard Brexit. From the man who earns £425,000 a year working for a charity. He’s that bad he couldn’t even beat his horrendous, useless brother to become Labour leader. 3 clowns  together FFS 
Well said @Jeremy_Hunt @BBCr4today critical #Brexit Cabinet discussions should stay in Cabinet & collective responsibility should be respected.  Jeremy didn’t say it but we were all thinking it - #BeltUpBoris
"EU's falling share of world exports." Sad EU export decline in just 15 years, revealed by #Brexit .  UK must NOT be tied to this failing institution.  Summary report: 
IS QUITALY GETTING CLOSER? Eurozone's 3rd-largest country to get Eurosceptic govt today.  Read #Brexit story: .  Please support our work for a clean #Brexit! 
Navy chiefs get go-ahead for £1.5billion hunter-killer submarine HMS Agincourt to boost our forces in a post #Brexit world.It will be confirmed by @GavinWilliamson at a visit to BAE Systems’ base at Barrow, Cumbria.
That illusion when you think your train is moving but it’s actually the train next to you, and yours is standing still? Goodbye Europe.#Brexit
The next voting generation is out in full force, extolling the benefits of the EU and demanding a #PeoplesVote on any #Brexit deal. 
A brief nod towards impending refusal of #LCM to #EUWithdrawalBill on @BBCWestminHour. Damien Green misrepresents opposition as purely @theSNP when it’s cross party except the Tories.  He is left uncorrected & sadly there’s no voice from the 3rd party #Brexit
100% correct.But the #NHS will be asset-stripped as a result of #Brexit. 
Now here's a thing. The most detailed UK radio interview I've done so far on #brexit & the Irish border & backstop options & all was on Love Sport Radio from London! Thank you @phildobbie
"I was scared of #Brexit and the dark... It's a #UKIP style nightmare of my dreams... Stop this unfair Westminster centric rule, put funding into regions the #NHS and our schools!" #StopBrexit #SheswithEU
Another important step to securing a #Brexit that puts jobs and growth first.  
It’s getting late, but it’s time to play tough with Brussels:  #Brexit
a year ago I wrote a blog about how the PM had yet to do anything to earn the nation's trust on #brexit 
Someone please inform the #EU that Keir Starmer IS NOT the government of the UK nor does he have any authority to be negotiating anything to do with #Brexit 
Nearly 2 years later, we face 4 options of which 1 is clearly defined. Share away!What kind of a #Brexit do you want?
"Gammon" is basically a sneer at middle aged men. Fathers, grandfathers, husbands, sons. It's a spit of bile at the everyday voter. The butt of every radio 4 "comedy" slot joke. An institutional contempt more responsible for #Brexit than any bus. 
John Redwood: Technology at Irish BorderGood News!It's all up and running for non EU trade already!We can just use current methods to deal with border issues after we've left.The so called Irish border "problem" is just an EU put up job.#Brexit #EU
1971 Foreign Office document advised the British government to cover up the realities of EU membership so that by the time the public realised what was happening 'it would be too late':  #Brexit
Greek proverb quoted by Will Hutton: A society grows great when old men plant trees in whose shadow they know they will never sit. [Just the opposite of #Brexit and Tory govt policy generally.]
Demographic change makes it very likely that there will soon be a big pro-EU majority. I do not think they will look very kindly on politicians who have dragged Britain out of the EU. I think rather that those politicians will face a very uncomfortable day of reckoning.#Brexit
Same in the UK.The swamp are trying to take down #Brexit.On both sides of the Atlantic we must stay strong to ensure that the swamp don't win.Our democracy is in the balance. 
Huh?  “UK To Host EU Summit”-@independent#Brexit
What. The. Actual. Fuck.  #Brexit hypocrisy just hit new levels of stupid.  #StopBrexit
Britain has a £82 billion trade deficit with the EU (2016)Whereas Germany has a trade surplus of at least £99 billion with rEU each year.Who is it here that benefits from the EU customs union and single market?#Brexit#NoCustomsTrap
The Salisbury Convention came about in 1945 to allow Labour push through nationalisation, a manifesto promise, past a Tory-filled Lords.Now actively working at Lords to defy the Convention, how can Labour make any moral claim to abiding by Constitutional principles?#Brexit 
If Adolph Hitler had had #Brexit as a weapon, he could have neutered the UK without a Navy, Army or Airforce. #Brexit is the weapon your enemy wished he had in his arsenal.
Even in a world festooned with ignorance, this takes some beating, but it shows the mindset of people prepared to go over the edge on the back of ideology. Extraordinary drivel @spectator #brexit "Why should we give in to EU blackmail over the EU border?"  
#Brexit: #Brussels set to push for six-month extension to UK's transition period out of #EU 
Sad to see @theSNP absent from an otherwise very good morning of TV politics coverage. With refusal of #LCM on #EUWithdrawalBill & consequent constitutional crisis looming it seems odd that the party of @scotgov & third party at WM shd be overlooked #Brexit
The #Brexit vote goes against the natural, “progressive”, liberal route the global liberal establishment expect of countries. It’ll be always be “a racist vote” no matter how many times they’re told because they must discredit it. I advise white Brits to response: ‘Whatever!’ 
Right let’s get this some coverage and shut up the Remainers once and for all.It’s clear that the Establishment and the media are covering this vital fact up, while still claiming we can’t #Brexit & will have to remain half in the EU..@theresa_may @SkyNews @LBC @BBCNews #bbcsp
I see the DUP’s key consensus builder is at it again! Expecting the British Govt to stick to an agreement is not “Brit bashing” #brexit 
There is a #Brexit crisis coming. #HMG seem unable to live up to the commitments it  gave in December & March. Must think the #EU will blink. Will not happen so best have crisis in June rather than October when it is too late.
Sorry @JennyChapman - this isn't good enough. #Brexit will hit hardest those who have least. It will deepen division and damage communities. @UKLabour can and must do better. A #PeoplesVote is what the majority of our members want and what the country needs.
Interesting interview / article by @Fearghaloc in today’s @TheSundayIndo about @RademonDistil in Northern Ireland, their future plans and challenges for Northern Irish Distillers from #Brexit . 
.@Cornwall4EU were out in #Wadebridge yesterday asking people what they thought of the #Brexit process so far and if they'd like to see a #PeoplesVote on any final deal.The response was pretty striking, as shown on their #Brexitometer.#Cornwall
37% (not enough for a public sector strike) of a rigged electorate in an advisory referendum mis-sold as mandatory for a vacuous 4 word slogan, narrowly won by electoral chicanery and a torrent of tax-dodging #Brexit billionaire press hate & lies.A mandate for chaos!#StopBrexit
These are definitely not giant buttons. #brexit? 
IDS honest and consistent as ever on #bbcsp. Asked about BoJo describing customs plan as crazy: “I think we should step back from emotive language.” Asked about Tory MPs voting against hard #Brexit: “They literally plunge a knife into the heart of gov’t and the Prime Minister.”
How is the PM writing an article saying she’s in charge reassuring?Lost Tories their majorityDoesn’t control her cabinetCan’t agree a #Brexit planSeems totally disinterested in social issues facing the UKWhat actually is she in charge of? Answers on a post card please
Read and share: Co-chair @C_Stihler_MEP in today's Scotland on Sunday - if we fail to support the EEA #Brexit option and choose to sacrifice so many jobs, we don't deserve to call ourselves the Labour Party. 
Lexiters, face the world as it is, not as you wish it were. 9 of the 11 **most equal countries in the world** are in the EU and the 10th (Norway) is in the single market. Important #Brexit reading from @NickCohen4 
As @Jon_Danzig writes, 'We now know more about #Brexit than we knew before. And in a few months time, we will know much more, including details of the final Brexit deal. That’s why there needs to be a new vote on Brexit. The #PeoplesVote.' Please RT.
Sadly, @theresa_may, I can’t help you “take back control”. On the contrary, I’ll do anything I can to continue to challenge the folly of #Brexit that you yourself don’t believe in. I’m with the million students who today also pledge to take back control of their future #MayPledge
#DINO would be bad for Britain - we need a #Brexit that works for everyone in #UK #ProsperityPeace
#brexit is so important, but fuck, I am bored to tears by the platitudes and guff. Let's talk about the poor, kids who need education, our streets that need protecting, our patients who need treating and our old folk who deserve decent care.
On the contrary, in the national interest, it is imperative that we all pull together to do everything we can to stop the insanity that is #Brexit.
In a free and fair referendum the people of the U.K. voted to leave the EU. To take back control of our laws, our money and our borders . The PM @theresa_may sets out how the @Conservatives Government will deliver on the instructions of the people  #Brexit 
I agree with much of this @GerryHassan particularly that we need “an all encompassing debate... about strategy & tactics” & not just about timing however I still see the #Brexit transitional period as a good time for #indyref2 but we need to be ready first
“The British people voted for economic suicide and that’s exactly what they’re getting” @michaelgove on #brexit progress 
My recent interview with @SODEMAction outside of Parliament on - Why we must not give up the fight against #Brexit.RT if you agree. 
More lies from @michaelgove. It’s all he excels at. All but the deluded and ignorant can see the #Brexit process was and is a shambles.It all belongs entirely to the @CONservatives.  #Marr
Labour’s #Brexit position! Northern Labour Brexit voters... you are being betrayed. Corbyn’s Labour only care about London#Marr
Good bloody grief. Read it and weep: Ireland the "lapdog" of the EU, the Good Friday Agreement is "not holy writ", "the whole conundrum is contrived". The Spectator on the Border. #Marr #Brexit
The Observer: One million students call for a vote on the Brexit deal.They are right. The first EU referendum was an advisory vote based on no details.We need a second EU referendum on the actual details. Failure to do so would be a failure of democracy.#Brexit #peoplesvote
Welcome to delusional time with @jamieoliver who blames #Brexit on..... wait for it...? for #British Fat #children! It would be hard to Find a more ridiculous #antiBrexit headline! #JamieOliver a man for all sorts of #STUPID! #BBC #SKY #LBC @LBC @ConHome #Tory #UK #EU
#Marr The #Brexiters parroting their line of “taking back control of our money, borders, laws and trade” are sounding a bit tired. In fact, #Brexit means LESS control of all of them: 
My cartoon - so you’re saying the idea Britain could become great again by leaving the largest trading bloc in the world came to you in a vision?#Brexit#Marr
Yeah right. Just cancel it. The referendum was rigged. We've read the report. No one from the #remain camp is going to accept there is a mandate for any kind of #brexit now. Stop being complicit, #stopbrexit #FBPE
Those most in favour of #Brexit seem to be good at indignantly demanding it, brilliant at alienating those whose goodwill they need to avoid the most catastrophic versions and terrible at pretty much everything else.
Blaming Remainers for the present #Brexit debacle is unfair, but I would concede this much: the people with the skills and experience necessary to actually deliver a project like this are largely against it. Constantly stigmatising them as an elite isn’t tempting them to help.
The #DeepState are trying to bring down @realDonaldTrump & #BrexitWe can't let them win.Our democracy is under threat from the powerful & wealthy, who think they know better than us plebs.
I've updated that #Eurovision points chart, to include potential for a Trade Deal post-#Brexit.They'll rue the day they crapped on our cheesy efforts at melody. 
"I will not let you down."You already have, by putting party before people & country + destroying our youth's opportunities through your bloodyminded #Brexit.Who is PM anyway? You, or fascist Rees-Mogg?Only way to redeem yourself is to hold a #PeoplesVote this autumn.#Vote100
I, along with the other 48%, did not vote for #Brexit - so my pledge to you is simple.  I will do everything to destroy your plans for your Brexit.Btw - that 48% is now 60%.  And that 60% will ensure you and the #Tories are never in government for a generation.
"All EU Project fears,fiddles & threats:All HoL self serving arrogance:Alll remain nastiness, haven’t put #Brexit voters off leaving the EU. We want Brexit settled & won’t B humiliated or sold down the river.Any gov, or MP which helps EU 2do that will b sentenced at ballot box.
Theresa May has been sent a stark warning by Tory activists that the Conservative party “will not be trusted for a generation” if she fails in the #Brexit negotiations. 
Predictably enough, the so-called #Brexit “war cabinet” has become the Brexit “civil war cabinet”.... 
Simon here voted leave as a protest against some of the bits of the EU he didnt like as he thought #Remain would win anyway. He now sees the harm the #brexit is causing & what it’s unleashed and is quite clearly a #remainernow#peoplesvote@TheNewEuropean

They might not like us, but they all speak & sing in our language.. #Eurovision #Brexit 
We already are....... #BREXIT 
This thread  will resonate with so many leave voters who are #remainernow Surely with all these broken promises we must have a #peoplesvote once final #brexit deal is known?

#Eurovision The true cost of #Brexit is emerging.
United Kingdom: Give us 1pt, Europe! Europe: #Eurovision #Brexit
Can't wait until #brexit is blamed for the UK finishing bottom at #Eurovision
Never mind #Brexit. Pull out of #eurovision? YES!
#Brexit the gift that keeps on giving...#NilPoints #Eurovison
That’s it. Europe hates us  #Eurovision2018 #brexit 
Feels like the UK Gov could let slip that #brexit is cancelled, The NHS will recieve adequate funding and that Boris Johnson is fired and no-one would notice right now.The real question we must all ask.. what are the government up to during Eurovision?Massive conspiracy..
I cannot BELIEVE the EU has banned us from voting for our own country because of #Brexit. So spiteful. This is why we need to take back control. #Eurovision2018
Brexit is 10 months away. Wales has apparently disempowered itself and handed the reigns to these folks. #Brexit #devolution #BloodyHell
Please let #UK @surieofficial win as hosting #Eurovision two months after #Brexit would be delicious

An interesting article arguing that the xenophobes don't so much want to expel migrants as push them back into a lower status than the natives. EU citizenship offering an equal status is therefore a red-rag to the xenophobic bull.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Really well recovered SuRie #GBR #EUROVISION2018 Brother Don’t Give Up - let’s make that the tune of @peoplesvote_uk ! We aren’t out yet and we can stop #Brexit
I do hope Britain wins. Just for the sheer awkwardness of hosting #Eurovision six weeks after #Brexit. #GBR #awkward
I see #Brexit supporters are at it again, claiming we never do well in #Eurovision2018 because rest of Europe is biased against Britain. In fact, #Britain has had more top two #Eurovision finishes (20, including 5 wins) than any other country. Second is #Ireland (11, incl 7 wins)
So the UK entry is basically a call to arms against #Brexit? I can get onboard with that #eurovision

What @JamesConnington  can't say in @Telegraph is only the 2 world wars have been more catastrophic for UK business than #Brexit #PeoplesVote @Labour4EU @EK_EuropeanMove "Global investors have withdrawn from UK in droves" Any guesses why James? #awfuljournalism
David Davis promised #brexit trade deals worth 10x the EU single market or approximately twice world economic output. This means either he has discovered extra terrestrials and is negotiating trade  deals with other planet or he's a clueless lying  fraud.

This is the worst tweet I've read all week. #FBPE people understand exactly what #Brexit is, and why as a matter of principle it should be opposed, as well as all the practical, economic, personal, democratic, and ideological reasons it should be opposed.
All the big outsourcing firms will go broke soon. Capita losing billions. Nothing the Tories have done has worked out. We must be patient like Corbyn, it’s a waiting game. The Tories are self combusting. #AcadamySchools #Carillion #Skripals #Brexit 
Peter Bone MP - "I have sympathy for Remainers in that position, and there are some, I do think counselling would be a good idea."Maybe leaving the country would help as well." #Brexit

One of the very best #Brexit summaries long seen. From a closed Facebook group I'm in, so I protect my source. #BrexitWasBrexit and it's important for MPs to understand that people are not going to accept it. It's a #5timesNO!

1/ A soft #Brexit would lead to chronic instability. The right-wing and their press allies would rant and rage about being a vassal state, while Remainers also angered by our rule-taker status would press hard to rejoin the EU.
Grassroots Tories warn Theresa May the Conservative party 'will not be trusted for a generation' if she 'fudges' #Brexit
#Brexit has turned out to be a shit sandwich and the #Leave camp know know it, hence they're crawling from under their rocks to blame #Remainers.Sorry chaps, it's shit sandwich of your making. You're going to have to man up and swallow it yourselves. Enjoy.
I am more worried by the political than the economic consequences of #Brexit. If Brexit happens it will demonstrate that a wealthy and powerful elite can use the politics of lies, fear, hate, scapegoating & nationalist hysteria to manipulate British politics.#StopBrexit #FBPE
2 slogans which might be useful as memes against right-wing Brexiters, given that patriotic pride is dear to them:There is no patriotic Brexit. #Brexit is what an enemy would do to Britain.Brexit is making Britain into a global laughing-stock. Restore pride #StopBrexit.
The truth is #brexit has no rationality, it is rooted in a fictional narrative of imperial exceptionalism. It's arrogance based on fantasy. That's why it is so dangerous.That is why it must be stopped. 
Hilarious joke from @RCorbettMEP to conclude at #millennifest  "How many #Brexit ministers does it take to change a light bulb? 1 to promise a brighter future and the rest to screw it up."

This pre-EU Referendum piece by Daniel Hannan about post-Brexit Britain will work would be very funny, were it not so tragic. The half of it that was not rubbish then also looks rubbish now. #Brexit 
Grassroots Tories warn Theresa May the Conservative party 'will not be trusted for a generation' if she 'fudges' Brexit - After 340 years more likely to be eviscerated - an annihilation if Tories fail to deliver the #Brexit we voted for
1. Plenty of people are talking about the serious threat #Brexit poses to the economy as though remaining was an entirely consequence free decision. It certainly wasn't. By voting to remain we might very well have deferred one or two problems but they would only ambush us later.

.@UN envoy condemns growing culture of racism in the UK since #Brexit vote 
The Conservatives and Labour are two sects of the same cargo cult.  They both insist that a unicorn-filled utopia will spontaneously emerge if the UK burns itself to the ground with #Brexit.  Remainers are cast as the amagogotya; the non-believers who threaten their prophecy.
Stone Staffordshire. Brit over from France to visit his mum. Car with French plates vandalised. Local Police advised there had been a spate of attacks on foreign registered vehicles and racist graffiti appearing. #Brexit let the racist genie out the bottle. 
As #brexit falls off the rails the #Brexiters are getting more desperate, their rhetoric more violent, their words more abusive and insulting to society.  Their trolls are sinking to new levels. The pressure is rising. I sense tension in the air, it is a dangerous atmosphere
"17.4million people voted to Leave the EU. How many people have ever voted for you? Zero. And yet you think it is your right to thwart the biggest mandate in our history." @Tom_Slater_ debates #Brexit with the Lib Dems' Lords leader.
So easy & cheap to pin the blame for #Brexit on @JeremyCorbyn. But not one of these clowns can tell us HOW Jeremy can stop it. Because he can’t. They just don’t want JC in power and that’s what it is really about. Brexit belongs entirely to the Tories.
Neil Kinnock first inspired me at a rally in #Barry #Vale when I was a kid - now his powerful words are doing the same again speaking up against this reckless Tory hard #Brexit @laboursinglemkt @WalesForEurope @Open_Britain @peoplesvote_uk
This is the ridiculous perception of international organizations the man behind #brexit has. Says it all really. 
Corbyn won't listen to Neil Kinnock.Will he listen to the TUC, who say #Brexit threatens 100,000 jobs  in the North-East?About the same number of mining jobs were lost in the NE between 1981 & 2004 {101,000).The effects were devastating.
Next month will be the two year anniversary of the #Brexit vote. Two years on and still not heard a single tangible and measurable benefit that the ordinary man in the street will get from leaving the EU. Millions of #Leavers out there, surely somebody has a benefit they will get

Try saying this in the @HouseofCommons & you’ll be howled down by a braying mob of Tories so it’s good to hear the #UN Special Rapporteur on #Racism tell it how it is. #Windrush is just the tip of the iceberg #Brexit 
Good to see @UKLabour leadership fully on board with the cross party campaign led by @theSNP to protect Scotland’s devolved settlement from #EUWithdrawalBill.  Time for @ScotTories to reconsider #Brexit 
Saturday's Times: "UK 'more racist after #Brexit'" #tomorrowspaperstoday
1) An absolutely cracking exposure of @DanielJHannan and his #Brexit foolishness.  This is what happens when you spend your life campaigning to only to destroy something, and when you are prepared to lie with dogs to get the win.
Today a leading #Brexit *economist* sd Brexit will screw us for 10yrs, but we shld lie back & think of England, the good we're doing our country & the world.They're not pretending anymore. #Brexit is openly presented like a medieval religion: suffer for the greater good.NO THX 
Saturday's Independent: "Kinnock attacks Corbyn's 'leftist illusion' on #Brexit" (via @hendopolis)  #tomorrowspaperstoday
If the civil service stopped trying to fight #Brexit and just got on with it, things would be going a lot better for Number 10. 
It's not just that Putin tried to interfere in our elections and #Brexit. It's also that he used fear of refugees, fake 'rape' allegations and Islamphobia to do it. I really don't get why some otherwise honourable people are so complacent about this. 
Electoral Commission found the Leave campaign overspending by 70 grand the limits imposed on expenditure while campaigning for #Brexit That same commission saw nothing wrong when Blair & Co overspent by about 10 million using cash for peerages to win the general election in 2005.
I see Remainers got upset that I mentioned that all kiddies fiddlers are against #Brexit It didn't upset them when their like branded all those who voted to leave the EU racists, haters, homophobes and Islamophobes. That sounded perfectly normal for these sick and twisted loons.
We knew the #Brexit #Referendum was (narrowly) won on the basis of a pack of lies and with a questionable franchise. We recently learned about data abuse. And now we know the #Leave campaign cheated on the spending...
Balance of power in #Labour increasingly looks to me like backing - or at least not obstructing - final #Brexit deal TMay brings back. If so, she's home free.
Should we have a #FinalSayForAll on the final #BrexitDeal? Retweet Poll.#EU #Brexit #UK
Super bright and super brave. A great parliamentarian and defender of liberty and justice. Dominic Grieve talking sense as ever #Brexit #PeoplesVote #EU #EEA #CustomsUnion
And they tried to tell us Putin had no impact on #Brexit. Look again... @J_amesp @carolecadwalla
This happened when @MarkCarruthers7 asked Jacob Rees-Mogg whether he's visited the Irish border recently. Wonderful exposure of the "know nothing and why would I want to find out?" attitude of so many #Brexit fanatics.
A bad deal is bad, but a 'no deal' #Brexit is by far the worst. Our Government must secure the best deal for Britain, if it means staying in the customs union, the single market, or remaining in the EU altogether @Open_Britain @euromove @peoplesvote_uk @Andrew_Adonis
A former #brexit supporter and #Leave campaigner changes his mind and has the courage to explain why... @Will_DryOFOC
If the government defies the will of the people, the British people will elect a new government. If the Lords defy the will of the people, there is only one recourse: their abolition.#Brexit#AbolishTheLords
In the 13 years since US-Aus free-trade deal, trade is up by 50% & investment by 130%.This is the sort of growth Britain is missing out on because of EU customs union.And if we remain in any such customs trap after #Brexit, we'll pretty much stay where we are.#NoCustomsTrap
.@jeremycorbyn’s silence on supporting the campaign to remain in the single market speaks volumes. He's declaring that the UK public has no choice but to accept the Tories’ hard #Brexit. @LibDems are the only party offering a final say on the deal & a chance to #ExitFromBrexit.
UN expert on #racism Tendayi Achiume urges further action by #UK government to end discrimination, raising concerns over #Brexit-era hate crimes, Immigration Policy, Prevent programme: #FightRacism
Worrying to hear reports that #Brexit has caused significant numbers of nurses & midwives from Europe to quit the NHS last year. This news is deeply concerning. Our health service has been built & is maintained by the hard work of people from not just the UK but around the world.
Court cases, GPS satellites, and what Scotland could learn from Ireland. All this and more #Brexit news in the latest Scotland in Europe update - including @StuMcMillanSNP on the bagpipes!
#Leavers and #Remainers unite! We have all been conned. All of us are victims of the lies that were used to sell #Brexit to the nation. Please RT @Jon_Danzig’s commentary on the @Reasons2Remain #Facebook page. Link:  pic.twitter.com/TZFsa7s51Z
Could all have been so different had Scots not returned 13 members of a party based in London. Not one of them stands up for their voters or for Scotland. #Brexit #PowerGrab
Everytime I see an anti-Brexit Blairite with an EU flag in their profile, it makes me glad that Jeremy and John got the result they wanted. Still pisses me off that the far right wing of the party forced them to campaign against their beliefs. #Brexit
Time to put Corbyn right on #Brexit. No Labour leader shld be overriding 3/4 of his membership & ignoring the overwhelming Maj of the Ppl who didn't back or weren't given a say on this #BrexitShambles.Binding #FinalSay with a #StopBrexit option. #ABTV 
There is no good #Brexit. Hard Brexit or soft Brexit it is still Brexit.
Remember, David Cameron spent £9 million to send out a campaign leaflet before #EURef.British tax-payer money was spent to represent only one side of a two-option referendum.Remain groups can spend as much as they want unquestioned but Leave groups easily fined?#Brexit 
Excellent insight. This is exactly what two #Lexiters in my family (SWPers who only joined Labour to back Corbyn) said before the #Brexit vote: "Yes, it means voting with Farage, BUT after the deluge...". God save us from all Utopians. 
That’s jolly magnanimous of you, but rings just a tad hollow. @chrisriddell50 summed up this attitude perfectly, pre-#Brexit @gordonguthrie @chrisk_hw
“An Irish chronicle: how Black America inspired the fight for Irish freedom” is out now.#Ireland #USA #civilrights #Brexit 
Rising #food bills and disruption to supplies if we go ahead with #Brexit,  Lords EU Environment Committee confirms 
We can’t go on like this. The country is crying out for leadership but the politicians are just crying. It’s time for parliamentarians to stop whimpering and start acting. Doing nothing is not an option. #Brexit #PeoplesVote
Reason #Brexit isn't going according to Hannan's plan is bc replacing a fully fledged and efficient common market (FTAs included) in which UK has integrated with its closest neighbours for 40yrs, with a never-done-before hypothetical deal with Trump, is not a very good plan.
At this stage, I think voting booths being accessed by the operation of a doorknob, rather than by pulling a curtain, would be enough of an IQ test to reverse the #Brexit majority.
Dear @adamboultonSKY. On your program Arron Banks denied that Leave EU worked with #CambridgeAnalytica. Not so long ago he was saying "we have made no secret of working with cambridge".The @ElectoralCommUK might be interested in this as well. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
BREAKINGPro-#Brexit group  fined £70,000 ($100,000) & referred to the Met **police** for breaching MULTIPLE election laws exceeded spending limit by at least 10%likely “considerably more”
Why should we respect the outcome of a cheat?What value do we place on democracy when an nation can be cheated but we still have to live with the outcome? Penalty for cheating should be the vote is void, then there is no incentive to cheat#brexit #fbpe ? @BBCGaryR @HomeMckee
.@LeaveEUOfficial has been fined because its cheating might have changed the outcome of the European referendum. In other words, the vote was corrupted. A fine doesn't change that. The referendum should be re-run. #Brexit
See @carolecadwalla's thread on UK breaking news.Campaign violations by Leave EU have now been referred to police.Reminder: #Brexit was plagued by many of the same problems the US election had - including foreign disinfo & funding. 2 sides of the same coin & worth watching. 
So we can now add the Electoral Commission, to the House of Lords, the High Court, the European parliament, the EU Commission, umpteen MPs and 16million+ 'remoaners' who are trying to ruin Brexit, so sayeth Brexiters.WELL GOOD!!!  #Brexit #StopBrexit
Reminder: The Chair of the UK Statistics Authority firmly stated that it was misleading to make it appear that £350m is the UK's net contribution to the EU. #LeaveLies have wholly perverted #Brexit as a democratic process. #Stopbrexit #FBPE
Amazing, the British government and the whole of parliament campaigned against #Brexit , along with 99% of mainstream media, but it's the Leave campaign that has supposedly overspent on supporting the idea of leaving the EU. The Electoral Commission should be prosecuted for this.
#Brexit breakthrough? Ministers mull #EU trade plan that could see UK tied to customs union for YEARS more but make a clean break afterwards 
1. Govt lost its mandate & Labour didn't win one; there was a lot of #Remain tactical voting...either way this current #Brexit & can't be legitimate on a number of grounds w/o Confirming if it's still the Will of the Ppl to Leave or now to end this #BrexitShambles & #StopBrexit
"This is a huge deal. For Electoral Commission to refer to police, evidence must be overwhelming. But investigation so long delayed & #Brexit so close - & VoteLeave investigation STILL ongoing - we won’t know full scale of illegality until we’ve exited..."#BrexitGate thread
UK stands to miss out on billions in EU research funding under current #Brexit proposals. How are we going to attract Europe’s best and brightest to UK universities when funding is cut? 
Chloe Westley:“We stay in the Customs Union, we can’t take back control of our trade.It’s just that simple!That’s why we’re Leaving the Customs Union &Leaving the EU.#Brexit means taking back control of our laws, borders, money & trade."#Leave #EU
The mandate for #Brexit lies dead.@ElectoralCommUK report adds to mounting evidence of a Leave campaign mired in deception, manipulation & electoral fraud. The only democratic response is a #PeoplesVote #FinalSay
When a local councillor is found to have falsified election returns, they are quite rightly disqualified.What happens when Electoral Commission finds serious breaches of the law by #Brexit campaigners?We proceed with a deeply damaging course decided on a wafer-thin majority. 
Fined AND referred for criminal investigation. There's nothing democratic about #Brexit. The "will of the people" was manipulated every step of the way. #StopBrexit.@LeaveEUOfficial @Nigel_Farage
incredible - UK Government acknowledging that #brexit will put "areas of the economy" at risk.... 
Probe finds pro-#Brexit group backed by @Nigel_Farage broke the law, massively exceeding spending cap
The United Nations has investigated our country over its treatment of our disabled, now its investigating racism since the #Brexit vote, it's no coincidence that this has happened since 2010, the tories have destroyed our once green and pleasant land #wrightstuff #ToriesOut
Whether you like it or not, @cliodiaspora, people voted TO LEAVE. .@jeremycorbyn is NOT in Government and he is NOT “negotiating” #Brexit.It is the @CONservatives doing & belongs to them.Jeremy’s position couldn’t be clearer and it’s NOT one in line with the Tories. At all.
There was so much interference & illegal conduct during the leave campaign that the #brexit result cannot be considered untainted. To continue is a dereliction of duty by gvt. Leave. EU fined for multiple breaches of election law during referendum 
#Brexit will weaken our trading position. The United States has been clear that the UK will be offered a worse deal on transatlantic aviation than what the US currently has in place with the EU. #52brexitfacts
So we learn these excellent constituency MPs  are being uninvited from the Durham Miners’ Gala for contributing to the EU debate in @UKLabour and suggesting our constituents get a vote on the #Brexit deal. An attempt to stop free speech in the movement and profoundly undemocratic 
 fined for multiple breaches of electoral law. Commission also suspects “that responsible person for  committed criminal offences & she has therefore been referred to Met Police”. Validity of result? #Brexit 
Superb video by Dr Mark McNaught, Associate Professor of Law & Political Science at University of Rennes, on what #Brexit means for Scotland.
Time and again when discussing #Brexit I hear:“I want my country back”I don’t know* what people mean by that so I always ask them. For clarity. The response usually starts:“Well, i’m not racist...” Brexit is about white supremacy.It disgusts me. It’s abhorrent.*I do

So @akalamusic calmly destroys the #brexit narrative. He uses facts, history and logic. Whilst hardline Brexiteers ignore facts and logic and forget any history between our colonial years and 2016. 
1/ It looks like if we ever #brexit we need to give Govt a big push Everyone knows who their MP is,most of them are on TwitterSo you know what to do.Tweet them your instructions,TELL them you are fed up and push them to act.Keep a record of your tweet.
I do not have any sympathy with this view. The lack of internal competence is a symptom of political atrophy - and arresting that decline is more pivotal to our future prosperity than EU membership. #Brexit shines a light on the rot. 
@bbcquestiontime Two people given a platform tonight to spout completely irrelevant points and/or falsities into an important national debate regarding the future of the economy and the country - this is why the country will go down the pan...#bbcqt #brexit #BrexitShambles
Spot On  - 'Customs Union wasn't on the ballot paper.. And to say staying in it would be a betrayal of #Brexit, is misleading'. #bbcqt
The PM has caved on everything in the negs so far. No #Brexit bill became £39bn. No transition became a 21 month standstill transition. Only a matter of time til she caves on the Customs Union—having got nothing in return... #BBCQT
So...Australian Chloe who worked for VoteLeave and a Tory Minister is patronisingly lecturing us on the most important choices affecting jobs, business + our future for decades while claiming to speak for “the people” - what nonsense! #Brexit #BBCQT @Open_Britain @peoplesvote_uk
#bbcqt - Vote Leave puppet @LowTaxChloe repeating the platitudes of people just needing to get behind the country to make #Brexit a success. 23 months post referendum those lines just sound so hollow and dumb. 
A focus gp participant y'day expressed deep fear the Irish border region would be a 'Sacrificial Lamb' of #Brexit.This becomes only more likely with every cynical rendering of @BorderIrish as a 'Trojan horse'.
Busy day with @Keir_Starmer here in Warwick and Leamington and around the region. Huge thanks to Keir for taking the time to meet with businesses both global and small as well as residents to discuss the challenge of #Brexit. Grt meeting in Leam Old Town @theleamassembly Thanks!

Was fantastic to host  @Andrew_Adonis tonight who debated Robert Tombs on the historical context of #Brexit, chaired by @CSBarnard24: lots attended, and show of hands found every single student attendee wants to remain in the EU! Shows why youth-led @OFOCBrexit is so important!
It's hard to think of a more dishonest article than this from Daniel Hannan. He now admits #Brexit is going badly but this apparently is purely down to remainers  
5-Star and the League make progress in coalition talks after Berlusconi capitulates.Italy closer to having a full-blown anti-EU government in days.Move aside #Brexit, refill your popcorn folks!#Italexit
All the polls & studies indicate most Leavers will vote Tory regardless & yet #Corbyn goes out of his way to pacify them & ignore Remainers & his own party members & Labour voters - so he's either all for #Brexit & happy to risk #Labour splitting, or he's just totally clueless
#Brexit #FinalSayWarning: You are about to delete your economy, your wealth, your public services and your standing in the world.  This cannot be undone.  Are you sure?

Reading this @GovUK document  I have been unable to find a single example of where #Brexit would enhance UK capability of meeting security threats...Framework for the UK-EU Security Partnership -   
If 80% of people want #Brexit now, for some unknown reason, then why are Brexiteers so opposed to putting the final deal to a vote to ratify or reject it in six months time?  If their ridiculous assertion was true then surely they'd be confident of an easy win.  It makes no sense 
Fixed it...#Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill #BrexitLordsBetrayal
14 revisions to a Withdrawal Bill shows Lords doing its constitutional job - challenging bad laws that hurt the country. Cross bench support at unprecedented  levels shows lack of confidence in government's #Brexit approach #FBPE

Post #Brexit Glasgow is perfectly placed to become the largest English speaking city in the European Union - it can be a magnet for international broadcasters. 
Davis has got form on declining meetings that would better inform him about how #Brexit will work (or not) in practice.  Last week he said he was surprised free movement was such a big deal for most  @BritishInEurope.  He’d have known this long ago if he’d bothered to meet us

"Brexit trade deal could take 10 yrs"This is getting plain ridiculous nowWe already have free trade deal with rest of EU.So how can carrying on status quo after #Brexit take 10 yrs?They must think we are stupid.This is just another #ProjectFear story.
There are over 1 million UK citizens living in Europe, but if the Tories catastrophic hard #Brexit goes ahead, they will become third country nationals, threatening their freedom of movement & employment rights. @theresa_may must wake up & start taking their concerns seriously.
#Brexit talks are going badly, not only due to the incompetence of the Conservative gvt. but because we need the EU more than it needs us. As a result, the government is making one climb-down after another in the Brexit talks. We aren’t ‘taking back control’, we are losing it.
.@DavidDavisMP who visited Irish border for first time in April without notifying local politicians, media or mtg w/locals on their concerns, has now rejected @CommonsNIAC invitation to give evidence on future of border post #brexit You couldn't make it up 
1. As per a number of tweets today, we can see that the technology that allegedly does not exist is very much alive and kicking and working quite nicely irrespective of remainer denials. These are people who don't want a #Brexit solution. This is why "experts" are ignored.

This man & his ilk sold the British people a fantastical pup that could never be delivered in #Brexit And what did they say when that was pointed out to them? “Fear mongering”  
Very sad to see astute journalists & Brexiteers buying No.10 lie that need soft #Brexit as parliament won't vote #NoDealArticle 50 means treaties cease & we're out regardless.Govt just walks away & parliament doesn't vote if there's no deal to vote on!
Our most honorable framers had the infinite wisdom to create an electoral college. Their foresight was astounding. We have always had one and always will. Miss popularity contest, winning votes clustered in one area, = NADA. #BREXIT #KAG
The government's blocking of #Leveson2 shows that our politics has now become wholly corrupt, with the Tories paying off the #Brexit press barons for their support. The UK is a failing democracy. Fight for democracy #StopBrexit!#FBPE #PeoplesVote
This is an incompetent, chaotic government running scared from a House of Commons where it has no majority for the #Brexit negotiating position it has adopted with the EU. This is why we will need a @peoplesvote_uk on the #Brexit deal. The case gets stronger with every week. 
An important article for Remainers to read: "The only way to protect jobs and public services while remaining one of Europe’s most powerful nations is to stay in the EU. And the best way of achieving that is to get a people’s vote on the #Brexit deal" 
To have supported #brexit at the time of the ref is one thing, you were misinformed, but too still support it in the light of reality and evidence of the disastrous consequences?  That  is madness on an epidemic scale.

Dear #Merrell/#Europe, The United States  is under a hostile take over by a foreign government who w/the help of the Electoral College installed Putin’s Puppet Trump as president. In any other country @HillaryClinton would be president with the popular vote. #Brexit was First
Have to say I agree with @afneil The case for reform of the House of Lords isn't about what's politically useful at any particular time. It's about whether we want a democracy fit for the 21st century. Whatever they do on #Brexit - I'm clear we need an elected upper chamber 
#Brexit is squeezing people’s pay. The pound plunged after the referendum, pushing prices up. Inflation shot up to 2.7% from 0.5% in the month of the referendum and wages have been growing more slowly, meaning people are being paid less in real terms.
#DailyMail leader on September 19, 2003: “The truth is this prime minister (Tony Blair) hates the robustly independent #Lords, which has proved a more effective check on an over-mighty executive than the Commons.” This rag can be relied upon to be inconsistent. #Brexit
Britain’s champion can-kicker #TheresaMay has delayed yet another difficult #Brexit decision. The “war cabinet” to at last define (2years after #referendum) Britain’s opening bid on #CustomsUnion has been postponed again. Does the PM know about the Article 50 two-year time limit?
Interesting discussion with Board & senior management of @CreditAgricole #Anjou this morning - utter incredulity at the chaos of #Brexit but a keenness to develop dialogue with Scotland
Short of wars, I can’t think of a more grievous self-inflicted wound for a modern advanced country as #Brexit. All this because of the internal politics of the Selfish Party and the personal ambitions of certain Selfish Party MPs and their backers, the tax-cheating press-barons
#Brexit is turning out to be the UK's largest foreign aid project ever.
Electorate was wrong to punish @LibDems for the 2010-5 coalition. The truth behind the tribalist vitriol is LDs did well. They moderated Tories & took UK from the crash to fastest growing economy before Brexit. Grateful to @LibDemLords, pivotal in effort to stop #Brexit insanity

Good to meet with the #EUSupergirl @albawhitewolf tonight at the @nlclondon who is championing the fight against this disastrous #Brexit. 
So basically, the Daft Left are now saying the goverment's breaking David Cameron's promise about #Leveson2 whilst not seeing that they are supporting the breaking of David Cameron's promise re #Brexit. The definition of hypocrites is available in all good dictionaries.
Funny how @UKLabour want to hold us to the words of Cameron from 2012 over #Leveson2, but refuse to accept when Cameron said in 2016 we'd leave the Customs Union when we voted for #Brexit.Hypocrites much... 
UK should demand £50 billion of the EU's £130 billion assets as part of the diviorce settlement.Why is this not even asked for?Why haven't the media covered this important aspect of #Brexit?
#Brexit harms, not helps, our non-EU trade with the rest of the world: 
If I were an MP or lord I would be livid beyond redemption that we were wasting our political institutions’ time on the arrant nonsense that is #Brexit.As a member of the public I am also livid beyond redemption.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote

Wishing everyone a happy #EuropeDay from Berlin. We can still stop #Brexit. Never give up  Also a big thank you to @euwomeneu for organising today’s brilliant #Women4Europe event. We look forward to seeing you in London for the #PeoplesVote march on 23 June for some more 
Julia Hartley-Brewer - "Even if Project Fear was correct, even if there was a big economic cost, the British people were told about it, were warned about it and they cast their vote anyway." #Brexit 
Tempers beginning to get frayed on the government side as they lose further votes in the Lords. Some of the harshest & most mean spirited debates I've witnessed in my time in the Lords. Pity, & shows weakness of the govt’s position on #Brexit in the face of logic and common sense
Having the freedom to easily hire a car when on holiday, and properly explore, is great. Yes, you'd still be able to do this after #Brexit but it would be extra hassle and expense that no-one would enjoy! #EuropeDay

Great speech by my Labour colleague @GarethThomasMP presenting his Bill guaranteeing the public a vote on any final #Brexit deal. Passed without Government even bothering to oppose. #PeoplesVote
Surely when Shadow Cabinet reflect on overwhelming support for EEA Single Market among Labour supporters & members, they will realise what a betrayal of British jobs and future prosperity this would be? Crucial moment when @Keir_Starmer & @jeremycorbyn must reject hard #Brexit 
Happy #EuropeDay to all! A day to celebrate all that unites us as world citizens & build on the peace & prosperity the continent has brought to the world. This is why we must continue our fight against #Brexit. We have much more that Unites us than Divides us. #EuropeDay #Brexit 
Great support from @UKLabour MPs including many also @CoopParty + @Plaid_Cymru @LibDems @TheGreenParty for @GarethThomasMP Bill to ensure there’s a @peoplesvote_uk on the #Brexit deal. Proud to be a sponsor! Passed its first vote in Parliament! @Open_Britain
Lovely to see the wonderful @Suewilson91 again today for #MKTalksBrexit (That's #MiltonKeynes not Madeleina Kay although I will be talking #Brexit too!)  this woman is defo an #EUsuperheroes Super star! She's here, there and everywhere stopping brexit! What a trooper! 
Good support on the @UKLabour benches for @GarethThomasMP Bill to give us a @peoplesvote_uk on the #Brexit deal. Hope the leadership takes note.
Great speech from @GarethThomasMP in House of Commons just now on why we need a People's Vote on the final #Brexit deal.  Second reading: 6 July. Thank you! #PeoplesVote
The Tories are supposed to be the party for business, so it beats me why they're pro #Brexit when all the evidence points to businesses being damaged by it.
Theresa May might think that dodging every question from Corbyn on #Brexit at #PMQs will not be criticised, but the EU are watching and they will see and hear her indecision and cluelessness.
If you couldn't get ready in the last 2 years, with what straight face can you claim you can get ready in the next 15 months?!Do we need a greater example of politicians failing to earn the trust of their voters?#Brexit#NoCustomsUnion
#Cyprus flag  proudly flying today w others of our #EU family at Parliament Square in celebration of #EuropeDay 2018. Sad; last time this will happen in London; #Brexit. Proud of EU construction in democracy, human rights, rule of law & peace project. Ways to go.  
For #EuropeDay we're pointing out the benefits for Brits of our EU membership. Such as... guaranteed paid maternity leave and equal pay. #Brexit #NHS #EqualPay
“All creatures great and small will get stuck at #Brexit border” - how leaving the common rules and standards we’ve agreed at European level will cause havoc in ways the #Brexiters want to keep quiet about:
#PMQs review: “@JeremyCorbyn triumphs as he exploits @Theresa_May’s #Brexit woes”
Heading to #MiltonKeynes on #EuropeDay2018 for a youf engagement event about #Brexit  Station staff saw my guitar & asked me if I was a #RockStar I said I was "Young European of the Year" and I write songs about EU. .. EVEN BETTER!  #StopBrexit 4 da kids #Happy #EuropeDay
.@theresa_may is not liking #PMQs today. She is rattled. She knows she can’t put the lid on the nasty @CONservatives infighting. #Brexit has damaged Tory leader after Tory leader.She will be no exception. Keep it up, @BorisJohnson, it’s delicious. #PMQs #karma
Unanimous verdict.#JeremyCorbyn wins #PMQsOn #Brexit and also on #BorisJohnson
Corbyn brilliant at #PMQs today.  Went on one issue with focus.  Tory Brexit policy ripped to shreds question after question.  Showed them in total disarray.  May had no answer at all.#brexit#CustomsUnion
"He has spent an entire career opposing a customs union" - PM Theresa May responds to calls by Jeremy Corbyn for a debate in parliament over "crucial" #Brexit legislation  #PMQs
Has House of Lords apologised to the EU yet for the #Brexit vote?Have the Lords of Lords apologised yet for 17.4m of us,who obviously did not know what we were doing,when we voted to #LEAVE It is good job we have those wise people in the House of Lords to correct our mistakes
Jeremy Corbyn asks if PM agrees with Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson that the plan for a customs partnership with EU is "crazy"?  #Brexit #PMQs
If only 100 people lived in Britain...#population #education #migration #NHS #religion #unemployment #UK #queen #brexit #stopbrexit
The very fact that extent of Queen Victoria’s contribution to famine relief is being discussed on news shows now is incredibly depressing #brexit 
V.interesting conversation: @BloombergTV about possibility of  #USDollar losing  #reservecurrency status as #DotardDonnie  politicizes the greenback through sanctions. Investors etc. need flow.What a time to be leaving the EU!#IranNuclearDeal#Brexit
Christine Hamilton on the @5WrightStuff claims the HoL are holding up #Brexit because they get generous EU pensions. Sorry Christine, but just 30 out of the 800 Peers are in receipt of EU pensions, certainly not enough to sway the vote. It's nice to have the facts, isn't it.
Peers inflict major defeat on Theresa May's #Brexit strategy as Lord's vote to stay in single market 
#RollsRoyce is too afraid to sign-off their new airliner engines in Britain due to #Brexit. Already we are losing business due to catastrophic negotiations by the Conservative Government. @theresa_may must grant the public a vote on the deal and a chance to #ExitFromBrexit
Today Twitter is full of politicians telling you to read MSM articles behind paywalls.  Our pieces are free and contain original research & facts.Daily #Brexit news based on research from official sources: 
Apparently the govt defeat in the House of Lords never happened...according to the #BBC. Not a mention on their website. Time to complain - something stinks #Brexit #HouseOfLords #WithdrawalBill
Whatever your view on #Brexit, it's absurd that the bishop of Leeds proposed an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill yesterday - and made biblical references as he did it. Scrap the Bishops' Bench 
On #EuropeDay, I challenge every political party in Wales and the UK to put politics aside & let us work together to build a more positive relationship with Europe & achieve a #Brexit settlement which the next generation can be proud of.  
yet another consequence of #Brexit - the best and the brightest from other European countries now being put off from coming to study at British universities    was #Brexit a vote to cut the UK off from international talent? #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk
Ken Clarke MP telling it like it is on the state of affairs of #Brexit which will make younger people in particular poorer than they otherwise would have been. Essential that there is #PeoplesVote @peoplesvote_uk at the end of the process
Here again is why we must leave the Customs Union if #Brexit will be successful for all our futures.
The #Brexit story so far: 1. EU meets UK. 2. EU loses UK. 3. Lords vote to remain in Single Market. 4. [ Insert ending ]Happy #EuropeDay!
Your most despicable tweet yet! The Lords violated the explicit will of the people & the largest vote in the history of our Parliament, which conveniently aligns with your wishes. It's like celebrating the Holocaust because you hate bagels. #Brexit #AbolishtheHouseofLords
Which party legislated for #indyref2 at Holyrood? Who declared #indyref2 on day after #Brexit vote? Which party has #indy in its constitution? Remind us...
How wonderfully apt that, on the day before #EuropeDay, the Lords voted to keep the UK in the single market - which sets us firmly on the road to stopping #Brexit altogether.Truly a day to celebrate!
On #EuropeDay here's to the end of #Brexit & consigning the #BrexitCoup to the history book of failures along with the original #gunpowder plot.  Let's be clear, it was never for the people, it was all about screwing the people. That plan has failed. #GameOver #StopBrexit #FBPE
The EU’s Deputy Chief #Brexit negotiator endorses the @thefabians study that confirms that EU #SingleMarket rules do not stand in the way of #Labour plans for nationalisation or for state aids
No.of Brits becoming citizens of another EU nation > doubled in year after the #Brexit vote. Gvt. should be ashamed that their #Brexit stance means people feel they have no option but to take up another citizenship & give up part of their identity to try and secure their future.
It’s Wednesday.And the idiocy of #Brexit is now plain for all to see. #Trump is a loose cannon and totally unpredictable as mid-terms approach. Our place is within the EU, standing up for our common interests.#StopBrexitSaveBritain#PeoplesVote#NoConfidence
Former Hull council leader Colin Inglis to quit Labour over #BrexitColin Inglis is quitting Labour after nearly 44 years in protest over the party's stance on Brexit. #StopBrexit #FBPE
How are you all getting on with #brexit, wasn't it a great idea to give the racist morons an advisory non binding referendum on leaving the EU, what a great legacy I have left .... 
.@theresa_may should now lead us to that softest of Brexits putting country before party. PM wld win support in Commons; give business certainty they crave & a #Brexit they’d support; receive the grateful thanks of everyone worried as #BrexitReality unfolds (& fed up with it all)
Parliament is finally taking control #Brexit & is seeing off a minority of ideologically driven hard Brexiteers. By whatever name or device there’s growing all party consensus in both Houses to ensure #UK retains benefits of #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion after we leave #EU
A crushed Theresa May forced to give MPs Single Market vote after yet another defeat for her shambolic #Brexit plans by the Lords.Thank goodness for the upper house, bringing sanity back to UK politics.
Full list of @uklabour & other hero Peers who helped ensure MPs get vote on the least damaging Norway-style EEA #Brexit deal. 
I used to be against the un-elected HoL. But now I realise just how important it is to have an influential group that is not influenced by fear of losing a popularity contest. #FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
We can’t fight on too many fronts at one time, but after this, once #Brexit is out of the way, many of us will be pushing for reform. #theirdayiscoming
& so it starts, the process to overturn a democtric referendum, a desperate attempt to break #Brexit by pro-EU lords. 
Happy #EuropeDay people, whatever you're doin today do it with an #EU flag raised loud and proud. Don't let anyone tell you it ain't our flag, we fought wars for this and we'll keep on fightin #Brexit  #StopBrexit #FBPE #Remain #IamEuropean #VEDay
Lords and prostitutes both get paid to sleep, but only one provides a valuable public service. #AbolishTheLords #Brexit 
Again. That important year, 2013. That's when #Brexit and #Trump were planned. That's when Trump went to Moscow. That's when the FSB infiltrated UKIP. That's when #CambridgeAnalytica was started
This "crazy" Customs pact will rip Tories apart...'The uneasy truce in Tory Party over Brexit is over.Remainers in our party are trying to halt Brexit.But this is a fight we must win because the future direction of our country is at stake'#Brexit #EU
Russian oligarchs sure have funnelled a lot of money into  the UK and US around the time of #Brexit and #Trump. A lot of that money went to a) media companies (hello Guido) and b) politicians. Money is traceable you absolute dolts.
Well maybe you should have spent some of the Last 20yrs of euro ranting planning how you would actually implement #Brexit then shouldn't you. Failure to plan is planning to fail as the British army says
They froth and rage about the House of Lords being undemocratic, but will they support giving the British people a democratic #PeoplesVote? Of course not! Hypocrites!#StopBrexit #brexit #FBPE
The main man @Michael_Heaver has it spot on. Why are there a whole load of #LibDem Lords trying to stop #Brexit? Who voted to put them in that elevated chamber that looks down on the people and their decisions? #SkyPapers
Ignore the unnecessary noise around May’s “Customs Partnership” and the supposed Cabinet split. All those options are impossible anyway.The Lords has done its job. It has said If #Brexit, then Soft Brexit. It’s crunch time now. What does the Commons do?
Some Corbyn supporters think plunging the UK into the jungle of global capitalism outside the EU will bring about a more socialist Britain! Sorry, the ERG know what they are doing, they know a hard Brexit will deliver them a #BrexitTaxHaven.#StopBrexit #PeoplesVote#Brexit
When Rees-Mogg says Donald Trump should get the 'reddest of red carpets', he is saying that:1. #Brexit Britain will be a toadying vassal state of the USA.2. he has more respect for the abusive liar Trump than for his own country.#BrexitBetraysBritain.#StopBrexit #FBPE
The invaluable work of the Lords is a signal that it is time to wake up & shake off this #Brexit delusion. If you've still got your head buried in the sand, watch out, because the tide is coming in! #StopBrexitSaveBritain #ThankTheLords #TheLordsRock #ExitFromBrexit #PeoplesVote
Our Parliamentary democracy has asserted itself this evening to take back control of #Brexit. House of Lords passed important amendments to give elected MPs the chance to reconsider how best we can Leave
Rees-Mogg:"Peers set themselves against the People... in efforts to stop #Brexit.But ultimately, democracy WILL triumph"Peter Bone:"When an unelected House deliberately trying to thwart will of the people, then something seriously has gone wrong"#EU
Are the wheels coming off #Brexit? 2 years after #Referendum , Govt still has not decided its opening position in #negotiations on central issue of customs union. Meanwhile, tonight, #Lords defeat it on #SingleMarket while #brexiter #Tory ministers rebel in other direction...
I often get people saying to me "I am confused on #Brexit. The government seems to be talking nonsense but perhaps I am just not getting it." No. They are talking tosh. To put it politely. #StopBrexit
Sometimes when leaders seek to force change, like May and Corbyn are doing over #Brexit , it leads to a different change than they intended!As well as an encouraging backlash against Brexit, are we witnessing the welcome beginning of a significant realignment of the centre? 
The archaic term Englandandwales seems to be in greater use than ever since #Brexit.When Englandandwales statistics are given they are utterly meaningless for #Wales.Wales is a nation in her own right.
Congratulations to @UKLabour’s Waheed Alli - his amendment on #SingleMarket #EEA has passed tonight with cross-party support in Lords - taking a strong & important stand against a reckless hard #Brexit 
Get in there you magnificent unelected saboteur bastards! #lords #brexit pic.twitter.com/Qw0uaoLMA6
The EU Customs Union is a racket that Britain must ditch in its entirety  #Brexit
Phew - thank goodness for rebels!When issue returns to Commons, focus will be on Labour front bench - will they really collude with Govt to make  country poorer, stop free movement, & undermine environmental protection?Britain deserves better opposition & better Govt #Brexit 
Great news to hear Labour’s fantastic Waheed Alli’s amendment on #SingleMarket #EEA carried with cross-party support in Lords - taking strong stand against reckless hard #Brexit - unusually I went up to Lords to watch result in person! @Open_Britain @peoplesvote_uk
Lords voting now on amendment to enable UK to remain part of EEA & single market.So incredibly sad & disappointing to see Labour front bench complicit with Theresa May in inflicting so much damage on the country.Still hoping enough might rebel...#brexit
. @campbellclaret talking the #StopBrexit line tonight, "we the people deserve the #FinalSay if the #Brexit deal is bad for #Britain. And that is what I'm fighting for!"  absolutely NOT "too partisan!" #PeoplesVote
If you're quiet, oh so quiet, and you listen carefully you'll be able to hear it...That, my friend, is the sound of Brexiteers everywhere losing their shit as the parliamentary sovereignty they voted to reclaim swings into action #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit 
I'm continually critical of the House of Lords but credit where credit's due - when it comes to the issue of #Brexit, they're the real opposition to this awful Tory government and their Hard Brexit agenda that a majority neither voted for nor support#EUWithdrawalBill
ANOTHER GOVERNMENT DEFEAT.Lords vote against a fixed date for leaving the EU. #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit #ExitFromBrexit
If #Brexit is such a brilliant idea, why do no other EU countries want to #leave?
71% of Brits want a #HostileEnvironment for illegal immigrants, the other 29% are still trying to vote Labour. #Brexit 
#BernardJenkin on pathetic #Remoaner attempts to undermine #Brexit: "this won't wash, and it all hinges on the false premise that our prosperity depends on  the #EuropeanUnion"  #BBC #SKY @LBC #LBC @ConHome @CCHQPress #Tory @Conservatives @theresa_may #UK
The latest @emireland @REDCResearch poll on attitudes to the EU shows that 92% of Irish people are in favour of EU membership. The onset of #brexit seems to have strengthened Irish commitment to EU membership. 
I am still awaiting your response @DUPleader on your solution for the Irish border after #Brexit. There are so many important questions that are still unanswered. 
Theresa May's vision of a hard #Brexit is crumbling beneath her, from the customs union clause to the invisible Irish border. But, it is not too late to turn back from her fantasist #Brexit. She must grant the public a meaningful vote on the deal with an option to #ExitFromBrexit
In 10 months the UK hurls itself out of the biggest free trade area in the world. So why is there no building work going on in the UK's main ports? The liars say the UK can simply walk away, but it will need customs infrastructure post #Brexit to function.
Remainiac MP Nicky Morgan: Brexiteers are "toddlers who want their favourite toy, and stamp their feet with frustration".That's at least 17.4 million British people.What a democrat you are Nicky, well done!#Brexit 
When Great-Britain goes #brexit, #NorthernIreland and #Scotland must be allowed to vote freely of their independence. Mrs. PM @theresa_may must ensure, that situation in #Catalonia is not repeated in GB. I am sure both new countries will be accepted to #EU and to Nordic Council.
The UK has invested £millions in the EU Galileo satellite navigation system and now the Tories are saying they plan to start again from scratch with a "British" satellite network, at massive cost and over many decades, because of #Brexit...
David Attenborough does #Brexit:"This predatory billionaire is a master of disguise. He has camouflaged himself as a patriotic anti-elitist - and, astonishingly, he's fooled a whole herd of voters. By the time they realise their mistake, it's too late..."
I met some Germans here in Scotland c. 10 days ago and they were crystal clear: #Brexit is lunacy - they don't understand it at all. Also said they hadn't really understood 2014 #Indyref.Now they say: "We get it #Scotland; Europe is waiting for you-but can't wait forever"#AUOB

Chuka, why are you always undermining your leader? #Brexit was conceived & enabled by the Tories & the electorate voted for it....JC wants to limit any harm done to Britain and its people....why don't you support him rather than trying to damage @UKLabour? @daily_politics 
No surprise the EU hasn’t offered the financial services sector a sweetheart deal. Tories have to stop trying to cherry-pick in #Brexit negotiations.We're already seeing sgfnt. damage to our economy, like being the slowest growing economy of the G7&these impacts will only worsen.
I'm in Truro this week to warn how #Brexit, and particularly leaving the customs union & single market, is failing #Cornwall. My visit coincides with evidence that more people here have changed their minds on EU membership than anywhere else in the UK. 
UK voted to #Leave ALL #EU Customs Arrangements..."[May] needs to listen to her parties & her Cabinet who have given a very strong message on this issue.She may not realise it, but we are on the brink here.This could be the end of Theresa May"#Brexit
Good of Nigel Lawson to regularly tear himself away from his comfortable, privileged life in France to argue for #Brexit policies that will impoverish so many ordinary people in the UK. #bbcdp
"Greg Clark’s remark about thousands of jobs at risk is complete economic illiteracy. There are no jobs at risk at all" Lord Lawson on #Brexit#bbcdp

Desperate #Government #Brexit plan to do exactly what they previously said they wouldn’t do - have #Border checks between #NorthernIreland and rest of UK ....
Quite literally bored to tears with the hard or soft #Brextit lie. There is no hard or soft #Brexit there never has been. There is only #Brexit. Anyone perpetuating this myth is being disingenuous at best.

As Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said there were parts of New York he would not enter for fear of meeting Donald Trump.Now he's reduced to cringing flattery of this fascistic kleptocrat & sexual molester.Isn't #Brexit wonderful? 
Here’s a fun game. Find the phrase used by Brexiteers to describe a Customs Union or Customs Partnership, that actually better describes them:Boris Johnson: “Crazy"Jacob Rees-Mogg: "Completely cretinous" Liam Fox: "Complete sell-out"David Davis: "A failure”#Brexit #r4today
As EU citizens, UK students can study for a degree for free or a nominal amount (~€500 pa) in the following EU countries. Austria, France, Germany, Belgium, Greece, Sweden & Spain.Thanks to #Brexit that opportunity will be lost.
Japan's ambassador, Koji Tsuruoka, knows that #Brexit will bring great economic uncertainty to the UK. That's why his country's biggest firms Nissan and Toyota have stopped investing in the UK and are not taking on new employees.
This is pure crazy.Liam Fox is cutting hundreds of jobs that assist UK businesses in trading with emerging economies NOW...... so that he can hire more trade negotiators to do fantasy deals *IF* we leave the Customs Union.It’s just so #Brexit.
You want to know the real reason the right wing #brexit media hate the Irish?It’s simple: everytime UK complains about the Irish holding up a trade deal it merely confirms that being part of a bigger trade & political bloc gives members extra leverage.
The best thing I've read about #Brexit, you ask? Try Sir David Edward  
Well over 17,4 million people want to hear more from him, and less from remoaners like you. Tories were given our votes to ensure #brexit, we can soon take it back again. Now do your job, support the government for a full #brexit and stop putting UK on its knees! 
This woman, enjoying Iranian MPs taking selfies with her, will soon wield EU power over the UK.  Full #Brexit story: 
Members of @UKLabour party must take control. We cannot and must not facilitate a disasterous Tory #Brexit. At CLP level you can organise a motion to go to conference calling on @UKLabour to back a #FinalSayWe can #StopBrexit.
Too true! #Brexit 
BBC News - Boris Johnson: No 10's post-Brexit customs plans 'crazy'. For once he is right. Let's just ask people if they would prefer to stay on in the EU and abandon this costly #Brexit folly - #PeoplesVote.
Meanwhile, #Putin's winning. Oil prices up, Navalny down, #Brexit a disaster, Assad stable, sanctions limp...and in Germany, a 5th column.  
Strong & Stable update.If Theresa May cannot sack Boris Johnson for openly rubbishing her in the pages of the Daily Mail, she loses any claim to being in charge of this chaotic, #Brexit-drunk government. 
This is the 'negotiating strategy' the Lords, Labour, LibDems and Tory Remainiacs want the Govt to adopt. Who would bet even a penny that this will work in Britain's favour?#Brexit

Dear Labour Remainers, don't take anything for granted. Make your message to Labour MPs and the party leadership loud and clear that you want the UK to stay in the EU. You are now the ones who to all intents & purposes have the power over whether #Brexit happens.#StopBrexit
Rants is muting Remoaners at an alarming rate tonight. It actually feels good, to remove those crying windbags from my online life.Anyone still crying over #Brexit after 2 years is really not worthy of an adults time.
Mrs. PM of #Scotland @NicolaSturgeon! After the stupid #brexit of Britain, approved by mrs. @theresa_may, when do you plan to break free from the chains of England and return to the union, and start new in the Nordic Council, as an independent state? Referendum soon! #Catalonia
BREXIT: Tory Brexiteers 'like toddlers stamping their feet', says Conservative ex-cabinet minister /#EU #Brexit 
Hiow long before Nigel Farage and the #Brexit fanatics start calling for the abolition of Sir David Attenborough?
The EU nations are racking up deals left and right, and are fast approaching saturation.The UK wants to dump all of these favourable ties with the entire world to start over again with nothing but a begging bowl.Global Britain after #Brexit.

UK and EU #Brexit negotiating teams jointly publish the list of outstanding issues still to be resolved on the Future Framework They'd have to tick off more than one per week to be ready on time!The long list of complex issues can be seen here 
It seems as if John Redwood is only in politics as a lobbyistfor the #AssetManagement industry.- He contributes little in term of local politics- He was useless as a minister- He does nothing, except whine about the EU- Since 2016, he has been a bully boy for #brexit
Britain to build a British satellite-navigation system after EU uses bully-boy tactics to exclude us from the Galileo network due to #Brexit.British companies handle ~80% of Galileo's high-tech security infrastructure.Which of the two do you think will succeed and excel? 
The #Leave camp garnered 37% of the electorates vote in the referendum. Sensing a hard sell in the HoC, May called a general election on a #Brexit ticket. The country replied by removing her majority. How on earth is #Brexit therefore still called the will of the people.
"we need a dose of #Brexit imagination – and a far less narrowly trade-focused debate". Time to debate:-regional policy development-public procurement -how to devise localised budgets-post-school apprenticeships 
#EU membership NOW £22 Billion!Gisela Stuart:“These figures lay bare eye-watering sums of money UK taxpayers would hand over to Brussels had we voted to stay in EU"Outside EU we stop sending Billions to EU & instead spend it on UK priorities.#Brexit
The Govt should require ALL persons in public service or employment to sign allegiance to Britain, rather than to any foreign power or institution.The EU does this, which is why we have so many pro-EU obsessives working to sabotage #Brexit. Time to get our own act together? 
Whoever tells you people knew what they were voting for when they voted for #Brexit is lying, and here's the proof. From the Electoral Commission report on the intelligibility of the EU Referendum question  @BrexitBin @IanDunt @faisalislam @RCorbettMEP
Let's be clear there was no prosperity after the First World War only hunger and filth. Moreover, prosperity only came to Britain when a Labour govt was elected in 1945. So there is no peace when there is unmitigated capitalism.   #Brexit
The is a distinct correlation between those who say there is no solution and those who don't want a solution.#Brexit
Important advice to #Labour on opposing #Brexit from Trade Union Leader @manuel_tssa
“The time for abstaining or ambiguity on #Brexit has passed”. Spot on from union leader @Manuel_TSSA on tomorrow’s vital Lords vote.  
If #Brexit happens, it will hit hardest those who have the least. As we step up our campaign, please support the first ever @Remain_Labour crowdfunder. Help us make sure that the Labour Party stands against Brexit and stands up for a #PeoplesVote
Remainers are no friends of Britain. These are not people who are mistaken in their beliefs and deserve to be heard, these are traitors and some are paid agents of the EU who are pushing Britain to destruction. Godless lot with no shame. #Brexit
**Campaign Launch** @Remain_Labour & @Labour4EU want @UKLabour to stand against #Brexit and stand up for a #PeoplesVote. Today we launch a motion calling for a change in party policy, to be debated in every CLP in the country. Please share and support 
Radical perhaps, but maybe 20 years of relative peace in Ireland actually means something to some people there?And that sacrificing that for the delusions of Hard Brexit is a bad call?#Brexit 
Yesterday anti-#Brexit BBC Remainer Andrew Marr misinformed British public about Irish border question EIGHT times, saying new customs system wouldn’t be ready.  He's wrong.  Read: 
The Tories deep divisions are ripping them apart. Labour must seize the moment by whipping its troops in both the Commons and the Lords to defeat the Tories dangerous #Brexit proposals at every turn - the time for abstaining has long past! 
Nicky Morgan has a right to her opinion. But both at the referendum and last year's General Election, where over 85% votes were cast for parties committed to proper Brexit, we rejected her ideas. Appeasing her is a rejection of what we voted for. #Brexit #MondayMotivaton
The best way for @UKLabour to inconvenience the Tories on #Brexit with little risk, and potential gains for itself would be to support a #PeoplesVote. The Tories could be presented as anti-democratic, and there would be no pressing need for it to adopt a strongly anti-Brexit line
#Brexit @Jacob_Rees_Mogg now decides all our futures. A born to rule toff has taken charge of the Tories and masses. This is more scary than bad economic forecasts.
"I voted Remain, but I don't care about facts and reality anymore so I've decided to put my faith in #Brexit unicorns."  a negative narrative fails to inspire hope... The Brexiter's boundless optimism is infectious. We need to make the positive case to Remain. 
The people who voted to stay in the EU are getting nothing they wanted and the people who voted to leave the EU are getting nothing they were promised (access to free market, extra NHS funding etc). What's the point? #Brexit
Blame Blairite plots, hostile media or aliens from planet Zog, no Labour opposition has *ever* been gifted with a more dire Government to oppose.If Corbyn cannot pull ahead now, he will never, ever pull aheadIt's either his #Brexit stance or more likely, the man himself 
#Police worried that, if we #Brexit, we lose access to EU-wide information system currently used by the UK some 539 million times every year. #Criminal
The self-righteous whingeing on the #brexit hashtag makes me want it all the more. It shouldn't be a culture war but the remoanoids have definitely made it one. Their sense of entitlement is nauseating.
‘Brexit will be calamitous but it’s the only way Britain will learn the lesson that it’s not exceptional’.You wouldn’t apply this theory of necessary failure to your children.  To apply it to your country is unacceptable. #Brexit is an error. Correct it. 
People are given lies to reinforce false beliefs until they genuinely feel they are in fact true, confirmation bias. It's a pervasive technique of modern day rule. It is how #brexit happened, it is how some people were conned into thinking their opinion was their own. #FBPE
70% of Conservative core vote support leave. UKIP vote which has denied so many Con MPs their seat has mostly transferred back to Conservatives The democratic process delivered leave. If we don’t clean #Brexit with no CUSM add on, the next election will be like a re run of ‘97  
Very gracious of you. Like so many Europhiles who in the face of #Brexit, act as though their first born is being removed, he’s lost the plot. 
Just 12 hours until @Remain_Labour & @Labour4EU combine forces to step up our campaign for change! If you are a #Labour supporter who wants our party to stand against #Brexit and stand up for @peoplesvote_uk - please share & sign up below 
My son had a lot of questions along the way about the banners he saw. #Trident #Windrush #Brexit #TrumpMuslimBan & #Catalonia etc. A few people heard him asking & spoke to him. There was no insults of parties or individuals. Just info & facts. Thank u for ur kindness  #indy
Dumb and Dumber, the two Brexiteers, working together to instigate an act of national self harm. One of the them,could change history if he has the "balls" to do it. So, @jeremycorbyn, do you have the "balls"? #JeremyCorbyn #Labour #Brexit #National Disgrace
How did the Lisbon Treaty get ratified without MPs ever seeing it?Lisbon Treaty transferred nearly all remaining(!) UK sovereignty to unelected & undemocratic EU.Gordon Brown was deceitful to such an extent it was no different to lying!#Brexit #EU

If we stay in the EEA then many #Brexit problems dwindle. Growing support to keep this as an option 
Russian spies helped #BorisJohnson arrange #Brexit coup.  No surprise, Farage, Banks, Mogg, Hoey ALL have Russian links.  If Brexit is so great, why does our enemy Russia want it to happen ????

My uncle is a writer and explained that, for maximum tension, all of the important resolution in a story has to focus on the final 15 mins/25 pages. My guess is that the #Brexit denoument will be the same. I'll check back in mid-Feb '19.@ThatTimWalker @abcpoppins @BrexitBin

German students now understand #Brexit better than the #NastyParty, thanks to an Indian cartoonist!
If you actually bother to SPEAK to the people who fought for Britain you will find the vast majority will be appalled that you are co-opting them as pro-#Brexit. Why? Because they saw first hand how destructive nationalism can be. The EU is first & foremost a peace project.
Dear Labour Remainer-Corbyn voter: enjoy your Sunday in the sunshine, reflecting on the fact that if you’d elected Cooper, Burnham or Kendall as leader, #Brexit would be history by now.
Your Party stands for:Child poverty#WindrushCoverUp#BrexitEssential welfare cutsNHS crisis#RapeClauseBedroom TaxCovering up #CambridgeAnalyticaDeportation targetsSyria warStanding racists, homophobes and bigots for electionGo cry elsewhere, Murdo 
80% of the money collected for EU tariffs goes straight to the EU.Britain has sent £15.7bn to the EU, since 2011.This cost is borne disproportionately by the British poor.All this to protect French farmers and other EU producer interests.Worth it?#Brexit#NoCustomsUnion
And this is one of the tragedies of #Brexit : the #IrishBorder
DUPer logic:- Pocket Dark Money- Campaign for #Brexit- Lie about Brexit- Lose "regional" vote on Brexit (important region if only cos it is "separated" from Britain and connected to an EU state)- Get Brexit- Offer fack all solutions- Shit yourself- Shout at EU for Brexit 
The next round of #Brexit talks is pencilled in for week of 21st May. In case useful for your “government customs decision crisis” planning.
Oh, you want to talk about "losing the plot"? How about your party's handling of #Brexit? #Windrush? #Grenfell? #PanamaPapers?Given your attitude and the way that you treat ordinary people in this country, is it really any surprise that they hate your party?
We are approaching crunch time on #Brexit. The future of our country, jobs and international standing is hanging in the balance. Empty threats of 'no deals' must be dropped to start proper negotiations!

Dear .@michaelgove Please could you do some more work on the #CambridgeAnalytica & #Brexit Scandal that so needs the country’s attention? Thanks.

MASSIVE win for anti #Brexit parties in local elections despite all the racists moving from UKIP to Tory is very clear mandate for #peoplesvote. Write to your MP and tell them that the British people deserve the #FinalSay, stop this #fascist hijack of our democracy NOW.

We have given @conservatives our votes, so now it is time for @conservatives to give us a clean and swift #brexit, as promised, if they want our votes again at the GE!@Theresa May set for 'HARD Brexit with NO COMPROMISE' after local election 2018 triumph
Right now, @jeremycorbyn is "doing a Nigel". From his own words he wants a #HardBrexit - After calling for the immediate trigger of #Article50 he's letting the #Brexit process go without contructive opposition so litterally Billions of Pounds are being wasted on the process.  
....but are increasingly concerned that #Brexit may be a worse disaster.  So they are considering, one by one, family by family - where the real risk lies.
Rees-Mogg:Conservative manifesto said we would leave Customs Union & leave Single Market.I believe politicians should implement promises they've given in manifestos.So all I've been doing is encouraging Govt to stick to promises it has made.#Brexit #EU

Trump can't stop lying, whether it's dictating a fraudulent doctor's letter or claiming that London hospitals are war zones that would be made safer by guns.Naturally, this man is a hero to #Brexit liars like Nigel Farage & Arron Banks.

John Redwood:Message for Govt is clear.People want Govt to get on & see #Brexit through quickly & cleanly.To take back control of our borders, money, laws, fish & trade.Little sympathy for Remain cries to delay & recreate much of #EU we are Leaving.
The only conceiveable reason to oppose a #PeoplesVote is if you think you'd lose it. Which means you think the people don't want #Brexit. Which is admitting it's not the will of the people, and people want to #StopBrexit. Which is admitting that #Brexit is undemocratic.
Unelected unacountable snout in the trough gravy train, this sums up the EU. #Brexit

Despite all the evidence to the contrary, #CambridgeAnalytica's Alexander Nix was at pains to deny any #Brexit involvement when I met him a couple of months ago. Perhaps his new friendship with Boris and the Foreign Office explains why 
They’re the Tony Blairs of this world...#Moggmentum #Brexit 
One of the most insidious acts of treason against humanity is to deny the truth. I have heard in recent days people deny the rise of the Right, deny the rise of discrimination, deny the negative impact of #brexit... they would deny the sun came up to suit their beliefs
UPDATE #localelections18 Now that all #LocalElections2018 results are in:- LAB (+77 on top of previous good result), LIBDEMs (+75) andGREENS  (+8) gain seats - CONS (-33 below previous bad result) and especially UKIP (-123 !), both strongly pro-#Brexit, lose seats
Uh-oh: looks like @BorisJohnson's department invited #CambridgeAnalytica/SCL group to shape British foreign policy. Yes, you heard that right. The Russian colluding, hacking, #Brexitdatabreach people asked to represent British foreign policy.  
How will #Brexit benefit any of us? This is a question we will be putting toany MPs or Lords we see over the next few weeks. Here is #ChukaUmunna’s reply. #StopBrexitSaveBritain #FBPE #SODEMaction
“Corbyn has been abandoned in Leave areas - his pledge to stay in the customs union means he’s not trusted to deliver #Brexit May’s clear vision for leaving the single market & customs union was a key part of Tory #LocalElection success” @BorisJohnson
So on the biggest single issue of our lifetimes, there seem to be 2 political parties actively campaigning against #Brexit . Yesterday we saw the best results for both @LibDems and The Green party in a long long time. And all the 2 other parties have is spin, fudge and bluster.
The flaw in Corbynista logic is that they believe he’s so charismatic he can convince a right wing country to make him PM, but yet isn’t charismatic enough to get a majority of MPs to do what they know is the right thing.  None can explain that. #Brexit #Corbyn
A #SoftBrexit is a deceitful & dishonest reversal of the people's vote to leave the EU. If politicians wanted vaguery to facilitate their reluctance to leave the EU they should not have asked such a binary question as Remain or Leave.#Brexit means Brexit

The party campaigning for an #ExitFromBrexit, the @LibDems, gained more seats in yesterday's elections than any other party. The party pursuing #Brexit lost seats and entire councils. It's clear that the UK want to #StopBrexit so denying a #PeoplesVote is undemocratic & cowardly.

In light of #Election2018 Theresa May is faced with a tough decision: A) Propped up unexpectedly by the Leave vote via UKIP, she breaks the habit of a lifetime and actually delivers on #Brexit. B) She continues to deny the will of the people and gets crucified by her own Party.

An enfeebled Tory party haunted by bitter infighting is not beaten by Labour in mid term Council elections despite UKIP's vote collapse. Tells you that #Labour supporting #Brexit is not what the public wants.Had Labour been for #Remain, the Tories would've been decimated.
Senior UK officials working on #brexit have admitted the UK will need to remain in the EU Customs Union for years beyond the end of the 2020 transition, as the UK will simply not have customs systems or infrastructure ready in time.#ProjectReality

UKIP voters broke 2 for the Tories to 1 for Labour. As the Tories are pushing through #Brexit and Labour paralysed by the issue this could have been a much worse ratio. One thing for sure is if you want to improve it stop calling voters “racist”. It’s not likely to work.

100% correct.#Brexit was a Cam/Osbo play to slap down #NigelFarage and the rightwing of the Cons, who hated those Hubris Bros. #UKIP is gone and the country is stuck with both the #Tories and a #BrexitShambles
Impossible options, citizens' rights and why Scotland's youth has a lot to offer Europe. The latest #Brexit news is available here in this week's Scotland in Europe update:

“About 70% of Conservative voters are eurosceptic now, that’s really a warning signal to the Government. If they try and soften a lot of their positions on #Brexit I think they will probably suffer in the polls for it,” says @HughRBennett
The #UKIP vote is going to the Tories because of FPTP.  Tories are the lesser of two evils in a corrupt two party electoral system.  So yes, you must deliver a proper Brexit.  No SM, CU, FOM, ECJ and no huge, unnecessary #Brexit bill.  Time to walk away. 
Only saving grace is many Tory gains look like UKIP-pickups &/or heavily Leave-voting areas: which = more pro-#Brexit Tory electorate, so retaining them & thus keeping Corbyn out means delivering proper, clean Brexit, not a Remainer-appeasing BINO.Hold May’s feet to the fire! 
After 98 of 150 councils:Pro-#Brexit parties (#Conservatives, #Labour, #UKIP): -18 seatsPro-#Remain parties (#LibDems, #Greens): +47 seatsThe numbers speak for themselves...#StopBrexit

The Labour Party cannot win by being a #Brexit party. That is glaringly obvious. A radical broad church that is pro European would clean up. We need new young leaders that look like the UK in the 21st century. We need to govern and rescue the UK.

The  Bishop of Leeds is right 'the #Brexit debate has led to the ‘normalisation of lies’. 
If Jeremy Corbyn can't make big gains in the middle of a Parliament with Theresa May as PM, #BrExit looking uncertain and the BBC pushing endless Windrush and NHS stories all week then you know we are well passed #PeakCorbyn
The circle that is still impossible to square. Either there is a border in the Irish Sea, or the UK remains in the Customs Union. Fin.#WDYM #Brexit 
Here's my prediction though I'd like to be wrong. @UKLabour will not do well because our #Brexit stance is wrong. Our policies are great but our leadership is not good enough. The Tories are the most incompetent I have seen in my lifetime and we should be 20 points ahead.

The @LibDems using #Brexit to try and claw back the votes they lost but they fail to realise that they lied to all their voters and fully supported Tory austerity. A vote for Lib Dem is a vote for Tory #VoteLabourToday

There are some important decisions for the Speaker to make in the next few months regarding #Brexit. I wonder if the attack on him now is just a coincidence.

Feel so sorry for non-Brit EU citizens here who are worried that today’s local elections are the last in which they can participate.Imagine how sick we’ll feel come European Parliament elections in May 2019 when we will be excluded altogether.#Brexit must be stopped. THIS YEAR.
#Windrush, breast screening, #Brexit & crime all areas in which govt has neither control nor credibility. Today’s local  election results could herald a big wake up call. Time for change @LibDems

1,000 jobs at risk as Jacques Vert owner collapses. The collapse makes Calvetron the latest in a lengthening line of retail casualties.Nothing to do with #Brexit of course. None of the recent collapses are, according to the #Leave camp.

That #brexit UK was merely a "test run" for Putin, Trump and #CambridgeAnalytics is a measure of how unimportant they consider us.That various #Leave campaigns so openly colluded with one another is a measure of how weak our policing and legal systems are !#StopBrexit pic.twitter.com/2ylwU9OpL1

Leader of the Labour Party @jeremycorbyn will join us to give a public lecture on 24 May 2018.It will be his 1st major speaking engagement in NI providing an opportunity to hear his thoughts on key issues relevant to the region including #Brexit.More: 
Brexit is trashing the economy and affecting all of us.Early worries the EU had that the UK would be a strong, low tax economy, undercutting the EU have completely disappeared.#Brexit#PeoplesVote
Don't believe the #FBPE Baloney that @jeremycorbyn wants out of #brexit - Labour has a definite policy re Brexit ( the 6 tests) and also Corbyn is opposed to anything that upsets the GFA and peace in ireland, therefore hard border is out. 
Misleading nonsense from the Tories. Their form of #brexit will hit the economy hard, meaning higher taxes and worse public services than if we stay in the EU.#ABTV #VoteEU #StopBrexit
I might have cast my last vote ever in an election today! I've been out of DKso long that I can't vote there. In the UK I can vote in local elections at the moment - that's it! When #Brexit happens that small say in how anything that affects me will be run will probably be gone.

I'm really upset & saddened that so many are blaming Labour for #Brexit rather than the #Tories who are 100% responsible for it.If you won't be voting Labour today because of #Brexit, when your local services are cut back, remember it was YOUR choice.These are LOCAL elections
That’s exactly the point. #Brexit will do more damage to public services than any Labour council or Labour government could ever fix. At the moment there’s one issue we absolutely have to get right and on which all else depends.
Fellow Remainers, Labour and Conservative won't listen to us. They ignore us, treat us as if we don't exist, or have no right to oppose #Brexit. Enough is enough. Give your votes today to pro-EU parties. Make ConLab listen!#StopBrexit #VoteEU#ABTV

The EU has more trade deals than the US, China and Australia combined. Leaving the EU means #brexit UK will have none. When we do eventually secure new deals, many will depend on prior less advantageous terms we secure with our current major trading partner (EU) #brexitreality
The Tory Brextremists like Rees-Mogg don't want a successful #Brexit deal. They want a catastrophic no-deal which would destroy the welfare state, end the #NHS and force Britain to become a #BrexitTaxHaven while making huge profits for disaster capitalists. #StopBrexit #FBPE
I have GIVEN up trying to second guess the PM and her pesky Govt.They REALLY don't know what they are doing !!They went into #Brexit WITHOUT a plan - and 2 yrs later they still CAN'T agree among themselves.SACRIFICING the future of the UK on the altar of their OWN hubris.

Another victory for common sense on EU Withdrawal Bill. Huge majority of well over 60 for protecting Good Friday Agreement and NI border. Hopefully hard #Brexit will be off the table and suicidal 'No Deals' threats quill be replaced by proper negotiation
@thatginamiller fought to give MPs a vote on triggering A50And Corbyn threw that vote away by whipping his MPs, knowing there was a 2 year time limit and that the Government had no plan for #Brexit, but triggering A50 anywayWhere we are now is a direct result of that decision 
We’re leaving all the benefits of the #EU, only to desperately try and get back as many of those benefits as we can after we’ve left. This is complete and utter madness. The truth? #Brexit makes no sense. Please RT @Jon_Danzig’s commentary. Link: 
The wrong over right lead continues to grow and threatens to clear the margin of error. It’s about time we secured a #PeoplesVote on the deal to see if the #Brexit deal we end up with really is the will of the people.

"If you have any checks on a border, then they become the focus for violence" ex-Tory chairman Chris Patten explains to @BBCWorldatOne his Lords amendment to guarantee no hard border in Ireland after #Brexit. 
The one good thing about #Brexit is that it has introduced us to the #Dunning-KrugerEffect, the study which showed that the incompetent are too incompetent to realise that they are incompetent.
The #Brexit Delusion: Has any cause ever been championed by such a collection of know- nothing charlatans? 
My takeaway point from the Minister & from GB-based #Brexit experts: there is still cause for optimism that a solution will be found.(Believe you me, that alone makes it worth the trip to Dublin today!)

Those who say "the EU isn't perfect so let's reform it" do not understand what the EU is, why it was created, how it works or where it's going, and are ignorant of 45 years of attempted reform.The EU is, by design, unreformable, a one way ratchet to create a superstate. #Brexit
Theresa May has to go, utterly useless. Anybody even contemplating a 'customs partnership' has no real understanding of what the people voted for and are crying out for but more importantly why #Brexit happened in the first place. It's now time to step aside while you can. 
My conclusion during our Seanad debate on #brexit yesterday 
The EU is terrified that Britain will become a high growth and thriving powerhouse of free-market economics, and that is why they want us tied down:  #Brexit
A tiny faction of extreme Tory MPs getting to creatively interpret the referendum, exclusively define what constitutes a “real” #Brexit and, in effect, determine the future for a generation, is the exact opposite of democracy.
Dear Mrs May,A customs union is:1. Not wanted2. Not needed3. Incompatible with Brexit4. Not independent self-governance#Brexit
David Davies’ new idea that you can have ‘hard Infrastructure’ just as long as it’s not at the Border illustrates exactly why the British Govt can not be trusted - legal certainty is an imperative in #Brexit
#Brexit What’s going on with Brexit. Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, & House of Lords trying to derail leaving EU. Now we’ve got Tories fighting each other as well about Brexit. 17 million voted Leave.  Hopeless Politicians All stop fighting each other get on with Brexit. FFS  
So Jacob Rees Mogg & 60 of his ERG cronies are having a hissy fit because they may not get their own way over #Brexit. First, they couldn't give a toss about the national interest, only their own, & second, local elections are tomorrow. Talk about destabilising the govt #r4today
It would be really nice if the #Brexit debate could be a question of our country's future, not a question of the internal rows in the Tory party. 
Almost two years since #Brexit vote Uk is still having an internal discussion about what it wants. No mention at all of what EU wants/has said on #r4today
The reason nobody from Leave pushes for this is that it exposes the downsides of #Brexit. They are still in campaign mode, promising sunlit uplands while sneaking us past the finishing line in 2019.
Reports Brexiters in UK cabinet have forced Theresa May to adopt as her only ‘policy’ on Irish border that it can be solved w/technology. There’s no way Irish gov (or EU) can sign off on this. No deal #Brexit just got a lot more likely
British voters brace themselves for a Walk Away or accept Philip Hammond's deliberately convoluted #Brexit ... #WalkAway and let them beg for their divorce settlement.

Translation: Hand-wringing, bed-wetting, sanctimonious leftie ponce #Jamesobrien dismisses the will of the people, the largest UK vote in history, and the word of Parliament, because the plebs had the temerity to vote the wrong way. #Brexit 
This could kill off any EU goodwill towards the UK.Philip Hammond wants to sabotage the EU’s €10bn Galileo satellite  navigation project by attempting to disrupt the transfer of sensitive  encryption technology from Britain.#Brexit#PeoplesVote
Lord Dodds - "There are those in this House who have vowed to do what they possibly can to destroy #Brexit and that, my Lords, is not a matter of principle, but a matter of abuse of privilege." 
If they are allowed to fuck us over on #Brexit it will be a game changer for me. I have always towed the line and played by the rules but if this goes wrong I will teach my children democracy is a lie.
This is how much the @Conservatives care about the plight of UK citizens who have completely legally made their lives in an EU27 country & now stand to have vital rights stripped from them - in many cases despite not having a vote in the #Brexit referendum! #CitizensRights
#Brexit boosted #Orbán’s ability to disrupt the #EU - and what is his likely strategy now. My commnetary for @guardian @dgapev @D_Schwarzer @PoliticoRyan @panyiszabolcs @eszterz @CarolineGruyter
Dear PM May,Do u think this newly acquired "a potato stuck up u know where" posture wld help Tories negotiate the #Brexit deal better or prhaps put a nice gloss over ur govt's abject failure?A word of advice...potatoes tend 2 rot (& stink, like urself) after a while too.#UK
A General Election this year is looking increasingly likely. I just hope the Brexiteers make their move before then and oust May. With her at the helm it's a feeble #Brexit at best, and a Labour Government at worst. #EUWithdrawalBill #JacobReesMogg
It's time to boot the House of Lords into the dustbin of history. If you are not for the ppl you are against the ppl. They are supporting another unelected body, the EU. It's time to remove them by any means necessary. #Brexit
What kind of failed institution has 2 blackmail people not 2 criticise them - however what kind of country jails people 4 criticising ideology! #HoL #BREXIT #EU #UK #CommieCultureAnti-Brexit Lords get £500k in EU pensions/yr and can't criticise Brussels
The real @UKHouseofLords! Scandal after scandal & yet these #unelected,  privileged #AssWipes continue to exist, running roughshod over our #democracy & your #BREXIT! The #HouseofLords must be put to sleep permanently! #AbolishTheLords  #BBC #SKY #LBC @LBC

I have voted for Labour in every election since Michael Foot.I do not understand why Labour supports Brexit as they know full well it will hurt the working classes the most.How can this be a Labour strategy.#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
First Minister Carwyn Jones said he wouldn't let devolved Welsh powers being taken by Westminster after #Brexit. He broke his word. Here leader @LeanneWood exposes the betrayal of the Labour led Welsh government after they sold Wales' powers. Plaid Cymru are #StandingUpForWales
Yes. But over Russian propaganda targeting  - and throwing - our referendum, not over campaign finance nonsense. As I reported last year. #Brexit
Sir Patrick Stewart ( @SirPatStew ) says #Yorkshire folk need to speak up and demand that the People, not just Parliament, should Vote on the actual #Brexit deal once we know it: 
I’ve never read such nonsense in my entire life. Among the countries British citizens can visit visa-free include Belarus, El Salvador, Haiti, Kazakhstan, Paraguay, Senegal, Swaziland & Tuvalu. The very suggestion of UK-EU visas post-#Brexit is absurd. 
Ahmet here voted leave. He thinks the EU has its flaws but he’s now seen the #brexit vote unleash racism & show that Ministers in the UK are just not competent enough to deal with it all.@Ahmet911 respect to you for having the openness to look at things differently.#remainernow
Unless you decide wrong. In which case a bunch of unelected geriatrics will screw you over #Brexit 
The tax-dodging #Brexit billionaire press has been relentlessly peddling some of the key elements of fascism - shameless lying, rabid nationalism, xenophobia, scapegoating of minorities, anti-intellectualism & the "Will of the People". Its whole approach is an attack on democracy
This just about sums up the Brain Power level of these UK Brexit Suicide Traitors #Brexit #FarageOnLBC #StopBrexitSaveBritain #StopBrexit
Bim Afolami MP - "The British government needs to be very clear and say to Europe if you try to deliberately damage the City of London, we will try and compete hard to make sure that that business doesn’t go anywhere." #Brexit 
Reminder for Thursday: despite the overwhelming majority of Labour's *membership* being remain, Labour is a pro-#Brexit party and votes with the government in support of #Brexit.Don't accidentally vote for a pro-#Brexit party on Thursday. Just don't.
Lord Dodds - "There are those in this House who have vowed to do what they possibly can to destroy #Brexit and that, my Lords, is not a matter of principle, but a matter of abuse of privilege." 
Meet David. David is the UK's Brexit negotiator.David thinks that freedom of movement is not so important for UK citizens. He thinks it only affects some retirees in Spain who are worried that they may not be able to pop over to France any more to go shopping.#Brexit #FBPE
Be under absolutely no illusion - a vote on Thursday for either the Conservatives or Labour will be taken as an endorsement of #Brexit. If you are Pro-EU, it is crucial that you vote #ABTV. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.
Billionaire Trump donor Peter Thiel has said that democracy is incompatible with libertarian capitalism. If this view is general among the #Brexit elite, then the lies, chicanery and attacks on the key elements of democratic government all fall into a single pattern.#StopBrexit
An excellent, short, factual & clear explanation of the #trade aspects of #brexit - and why trade with rest of world is no compensation for lost trade with Europe:@InFactsOrg
Peers back Parliament to have say on #Brexit deal. This  is too important and potentially damaging to give this weak govt, held to ransom by DUP & Rees Mogg & his fanatics, a free hand #FBPE
So looking forward to read this! And the timing could not better! @MaryCMurphy has researched/published on #NorthernIreland & #EU her entire career & is a leading scholar in the field. I encourage everyone interested in #Brexit #NorthernIreland #EU to read it ASAP!
Important speech from @UKCivilService Chief Exec John Manzoni @instituteforgov today, on the good progress already made to strengthen #commercial, #digital & #delivery expertise across govt, and how #Brexit necessitates & accelerates this important work: 
"We are a divided country, a divided Party and a divided Government." MIchael Heseltine, Radio 5 Live, 1st May 2018. #Brexit #LocalElections2018 #MayMustGo
I hope the farming community of North Antrim and beyond will take up the opportunity to discuss the ‘basic income’ payments ‘at a level significantly below current EU subsidies’ that could result from #Brexit when Nigel Farage has #DinnerWithTheDUP
Dear Liam Fox,  were you a real Democrat & believed in the Will of the Ppl & not about imposing your will on the Ppl, you wouldn't have a problem with a Binding #FinalSay + a #StopBrexitSaveBritain option which would only Confirm if the Will of the Ppl is still #BREXIT or #REMAIN
Legatum specialises in "disaster capitalism" advice - asset stripping crashed + declining economies. Hence Fox wanting their input re #Brexit. Big profits to be made by Tories, elites, cronies - eg NHS sell off, land buying etc
UK MPs have just revealed evidence that French security services once considered Christopher Chandler - key funder of Legatum Institute - a risk, because of links with Russian intelligence That is, #Brexit-backing Legatum: 
Very grateful to @nirwnnews for sharing with me how the EU and #ESF have improved livelihoods in rural Northern Ireland, and their concerns about women’s social and economic rights #Brexit 
DUP: "We're going to show just how out of touch and arrogant we are to coincide with Barnier's #Brexit visit."John Taylor: "Hold my Sash..."
#Brexit exaggerations cloud the debate:Since the Brexit vote UK created 400k jobs. Unemployment 4.3%, Participation Rate 75% (vs 8.7% and 58% EU)Productivity grows at fastest rate in 6 yearsUK factory orders at 4-year high Challenges remain, but  doomsday predictions wrong 
“I never thought that salt would be sprinkled over me” said the slug who voted for salt.#Brexit 
New poll shows voter confidence in a good #Brexit deal at a record low. All the more reason for a #PeoplesVote.
Meet Douglas Hoggof the Moat episode in the MPs Expenses scandal,the disgraced ex-MP then got a peerage,as Lord Hailsham, now the chief #Brexit blocker in the Lordstabling wrecking amendments severely weakening Britain's hand in EU talks.What better case to #AbolishTheLords?
Perhaps they could put out the fire with champagne Jacob. #HouseofLords #Brexit 
What a bunch of traitors...SCRAP the House of Lords NOW!!#brexit 
Don't make the mistake of thinking #Brexit is only an issue for central Govt. If tax revenues dive, local spending will be cut & public services will suffer even more.#ABTV: Vote against Brexit on May 3Vote pro-EU: #Greens #LibDems #Renew#MayDay #LocalElections2018 #VoteEU
House of Lords are totally undermining our #Brexit negotiationsThey are inviting EU to offer the worse possible dealThis is treachery of the highest orderPM needs to make the Brexit vote a vote of confidenceWe aren't going to be pushed around by a motley crew of bad losers.
#TheresaMay plans to dictate the outcome if her #Brexit deal is rejected. No role for #Parliament or #people !
Daily Mail headline in the 1930s "German Jews Pouring Into This Country" And the owner's "Hurrah for the Blackshirts" article. Now as in the 1930s the Daily Mail is peddling fascistic hate. #StopBrexit #ABTV #Brexit #FBPE
Sir Patrick Stewart: "#Yorkshire folk need to speak up and win People’s Vote on #Brexit deal" from today's @yorkshirepost >> Don't worry, Sir Patrick, we in #Leeds are speaking up along with our friends across the county, and will continue to do so! 
The younger you are, the higher the  Brexit stakes. Younger voters flocked to @UKLabour in 2017. We have to stand by them, by standing against #Brexit. 
"One of the major reasons for the uncertainty in manufacturing is the very disruptive impact on supply chains from leaving the EU. We need to maintain the access to European markets that is crucial British industry.”@vincecable on low growth in manufacturing sector #brexit
Continued my visit of NI today: delighted to meet @derrycc @donegalcouncil & listen to all those who were there to meet me. Great to see the sights & learn about the vibrant town of Derry-L'derry. Discussed challenges of #Brexit w/ business & how the backstop can address them. 
During last night's debate on the #EUWithdrawalBill, I made a short intervention about the feelings of young people regarding #Brexit
#BrexitRemainers before the vote: at the moment of voting Brexit, the earth will split in two; demons will spill forth to ram pitchforks into you until you are quite literally dead, except those escaping to Elysium (Frankfurt). Remoaners two years on: well we haven’t left yet
Here’s @LadyBasildon another of the #VermininErmin trying to stop #Brexit She was only selected as candidate for Basildon because of an all woman shortlist & was booted out in 2010 & then immediately elevated to the home for failed, troughing politicians. 
1st official job in my new role was an important one in welcoming @MichelBarnier to our City & District, he will leave under no illusion that Derry & the North voted to remain & we need protections guaranteed #Brexit #specialstatus
1707 was a betrayal of ordinary Scots by 'Scottish Lords' that is why they rioted on the streets. #Brexit proves the UK is no union of equals!
Listening to the *hard brexiteer* demagogues on #bbcnewsThey seem to have total contempt for ParliamentIt seems to be *their way or no way*A handful of Tory Ministers should NOT be deciding the future of #Brexit UK.
Brexiters like Daniel Hannan who rave about an Anglosphere trade bloc, know full well that without the USA it would be economically irrelevant, & that with the USA it would be dominated by Washington. They are clearly not interested in greater UK sovereignty.#StopBrexit #Brexit
Don't you just love #stupid #Brexit 'thinking'?UK is NOT 2000yrs old; that's Jesus!UK was created in 1707 by the Treaty of Union between England & Scotland. Ireland joined in 1801; but was reduced by Five-sixths in 1922. 
Treasonous EU nationalists like @thatginamiller @Femi_Sorry @andrew_adois @acgrayling @albawhitewolf @mrjamesob are doing more to divide the UK than they realise.On this path they’ll lead the UK to a very dark place and their types will be *hated* for a generation.#Brexit #FBPE
Just a reminder that if Corbyn had come out against #Brexit 6 months ago it would now be deadThe momentum against Brexit is building in spite of him,not because of himAt best he is a distraction,a pointless side show in the biggest event in a generation
#Brexit means - a monumental act of self harm.Cartoon by @CH_Cartoon.
There is a momentum building against #Brexit which Corbyn is trying to resistHe wants Brexit, he's always wanted Brexit.If he had any integrity he'd have joined the leave campaign in 2016 and let a real Remainer lead the Labour remain campaign 
The EU’s Chief Brexit Negotiator Michel Barnier speaking to the media ahead of a meeting with @M_AndersonSF in Derry - he repeated the EU’s commitment to the backstop #Brexit 
VERY IMPORTANT Use this to #ABTV  Not a single vote for any of the pro-#Brexit parties. We need 16 million #Remainers to go out and #vote.  #Vote for #Remain parties! - #StopBrexit #FBPE #WATON #ABTV #LE2018 #The3MillionVote #Resist #Hope
Apparently Theresa May doesn't like this old photo of her supporting the Remain in the EU campaign shared around social media.Please do not share.#MayDay #Brexit 
Message on Derry’s Walls for EU Chief Brexit Negotiator @MichelBarnier as he visits the city and discusses the @BorderIrish and #Brexit 
Delighted to welcome @MichelBarnier to our wonderful city. Today he will hear first hand, from a range of stakeholders how devastating Brexit will be to us,the people of the NorthWest.  #Brexit #specialstatus
400 jobs on way to Ireland from China firm seeking EU foothold "Access to the European Union was... a key factor for the company choosing to locate in Dundalk". Bet that won't show up in any assessments of the costs of #Brexit 
I've personally heard Alexander Nix tell me #CambridgeAnalytica had NO involvement in #Brexit. More importantly he told @DamianCollins and the @CommonsCMS this. When will he reappear and explain himself to Parliament and the people on such a constitutional altering issue.
Liam Fox claims that a referendum on the final #Brexit deal would be undemocratic. But in 2015 his fellow Leave campaigner Owen Paterson said that this is exasctly what should happen.  #PeoplesVote #r4today
More evidence, revealed by @J_amesp, that #CambridgeAnalytica WAS working with @LeaveEUOfficial on #Brexit despite multiple denials on both sides. 
Whilst it may go unnoticed, by preventing a no deal #brexit scenario The Lords has quietly put down a coup led by Johnson, Leadsom, Mogg, Wigmore, Mercer, Banks, Hands, Davis, Farage, IDS, Fox, Redwood, Gove, Dacre, Murdoch, Bannon, Hintze, Odey, Grayling, Ashcroft et al #FBPE
Message greeting @MichelBarnier outside the Guildhall this morning in Derry/Londonderry #Brexit 
Seldom discussed, but spin-off benefit of #Brexit is that many businesses are now planning to export internationally - including to EU27. #Brexit has woken us up & reminded us that we're a global trading nation.Original pro-Brexit facts-based daily news: 
- Daddy, what did you do during the great #brexit crisis of 2018?- I abstained, honey pie. 
#Brexit Stop trying to derail Brexit  everyday. 17 million voted leave we’re leaving the EU. We’re leaving The Customs Union & The Single Market. Bloody non stop everyday. House of Lords, Labour, Lib Dem’s, & SNP. Get it through your thick skulls. We voted to leave the EU.

"THE PLANET OF THE LORDS" - Some of the best & very worst quotes from the Lords debate:  with some #Brexit Facts4EU analysis. 
Now we’re seeing the unelected Daily Mail condemn the unelected House of Lords. The #Lords are, however, part of the governance of the country unlike the Mail whose sole aim is financial profit @Labour4EU @LabourLordsUK @labour4europe #Brexit 
.@ChukaUmunna has consistently stood up for the national interest, seeking to protect jobs & tax revenues (to fund public services) from the worst ravages of #Brexit. He backs #PeoplesVote.Thanks to the 51 #Labour Lords who defied the whip last night to also back #PeoplesVote.

Labour could have voted for a Final say on #BrexitYet again Corbyn has used the whip to force abstentions on a key voteIs this why Labour elected him, so that he could force his party to sit on the sidelines and abstain over and over again?New kind of (absent) politics 
You forget yourself. You're part of a minority Govt propped up by the DUP in a hung parliament.Of course parliament should (a) be sovereign & (b) hold you to account.May asked the electorate to strengthen her hand in #GE2017 & get behind her hard #Brexit. We said NO.
 UK govt faces embarrassing defeat on #Brexit as House of Lords voted to give Parliament powers to block or delay final deal on country's departure from European Union. 
Pip has a British name, maybe she would leave the EU as well?  #brexit #alonziinstatweets #pipsquad #hintsquad
They shame our country & they shame our democracy...what's left of it...I hope Corbyn pays a price for his support of #Brexit & denial of a Binding #FinalSayForALL with the option to #StopBrexit & #Remain
There are some that are insecure about they're looks. There are some that are insecure about how they're perceived. But the most insecure person in the world is a remainer #Brexit

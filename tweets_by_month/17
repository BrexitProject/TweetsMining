"No deal better than a bad deal"? Ahem...No Brexit is better than bad Brexit. Howzabout that?  
It's said papers don't have power any more.If a few can persuade millions to impoverish themselves with Brexit,believe me,they still have it 
We had 2 shock results with Brexit and Trump, let's make it 3 with a huge Tory defeat! #ToriesOut #LiarLiar #brexit #StrongAndStableMyArse 
Coming out today.Let's get this straight... Brexit is already screwing the NHS - and a bad deal will only make it worse.  
Admit it, Theresa May: ‘no deal’ is not an option in the Brexit talks | Rafael Behr  
If you've the slightest moral compass, please vote Labour. Voting Labour is giving the country a new lease of life especially amidst brexit 
Just imagine if Labour had backed their democratically elected leader after Brexit, rather than launching their spectacularly failed coup.  
Don't worry about Brexit negotiations starting 11 days after a Corbyn victory. It would take at least 6months for everyone to stop laughing. 
Sturgeon promises second independence referendum: 'There is too much at stake for Brexit to be imposed on Scotland'  
No Brexit mandate even if 50% vote Tory?  
Ironically, if Corbyn can beat the Tory's rancid and relentless attacks for years, he's certainly strong enough to negotiate Brexit. 
NHS faces £500m-a-year bill post-Brexit for returning retirees, says thinktank  
I don't like the fact that I actually have some hope for this election. 2015, Brexit and the US election devastated me. 
Brexit isn't just about the UK and the EU. It will open more than 750 time-sensitive mini-negotiations worldwide.  
More than 750 international arrangements up in the air. Why Brexit will be even more complicated than many thought

I still have faith in Theresa May though... she's tuff. We need a strong back bone for #brexit I think?

Grayson Perry's @Channel4 programme on #Brexit airs tonight and his @serpentine show opens next week – get clued up: 
Did you also just receive a text from your phone operator about your data in the EU? This could be at risk with Theresa May's extreme Brexit  
Corbyn has a man of high intelligence and knowledge to go into Brexit talks for a Labour government. May has Boris Johnson. 
I gotta tell you, the worse they treat Corbyn and the calmer he stays, the more I feel he's the best person to negotiate Brexit! #womanshour 
“Jeremy Corbyn…will find himself alone and naked in the EU negotiating chamber.” Theresa May attacks the Labour leader on Brexit  
A great interview from the brilliant @Emmabarnett - how will JC handle Brexit if he can't negotiate his way through a simple question  
May has been fantasising about Jeremy Corbyn being naked in Brexit negotiations. No pic of that but feast your eyes on this @theresa_may 
Great to be with @PaulJHolmes today, Theresa May's candidate in Southampton Test. On 8 June vote Conservative to secure the best Brexit deal  
No-deal Brexit is potentially WAY more expensive than any childcare policy. Where are the figures, May? Where are the questions, journos?  
BBC reporter castigates Corbyn for not knowing exact figures for childcare policy. But no-one even asks May for figures for no-deal Brexit. 
Jeremy Corbyn could be Prime Minister in just TEN DAYS’ TIME, in charge of our national security and Brexit negotiations.  
.@ChukaUmunna – May’s Brexit speech was “dishonest and shameless”  
So after hearing May & Corbyn grilled by some relic of 1990s "Me-Me" journalism, I've still to hear a practical, tangible benefit of Brexit. 
'No deal is better than a bad deal?' @noreenahertz explains why the PM's Brexit stance concerns economists #GE2017  
If May conducts Brexit like she has this election we're all in serious trouble  
"Everything depends on getting Brexit right, which is why I'm prepared to give up & walk away with no deal at all, because I'm incompetent."  
So the SNP position on Indyref 2 is that the only way is up: wait and see if Brexit is a car-crash. If so - Indyref 2's a shoe-in. 
.@NicolaSturgeon says if the SNP get a majority in Scotland they will have a mandate for a second independence referendum.  
The idea that Theresa May will be better in Brexit is hilarious based upon recent evidence

Theresa May has been exposed as really BAD in the pressure of TV interviews.Turns out #Brexit will be much more stressful #GE2017 #ToriesOut 
So will #Brexit if it's allowed to happen.  
How dare she threaten our lives like this? Dire consequences for us if they don't get Brexit right but she may well walk anyway. WTF??  
... PM replies saying that Corbyn will sign a Brexit deal "at any cost" - doesnt address Gary's point re experts on No Deal risks. 
Cc-ing everyone who attacked young people for not voting in Brexit poll. Man that was a lot of grief over bogus stats.  
"Scotland must have a choice about our future – a choice between following the UK down the Brexit path, or becoming an independent country."  
No. When Brexit tanks the country they'll blame Remoaners and foreigners, the press will back them up and they'll stay in power for decades.  
Here's our editorial @EveningStandard on the strange absence of Brexit from this election & the answers voters need  
So it's been nearly a year since the EU referendum and I've only just learned that Brexit negotiations will be conducted naked. 
Given that virtually every Tory policy is uncosted (Brexit, social care, school breakfast) why all the fuss about Corbyn? #wato 
OMG. If she thinks high votes mean she has mandate for no deal #Brexit then it is everyone's patriotic duty to vote anything but Tory 
.@GerryAdamsSF welcomes SDLP Leader’s Call for an Irish Unity Referendum

"We will deliver a smooth and orderly #Brexit" - @Theresa_May  #GE2017 
Clegg Brexit security warning dismissed: Ex Scotland Yard terrorism chief says leaving EU will have little impact  
Irrespective of other political considerations, I probably agree with May that negotiating Brexit while naked would be an error.  
#BorisJohnson exposes clueless #Labour #politician over his lack of commitment to #Brexit. Brutal!  #BBC #SKY #UK #EU 
The PM is listing unachievable goals and contradictory outcomes on Brexit - don't fall for it. She's lying to you! 
If you want an idea of what Brexit without a deal looks like, imagine being a BA passenger, then times that by 100:  
“Alone and naked in the Brexit negotiating chamber” is my signature dance move. 
"Everything depends on getting Brexit right" is the PM's new message, with new slogan, speaking in Wolverhampton  
May will win this election comfortably. But if she subsequently makes a mess of Brexit, the Tories will be out of power for a century. 
PM: "Our future prosperity will depend on and will be defined by outcome of Brexit"; Tories created the problem, they're not the solution! 
Here's the thing: where Brexit is concerned, "no deal" is STILL A DAMN DEAL. It's just a deal the terms of which are "we give up". 
Applications for Irish passports from people based in Britain have risen by 70 per cent in a post-Brexit surge  
Says the man who run a propaganda campaign for half a year in Greece in favor of Grexit, got bored, went back to UK, then opposed Brexit.

Clearest of #Brexit messages from @NicolaSturgeon at @theSNP Manifesto launch - at the end of the process Scotland will get to choose 
Corbyn's memory failure is irrelevant. The massive cost of #Brexit will put paid to all of Labour's spending plans.  
This is getting ridiculous. If you vote Labour in #Plymouth you are voting this. He's a puppet; terrible for BREXIT

Post-Brexit, the UK shall stride the globe like a colossus, telling ever-smaller nations that we never wanted a trade deal with them anyway. 
In 3 simple figures, why we need to get #ToriesOut “The Case Against Brexit That Should Have Been Made (But Wasn’t)”  
Corbyn politely withstood incredibly aggressive #womanshour interview: speaks volumes about ability to remain at the table in #Brexit talks. 
And, as to our trade deal with the EU, we have one. It's universal, tariff free and barrier free. But Brexit means we're abandoning it. 
Brexit is fascinating for those of us who've always wondered what it'd be like to see a country walk into a lamppost and try to style it out

Corbyn has no plan to deliver Brexit, and has already admitted he would give control of our borders and control of our laws back to Brussels

Let's be clear about something before the Tories try to destroy Britain yet further: no deal with the EU on Brexit is the worst deal 
May: "I know Brexit is a terrible idea, but I'm going to carry on with the shambles anyway"A complete dereliction of ministerial duty.  
Given May's willingness to consider catastrophic no-deal Brexit and her low quality team, this is just a list of reasons to vote against her  
"no deal" rhetoric is moronic. Crash out without a deal and we STILL need a deal - only we face the full force of hard #brexit first.

May speech tomorrow. Bad brexit is a threat to public finances and jobs. Fascinated to see polling behind this.  
Amid all the other issues, in an election supposedly about Brexit, it is a real surprise education funding has cut through. Well done, all. 
What I'll chiefly remember is the audience applauding Brexit - a policy that has been imposed on the political class 1/n 
So none of the below then. Not by Paxman, who seemed to be fixated with Brexit.  
We are so screwed. Brexit is a populist fantasy orchestrated by mega rich neoliberals who want to deregulate & rule us.#BattleforNumber10

May saying she supports the will of the people on #Brexit. Let’s see the will of the 84% on #foxhunting. #BattleForNumber10 
EU chief negotiator on what 'no Brexit deal' means: breakdown in UK trade, travel, flights - & even nuclear material. "Just some" examples.  
Ireland & England are best friends nowadays. Makes me sad seeing Tories stirring up the tension pot, especially after Brexit. That's all. <3 
Summary of #BattleForNumber10: Theresa May, terrified of studio audience, says she will fearlessly negotiate a Brexit she doesn't believe in 
Getting a good Brexit deal underpins everything else and this can only be achieved with @theresa_may as Prime Minister #BattleForNumber10 
This was painful to watch! This was a pure KNOCK-OUT!! May might not recover from this; her Brexit negotiation argument destroyed live on TV 
Brexit Sec David Davis tells @adamboultonSKY Corbyn is old friend who he likes but doesn't see as PM. Doesn't make him sound very dangerous 
You may have heard that a post-"Brexit" Britain is going to conquer world markets. The reality is rather different.  
Thanks! When @theSNP take the fight to @ScotTories on UK Govts woeful record on #austerity & #Brexit there can only be one winner #VoteSNP 
The Conservatives Party are the best of the worst when it comes to BREXIT Labour & the Libdems Have made it clear they will remain in the EU 
May deserves respect - She is no Remoaner and is committed to implementing the will of the British people #brexit #GeneralElection2017 
Theresa May was laughed at by the #BattleForNumber10 audience. Wouldn't bode well for Brexit negotiations. Consensus is Corbyn won 
Former counter-terror chief says Britain’s security won’t be harmed by Brexit — because of our spooks’ global reach  
None the wiser on May's Brexit position. Meanwhile, EU published citizens rights & financial settlement papers today  
Theresa May is switched on to Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn isn't and his party don't want it. That's that really. #BattleForNumber10 #MayVCorbyn 
I fear #BattleForNumber10 showed that many just want a hard Brexit, however much damage it’ll do, and trust May to give it them. Depressing. 
So, simple question.After seeing their performances tonight, who would you rather see lead the country into Brexit? #BattleForNumber10 
Has Theresa May even the slightest idea what #Brexit with no deal would mean? Put another way, does she actually understand the EU? 
Real question to follow "no deal is better than a bad deal" is "what happens next ?" Complete chaos in trade, finance, borders #Brexit #GE17 
May uncomfortable on:-social care-police-NHS-Net migrationComfortable on:Brexit 
PM showed her mettle on Brexit negotiations just now. Getting that right is central to everything #BattleForNumber10 
May on Brexit: "no deal is better than a bad deal"Studio audience: *thunderous applause* 
That interview ended on May's strongest suit; the idea she's the 'difficult woman' who is tough enough to negotiate the best Brexit deal 
Re 'no deal better than bad deal' - if UK crashes out overnight Irish border becomes hard. Almost certainly would need army. Crazy #Brexit 
Paxman steered May back to Brexit again for last four minutes and gave her easy ride to tell us how strong she was. Disgusted. 
Let's do it then! Only 2 options Please only vote if you don't mind retweeting What's the better outcome of #brexit negotiations? 
Tonight showed this 'bloody difficult woman' is the only candidate who can get the best Brexit deal for Britain. #BattleForNumber10 
Strong performance from Theresa May. Clear that she's the best person to be negotiating Brexit for Britain. #BattleForNumber10 
May was at her best in the last five mins of that, on Brexit negotiations #BattleforNo10 
Weak and wobbly on police cuts, dementia tax, Brexit u-turn etc. Laughed at by audience. This isn't going well for PM #BattleForNumber10 
Paxman concentrating with May on favourite Tory subjects - Brexit, immigration then Brexit again. No mention of NHS or education. 
Not there to get a deal at any price, she says. In other words Brexit At Any Cost confirmed. Disaster for UK. 
Only the PM can deliver on Brexit and get the best deal for the UK #BattleForNumber10 
I know who won as strong&stable leader in #BattleForNumber10 Q&A & Paxo interview. JC won on,defence,Brexit,security, welfare,health&honesty 
PM already laying the ground for leaving with no deal. Please don't vote for their reckless, extreme Brexit at any cost #BattleForNumber10 
Important that May says no deal would be better than a bad Brexit deal - which Corbyn is not willing to countenance #BattleForNumber10 
'No deal is better than a bad deal' is completley nuts. Imagine what Irish border will look like that night? #BattleForNumber10 #brexit 
Lesson from this is that May has to talk nothing but Brexit. Applause every time on that and in trouble on care, national insurance 
No deal on EU #Brexit is a bad deal #WeakAndWobbly #BattleForNumber10 
May is scoring very strongly on who would you want in charge of Brexit negotiations 
Fucking Hell, Brexit is going to be an absolute disaster. What a stupid, stupid decision. 
We need to be strong & united to get the best from Brexit - the other parties want to mess up Brexit, risking our future #BattleForNumber10 
like owen 'stop brexit' smith? don't let the slugs twist this: no-one else would have offered this manifesto, jc looking prime ministerial  
Only Theresa May can and will get the best Brexit deal for Britain. The other parties want to frustrate Brexit.  #BattleForNumber10 
Paxo landing some blows on u-turns, trust & Brexit @theresa_may #battleforNo10 
Theresa May is clear about delivering Brexit and getting the best deal for Britain. #BattleForNumber10 
It's a 100% correct that we respect the will of the people in a #Referendum  Something maybe @NicolaSturgeon should do. #BattleForNumber10 
No coalitions. No deals. Lib Dems cannot support Theresa May’s and Jeremy Corbyn’s mad dash for Brexit. #MayvCorbyn #VoteLibDem 
If it's wrong for Corbyn to back a nuclear policy he didn't personally believe in, then why is May's Brexit U-turn okay?#BattleForNumber10 
Brexit social care NHS 20,000 less police security  Jesus!!!  
It's easy to see why PM May did not want to debate She just rubbish at it!Can you see her negotiating Brexit#battlefornumber10 
Theresa May refuses to say whether she's changed her mind about Brexit. Here's what she wrote a year ago. #BattleforNumber10 #mayvcorbyn 
Could we get Nicola Sturgeon to negotiate Brexit please? 
Paxman: You don't believe in BrexitMay: I want to make a success of Brexit.Well - that was an epic moment...#BattleForNumber10 
Paxman spot on when he says to May that Brexit is a 'duff idea.' That's been one of the great unspoken truths in #GE2017. #BattleForNumber10 
Strong enough to Deal with Brexit but too scared to debate directly with @jeremycorbyn You're a phoney Mrs May.  #BattleForNumber10 
I'm not sure haranguing politicians for  upholding party policy or Brexit in spite of private views is a smart tactic #BattleforNumber10 
Slightly odd perhaps that Paxman didn't ask @jeremycorbyn too whether he had changed his mind on Brexit 
Getting the best Brexit deal is crucial to our nation's future - and only Theresa May can get the right deal for Britain. #BattleForNumber10 
The PM respects the will of the British people and will make a success of Brexit #BattleForNumber10 
May has given the game away. Brexit is bad for the UK, and she's only going along with it to keep her job.#BattleForNumber10 
PM is the only party leader committed to Brexit - and to making a success of it #BattleForNumber10 
You don't believe in Brexit wow!!! Stunning!! Can't answer  
Theresa May has set out a clear plan for Brexit - to get control of our borders and protect our security:  
Only the PM can get the best Brexit deal #BattleForNumber10 
Theresa May makes it crystal clear that she believes Brexit to be bad for the UK.She has no business being PM.#BattleForNumber10 
The essence of British humour is irony. Here's a classic example - a ref to "guts"  from Mr. Brexit-and-run-away.  @BorisJohnson 
May has the right answer, respecting will of ppl on Brexit. Did Paxo not know she'd said 'the sky wdn't fall in' after Brexit? 
May all over the place on Brexit. We need to give the people a choice on the final deal. #voteLibDem #MayvCorbyn 
"That lie is the only reason why I...decided to vote Leave" - Theresa May is asked about the £350m to the NHS promise in the EU referendum  
Who do you want in charge of Brexit - Jeremy Corbyn or 'a bloody difficult woman'? #BattleForNumber10 
Lib Dems will guarantee you the final say over the Brexit deal. Your future, your choice. #MayvCorbyn #VoteLibDem 
Theresa May put on the spot about her Brexit U-turn - looking weak and wobbly, no pre-scripted lines to answer this one #BattleForNumber10 
The British people have voted. Now it's about who will get the best Brexit deal for Britain: Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn #BattleForNumber10 
The only people more annoyed at Corbyn's performance than the Tories will be the Labour MPs who tried to oust him hours after Brexit. 
.@theresa_may tried at end to get voters thinking again about who's more competent/experienced, esp for Brexit, but was largely on defensive 
May, who called those who oppose hard Brexit "saboteurs" and deployed Go Home vans, laments "divisions within our society"#mayvscorbyn 
She didn't answer any questions and said nothing anyone can remember. Brexit'll go GREAT with Theresa. #BattleForNumber10 
Corbyn was asked about his personal beliefs & if they matched his party stance. Can someone ask Mrs May about personal views on Brexit? 
Applause for PM - will do what is right by the country in Brexit negotiations. Your choice: Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn #BattleForNumber10 
Dude in audience thinks being "a bloody difficult woman" helps with Brexit negotiationsNope. Inflexibility not a help#BattleForNumber10 
May claims she stands for what she believes is right. Like how she campaigned for Remained and now supports Brexit.. #BattleForNumber10 
May on NHS is bs...We're dropping per capita & per GDP.But she's *right* that Brexit impacts the £ - it will hurt.#BattleForNumber10 
'The Tories promised £350 mill saved each week for the NHS after Brexit. Can you explain that lie?' No. Next question?' #BattleForNumber10 
Britain Tells Chamber to "Get Over It'.  Donald Trump & Brexit Won! We Must Understand Why People Felt Left Behind 
Applause on Brexit and on NHS funding. The former her strong point, the latter not. May pretty composed and competent. 
The only way to get a strong NHS is with a strong economy - and that means getting the Brexit deal right #BattleForNumber10 
Just 11 days after we vote the EU will start Brexit negotiations with Britain and Theresa May needs every vote for the best Brexit hand 
Brexit is central to everything - that's why it's vital to back Theresa May to get the best deal possible. #BattleForNumber10 
As the PM says, she has a plan and only she can get the best possible deal in the Brexit discussions #BattleForNumber10 
Apparently some people voted for Brexit based solely on a slogan on the side of a bus. Really ?????????#battlefornumber10 
Congratulations to the producer who found a woman who voted Brexit BECAUSE OF the bus 
Brexit negotiations starting 11 days after the General Election - who do you want at the table for the UK?  
May on the £350m money for BrexitMay no commitment to NHS funding... just "best deal" vapid talk.#BattleForNumber10 
More applause on Brexit. May is not blowing their doors off but so far she's looking composed. Stable you might say 
Lack of answers from Theresa May. Nothing on the £350m NHS lie during the brexit campaign. 
You wouldn’t sign a contract without reading the terms would you? Only Lib Dems will let you check the Brexit terms.#VoteLibDem #MayvCorbyn 
Ridiculous question on the Brexit campaign. May not responsible for questionable claims about extra money for NHS #BattleforNo10 
May called out on the £350 million to NHS Brexit lie! #BattleForNumber10 
“It was going to be the Brexit Election but it seems that other concerns were dominating.” @sbg1 
Quite extraordinary that a PM who called election because of Brexit yet to be asked about it. Hope Paxo has better line of q than with JC 
@theresa_may claims she wants what's fairer for younger generations- while pushing a hard Brexit that 70%+ of them oppose. #VoteLibDem 
Serious Q - If May can't face other party leaders in a TV debate, how can she be the right person to negotiate Brexit? #VoteLibDem #GE2017 
"There's going to be a deal...we will make sure there's a deal" - Jeremy Corbyn insists Labour will secure a Brexit deal #BattleForNumber10 
If Corbyn gets through this without punching Paxman clean in the tits, he's more than fit to enter Brexit negotiations. #BattleForNumber10 
Strong SNP voices will ensure the Tories don't trade away Scottish jobs in Brexit talks. #VoteSNP #BattleforNumber10  
Paxman's questioning have all the surgical precision of your pissed-up great uncle trying to start a fight about Brexit at Christmas dinner 
Paxman: Tell me about BrexitCorbyn: IPaxman: I'M ASKING A SIMPLE QUESTIONCorbyn: Can I finiPaxman: NO 
In contrast to May, Jeremy Corbyn insists there WILL be a deal on BrexitJeremy Paxman has a childish hissy fit. #BattleForNumber10 
#BattleForNumber10 I trust Corbyn and Starmer to negotiate the best possible BrexitI don't trust May, Davis, Johnson 
The Brexit negotiations look set to start 11 days after the election. Don't risk Corbyn in charge of Brexit.  #BattleForNumber10 
Who would you rather negotiate Brexit #BattleForNumber10 
Paxo is right - when the Brexit talks begin the EU leaders will have Jezza for breakfast #battlefornumber10 
Corbyn is keeping calm while Jeremy Paxman is struggling to control himself. One reason why Labour would be better to negotiate Brexit 
Corbyn handles Paxman well on differences between his own position and Labour policy...Ahem... hope for Brexit sense!#BattleForNumber10 
Corbyn on Brexit: He says we should be part of some EU frameworks... yeah- that's not enough. Not different from Tory#BattleForNumber10 
Will anybody inform Mr Corbyn that talking about "a close relation with Europe" is nonsense? Britain IS in Europe (despite Brexit) #GE2017 
A ratification referendum ensures the government isn't handed a blank cheque on Brexit #BattleForNumber10 
Only the Liberal Democrats are offering YOU the final say on the Brexit deal. #BattleForNumber10 
IFS: Corbyn's corporation tax rises will hit wages. Don't risk this shambles in charge of our Brexit negotiations #BattleForNumber10 
 If you don't want Theresa May to have a free hand for a damaging Brexit, you need a strong opposition. #BattleForNumber10 #VoteSNP #GE17 
Only Theresa May will get the best deal for Britain on Brexit #BattleForNumber10 
Fact is Labour position on Brexit makes more sense and closer to delivering what was voted for than Tories hard Brexit plan #BattleforNo10 
Not happy with Corbyn's answer on Brexit. We should keep an option to remain on the table- or to try and reshape.#BattleForNumber10 
Truth is Labour under Corbyn have position that most Brits agree with: a Brexit that works & doesn't tank our economy #BattleForNumber10 
There's literally no reason to vote Corbyn rather than Lib Dem if you're worried about Brexit. None. #BattleForNumber10 
Only the Lib Dems will stand up for immigrants. Corbyn is backing May's disastrous hard Brexit #mayvcorbyn #votelibdem 
You don't sign CONTRACTS without checking the FACTS. Request another Referendum to agree on the TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF BREXIT #VoteLibDem 
Lib Dems will guarantee you the final say over the Brexit deal. Your future, your choice. #Paxman #VoteLibDem 
Corbyn: "Free movement stops when we leave the EU" = no single market = hard Brexit = same as Tories #BattleForNumber10 @LibDems 
I'm calling for immediate devolution of powers to @ScotParl following #Brexit to protect from 1-size-fits-all Westminster policy #GE17Rural 
Not funny. Not clever or charming. Buffoonery with a nasty edge. Brexit negotiations are chaotic. People's livelihoods are at stake. #GE17 
I'm backing our Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May to get the best #Brexit deal for Britain #BattleForNumber10 
In the #BattleForNumber10, there is another option. Theresa May won't offer you a final say on the Brexit deal, but we will. #VoteLibDems 
The Brexit negotiations look set to begin 11 days after the election - it's clear you can't risk it with Corbyn #BattleForNumber10 
Getting Brexit right is central to everything - and only Theresa May can and will get the best deal for Britain #BattleForNumber10 
Brexit is an illogical mess, badly thought out project, complete waste of time & money, divisive & destructive abhorrence. It's pure madness  
With so much at stake, let's not risk the shambolic Jeremy Corbyn going into the Brexit negotiations on our behalf #BattleForNumber10 
Vote Conservative to strengthen Theresa May's hand in the Brexit negotiations - and get the best deal for Britain #BattleForNumber10 
Just 11 days after you vote, the EU will start Brexit negotiations with Britain. Only Theresa May can deliver #BattleForNumber10 
People tonight are deciding who they trust to protect our economic & national security, and to negotiate our Brexit deal #BattleForNumber10 
Merkel says that she & her EU cohorts intend to 'eat nails for breakfast & spit rust out' over Brexit negotiations! Don't leave it to Corbyn 
Spokeswoman @neusmunte: "There is much ignorance about the political reality"  #referendum  
And every time you open yours Brexit leave numbers increase.Thanks  
Wondering what "Strong and stable" Dalek Theresa May will do when she discovers the EU talks are upstairs. #brexit #GE2017 
& that, ladies & gentleman, is how this country's Brexit negotiations will be conducted. 
The Brexit challenge in the Irish High Court has been thrown out!  
What utter garbage is being spun by the Scottish Tories today - Corbyn has repeatedly said No referendum - No Independence, No alliance 
Boris Johnson on Brexit. What diabolical way for a Foreign Sec to behave. Never answers a question, thinks it's all a joke. It's on you mate  
"I don't see why we should have to pay a divorce bill" - Paul Nuttall on #Brexit settlement  #BBCElection #GE2017 
Forget who-said-what-aboutery from 30 years ago. The biggest threat to peace in Northern Ireland is a Tory hard Brexit. 
Its a shame I have to vote Conservative to get Brexit, as UKIP are speaking so much common sense right now. #AndrewNeilInterviews

And you think Lab will stop #Brexit? Sorry to be blunt, but you need to get real: check their manifesto, voting record & Corbyn statements

Disappointed by Leave lies? @Molly4Bristol believes once we know the deal, the people -not politicians- should have a final say on Brexit.  
Why ‘Brexit’ Will Make Britain’s Mediocre Economy Worse

Jeremy Corbyn says he would 'open discussions' with the SNP over a second independence referendum  
Pleased to be endorsed by @BestForBritain as the #Greenwich and #Woolwich candidate best placed to stop an extreme and damaging hard Brexit.  
I cannot overstate how angry and disgusted I am that you and your party will not accept the result of your own referendum.  
Angela Merkel picks her battles, and that should worry London. #Brexit #UKElection2017

#Brexit bill, #righttoremain and border controls key to negotiations. UK is ill-prepared for all. Trouble ahead 
Yeah, about that:1) If Mrs May has a Brexit plan, now would be a good time to tell us about it, because it starts looking like she hasn't

How can Britain be stronger when we will become weaker due to Brexit ?

Dominic, people go to food banks b/c they are skint. Tory Austerity started it and Tory Hard Brexit will amplify it 
Jeremy Corbyn says he will "open discussions" with Scottish govt over independence referendum if he wins election

Theresa May's hard Brexit would mean the UK couldn't access vital EU-wide security database. Euroscepticism gone mad  
Vote Labour, get indyref2. To stop a second referendum, and to stop the SNP, vote for Ruth Davidson's @ScotTories 
Don’t believe Corbyn can negotiate Brexit, keep our economy strong or nation secure? Don’t want him to be PM? #VoteConservative on 8 June

Parliament should face up to the fact that the EU referendum & Brexit outcome was a 'bungled' & mismanaged process; not too late to salvage.  
Post-Brexit.  
Brexit has diminished Britain, entirely as we predicted. Even the Express has noticed. Slow hand clap Leavers  
Even the Express has spotted that Brexit has lead UK to become a global also-ran. Global Britain my a***  
A hung parliament would be better with SNP and lindems holding balance of power and being able at least to enforce 2nd referendum. 
Merkel has said Europe must take 'our fate into our own hands'. Is this new world order what you hoped for when you voted for Brexit?

The election isn't about hard Brexit, it is about hard Tory. Pure Tory. Food banks, grammar schools, fox hunts, fat cats, hungry kids.

Former Deputy PM @Nick_Clegg tells Adrian Chiles the UK could lose access to terror database under Theresa May's Brexit terms #5liveDaily 
Nicola Sturgeon is planning another divisive independence referendum. Only Labour can beat the SNP. Vote Labour on June 8.  
But Brexit does. You cannot walk out of 3rd most important treaty orgsnisation in world and pretend there are no geo-political consequences  
Most voters here want a vote on final Brexit deal - only @LibDems offer that and if people don't like it they must have option to remain 
Dear @theresa_may Can you explain how you're tough enough to deal with Brexit when you're too weak to debate @jeremycorbyn ?Yours,John 
Theresa May has no international friends. How is she going to negotiate a #Brexit deal? It will be #BrexitShambles #ToriesOut #GE2017 
The Brexit referendum question was flawed in its design  
Dear Brexshiters. Sorry if any of my words or tweets offend you. You need to understand that I am offended by Brexit every single day. 
Only Theresa May can sail the UK through the narrow straits & choppy waters of #Brexit.Labour disunity would be our undoing, they're a mess 
The EU wants to start Brexit negotiations 11 days after #GE2017. Your vote decides who negotiates for Britain: Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn. 
Brexit: Lib Dem manifesto pledges new EU referendum 
.@nick_clegg May's approach to Brexit is a threat to national security. You can read the facts here >  
Every attempt to stop Brexit has made our departure from the EU more certain. My Sunday article for @IndyVoices  
Even Remainers can see that if you enter #Brexit negotiations with the EU you will need strength & determination to make the tough decisions  
Tories: "Brexit creates the right opportunity to control migration... we will get workers we need, not wholesale cheap labour"  
We will be leaving after 19yrs. Husband is neurobiologist applied for job in France. UK sci is getting decimated by Brexit already. 
£ billions that would be spent on the NHS & social care isn't bc of Brexit... People are dying to pay for Brexit  
UKIP: "This scaremongering must stop, people voted for Brexit and it's about time the Lib Dems got behind it"  
Brexit will be intricate. On a radio panel yesterday I raised problems already facing scientists and just got back slogans from the Tory.  
Rudd says UK wants 'deep & special relationship with EU' - OK so let's REMAIN IN THE EU. The dishonest  #Brexit rhetoric is maddening.

Look. It's a clear choice. Who should represent us at the Brexit talks? Corbyn or someone I choose to cover for me because I'm too scared? 
InvestNI CEO and ex DUP Spad Alistair Hamilton welcomed Brexit. Still waiting to see how this "guru" sees it improving the NI economy.  
My Aim is Civil Disobedience Until We Get a Referendum – Nnamdi Kanu  
The reason May wants a blank cheque & won't set out her Brexit plan is clear - she doesn't have a plan 
We will always stand against being dragged back to another referendum when the people of Scotland don't want it. #GE2017 
Your weekly reminder Brexit negotiations set to start in 3 weeks. As the EU extols transparency, we don't have a detail on May's 'plan'. 
Why do UK parties want to block a Scottish referendum? It's nothing to do with reasons they offer.It's because they're afraid YES will win. 
The PM is saying she will be "tough" in Brexit negotiations but cannot come out of hiding to debate or talk to real voters #WeakAndWobbly

Two thirds of those MPs who are standing as candidates on 8th June are still trying to stop Brexit ignoring the will of the people

Britain can't escape its financial commitments to EU, Germany's deputy finance minister says  
If you are one of the 52% who voted for Brexit a vote for these will be a vote to remain  
Let's be clear. Jeremy Corbyn has said he will take any deal on #Brexit. Only Theresa May has said full Brexit, or she'll walk away. #GE2017 
Mrs May is a Brexit disgrace I agree get @nick_clegg to talk to the EU he will get us a deal & @timfarron will give you a vote on the deal! 
Given you're barely allowed out in public, I'd say the knives are out for you. So who knows which Tory would negotiate Brexit. Boris? Gove?  
Ignorance of British media on EU policies & law really on show in failure to hold govt to account on 'cake & eat it' Brexit claims 
Brexit is already exacerbating NHS crises of staffing and £. A US-UK trade deal is also sharpening the knife.  
Seems to me the Tories have made a balls up of this election campaign. Can we really depend on them to negotiate #Brexit? Don't think so. 
8 great reasons to #VoteConservative at #GE2017 - from getting the best Brexit deal to more housing and more funding for schools and health.  
The folk attacking Corbyn over The Troubles are the same folk whose Brexit threatens to revive them. It's almost like it's pure opportunism.

Merkel gets it: BREXIT and Trump are actually good for EU emerging as a world power in its own right. 
Merkel says the postwar western alliance had been undermined by the #Brexit vote and Donald Trump’s election. She's right. 
Europe cannot rely on US and faces life without UK,says Merkel  via @FT (neither can, nor should post-BREXIT Britain) 
A Vote for anyone other than Theresa May will result in the weakening of our #Brexit position ... Corbyn considering Sturgeon 'Alliance' !

This has been one of my main concerns regarding #Brexit. We have always worked together with the EU in fighting terror.

Listen to this Tory Secretary of State for Brexit agreeing with @jeremycorbyn Curious don't you think? 
Yep. I know a lot of very racist, fascist Labour voters. They read the DM and all voted Brexit. And THOSE are the ones Corbyn sided with.

No idea why it took so long for people to see Brexit was a phase of Putin's attack on Western Democracy. Still not hearing it in MSM. 
Can't stress how inept this is. Trust her over Brexit, peace, war. My saggy old arse   
When will the realisation that the EU is essential for all our futures eventually sink in? #Brexit #remain #GE2017 
This is the problem with Labour. So much good stuff then hard Brexit. The worst decision ever. Ideology over the economy. Madness.  
The Conservative attempt to turn election into 'terrorist' issue is about fear and hatred.TM is not the person to negotiate a soft Brexit.  
Please don't forget if we hadn't been lied to by all the unionist parties sco would be independent & not involved in brexit fiasco 
*Brexit Negotiations Start In June*  
A profound headine: "Merkel: Europe 'can no longer rely on allies' after Trump and Brexit." It's a strategic weakness in the Atlantic region 
When serious laws are broken, are they put to referendum based on politics? Or are they enforced through non-political mechanisms? 
.NOW the Brexit Reality Bites!Vote for #WeakAndWobblyMay if you want the UK to be Less STRONG & Less STABLE. 
This bodes very badly for #Brexit, and for everyone in UK. Germany has long been #may and Brexiters main hope for a good deal. V worrying 
Let me whisper in your ear before you go to bed:Vote @LibDems in #GE2017 and stop #brexit.Love to all. 
There is so much for US to worry about in what Merkel implied in her strong rebuke of a Trump and Brexit  
Two out of three people believe that Theresa May should reveal her Brexit strategy more clearly before polling day.   
May: "Shut up, UK! I'm strong and stable! You don't need to know the details of Brexit!"Oh, but we do. 
As Brexit looms, Merkel set to deliver lesson to May on the true meaning of 'strong & stable'. 
8) Brexit isn't seen as "plucky", it's just seen as stupid,vain & destructive.Our standing in the world just plummeted, our influence 
Majority of voters want Theresa May to spell out #Brexit plans before #GE2017  < PM is demanding a 'blank cheque' ? 
The idea that Theresa May would be a good steward of Brexit negotiations is farcical when she can't even oversee a coherent costed manifesto  
People are more scared of losing their job to a robot than because of Brexit  
*Brexit Explained*  
Tory cuts are undermining the police and army, while Tory #Brexit is undermining our alliances & Western security.#GE2017 #GE17 #Remain 
1) this is hugely significant & a lasting consequence of #brexit.We've become so used to the western consensus & protection of NATO..  
Trump's actions are helping Putin undermine Western security And here's May holding hands with him#GE2017 #Brexit  
The interesting thing is, alot of people who vote labour (Corbyn) actually supported brexit and are not to fond of migrants. 
If the right cucks out they won't get anywhere. Populism, wether from the left or the right is what will win votes. That's why brexit won. 
The numbers who support Brexit today vastly exceeds those who voted for it in the referendum.  
Here's @CalumKerrSNP standing up to the UK Govt's extreme Brexit that will hurt Scotland's farming communities.  
But #Brexit hasn't changed anything! We're stronger out!We're now in control of our borders! We're... we're......We're fucked aren't we?  
As an ex-Tory I find myself astonished to say that the Tories are no longer the party of business or of national security.#Brexit #GE2017 
Here's @AlexSalmond laying down 50 amendments to the Tories brexit bill & standing up for Scotland's interests.  
Next it's @StephenGethins standing up to Theresa May's extreme Brexit obsession & protecting 80,000 Scottish jobs.  
Majority of voters want May to spell out Brexit plans before electionShe's weak, wobbly and doesn't have a clue.. 
#Merkel confirms Trump & Britain's  Conservative Party led by May not trustworthy.  Brexit will destroy everything we have built since WW2  
Theresa the Tory too gutless to debate @JeremyCorbynReady for Brexit?Strong and stable? She's weak, weak, weak. 
Let's remind ourselvesWe wouldn't have been in this position (Brexit) if Labour had not pandered to UKIP voters and ignored the referendum 
Were May principled,she'd have set out why Brexit would be a disaster for the UK,refused to implement it,resigned,& then sought re-election. 
Quick search of HansardScotland - 43Jobcentre closures - 15Human rights - 12Brexit - 9Emissions - 9LGBT issues - 9Independence - 5 
Brexit would destroy our United Kingdom, but this election provides an opportunity to destroy Brexit.  
Nicola Sturgeon is more interested in another independence referendum than opposing austerity or standing up against the Tories.  
Former British Ambassador & peace negotiator. On May, her lack of emotional intelligence & instinctive hostility. Prefers Corbyn for Brexit.  
At local hustings, nasty party audience doubted need for food banks and shouted down debate on Brexit. Vote @GarethLibDem if that isn't you. 
Angela Merkel says Europe can no longer rely on US or UK after Trump and Brexit  
She's also saying Derek Mackay never suggested Brexit impact was higher on Scotland than elsewhere - both he and Kerevan said exactly that 
Yes. And that's important. For the most part it's a mild, lazy, curtain-twitching type of bigotry. Brexit was its high watermark. 
JC: While the SNP obsesses over how to get another divisive independence referendum, by contrast Labour believes that together were stronger  
Let's hope the sequel to the Merkel Intervention is the Brexit Reversal#RobertLudlumPolitics 
Nicola Sturgeon's plans for another independence referendum would bring turbo-charged austerity to Scotland.  
We're seeing a disastrous combination: Trump destroys the idea of Western unity, while Brexit ties UK to US at the worst possible moment.

It's important to understand that Merkel didn't only address Trump but also Brexit UK. Anglo-Americans decided to deviate from joint path. 
Merkel: 'Britain is no longer a reliable partner following Brexit':  Well we all know what she can do!! 
THIS. So if we leave EU we have no friends and allies. We have to stop #Brexit. @LibDems have the best manifesto & 2nd Ref. #votelibdem 
Ruth Davidson: No independence referendum 'any time soon'  
Doesn't also the lack of detail on Brexit undermine scope for making this an election about Brexit, other than offering vague platitudes. 
Great film about BBC bias during the Scottish Referendum - London Calling  via @DocsOnline 
Sour grapes from Merkel who knows after #brexit Germany will be the sole net contributor to the EU 
.@NicolaSturgeon: if you want Scotland's voice to be heard on brexit & contest a hard Tory brexit, vote for the SNP.  
This is what happens when May's aggressive hard #Brexit allies itself with Trumps isolationism - Europe moves on without us.  #notinourname 
It's not an excuse, costs have gone up directly due to Brexit Shambles.  
#Merkel comments re security + unpredictable internat partners aimed at Germanelectorate not Trump or #Brexit Britain She's on campaigntrail

Young Brits on #Brexit: "I voted remain, & now I worry that Brexit will limit my chances of living & working abroad"  
If she can't face the opposition leaders in the UK, how on earth will she ever face the leaders of the EU nations in Brexit negotiations.  
Remind me who the intolerant ones are, again? #Brexit  
Tories very fond of alleging "chaos". Yet what could be more chaotic than THEIR handling of Brexit, budget, manifesto,A50 case & police cuts 
Deeply worrying potential split in Western alliance which UK must resist&convince its allies that Brexit doesn't change UK basic geopolitics  
May's crash and burn Brexit could see the UK drawn into alliance of paranoia and irrelevance with Donald Trump. #WeakAndWobbly 
NO BREXIT is the best deal. The economy is safest in Lib Dem hands.#GE2017 
You forgot: 'We'll take you house if you get dementia but you can keep it if it's cancer'. And: What. Does. 'Best. Brexit. Deal'. Mean??  
...there is simply no bigger economic risk facing us than a cliff-edge Brexit. We are not talking about it enough in this election:  
Does the person closest to you (partner, sibling , child , parent) share the same #ge2017 and #brexit views as you ? 
That would mean the French and Germans are smarter than 49% of Americans. The Brits lose points for Brexit. 
Theresa May's 'no deal is better than a bad deal' Brexit logic could end up destroying the British economy.

Those thoughts on the vague, insidious linking of immigration to terrorism, #Brexit, and reason vs extremism, in a more manageable format.  
We should reduce our carbon footprint by supporting British organic producers post-Brexit.  
I suspect these events and rhetoric also help those wanting more integrated EU-wide intel and security cooperation in the EU27 post-Brexit. 
.@afneil Is there any reason you never ask if Brexit is a good idea? #JustAsking 
There is no "right" Brexit.  Stop talking utter nonsense.You've had 7 years to build a "fairer" Britain and chosen to make it more UNfair.

Neither of you. Why can't we have someone with the guts to say that Brexit is a ridiculous notion, and just cancel it?  
Would that be the democratically and legally legitimate referendum already voted through by our parliament? So they don't respect Scot parl? 
The Federal Government and the National Assembly should allow the SE hold a referendum. Then this question will be answered.  
Every single Tory tweet today is abt Brexit. What's wrong, darlings? Are you a bit shaken by the polls? But yes, let's remember Brexit! 1/  
Only Labour will protect jobs & workers through Brexit. The Tories’ Brexit deal will mean a race to the bottom on wages & workers’ rights.  
The campaign against Brexit has been one of the most unsuccessful political movements in the world – @JohnRentoul 
A cannier politician than May would've been less strident on Brexit. She's made it v hard for the 48% (inc Tories) to want to vote for her. 
Boris Johnson, who is literally FOREIGN SECRETARY, went to a SIKH TEMPLE to say how great it'll be to import alcohol from India after Brexit 
No sign that business investment is suffering after the Brexit vote.

Theresa's May's 'no deal is better than a bad deal' Brexit logic could end up destroying the British economy  
"There is NO support for another independence referendum", says Davidson. Those exact words. 
Polls are unreliable. They made people complacent during the EU referendum. Do not get comfortable.  
Funny how the tories think it's important Corbyn doesn't negotiate Brexit, but they're happy to walk away with no deal at all from the EU. 
8 great reasons to vote Conservative - from getting the best Brexit deal to more housing and more funding for schools and health. #GE2017 
'Only Theresa May can be trusted to negotiate Brexit'. The prime minister will now attempt to hammer home that point  
That awkward moment when your deluded socially awkward PM believes she can negotiate Brexit Shambles & millions of people believe her.  
"Our job is to block a referendum" - Kezia Dugdale on #bbcsp Labour in Scotland are now by definition 'anti-democratic'... 
KEZIA DUGDALE just SAID NO REFERENDUM 197 TIMES IN 10 MINUTES on BBC despite being asked her policy all she said was "no referendum" 
Kanu is asking for a referendum but says it's Biafra or death. That's contradictory. Will he commit suicide if Igbos vote for Nigeria? 
Back Theresa May and her team, so she can deliver her plan for a stronger Britain. Don’t risk Corbyn in charge of Brexit – and our country.  
The billions to be wasted on #Brexit could be spent on education & training which would give people real control over their lives#GE2017

Lib Dems: ‘Brexit undermines universities at every turn’  
Diane Abbott getting grief about what she said 35yrs ago yet Theresa May can U turn on brexit, snap election and dementia tax with impunity 
Amazing we're not allowed to ask May in #GE2017 if Brexit was such a great idea. From the pro-Brexit Sunday Times:  
Leading architects see #brexit as damaging to business, exchange of ideas, movement of staff & research/education  
I'm the only candidate in North Norfolk who backs Brexit and Theresa May's plan to deliver it. Negotiations start 11 days after #GE2017 
Ah "for you & your family" ... nobody really believes that. A Conservative brexit is for bankers & the wealthy; our families are collateral 
Tories in BBC @TheresaMay_MP if you can't face the British public in a simple debate how would you face Brexit negotiators? Weak & wobbly.

"The campaign against Brexit has been one of the most unsuccessful political movements in the world" by @JohnRentoul  
The weak, ineffective, incompetent & dithering way @theresa_may has run this campaign shows her completely unfit to be in charge of #Brexit 
Although Stirling has fallen and growth slowed we are still in the #Brexit 'phoney war'. Worse to come when the reality becomes clear. 
Leavers should have to apply for a permit to move to a different town, then perhaps they'd understand how angry we are.#Brexit #GE2017 
Labour's Stoke candidate branded Jeremy Corbyn 'IRA supporting friend of Hamas' and criticised Brexit  
What she means is the election she promised she wouldn't call was deliberately organised to be 11 days before Brexit negotiations.  
If & when Theresa May does start negotiating Brexit everyone will know it.  
Excellent thread. How UK's deals with EU are about presentation, not power to act in UK's interests. Highly Brexit-relevant.  
People are more scared of losing their job to a robot than because of Brexit  
Scotland must decide if it wants to be the last bastion of Brexit resistance or fall in line  
She knows Brexit will be a dissaster for the UK but her priority is appeasing her rabid MP's which she knows is the only way to stay in No10  
These are the numbers behind the most difficult issues for Brexit negotiators  
If May cracks up in pressure of election, how can she be trusted to negotiate Brexit?Much better Corbyn and Starmer#VoteLabour 
#TheresaMay wont debate other party leaders but tells us she's the best to negotiate #brexit! #VoteLabour #GE2017 
Never fear; this is to be our bedrock post Brexit.

Such astounding cowardice from May. How can she possibly succeed at the Brexit negotiations if she's such a weak, vacillating yellow-belly?  
This man is launching a judicial review of against Brexit because he says it's 'unlawful'

May alarms ministers with election U-turn as Brexit talks loom  
I think that has finally put to bed any notion that Theresa  May is the right person to run the country & negotiate #Brexit with the EU. 
A nation that voted Brexit could vote for Corbyn. I'm not a fan and I'm not placing that bet - yet. But I'm seriously studying the odds. 
Theresa May is an embarrassment who would be useless in negotiations on Brexit. She would struggle to lead a Council, never mind the UK.  
Elisha was a good councillor & a great Mayor. I think she's only getting started &will be a first class MP. Sends a clear no Brexit here  
Before the Govt start telling us how much they will invest in NHS,social care,education,etc, can they pls tell us how much Brexit will cost?

And this is the woman you want to trust with our Brexit negotiations?

We all thought May went to the US to talk about Brexit. Now it's clear she went to get some election tips. 
The choice facing the British public on 8th June is clear: who do you trust to get the best deal for Brexit – me or Jeremy Corbyn?

An effective post-Brexit settlement would enable British universities to continue attracting int’l talent, contributing to a successful UK.  
There is nothing more difficult to plan,more doubtful of success,or more dangerous than to change the established order! Sounds like Brexit

This is nuts. May keeps saying "this is about me or Corbyn negotiating Brexit". But that's only an issue because SHE CALLED AN ELECTION.

Hard to take Theresa May seriously about being a strong hand in Brexit negotiations when she bins a manifesto commitment within 4 days. 
I feel like I'm living in some dystopian future in which there is a permanent election/referendum campaign, but we never get to polling day. 
2 things you can do now to fight a hard Brexit1 Register to vote 2 Campaign in a key seat 
May's interview with @afneil was a total shambles. No answers to basic questions on social care, NHS funding or Brexit. 
Mrs May has failed to agree a manifesto with her own Party.Don't think she's going to manage a Brexit deal with 20-odd other governments! 
As predicted May refuses to answer Qs on social care cap, NHS funding, NI rise, winter fuel payments and Brexit. Won't play well with voters  
I have never seen a PM flanneling around as badly as May on @afneil. How on earth will she cope with Brexit negotiations? 
You're not going to have a strong economy with #Brexit. 
Strong performance by PM @theresa_may w/@afneil. There are 17 days to polling day – let’s back her to get Brexit right and secure our future 
If Theresa May can't handle an Andrew Neil interview, how on earth will she cope negotiating Brexit? #GE2017  #ToriesOut2017 #bbcelection

Catalonia's government has drafted a secret bill setting out steps to independence — with or without a referendum 
Theresa May isn't looking so strong and stable now – do we really want her leading us into the Brexit negotiations?  
Theresa May doesn't even have the strength of her own convictions. Strong & stable in Brexit negotiations? Seems unlikely.  
Ha ! Theresa has changed her mind AGAIN ! #DementiaTaxStrong & Stable ?And SHE wants to LEAD us through the treacherous path of #Brexit ! 
If May & Corbyn are the only answers, you've asked the wrong question. 'Let's stop Brexit & prosper' is on the ballot. It's called #LibDems 
Brexit will 'harm science', say top university leaders  
So we've learnt Tories are thick & incompetent, and when try to correct mistakes make things worse. Now imagine Brexit negotiations.

UK PM Theresa May to play the Brexit card as her poll lead shrinks:  via @ReutersTV

#StrongAndStable.Oh, and #TheresaMay was for #Remain, too. Maybe she won't do #Brexit!Who knows when you deal with #UTurnTheresa 
Labour have been flip-flopping on the benefit freeze, Trident, Brexit and immigration throughout this entire campaign.  
How is May going to look strong & stable in Brexit talks after she's caved on a key policy after 3 days? Merkel & Macron will make mincemeat 
Following May's #dementiatax 'clarification' it would also be helpful if she stated that #brexit will now take the form of staying in the EU 
#Brexit and the coming food crisis: ‘If you can’t feed a country, you haven’t got a country’  
It is, but then Labour manifesto suggests those types of figures lost Brexit tug-of-war with the leadership.  
That sound you can hear is  EU Brexit negotiators rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of Mrs May or May Not   
May's shambolic handling of the social care "u-turn" gives you an idea of how chaotic Brexit negotiations will be if she's leading them 
Sometime soon Theresa May will set out her terms for Brexit. Three days later she'll reverse them #StrongandStable 
EU agrees final Brexit negotiating position after Britain threatens to quit talks  
Wonder what the Brexit negotiations will be like, then?  
Two years after equal marriage referendum in 26 counties, people here still demanding equality. #LoveEquality 
However the fact that May can u-turn like a spinning top so quickly has its advantages...if she keeps going there will be no #Brexit. 
So now we have the official EU negotiating mandate for the first phase of Brexit talks. Some comments 1/x  
Swedish EU Minister @AnnLinde on authorising @EU_Commission to open #Brexit negotiations with the UK.  
I think the leader who has u-turned so soon on a manifesto pledge for an election she called will be great at Brexit negotiations... 
U-turn s  are great. Let's have one on Brexit. Save the country lots more grief. 
"Weak and Wobbly" ... like Brexit Theresa May ploughing an unsteady furrow on Dementia Tax

Full text of EU Brexit negotiating mandate as just adopted here - (after 'next steps' at bottom of the page):  
As @FT reported yesterday, May barely consulted with her cabinet on last minute #dementiatax proposals. Doesn't bode well for Brexit negs.  
Latest U-turn again confirms May as entirely reactive to events, not in command of them. Which again means really bad news for Brexit.  
5 major U-turns by PM May in 10 months: Brexit, NI rise, workers on boards, snap election, entire social care policy. How can we trust her? 
#Brexit Given the unprecedented nature of #Article50 negotiations, the EU will ensure a max. level of #transparency 
Turns out "strong & stable" May offers considerable inconsistency on Brexit, snap elections, workers on boards & now social care too. #UTurn 
Hey weak & wobbly May why not do another uturn & agree to debate Corbyn on live TV?How can we trust you to negotiate Brexit if too scared? 
Our PM said she won't have "running commentary" on Brexit negotiations. Thanks for your transparency. Real democracy absent in UK now.

Its official: #Brexit negotiations in full swing with both a substantive and formal asymmetry:  EU knows and tells what it wants not the U.K  
PM says she is "100% committed” to Brexit and has been since she told everyone it was a terrible idea and voted against it. 
Corbyn stands by principles. May writes a plan so bad she can't stick to it for more than 4 days. Who do you want at Brexit negotiations?  
We just received mandate to begin #Article50 negotiations with UK.We are ready. Formal negotiations to begin as soon as UK is ready. #Brexit  
"Hard Brexit" is Brexit. "Soft Brexit" is EU Associate Membership. It would come with most of the costs, none of the benefits.  
We need the right Brexit deal for Britain. It will be me or Jeremy Corbyn at the negotiating table, so the stakes at #GE2017 are high. 
The EU's Brexit negotiating team will be looking at this unprecedented mid-campaign U-turn & smiling at what it shows about the PM's resolve  
If Theresa May is doing a U-Turn on a key policy after just 4 days, do you REALLY think that she's strong enough to negotiate Brexit? 
She says she's strong and stable but does whatever the Mail and a tiny coterie of hard Brexit MPs tell her to do.

Like Theresa May. No-one knows what sort of projectile #Brexit is, except that it is already starting to blow up in our faces.  
Real threat to pensioners is failing to get Brexit right.Everything depends on Brexit negotiations.That is why we need TM as PM after 8 June 
"Boris, why are you legalising foxhunting?""Jeremy Corbyn.""Elderly care?""Corbyn""How is Brexit going to work?""Corbyn" 
"Forget that, that's done" @timfarron says about the referendum, saying #Brexit is happening, but the people should get the final say #Ridge 
Call him out on his Brexit lies.   
Davis: Britain will walk away from Brexit talks unless Brussels drops demands to charge us €100bn to leave the EU  
Farron tells Sophy: May has called election now to avoid any Brexit details, "question is who should have final say? Politicians or people?" 
Are the "older people" that Labour pretend to care SO much about related to the "older people" they blamed for Brexit? Just wondering.... 
The UK's top universities are highly dependent on #EU talent. #Brexit a massive threat  #GE2017 
Every vote for @theresa_may’s team will strengthen her hand at the Brexit negotiations to get the best deal for your family. #GE2017 
Hardly surprising as Tories, Labour and media barely talking about it. This is a Brexit election without Brexit debate La La Land  
But hey, I got another Tory leaflet yesterday telling me that 'Ruth Davidson' still opposes a 2nd referendum. That's alright then..... 
Without any MPs, @UKIP forced Cameron to "offer a referendum he never wanted to give", @paulnuttallukip tells #Marr that UKIP will be back 
23. Those who don't want a 2nd #EURef are against democracy and do not deserve your vote at #GE2017. Tell your kids, oldies and friends 
Corbyn's rejection of Freedom of Movement is a surrender to the hate & lies against immigrants of the #Brexit billionaire press.#GE2017 
Can't tell you how much adrenaline sending this to governments, NATO, and the FBI set off... #TrumpRussia #Brexit #GE2017 
#Marr With the greatest respect Damian Green,I would trust Starmer & Corbyn FAR MORE than Davis & May on #Brexit negotiations#ToriesOut2017 
Britain threatens to walk away from Brexit talks if it faces a huge bill from the EU  
After having voted to give Theresa May a blank cheque for Brexit, Labour is refusing to oppose £7bn of benefit cuts 
Is this the more open and more liberal UK that some of the Brexit folks talked about? Or the reverse?  
PM: The EU must pay its own Brexit bill for Britain's share of the European Investment Bank and other joint projects  
Brexit and the coming food crisis: ‘If you can’t feed a country, you haven’t got a country’  
Theresa May: Brussels must pay its own Brexit bill of billions | Davis warns UK will quit talks if EU demands €100bn  
Time to pack for Geneva, and the most important election of the year, more important than Trump, Brexit, or May. Yes, it's the DG of WHO. 
I’d rather him than May marching us over a Hard Brexit cliff while punishing the poor and vulnerable, destroying the NHS/public services etc 
No, UK voted for Brexit thanks to incompetence, ignorance, lies, propaganda, and dark money. The irony is immigration could have been sorted pic.twitter.com/JMEXbKdXJF 
Trust Corbyn with Brexit? You must be joking, says @BorisJohnson:

On how "the underlying reason [for Brexit] is the hubris and ignorance of much of the British elite"  
Day after ref #Corbyn called for triggering of Art 50. This betrayed his eagerness for #Brexit & lack of awareness of damaging complexity 
Theresa May said the Scots should wait till the #Brexit situation becomes clearer, but she thinks we should vote in the dark.#GE2017 #GE17 
#Britain has a bright future ahead Goodbye #EU Hello World#Brexit #GlobalBritain #BestForBritain #No2EU #GE2017 #Marr  
Your Sunday morning dose of brutal realism: how the hell will Britain feed itself post-brexit? By me.  
May is happy to champion any random, populist - but irrelevant - cause to distract from the lunacy of a hard Brexit

How Brexit casts doubt over the future of co-productions  
Tell your friends, family and the person on the bus. Hard WTO Brexit wipes out £100bn a year, 1m jobs and 1/3 the NHS budget in tax.  
#Brexit minister Davis warns Britain will quit talks if #EU demands €100bn. “Even £1bn is a lot of money” Good luck. 
Remainers are being urged to give up and back May. They should instead stand and fight. Brexit, however bad for UK, is not inevitable. 
May slipping in polls because she's a dislikable PR disaster who won't debate with Corbyn on TV but expects  to negotiate Brexit. 
One can only conclude that knowing the monumental F*** up #brexit will be the Torys are desperate for Labour to win.  
From tax to Brexit, the Tories will do anything to stay in power  
The biggest threat is Brexit - however it's achieved.  
"The biggest threat to every generation in this country is getting Brexit wrong." - Tory spokesperson.And yet they still risk going ahead.

May: Wants to leave the EU, still receive all the benefits of membership and wants them to give us money! #Brexit delusions  
Davis says, in today's Sunday Times, that UK will 'walk out' of Brexit talks. Public should be told NOW the costing of such reckless idiocy  
Don't let Labour waste your efforts. They will remain in the EU (Plain & Simple).#GeneralElection2017 #Brexit #Brexiteers #LeaveEU #leave

The biggest lie of all is *no deal is better than a bad deal* - a claim the #Brexit SelectCom says is unsubstantiated, but which she repeats  
"Theresa May: Brussels must pay its own Brexit bill of billions of pounds." #BREXIT  
Let's hope that the UK erupts with massive protests over this backward conservative stance. Truly disgraceful & ignorant. A cost of Brexit.  
Corbyn was 200:1 to win Labour leader election. To Westminster Elite, you got Brexit wrong, you've got #GE2017 wrong.#JC4PM #Solidarity 
Think I'm right in saying we'd be sending Keir Starmer to negotiate Brexit and Tories would be sending....BoJo?! 
#Brexit negotiation choices.  
Brexit really can be stopped, that's why Brexiteers are so worried and so aggressive in their reactions.Maintain dignity and commitment.  
Yes, point about @TheNewEuropean is not just Brexit news/views but much rounder culture coverage which sadly daily papers have given up on  
Remember how people agreed after GE2015 & the EU referendum that voting polls turned out to be a poor guide to the ups & downs of campaigns? 
Thread: I'm not going to agree with anybody defending Labour on Brexit, but this puts case against #TheresaMay's handling of it very well.  
Brexit at any cost was fineAs long as it was costing other people....  
Sunday Times: Irony not dead....David Davis accuses other EU member states of posturing, incoherence & failing to tell the truth. #brexit  
Theresa May asks, would we want Corbyn to negotiate Brexit?  Actually, it would be Keir Starmer QC and Barrister. Theresa will send Boris.

Wobble weekend normally comes 2 weekends before polling day (see Scotland/Brexit). May has an extra week to win the waverers back 
David Davis says he's prepared to walk away from Brexit talks if EU won't compromise on money. Exclusive interview in Sunday Times 
If May fails to increase majority substantially will she quit? Pointless election when she should have been prepping Brexit 
There's nothing inevitable about #Brexit. Unite, get involved and most importantly vote and stop it before it destroys the values we cherish 
We literally packed up our Family of 7 after brexit and years of shite from the Tories and left for a new life in Open & Inclusive Scotland 
.Brexit eh?"Increases blamed on Brexit as £'s fall puts up cost of ingredients such as cocoa beans & sugar". 
The Scottish Government already has “public consent” for another independence referendum. Can we have #ScotRef if we want? Yes, we can. 
The Brexit negotiations will start right after the election - don't risk Jeremy Corbyn in charge of Brexit.

Theresa May asks, would we want Corbyn to negotiate Brexit?  Actually, it would be Keir Starmer QC and Barrister. Theresa will send Boris.  
nothing personal but I hope Macron destroys the UK in Brexit negotiations  
Practically every group that wanted #Brexit is now asking for money or legislative changes to offset the costs of their own stupidity.

This is as good as people are saying & suggests that Brexit, when it comes, is going to be hard  
Brexit is ransomware. The Tories created it. Now they say, "Re-elect us, or your country is fucked." This is exactly how it is. 
All those Lexiters who dreamed of a post-#Brexit socialist paradise? This is what we get: Theresa May. Thanks. 
Brexit. Corbyn. Even Trump I understood. But withdrawal of benefits from wealthy people, making a Marxist angry? Politics truly has gone mad

Tonight has made it clearer than ever: Theresa May is not strong and stable, she's a bottler. And she'll bottle it at Brexit negotiations. 
@nick_clegg @campbellclaret @nickreeves9876 @brexit_sham Love it 
Brexit Explained #LeadersDebate #ITVDebate 
#ITVDebate summary:Farron: BREXIT!Nuttall: IMMIGRATION!Lucas, Sturgeon & Wood: When can we put the boys to bed & get busy adulting? 
Tories overturn their law on 5 year Parliaments, then go for Brexit, junk their 2015 manifesto and claim to be strong and stable!! Really? 
Tim Farron & Lib Dems will say anything to get elected. Their coalition of #chaos would put the UK’s Brexit deal at risk. #itvleadersdebate 
Only LibDems will give you the final say on the Brexit deal. Join our fight:  @timfarron #IAgreeWithTim #ITVDebate 
May's UKIP-style Brexit means no more Erasmus for the 15,000 UK students a year who study abroad. #ITVDebate #IAgreeWithTim 
The agreement will be sent to grassroots @PC_Alberta members for them to decide whether to ratify it in a referendum to take place in July.  
By keeping our economy strong we can increase funding for public services. Getting Brexit right is key & only Theresa May can deliver. 
A).  We don't need Brexit.B).  Neither can you deliver the Brexit you falsely promised.  There is no better deal than being in the EU. 
#ITVdebateLucas, Sturgeon & Wood: Don't vote for cruel @ConservativesFarron: Brexit, Brexit, Brexit (etc)Nuttall: Bloody foreigners!  
All leaders at #itvdebate, barring Nuttal, see leaving single market as disastrous. So does most of the #UK. Why not @TheresaMayPM? #brexit 
Theresa May is missing from tonight's debate like she was missing in the referendum. She won't debate Brexit because she doesn't want Brexit 
#IAgreeWithTim#itvleadersdebate Where is the happy Couple??? Scared stiff of being pinned down on facts!How to pay for Brexit??  
When you've been fighting your political life for Brexit, what's next? Nigel Farage reveals all.  
Problem is #ITVDebate is 4/1 against Brexit/UKIP when clearly that is not reflective of wider public views. 
71% of 18-24 year olds voted Remain. May's extreme Brexit means she is turning her back on our young people. #ITVDebate #IAgreeWithTim 
Another good read from @IanDunt on Brexit & #Torymanifesto. Or in short: Does May really know what's she doing? 
Brexit is going really well! Looks like it... #ITVDebate #IAgreeWithTim 
Like @CarolineLucas? In #BristolWest you can vote @Molly4Bristol & return a 2nd Green MP! #Brexit #ITVDebate 
Conveniently forgets that Scotland had a general election to run 6 weeks before Brexit vote, and still got 62% Remain vote.  
Not only did Labour give the Tories a blank cheque for a hard #Brexit - they gave them a lift to the bank to cash it in #ITVDebate 
By 2022 the poorest families will be £1,000 worse off under a Hard Brexit government lead by Theresa May #IAgreeWithTim #ITVDebate 
#Brexit means #NHS investing more in training #English #nurses. What a great thing! #ITVdebate  #BBC #SKY #UK #EU #RT 
May's Extreme Brexit means households will be £1,250 worse off by 2020/21 - only Lib Dems provide an alternative #ITVDebate #IAgreeWithTim 
Getting the Brexit deal right is crucial for our economic security - the choice is Theresa May or Corbyn negotiating for Britain #ITVDebate 
How f**king dare you! Your pathetic referendum to mend your broken party has broken our nation, and now you're blaming others? Sickening. 
One of two people will be negotiating Brexit - Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn. Only Theresa May can get the best deal for Britain #itvdebate 
.@NicolaSturgeon accuses @theresa_may of not having the "guts" to come to #ITVDebate and explain why she's pushing for a hard #Brexit  
@NicolaSturgeon: "If you don't want Theresa May to have a free hand for a damaging Brexit vote for a strong opposition" #ITVDebate #VoteSNP 
.@timfarron "You should sign off the final #Brexit deal" Agree?  #IAgreeWithTim #ITVDebate 
"Someone will sign off that final Brexit deal. It will either by the politicians or it will be the people. I trust the people" #TeamFarron 
Weird debate among 5 people who have no influence on the Brexit negotiations saying how they should be conducted #itvdebate 
FM: "If you don't want Theresa May to have a free hand for a damaging Brexit, you've got to vote for a strong opposition." #ITVDebate #GE17 
Tories & Labour turning their backs on young people with Brexit. We will give 16 and 17 year olds the vote, incl. on Brexit deal #ITVDebate 
"Not only did Labour give the Tories a blank cheque for hard Brexit, they basically gave them a lift to the bank to cash it in" #ITVDebate 
We were promised an extra £350m a week for the NHS. Brexit is already costing us £290m each week #ITVDebate #IAgreeWithTim 
Read the full agreement here. As always, our members will have the final say in a referendum.  #ableg #pcaa 
You brought us the chaos of brexit and 2 general elections in 2 years. You are the chaos. Where is Theresa May? 
Very little appetite for a @timfarron's second referendum. 9/10 of our panel don't want another one. #ITVDebate 
You mean they voted to accept the result of a democratic referendum? Whatever next!  
Tim Farron isn’t fooling anybody. Every vote for the Lib Dems simply increases the likelihood of a reckless Tory Brexit #ITVDebate 
So 4 in #ITVDebate say @theresa_may Brexit plans too extreme, apart from @paulnuttallukip who says not extreme enough #ITVDebate 
Agree with Tim? Think you should have the final say on the Brexit deal? Add your name  #IAgreeWithTim #ITVDebate 
I trust the people. You should have the final say on the Brexit deal. @timfarron #IAgreeWithTim #ITVDebate 
As @CarolineLucas says-Labour's failed to turn up to the #leadersdebate, & has failed to be an effective opposition during the Brexit debate 
No such thing as hard and soft Brexit. Yawn. There is no half way house. People voted to leave. #ITVDebate 
So apart from Nuttall, this is just the 'We're Still Whinging About Brexit Show'. Move on, sooooo dull. None of you can win  #LeadersDebate 
If you're missing this, replicate the experience by getting your friends to scream "Brexit", "Scotland", and "Wales" directly into your ear. 
The SNP hardly campaigned against Brexit - they spent £90k, less than they did on just one Parliamentary by-election #ITVdebate 
First Minister: i campaigned passionately for Remain last year**SNP spent 90k on referendum campaign

We're all going to get poorer under a Tory Brexit government, but at least older people will now pay their share  
The #Brexit election campaign that doesn't really talk about Brexit. My latest blogpost:  
And May's making sure the young, the elderly & those most in need, will pay for BrexitCynical & brutal. The true face of BLUKIP is revealed  
Ireland's next prime minister might be the openly gay son of an Indian immigrant  
So sad to hear this. Unfortunately since #Brexit so many people feel this way. Racist #Farage and his loons have caused such divisiveness

It's scary so many ppl are willing to sacrifice the NHS, social care, education, old & disabled ppl for the hard Brexit myth #torymanifesto 
Britain sees record number of foreign visitors after Brexit.  
Just a reminder that the result of the referendum was only going to be respected up until the next available election if it was Remain.  
Interesting fact on #C4News, Tories plan to build 250k new houses a year, yet 17% of builders not from UK. Who will build them post-Brexit? 
These Remainers who fold because they’d sooner protect their own arses than actually stand up for beliefs. Pff. There’s NO SUCCESSFUL BREXIT

EU should pay UK! Brussels needs REALITY CHECK over ridiculous Brexit bill - Swedish MEP  
What do you mean "until"?  The democratically elected Scottish Parliament has only just voted to hold a referendum. 
Thanks Andy, likewise. From the light into the dark side with #Brexit or fight to #Remain? It's a no-brainer now - I want my country back. 
So you can take your Brexit and shove it up your arse. I will NEVER support it. I'd rather leave this miserable little England behind. 
I haven't seen a single persuasive argument to Leave - still. And Brexit has shown itself to be distasteful in so many ways. 
Tory manifesto aim was to set out  May's vision for UK post #BrexitThere is a DISCONNECT with the speech she made on the steps of No 10 
Remainer #May. A weathervane politician, lacking judgement. Already backsliding on #Brexit. Not to be trusted. Vote #UKIP

Big question on Brexit section of manifesto: is it tactical, cynical or merely ignorant?  
I do too. But #Brexit was never about 'taking back control' #EU was the only protection we had against our government.

Conservative manifesto puts TM's #Brexit stance into writing: 'No deal is better than a bad deal' [Fantastic news!]  
While the Lib Dems main Manifesto policy is to have a second referendum, it's worth remembering what Sarah Olney wrote on her blog:  
Conservative manifesto promises £8bn more for NHS over 5 years. That's only £30 million a week. Where's the other £320m Brexit bus promised? 
I am really pleased to see the @LibDems call for a Nature Act - committing UK gov'ts to protect nature after Brexit  
Last week @AaronBastani interviewed @CarolineLucas on Theresa May, Brexit and the General Election.  
You can't really read either & get a clear picture of their Brexit strategy. Tory one quite contradictory, Labour one riddled with omissions 
France and Germany prepare creation of an EU army after Brexit  
Tory hard Brexit and manifesto reminds us of Franco instigating civil war in 1936. No one in their right mind would vote for these fascists.

Hard Brexit, a Dementia Tax & fox hunting are how the #torymanifesto plans to make Britain a green and pleasant land for hedgefund managers 
The manifesto was a once-in-a-Brexit-lifetime opportunity for May to muzzle the Lords. She didn't take it  
So Theresa May thinks Jeremy Corbyn is too weak to negotiate Brexit?    This from the woman too scared to take part in a tv debate....

Who'd have guessed that Hard Brexit would have consequences.   
The UK's main problems are #Brexit & the corrosion of the political system revealed by the Brexit fiasco. 
It's to give EU citizens an unfair advantage post Brexit.People care less about Xenephobia unless it effects other white Europeans.  
Britain faces dire consequences if it fails to secure good Brexit deal: May  
Missed out the next paragraph, which says 'With the help of Brexit we can ensure most of these things will come to an end'.  
We're all going to get poorer under a Tory Brexit government  
I remember one quote about Brexit that rang true "Brexit is the people who can't read burning down the library". 
Harold Wilson got a landslide of 100 in 1966. Didn't last 12 months. We have to keep telling the truth about Brexit because it harms Britain

The enormous lacuna on Brexit in #torymanifesto is its complete silence about transition. Role of ECJ? Customs Union? Contributions? Nada. 
The Greater London Authority was confirmed by referendum. As a resident, I don't care for its makeup being changed without London's say-so.

6/ Spot the inconsistency. May promises "smooth and orderly Brexit" while threatening to crash out with no deal.

Brexit is not costed at all by the Conservatives at all. No fan of McDonnell. But even his costings are more reliable than theirs  
Because things will get worse with Brexit. And May wants a blank cheque to cut living standards.

Theresa May's speech:"Conservative" = one mention"Me" = Seven"Brexit" = 11  
Manifesto does state we'll leave Single Market & Customs Union. That's so-called 'soft Brexit' out of the window then. Good. No such thing. 
With a resolute determination to get on with the job of delivering Brexit. Optimism that I can get a deal that works for all. 
But most importantly, the Government I lead will provide strong and stable leadership to see us through Brexit and beyond. 
May's 5 challenges: 1. Economy 2. Brexit 3. Social divisions 4. Ageing society 5. Fast-changing tech  #GE2017 
This month's New Humanist has a piece by me and @GKBhambra about the echoes of empire in British culture and politics (cough Brexit cough)  
May says challenge number one is need for a strong economy, but has chosen an extreme Brexit that will cost jobs and push up prices 
If we get Brexit right, we can use this moment of change to build a stronger, fairer, more prosperous Britain here at home.  
But  Mercer couldn't have had any role in referendum. And none of this was co-ordinated in any way. Because, that would make Brexit illegal 
RT if you agree - #WarOnThePoor is being 'buried' by #Brexit - I commit to posting /RT ing anti #austerity news once a day. Do you? 
"A country that asks not where you've come from but where you are going to," says May, after a referendum that was won by promising opposite

So all the talk of Brexit being fairer for non-EU migrants was crap then?  
The ICO has started to investigate Brexit and how people were manipulated and data abused. My investigation over at @Byline_Media helped.

The Labour manifesto is schizophrenic. It praises everything about the EU in the Brexit section, only to hen reject it all in "immigration". 
If you only read the Brexit section of Labour's manifesto, it all sound great. That's why they hid the hard Brexit bombshell in immigration. 
By making immigration control a cornerstone of its manifesto, the Tory party has made hard Brexit inevitable  
We had the person who understood almost every complicated policy issue v an idiot who didn't know of Brexit or the strategic nuclear arsenal 
Errr NO!! Tim Farron - Labour has NOT "pushed through HARD BREXIT" at all! Don't tell porkies - Read #LabourManifesto

Theresa May refuses to accept fall in the pound is due to Brexit. She's sounding more and more like Nigel Farage every day  
In terms of economics, the #Brexit referendum was like asking the bloke down the pub for his input on the design of the next NASA rocket 
Theresa May suggesting that the collapse in Sterling wasn't because of Brexit. She really can't believe this.

May now pretending that sterling fall isn't down to Brexit. That's not BoE view.

Brexit Sec @DavidDavisMP says 'hard' and 'soft' #Brexit are 'propaganda terms' and both sides clear a Leave vote means leaving single market  
Upsum: election allows parties to set out policy on Brexit. SNP policy on Brexit is independence. So it's legitimate to demand indy details. 
Farage is not a patriot, he is the instrument of a powerful US clique involving Trump, Bannon & Mercer. #GE2017 #Brexit #Remain #GE17

Don't let the money-men buy your future away from you. Vote tactically for anti-#Brexit candidates. In this election tactics are essential. 
#PestonOnSunday DavidDavis lying when he says everyone agreed #brexit means leaving single market. Leave campaigners promised the opposite:  
/And yet Sturgeon has demanded a new indyref to give Scots a say on Brexit deal. There's the key SNP weakness in this campaign, right there. 
Usual bluff & bluster from @DavidDavisMP on  re #Brexit. I'm hearing his coat's on a shoogly peg & @theresa_may will sack him soon 
David Davis is a very credible Brexit advocate in which I place some confidence  
No second independence referendum will ever be as "divisive" as the sectarian hatred you're shamefully trying to stir up.

Hard to know what's worse - the politics of Brexit or the politics of Eurovision.

P.S. Fuck Brexit. 
We did well, I didn't think we'd get any points tonight #brexit #Eurovision

May I be the first to say that Brexit has brought us more votes in Eurovision than we have had since 2009. I thank you. 
can you believe that the uk voted for brexit yet we just got 111 points in #eurovision 
According to new @LordAshcroft poll, 71% of people now want us to #Brexit. #Remain vote shrinking badly 
I predicted Sweden, Bulgaria, Australia would do well. I'm the voice of Europe. I should be handling Brexit negotiations #eurovision 
Ireland have taken the whole Brexit thing *VERY* badly. It's nil points for Lucie Jones...  … #Eurovision 
5 points for us from Poland. So no hard feelings. #Brexit #Eurovision 
WHY HAS BREXIT MADE US BETTER AT EUROVISION. EUROPE IS MASOCHISTIC AF 
Messag to Theresa May: Immediate post Brexit 50% tariffs on all Irish imports. That'll teach them not to give us a point. 
UK to Ireland and looking at 2 years worth of Brexit negotiations. #Eurovision 
I don't think I realised how much better Eurovision would make me feel about Brexit. 
y'all voted for brexit so  
My 2 cents: Lib Dems made major strategic blunder in #ge2017. Gambled on "Brexit realignment" that was clearly only going to be on the right  
Ireland #eurovision jury sends the UK 0 points, and I leave it up to you to decide whether it was the song or the Brexit that caused that. 
Dear UK, Remember when you voted for Brexit? Well, it's payback time.Regards,Ireland#Eurovision 
12 points to Belgium and Zero to U.K. ....  Ireland throwing serious shade over #Brexit 
No, Ireland, tell us what you really think of Brexit. 
Hard border it is then. #Ireland #Brexit 
Good to see that, despite #Brexit, the Commonwealth still alive and well. Good performance tho… #Australia #UK #LucieJones #Eurovision2017 
Australia has just secured a trade deal post Brexit #Eurovision 
Ahh, don't worry. We (the Uk) have got 46 points but, post Brexit, they're now only worth 38 points. 
The fact that the UK doing OK in the year of Brexit shows why the BBC needs to start taking #eurovision selection seriously again. 
MEPs will block any Brexit deal threatening EU citizens' rights  
As long as the UK finishes on the left side of the scoreboard in #Eurovision then we can still reverse Brexit! Believe the hype  
Desperate measures. After bullshitting the public last year with #Brexit, he's now trying to maintain the delusion.

& when we eventually go back with a Sheepish look on our faces we won't have the opt outs we enjoy now ~ this whole Brexit is utter folly. 
So thats former PM saying a large Tory majority will help Mrs May stand up to those in her own party as well as Brussels on "extreme Brexit"

A third of people considering tactical voting at General Election to block Tories' hard Brexit, poll reveals  
Age of voters had a totally different role in French vote vs Brexit/Trump - older voters plumped for Brexit/Trump but surged for Macron  
The gvmt's Brexit stance on the ECJ is as dishonest as its stance on immigration, so solutions based on that mendacity will fail.  
So the UK is even more divided, right? 51.9 vs 48.1.. turnout 72%... so, out of 72% not even 51% pro Brexit. Oh & misled by Brexiteers  
The silence or myopia of certain UK newspapers on Macron's historic victory, those which led us to Brexit, lead our retreat into insularism. 
Lovely quote in Hull from a voter talking to @thetimes: "I think I voted Labour at the referendum thing but I'm not sure". #GE2017

So, a fraudulently elected Tory government implements the outcome of a fraudulently manipulated referendum. That's democracy?

As hard as they might try, the Tories won't avert the Scots attention from their appalling new right wing agenda and chaotic Brexit plans. 
Yet more evidence of the critical role of education. After Brexit... After Trump... & now after Macron...(HT to the FT analysts)  
e.g. You can ask Google if the Holocaust happened and be presented with results that say no. Or ask if Brexit is a good idea and be told yes  
My thread from yesterday on how the civil service is not to blame if Brexit goes badly.The fault lies with ministers.  
As with Brexit, Trump and Holland, education was strongest predictor for a populist vote.

Its funny that until a couple of years ago the EU was a non-issue in the public. Now everyone has to 'invent' problems to defend Brexit... 
Theresa May is as qualified to represent Britain in Brexit negotiations as Eric Pickles is to represent Britain in slimmer of the year. 
The EU has a short memory. If it wasn't for British bravery & money [shed loads of both] the EU would not exist #brexit #GeneralElection2017

UKIP job is done Sir. Brexit was their ultimate success. Done and dusted.  
Brexit was not a democratic vote. We need to face up to that. Our democracy was interfered with by Russia with right wing as allies. 
So let's face facts. Le Pen was part of a Russian conspiracy to collapse western democracy. Trump is part of the same. Brexit was round one.

Not if we vote tactically. Remember that most Labour MPs are not Corbinistas. Vote anti-Tory & anti-#Brexit.  
The victory of Trump and Brexit helped crack the culture, and thats the biggest way they've change things. Politically they disappoint 
All throughout Brexit vote we heard about European-ness, but the problem is the technocratic vision for what Europeness is isnt compelling 
They aren't lining up behind Jeremy Corbyn to stop Theresa Mays hard brexit, and didn't try to stop netanyahus election either 
This @guardian article on Brexit and Trump ties to Cambridge Analytica and Thiel and Bannon is REQUIRED READING!

CA insider tells me: Bannon thought Brexit was 'key' to changing world order. Had a 'domino theory' of change. Where UK led, US would follow 
This is not meant as a referendum to bring Hillary back even though my heart will be forever broken. It is sadness about who we have become.

British Brexit supporters insult Macron after presidential win  
This tweet -- on the 72nd anniversary of VE Day -- tells you everything you need to know about the infantile recklessness of Brexit.  
So look, I'm no artist. But this how the illegal co-ordination of 5 Leave campaigns links Brexit to Trump. No conspiracy here. Just facts.  
Reality. Brexit has Strengthened Europe and weakened Britain. It's not too late to change our minds. #LibDems 
On planet Brexit 65.5 to 34.5 is a narrow win, whereas 51.9 to 48.1 is a decisive mandate and the 48.1% are saboteurs to be crushed. 
The monumental irony of Farage talking about ppl voting for giant deceit ... #brexit  
Britain is like that idiot who got off the bus expecting everyone to follow but now has to walk in the pissing rain #brexit 
Hey @TheresaMay_MP your #brexit plan is on to plums. Here speaks the newly elected President of France:  
Far-right wing of Brexit campaign apoplectic the fascist lost. You can often tell you're doing the right thing by looking at your opponents.  
Vive #Macron! A great, optimistic victory  The right wing populism of Le Pen, Trump & Brexit suffers a gallic blow 
An irony: the law can't tackle its flaws because the Referendum is advisory; and politicians won't because they treat it as mandatory. 
#fightback #Bresistance yep. Time to kill brexit. X  
If only UK were as fortunate in having a positive uplifting liberal future, instead of right wing Brexit nightmare.  
Will this French election also mark the end of the UK's post-referendum domino fantasy? ('EU is about to fall apart anyway so don't worry') 
..eurozone will be EU's top priority, Macron sympathetic to idea Berlin been too harsh, change possible. Brexit deal will have to fit around 
Banksy unveils Brexit-inspired mural showing dismantling of EU flag  
Congrats to Macron. The wave of populism, embodied by Brexit and Trump, has been stopped, first in Holland, now in France. Next Germany. 
what's up with Yankees thinking everything that happens in Europe is a referendum on American twitter drama?  
Jeremy, the elites aren't just hijacking Brexit - they *created* it. Which is why it has to be STOPPED!  
This notion that France should have elected a neofascist to make Brexit easier for the UK has been strangely, selfishly persistent  
..far from it actually. With Merkel or just perhaps Schulz, and Renzi making comeback in Italy, on top of Dutch results, no Brexit contagion 
Compare: 1) after French 1st vote > Macron wins but story twisted towards Le Pen poll surge/linked to Brexit 2) after Macron wins > nothing  
Key thing re Brexit from Macron presidency: the EU is & will still be here. Was never Gov position, but fair few Brexiteers believed it gone 
Have to believe there are enough fair people who see the disaster ahead aka 'Brexit' and then combine as a progressive EU alliance on 8 Jun.  
But this is why we have to give the people a final say on any #brexit deal. And why @LibDems justify support on 8 June.

The French victory will embarrass #Corbyn. By accepting #Brexit he is in conflict with the liberal progressive forces in the rest of Europe. 
Disappointment of Farage and Leave EU at defeat of Le Pen puts Brexit in proper context. Hope all Brexiters pleased at the company they keep 
Fwiw, found Macron to be among the more pragmatic during the EU renegotiation. Brexit is different but his hawkishness may be over-stated  
Also higher than *huge* turnout for 2016 Brexit referendum. Still, when you've got a narrative...  
Be in no doubt: Macron's election is a huge boost to the EU, its values and its momentum.Caveat Brexit. 
Overwhelmingly ‘liberal’-Left, pro-EU, anti-Brexit UK MSM’s hacks near-salivating at prospect of Merkel-Macron axis screwing UK over Brexit

This is essential reading. Wonderful work by Carole Cadwalladr exposing the depth of the #Brexit cheat.  
Big lesson from the #Frenchelections2017: French voters didn't want #Frexit. You can't copy & paste #Brexit to the rest of Europe. You can't 
The only good thing to come from Brexit and Trump came today, with France learning from them to elect Macron as their new president. 
Will you call him like you eagerly called Erdogan congratulating him for rigging a referendum dismantling democracy?  
Trump called Erdogan to congratulate him for win on referendum ratcheting up authoritarianism vs press secretary statement on Macron win  
People who voted Brexit 'cause they were told that all the other European countries were going to leave...  
Important point. I'd rather say the strategic disaster is Brexit itself, but Macron victory will put it under cruder light more quickly.  
Can't help thinking if we'd had a 2 round referendum folks would have come to their senses. Nonetheless, félicitations á la gens Francais  
With France's LePen and the UK party that wanted Brexit both getting crushed u get sense pendulum is swinging back. Wish we had election now 
Hurray for Macron. Now let's unite in Britain to defeat the UKIP-Tory alliance that formed this week. Vote tactically to stop hard Brexit 
Poor Trumpers: the bigot of France Marine LePen was crushed today. Also in UK the party that wanted Brexit got crushed in local elections 
It's not too late to stop the disastrous Brexit. Tactical voting against the Tories next month is the way forward 
Same with Brexit.  
Peter Foster: Emmanuel Macron will give little comfort to Theresa May in Brexit negotiations #premium

Brexit, Trump, Macron.... three extraordinary political bombshells in less than a year. Amazing. 
Merkel annoyed with Juncker over his behavior in Brexit negotiations, Spiegel reports   
Not only is Macron victory a repudiation of right, Putin, Trump, thanks in part to Brexit, it underscores greater importance of France. 
Viva la France!  #Europeans in defense of Europe. #Austria, #Olanda now #France block the way to #populists and #Nationalists. Never #Brexit  
Loud & clear: Labour will not stop Brexit, but nor will we give May a blank cheque to look after her cronies rather than the whole of the UK  
Calling on all who admit regretting voting Leave. Shout out loud. Remainers will back you all the way. 
You achieved your ambition of brexit #AwfullyBritishReasonsToRetire (if only) 
The regressive forces that created #Trump and #Brexit have been defeated today in France! 
We will never give up.Never.We despise #EU for all it does, and we will bury it. And we will bring the traitors to Nuremberg 2.0#BREXIT  
Far-right populism rejected in France, Austria, Netherlands elections. Trump & Brexit increasingly looking like aberrations, not new normal. 
Whilst Macron wouldn't have been my first choice, I'll certainly take him over Le Pen. Well done France, you avoided your Brexit / Trump. 
The official Leave EU account was rooting for a bona fide fascist. Not a surprise really but let it sink in. Brexit = facism  
After the #Brexit, new Street-Art by #Banksy found in Dover #England#StreetArt #art #Graffiti

Glad us french don't have your mindset. You lost get over it, enjoy brexit. 
.@EmmanuelMacron victory is a triumph for all of the EU.France shows us populism and the far right can be stopped.Now we must stop #brexit 
At time of referendum, Cambridge Analytica & AggregateIQ SHARED database. They worked together EVERY DAY. Again: co-ordination is ILLEGAL 
wha?? WHAT!!!! LE PEN IS LOST BY TWO THIRDS OF THE VOTE.. get it up ye brexit fakers.. the rise of the right MY ARSE!!!!!!!! YIPPPPPEEEE 
Since Brexit/Trump - Record of far-right in Europe:Austria Netherlands France Germany next, where Merkel's CDU/CSU was boosted today.

Right wing populism has been defeated in Holland and France. Now it's up to us in Britain! Defeat #Brexit and this Brexit government! 
Yes, the people behind Brexit really wanted the far-right to win in France  
1. Must say that in recent months I've become increasingly troubled by framing of political narrative post-Trump/Brexit in terms of populism 
So much for predictions that Brexit & Trump would be followed by election of Geert Wilders & Marine le Pen (AfD also in decline in Germany) 
Completely wrong to compare Le Pen to Brexit campaign. Vote Leave campaign in UK was pro-free trade, pro-free market, pro-NATO and pro-US. 
Spare a thought for Brexit, who is taking the news pretty hard  
Macron's win is a defeat for Theresa May. Brexit just got harder for her. The UK is a friendless outpost of right wing isolationism. 
Instead of starting a new trend, Brexit and Trump wins were a wake-up call for voters in the West  
Unlike the U.S. after Brexit, the French saw that mass ignorance probably isn't the way to go 
Striking contrast between self-confident resurgent Brexit Britain, and declining France now headed by a younger version of Francois Hollande 
One reason for Macron win - France looked at UK's impending Brexit disaster and said 'Non merci' 
2/ This was *the* moment for a Le Pen victory: Trump...Brexit...terror attacks...weak Socialist party...scandal-plagued center Right... 
Only about 90 million people in the world voted for Brexit, Trump, or Le Pen, so everything's fine. 
Macron headed for a ~31 point win, which will mean polls underestimated him by ~7 pt. A bigger error than Brexit and much bigger than Trump!  
It's official. Macron with 65% of vote!!! Turning corner on Putin-Brexit-Trump. Le Pen loses resoundingly.  
Farage-Putin-Brexit candidate booted into dustbin of French history by a president who believes in France and Europe. UK never more isolated 
The polls missed. Had Macron up by 24. He won by 30. Brexit-level miss, worse than US 2016. 
So after #Trump and #Brexit, the pendulum swings back... #Macron

Putin helped shape the outcome of the Brexit vote, may have determined the winner in the US election & is trying again with France. Resist. 
No one is saying ALL WHITE PEOPLE but Trump, Brexit and Le Pen is only possible because of millions of selfish and angry white people. 
No idea why @Theresa_May thinks being re-elected will make EU negotiations easier. Won’t change fact that almost 1 in 2 do not want #Brexit

The great British Brexit robbery: how our democracy was hijacked  
Turnout in France's presidential runoff is down sharply so far in a race seen by many as a referendum on populism:  
In 1974 he voted for nationalisation of large corporations, a referendum on EEC membership, workers co-operatives, industrial democracy. 
Moreover, when history of Brexit is written the disproportionate attention given to UKIP by BBC over years will surely figure as a factor  
This says it all: Theresa May is going to wipe £100bn a year from UK GDP with Brexit. Even a Marxist couldn't do that.  
Shock as the internal Tory tensions that led to an EU referendum and Brexit vote have not gone away.  
Why Marine Le Pen would be worse for the EU than Brexit

More accurately, Horgan says he is "offering" pro-rep, has promised a referendum on it.  
So Tory councillors won because they lied.Every leaflet implied they would- "Stop a 2nd referendum" Which they don't have any power to do

Without UKIP, we wouldn't have had a referendum; we wouldn't have won the referendum; and the Tory Party would never have backed Brexit. 
Here's Roger, trying to get us 16m people who voted Remain to back this suicidal #Brexit. If we don't back it, we are traitors in his eyes.

"Slowly but surely, English is losing importance in Europe," Jean-Claude Juncker says  
I'm seeing a lot of ~analysis~ of their collapse but like, UKIP stood for Brexit. Brexit happened. Surely that's the main explanation? 
Corbyn quite literally whipped the PLP to vote with the Tories over Brexit. This is unforgivable. Completely unforgivable.

EU turns up the heat on a divisive issue with Brexit talks looming

Labour's pro-#Brexit stance has not  prevented it losing a significant part of its pro-Brexit voters.#GE2017 #GE17 #Remain 
Sadly UKIP has lost all its council seats, we've given all our support to PM to deliver Brexit, Tories should be aware of the trust we give. 
1.The local and general elections are Part 2 of Brexit revolution. May is the 'change' candidate because she delivers Brexit.

This election is going to answer the question: whatever happened to the 48%? And the answer will be that many shrugged and backed Brexit. 
Charlotte Hogg, the first new registered Libdem member after the referendum has won her seat and is now on herts county council. Respect.  
If you thought that giving Tories your vote yesterday has strengthened their hand in the Brexit negotiations it hasn't, more cuts for you!

Tories are reaping rewards of tough Brexit position in local elections | Analysis   
Brexit created 'war mentality': PM fighting foreigners. Nationalism favours Tories, so more cuts, more zero hours, more bogus self-employed. 
day 2avoid media. Tories gloating while pretending not to. Labour pretending things fine. UKIP pretending hard Brexit May hasn't eaten them 
What will Brexit cost and will Britain pay the bill? Here's a quick guide  
My instant analysis: at the moment Brexit is beating 'save the NHS and schools' as a vote winner. 
Brexit secretary David Davis says a "line was crossed" when stories suggested the UK could face €100bn "exit bill".  
The election is a 2nd referendum. Only if the Conservatives get more than 50% of the total electorate can they claim a mandate for #Brexit. 
In @thetimes @PCollinsTimes right on May except in my trips to EU capitals no one worries abt Con majority. Brexit seen as lose-lose. 
Looks like Labour backed the wrong horse with Brexit.  There was nothing to distinguish them from the Tories.  
Google's UK investment is often cited as an endorsement of Brexit. More likely, it's motivated by expectations of a negotiable tax bill.

VIDEO -  Marine Le Pen on Europe: "I want to organize a referendum to leave the EU in September"  
The huge irony that Brexit will result in a vast transfer of power away from Parliament.  
Finally a Brexit benefit! The sun will still rise in the East and set in the West. Praise be!  
Send Nicola Sturgeon a message: Scotland doesn't want another divisive referendum. #VoteLabour 
I don't want a bad deal.  I don't want no deal. What I do want is no Brexit.  
Le Pen says if elected she'll call for a EU referendum in September 2017 #frenchelection 
Apple can build the wall and pay the UK Brexit bill and bail out Greece and still have money left over. 
The #Brexit negotiations your average remoaner would like #SodThem #GE2017 
#Debat2017 Le Pen holds up #brexit as positive example for France -and talking amazing nonsense about double currency... 
I live in the UK. I'm French. So when @MLP_officiel says the UK has been doing amazing since #Brexit...#2017LeDebat 
We don't want Tory Cuts, or a Hard Border or Brexit. We voted to stay, we want leadership & #Equality #Integrity #Respect. Vote #finucane4mp 
Macron attacks Le Pen on wanting return of franc currency. She says he's copying "project fear" of Remain camp over Brexit #2017LeDebat 
Ah AH Ah! Le Pen just said the #brexit is doing well #2017LeDebat 
Introducing the UK's new Brexit negotiating team....  
OUCH.. #LePen lost in her #euro plan, sinking literally. shared currency, common currency, ECU, franc, referendum, all over the place 
Le Pen proposes renegotiating France's relations with EU and putting to a referendum. The Cameron model - worked well for him! 
President Jean-Claude Juncker Has Committed EU to Brexit Suicide  
Theresa May is already blaming Brussels for the failure of Brexit. It will be the Remainers next  
Carrying out the results of a referendum and calling a general election is as democratic as it gets Do you have a different definition ?  
The similarities between May and Erdogan are getting a bit chilling. Erdogan won his election and his referendum. Turkey lost its freedom. 
Elected national govts, not "eurocrats", decide EU stance on #Brexit. They also, with MEPs, decide EU laws. UK public often misled on this.  
Brexit may cost MPs and peers the power to pass laws, says former judge  
A motorist in an unfamiliar city.Keeps taking a turning to avoid traffic.  Ends up in a cul-de-sac.This is May's Brexit policy. 
Strong words by Lord Judge: Brexit to unleash legislative tsunami, presenting greatest challenge ever to parliament.  
One a Human Rights Lawyer & another a Human Rights Campaigner - @Keir_Starmer & @jeremycorbyn!! #VoteLabour for #Brexit that is #forthemany 
Belgian MP warns EU is DOOMED if Brussels punishes UK over Brexit  
Are the Tories really proud of *this* record?Good grief! No wonder they want to make Brexit the sole topic of election conversation! #GE2017 
French flatmate has friends round to watch #2017LeDebat. But maybe it's a plot to sabotage Brexit? I've emailed @Theresa_May just in case. 
The six Brexit traps that will defeat Theresa May  I don't agree with it all but the conclusion is good 
According to a retired Scottish doctor, the law requires a second referendum on any withdrawal agreement #brexit  
Steve Bell on Theresa May, the general election and Brexit – cartoon  
Most of our food and drink exports could be put at risk because of #brexit, according to a House of Lords report  
Juncker doesn't seem to have a clue why #Brexit is happening! I voted remain but his arrogance is intolerable! 
We didn’t vote on details of #brexit, just in or out.  And already it's clear that Britain’s hand isn't so strong  
The European Union's antics serve as a reminder of why Britain voted to leave  #Brexit 
"Great Britain has had to pay the European Union from the start due to Brexit. If France leaves the EU, we will also pay." #LeGrandDebat 
#Macron faithfully repeating #EU line to #LePen re #EU, saying Brexit will cost UK €90 billion.He's just an #EU stooge.#Debat2017 
Macron cites enormous bill UK will have to pay for Brexit as warning v Frexit. Shows domestic necessity to "punish" UK 
I just want someone to look at me the way Le Pen looks when someone mentions "brexit" #2017LeDébat 
Now Macron brings Brexit into the debate. Britain will have to pay between €60-100bn. 
Have you not got it yet Mrs May @theresa_may? Only you and your deluded ministers think Brexit can be a success. No one else does.  
An alternative view is that Brexit is one 'massive mess' - badly planned and poorly managed. via @Telegraph

Brexit may cost MPs and peers the power to pass laws, says former judge

Well.. #EU #Brexit  
I dare you to watch this video and tell me this election is about Brexit. Go on, try it.  
Only #WeakAndWobblyMay would try to reuse the Brexit project fear line to drum up support while poll lead dwindles. It's of her own making. 
I have seen nothing but anti Brexit anti British and anti May comments today from @SkyNews and @BBCNews disgusting bias 
Theresa May's Brexit team have misunderstood rules of single market, Peter Mandelson says  
JPMorgan will expand offices in locations including Dublin as it relocates staff for Brexit  
whether we're pro or anti Brexit, can't we just be a bit better than this? 
The truth about EU/Brexit both before Referendum and now is simple: we, the people have no idea what's going on. 
For #WeakandWobblyMay hysterical approach to the GE & Brexit negotiations, Corbyn always has a reasonable calm answer. He'd make a great PM 
Brexit as a soap opera divorced from real life consequences.  
#EU2017 @Theresa_May now admits that no #Brexit deal would be disastrous. Please read and share our editorial:  
The EU Troika has just imposed 14th cut in state pensions in Greece, with more austerity and more poverty. Glad I voted Leave #brexit #GE17 
Under George Osborne the Evening Standard seems to have become a propaganda sheet for the European Commission. Best avoided. #Brexit 
Risky Tory Brexit. Stable Labour Brexit. Labour putting jobs, the economy and living standards first. The Tories putting their party first. 
#VoteLabour tomorrow to elect a local champion, not a cheerleader for a divisive second independence referendum.

.@Nigel_Farage says the idea of the UK being held “ransom” with a €100bn Brexit bill is looking “utterly ridiculous”  
'Today before Brexit negotiations I accused the people i'll be negotiating with of interfering in our election. Yes I'm THAT stupid'  
We must fight Hard Brexit at the ballot box, says @stephen_dorrell  
Apparently, @ChukaUmunna had a go at @FT's €100bn #Brexit bill story. Mr Umunna: here's our maths. Might want to read before critiquing.  
Only 5 years ago we were hosting the Olympics. Now the UK, after #Brexit, with May and her Tory clowns, we couldn't host a chimps tea party.  
.@Nigel_Farage: Brussels is strengthening the PM's hand with every single negative Brexit remark  #FarageOnLBC 
I guess you have to laugh really.The same people warning us of economic catastrophe are the same people DESPERATE for #Brexit to fail. 
May appoints new #Brexit negotiating team.  
FM is 100% right. PM is neither strong nor stable. Her comments on Brexit negotiations are embarrassing. Scotland needs indy, badly #ScotRef 
Spain plans to use Brexit as a chance to attack Gibraltar’s low-tax economic model  
If only someone had REPEATEDLY TOLD THEM that this would happen #brexit 
Theresa May's EU comments sabotaging Brexit prospects, warns Nicola Sturgeon…  via @thecourieruk Job in London? 
May's gambling w/ Brexit for internal reasons against citizens' interests. She's wrong person, in wrong role, at wrong time -@giannipittella 
313 days since the Brexit vote. Still yet to hear a single, consistent, coherent reason to vote Leave. They've had ages. 
London, don't say you weren't warned:JPMorgan to Move Hundreds of Staff to Three EU Offices on Brexit @business 
Apparently I am now a remoaner, an extremist, a saboteur and a citizen of nowhere. How did that happen, just because I oppose Brexit? 
The EU wants the UK to pay up to €100bn for Brexit. Here's where that figure comes from:  
It's folly for Labour to blame the difficulties of Brexit negotiations on our side and defend  the EU as blameless. Whose side are we on? 
Totally irresponsible comments and allegations by Theresa May today over #Brexit - playing political games with jobs and our economy. 
That almost sounds like you're saying Brexit voters can be fooled into voting against their own interest, Tim. Imagine. 
May to EU: talking loudly but carrying a small stick—the election, not the Brexit deal, is the prize her mind 
Well, now we know  who helped the EU to work out UK's #Brexit bill....  
Our top story of the day: JPMorgan confirms where it's moving hundreds of London bankers  
Is a #Brexit deal which works for both the UK and EU possible? We ask @IrwinStelzer of @HudsonInstitute: 
Will Brexit be a disaster? YesWhy? Because it was built on lies and stupidity Will Brexiters ever take responsibility? Clearly not  
Will we get a referendum on whether we want to go to war with Europe?#StrongAndStableMyArse 
Et voilà. Answering those LibDem & Green calls for a 2nd referendum on the final terms of the deal or to remain in the EU...  
The people of Ireland voted against Brexit. The Tories won't be allowed to ignore the democratic wishes of the people of Ireland @moneillsf 
Yes, "The best possible deal for Britain", so let us stop the madness of Brexit and remain in the EU. Unite & vote tactically against Brexit  
#TheresaMay's pathetic anti-#EU rant is the UK's weakness under her leadership writ large. That's #Brexit for you, folks. #GE2017 
Reality seems to be dawning on Theresa May & her chaotic Brexit ministers. Their rhetoric becomes ever more shrill.  #VoteSNP #GE17 
Dear Mrs May. You called this election. You can't blame Brussels for everything. Your bullying tactics will not work. #GE2017 #brexit 
The idea that a politician who completely reverses her principles because of a referendum result is strong & stable is ludicrous.#GE2017 
Also, if the "bureaucrats of Brussels" really think there's a way we can vote to stop Brexit, they could at least bloody tell us what it is. 
Exactly right. Short-term politics for May are good. Medium-term implications for Brexit deal of this electioneering are wholly negative  
Lord Judge says Brexit process will cement law-making by unscrutinised legislation into our constitution.  
I BELIEVE JC's dignified measured & thoughtful stylewould deliver a GOOD #Brexit for ALL.UNLIKE the PM's aggression & confrontation 
Fickle, unprincipled and popularity seeking; Theresa May is a politician Margaret Thatcher would have despised.#GE2017 #GE17 #Brexit 
Your Brexit tactic is like trying to rob a bank by pointing the gun at your own head.  
The Tories have been out of control since they bought the last election; they're determined to steamroller anything that stands in their way 
How has the EU influenced our election ? They haven't changed their position since the day after the Referendum 
So you're already blaming Brussels for the failure of Brexit. Interesting. 
Right or wrong, Thatcher stuck to her principles, risked unpopularity & did not blow with the political wind like May.#GE2017 #Brexit 
With some in Brussels determined not to let Brexit talks be a success, our country needs strong and stable leadership to get the right deal.  
The British PM is, effectively, basing the UK's Brexit position on the tweets of @JeremyCliffe. The most powerful man now in journalism.

"We won't threaten Europe on the way into Brexit" - Labour leader @jeremycorbyn reacts toPM's attack on EU  
Check out UK Brexit Secretary D. Davis as he emerges from Number 10 just ahead of PM's speech accusing EU of election interference:  
The #BBC come out strongly in support after the #EU blackmail #Britain with 100 billion Euro demand.They back the European Union!!!#Brexit  
Theresa May is already blaming Brussels for the failure of Brexit. It will be the Remainers next  
Putting Theresa May in charge of #Brexit is like putting Donald Trump in charge of Amnesty International & Greenpeace 
So our "strong and stable" leader publicly loses her rag with senior EU officials before the #Brexit negotiations have even begun. #reckless 
Brexit offers greatest challenge ever faced by our legislative processes, Lord Judge says in @BinghamCentre lecture. 
The six Brexit traps that will defeat Theresa May | Yanis Varoufakis  
This is irresponsible from Theresa May. Naked electioneering, not based in fact and only likely to make #Brexit negotiations trickier  
BREAKING: Juncker's top aide says “Brexit will never become a success. It is a sad and sorry event”  
May wrong to say EU people interfering in GE. In fact they want her to win big, so she has the strength to compromise on Brexit @CER_London 
In a few years whenever Brits and Germans meet up the Germans will whisper to each other "Shh, don't mention the Brexit" 
Might be worth electing Corbyn PM just to see him interact with Trump on that State Visit. The popcorn sales would see us through Brexit 
Thesis: Only a nation that had a huge empire (loss of which it's never really got over) could act like UK now. #brexit 
I agree with this, and for most of my life I've voted Tory.#GE2017 #GE17 #Brexit #Remain 
May has literally just painted a vision of Post Brexit britain that’s worse than 28 Days. 
"May's challenge isn't beating Labour. It’s Brexit. Wouldn’t hurt if she started to take it seriously" @stephenkb 
BBC Tory PR lady: "Really? Can Jeremy Corbyn negotiate #Brexit, really?" @BarryGardiner puts her straight...

Great response as always from @BarryGardiner on Brexit, leadership and GE2017. #VoteLabour 
Honest answers , not based on your own voting choice If referendum was run again today , who would win #brexit #eu #referendum 
To Understand ‘Brexit,’ Look to Britain’s Tabloids  
One minutes it's gossip the next a conspiracy. One minute you are for remain the next as hard a brexit as you might imagine. Stable my arse! 
Theresa May is destroying any chance of a good deal for the UK in the Brexit talks because she thinks it'll help her party. Let that sink in 
The six Brexit traps that will defeat Theresa May  
Remember in 2015 when Tsipras capitulated to the EU after months of costly posturing? Brexit under May will be the same. Just 100x worse. 
.@NicolaSturgeon on Tories using irresponsible rhetoric on Brexit to distract from an appalling record, and the need for strong opposition.  
Smart move by May attacking Brussels: ensures another day of media discussing process/tactics rather than quizzing her on Brexit substance. 
Have a listen to @BarryGardiner talking Brexit, Corbyn and #GE2017. What he says is of great interest  #GE2017 
Good luck with Brexit with May in charge, Brexiteers.Genuinely cannot see how any Remainer could do more to sabotage a successful Brexit. 
UK cannot unilaterally cancel Article 50, but other states are unlikely to refuse a request to cancel Brexit -- Selmayr 
#GE2017 @BarryGardiner is asked if this election is all about Brexit as May says it is. Worthwhile listening to his reply...  
On #Brexit and #beer : trouble brewing? 
Brexit has no benefits at all. It's a stupid thing to do. So let's forget it and save the NHS instead. @MarieAnnUK #StrongAndStable #GE2017

My favourite part of Brexit is all the idiots saying they're now free to rule themselves, as if the Tories give a shit about them

What will the UK govt (& tabloids) do post-Brexit? I mean, what will they do without Brussels to blame for all the country's problems?  
Brexit: a highly self-destructive way for English nationalists to indulge in the fantasy that they are still the center of the world.  
Who will get the best deal on Brexit, T.May who thinks we're negotiating with enemies or J.Corbyn who knows we're negotiating with friends? 
Irony fail.May calls the election on the (fake)premise of needing it for Brexit negotiations.Now she blames the EU for playing games. 
Juncker chief of staff @MartinSelmayr says his boss won't spend more than half an hour a week on Brexit. EU has other things to do 
It's really arrogant & presumptuous for EU staff to think they can tell us whether "Brexit will be a success". Just none of their business!  
May neither stable nor strong switching in 24 hours from "just Brussels gossip" to a swivel-eyed paranoid Brexit conspiracy theory. Nurse! 
EU leaders respond to Theresa May's claims that they're trying to "sabotage the general election and Brexit"  
Brexit is the story of the national interest being utterly subordinated to the interests of the Conservative Party.

The six Brexit traps that will defeat Theresa May | Yanis Varoufakis  
The last time I heard a speech as good as May’s - as in tune with large numbers of sensible voters - was Boris’s Brexit debate one. 
Dear Theresa May, the only place you don't get opposition is in a dictatorship. Is that what Brexit is REALLY about? 
My reaction to PM's crudely jingoistic and deeply damaging outburst getting Brexit negotiations off to a disastrous start  
Those pesky Europeans are interfering with the election according to @theresa_may. You are exploiting Brexit to grab seats you daft ha'peth 
I think we can add the word 'unhinged' to 'clueless' and 'delusional' Tory hard Brexit. 
I see Brexit's turned out nice again *digs Anderson shelter in garden* 
Her election tactics are now clear, the enemy without and within. #May mustn't be allowed to divide us. #Brexit is a modern British tragedy.  
Turner prize 2017: a cosmopolitan rebuff to Brexit provincialism  
Brexit means... LEEROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOY JEEEEEEENKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIINS  
Theresa May just asked for a mandate to conduct Brexit as a diplomatic war. It may work to get votes. The price will be a terrible Brexit. 
After Brexit the UK should put a tax on all immigrants sending money back home,money is drained from the UK economy to prop up other nations 
#TelegraphView: Theresa May must show that she can walk away from a bad #Brexit deal  
Theresa May's talk of 'threats' won't aid smooth #Brexit negotiations; astonishingly dangerous fake over-reaction for purely political gain 
Hey, let's take some times to remember what the continental papers did say about the UK & Brexit.  
It's increasingly looking to some in the UK like the European Commission wants to create a no-Brexit-deal crisis: 
In my 13 years as a British MEP, I have never seen my EU colleagues as united as they are over Brexit  
i love Theresa May's Brexit negotiating strategy of being incompetent, then lashing out at EU negotiators for mentioning her incompetence. 
All other political issues aside, I do not want this woman anywhere near Brexit negotiations. She is incompetent.  
So, let's get this straight.Brussels can't interfere enough to swing a referendum its way. But it can interfere with an election  
May realises negotiating from position of extreme weakness impossible. Instead calls EU bunch of f***ers & plays to Brexit bigots' gallery 
Theresa May. Parroting the likes of Erdogan to garner support from the frothing Brexit nationalists.  
Pound extends losses against dollar after signs of a rocky start to Brexit process  
I have always believed, actually feared, that it would be extremely difficult to avoid a contentious Brexit, considering the stakes.  
Is Theresa May stupid? O course 27 states do not want the UK to prosper from Brexit talks. Why on earth should they? 
11. The political pressure would be absolutely intolerable. She would *have* to return to the county for another referendum or election. 
Boom to bust; Brexit; climate change. Screw the economy, the country and the planet. Thank goodness he at least gave us Nigella.  
.@TimFarron: This is a Brexit election and a chance to change Britain's future  
That 2014 No vote is going to cost Scotland a £10bn share of the Brexit bill. Cheers guys. Don't do it again. 
I can genuinely see a situation in 3-4 years time where Brexit is a disaster, but it's the Remainers who end up getting the blame. 
As Brexit leaves Europe's future in the balance, could a single passport bring Africa closer together?  #af17 
I always suspected May was a little unhinged. She's now confirmed that today. Now more worried than ever about how Brexit will play out 
If this is how May behaves when #brexit negotiations haven't even started, imagine how she'll be when they have? #WeakandWobblyMay #GE2017 
The problem is Remainers still see Brexit as a political phenomenon and Leavers, correctly, recognise it is a cultural phenomenon. 
This is the least Brexit thing you'll see today. Joyous.  
When it finally dawned that Brexit was not achievable they turned on the EU. They blamed remainers & foreigners. It will be YOU that suffers 
A speech which will make negotiations with EU even harder.  Increases instability so either deliberately disruptive or very stupid #Brexit  
WATCH | Michel Barnier's speech was the “opening shot of Project Fear made in Brussels”, says Gisela Stuart MP #Brexit  
MAY: "If Brexit negotiations fail it's the fault of the EU. If I lose the election it's the fault of the EU. Not me, I'm strong and stable." 
We ground the poor down til they were happy to throw the steering wheel out the window with Brexit. Avoiding risk is no longer a good offer.  
There is not one single issue which is impossible to solve during Brexit. Not one. She is making it impossible. 
#UPDATE British PM accuses Brussels of deliberately making "threats" over Brexit talks to affect outcome of next month's general election  
Beneath the conspiracy theories, an interesting and new tone in May's address: that botched Brexit carries economic risk to families.  
Remember: May chose date for Brexit talks & General Election. She's now angry that these 2 events are taking place simultaneously. Well, duh 
This is complete nonsense. May triggered Art.50. EU now doing what she asked it to do: to prepare for Brexit. Jeez!  
THERESA MAY: “Everyone is trying to reverse Brexit except me. There’s saboteurs and traitors on every corner. Trust no-one but me.” 
Arthur will stand up to Tories on Brexit  
How can this help Brexit negotiations? Answer: it can’t. Done only to help her election chances.Selfish, cynical, irresponsible, disgraceful  
This is a gross distortion of what @MichelBarnier said today. @theresa_may is coming up against the hard reality of #Brexit & can't cope  
May's using Brexit like Falklands. Portraying a (diplomatic) war with the EU as a means of galvanising domestic political support 
Dear Theresa May, If you don't want Brexit negotiations to affect our election then DON'T HOLD ONE IN THE MIDDLE OF BREXIT NEGOTIATIONS  
Who chose a referendum? Lied their way to victory? Misled about a deal? Set our priorities? Mishandled negotiations?  
It was bad enough that she started an election with nonsense paranoia about parliamentarians trying to sabotage Brexit. 
Attacking those we want to have a trade deal with&whom we need to negotiate with on Brexit is not very  helpful or sensible. #WeakAndWobbly 
Theresa May just admitted her hard Brexit could end in disaster for our security and economy, but is refusing to give people the final say 
Chutzpah - call an election, LOUDLY proclaim it about Brexit, then accuse the EU of interfering in the election if they mention Brexit.  
This is the UK for goodness sake - not some rogue state !#Brexit & Tory policies have divided us - take responsibilty !  
May re 'misleading' influencing of campaign - what about the monstrous lies of the Leave referendum campaign? Will she rerun it therefore? 
BREXIT: Angry old white man unsuccessfully challenges stereotype that Leave voters are angry old white men.  
BREXIT ELECTION- Brussels interference- EU threats- No deal better than a bad one  
Brexit talks require subtlety & realism - neither of which Theresa May has yet demonstrated. My @guardian article: 
.@theresa_may says there are some in Brussels who do not want Brexit to succeed or Britain to prosper  
Theresa. If you don't want Brexit to interfere with your election, don't call an election about Brexit.  
Feel like May's speech was a pitch for a Brexit that's only slightly less hard than physically pushing the UK away from Europe's shores. 
Theresa May is sabotaging Britain's ability to get a good Brexit deal by destroying relations with our closest economic partners. Madness.  
There are two ways of negotiating: seek common ground or threaten to go to war. Theresa May has chosen 2nd option for Brexit. 
May claims UK negotiating position misrepresented in Europe. "There are some in Brussels who don't want Britain to prosper." #brexit 
PM just cast Brexit as existential high stakes crisis which could go horribly wrong. Perhaps should have pointed that out before referendum? 
That's the "enormous goodwill" Downing St has been telling us they'll be entering the Brexit negotiations with tossed out the window. 
.@theresa_may is framing the election as all about the brexit battle with rest of EU! 
WOW. Theresa May says Brexit leaks "deliberately timed to affect the result of the general election”. 
Hang on, did Theresa May just claim the tough EU talk on Brexit is a deliberate plot to affect the election result? Does she mean that? 
A quick break from door-knocking in #Barnes to speak to @itvlondon about the Lib Dem #GE2017 campaign & our opposition to Tory hard Brexit

Still no benefits of Brexit, let alone when to expect them. 
Brexit did not prevail just because Leavers outfought Remainers. More important were “baked-in views”  
Voting Lib Dem to stop #Brexit is about as dumb as it gets since you don't know if they will drop anti Brexit stance for a sniff of power. 
Has #Brexit transformed from being a plausible political objective into a cult based on fear hate & blind faith? Just asking #Brexitshambles

Whatever the Brexit "bill" ends up being, I'd love to see the calculations/methodology of those saying €60-100bn is too high 
It occurred to me recently that Britain's Brexit approach bears all the hallmarks of England heading into an international football comp. 
FT's Alex Barker, always v much worth a read on all things Brexit puts new Brexit bill request at 100 billion euros.... 
It seems increasingly clear that Kamikaze Juncker wants a "no deal" Brexit. Odd, then, that so many Remainers are taking his side.  
Britain's May promises to be 'bloody difficult woman' in Brexit talks  
100bn euros? Why not go the whole hog and have the Brexit agreement signed at Versailles? (based on an idea by @AlenMattich)

Dear English Press, Please read the German Papers today & do your jobs to report the actual situation on Brexit.Sincerely YoursThe Public 
Here's a summary of why, despite #brexit etc., I see EU membership as by far the best option for Ireland.  
Government spokesman: "We do not recognise this account." (Because no one in Brexit Britain speaks German?) 
I'm hardly a fan of Juncker but the idea that the EU are playing nasty, unfair tricks against a brave and honest UK over Brexit is farcical 
'Let Britain vote on the final #brexit deal' says Labour MP Clive Lewis @labourlewis 
Ryanair's O'Leary said about the #brexit ministers last year. "If their IQ were one point lower they’d be plants”  
Commissioner Juncker concludedA deal can be almost excludedAs May's stance on #BrexitEffectively wrecks it,She being completely deluded. 
Anybody in any doubt about Brexit will soon realise we must leave this bullying coercive antidemocratic imperial EU Empire  
'She's deluding herself': May's car crash Brexit meeting with Juncker revealed    
Again, think about how you think the negotiations to create an independent Scotland would have gone. Now apply that thought to Brexit. 
Watching Tories who spent their whole lives telling us lefties that we're naively optimistic now try & spin Brexit & May as good things is:  
Not at all. You're getting Brexit. The EU is doing what it was expected to do. So stop moaning and live with  what you wished for. 
After Juncker's disastrous dinner with May, he called Merkel to give her the bad news. She promptly rewrote her Brexit speech to add this...

Even Juncker can't get through to May that you cannot rewrite a club's rule book when you leave it. #Brexit-eers are in for a big shock. 
Jean-Claude Juncker says Theresa May is 'deluded' in scathing call with Angela Merkel after Brexit talks  
The Brexit negotiations were never going to be secret. If the UK doesn't want one-sided briefing, it will have to open up itself, too. 
Theresa May's #Brexit dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker was a bit of a disaster  
Here we go. When Brexit is the disaster it will be, "remoaners" will get blame for "sabotage". In fact Brexit is a shit idea with no plan 
I'm no Brexit fanatic but seems to me the Commission leaked what happened in that dinner in order to influence our election. That's not on. 
WHERE: Cults, human sacrifice and pagan sex: how folk horror is flowering again in Brexit Britain  
Remoaners are fully intending to whinge right up until Brexit, trying to weaken UK's hand at every turn.One could almost call them traitors 
If you think of Brexit as a religious cult it becomes easier to understand. 
Tony Blair to wade into the political fight over Brexit  
Other point on the Brexit dinner leak. It's quite hard to overstate how badly May reacts to what she sees as personal treachery 
Show this to anyone who thinks Theresa May's offering 'strong and stable leadership' on Brexit  
+ @JunckerEU can leak private talks. Or there can be a proper Brexit negotiation. But not both.  
Add Brexit's toxic effect to this staffing catastrophe and the NHS has never looked more vulnerable. We can't afford to lose our EU nurses.  
The disastrous meeting that prompted Angela Merkel's strongest response to Brexit yet  
For anyone who still for second thinks brexit was a good move, have a read.

Your vote at #GE2017 counts to strengthen Theresa May’s hand and the UK’s negotiating position on Brexit.  
Strong and stable leadership? After reports of May's Brexit dinner with Juncker it's more like weak, wobbly, ignorant, delusional leadership 
Keir Starmer: “This is...evidence that May’s rigid and complacent approach to Brexit negotiations risks leading Britain over a cliff edge."

You can't split what isn't there. Corbyn did not oppose Brexit. He supported the terrible Tories with a three-line whip.

Can guess how #Crosby feels after TM's performance today. Epic failure. Negotiate #BREXIT? Give me strength. #ToriesOut #AndrewNeil
If the Tories fuck up #Brexit like I expect them to, do you know who is getting social care funding?Nobody.
You're joking. You mean we're going to be paying the cost of #brexit for years to come? In that case I'd like to #Remain
I Trust Corbyn & @UKLabour to negotiate the #Brexit deal we need for our economy, science, jobs, future. #TrustInCorbyn #c4news #GE2017
Very believable poll puts Labour 10% ahead in Wales, why did it take so long for #Brexit to unravel? 
Yes, and because #Brexit will give us a weak economy large chunks of the #NHS will have to be privatised.Tory smiles all round.#GE2017

If you can't manage 30 mins with Andrew Neil, what makes May think she  negotiate successfully with Barnier on #brexit? #BBCelection
Theresa May on #andrewneil was all over the road. If she is allowed to negotiate #brexit it's a car crash for Britain
You're not going to have a strong economy with #Brexit.
Theresa May lying already, this general election is NOTHING to do with #Brexit, it's about her wanting a huge majority. #BBCElection

#Brexit negotiations begin 
Even if you’re an avid #Brexit fan, the revelations of May’s delusions and incompetence should worry you.
It's good to see people like yourself & most of British media have chosen their side, shame it isn't the UK's... #Juncker #May #Brexit #EU
Dear Twitter, I'm thinking of building a #Brexit Wonderland Park. Looking for ideas for exhibits, rides and fun games for the family.
We have to speak more plainly in Europe. #Turkey cannot be member of EU. #Brexit for Britain means to stand alone. Lecture at @Georgetown
"We need real guarantees for our people to live, work and study in the UK. The same goes for the Brits". #Brexit 
Who would you trust most to give a correct account of their meeting? #EU #BREXIT #LEAVE #REMAIN
Brendan O'Neill on why we voted for #Brexit 
Yes, in fact it's fortunate the EC is leaking, that way we in Britain find out what they're all up to when it comes to #brexit.
Wellcome Trust says UK must be part of the European research system if it is to invest "confidently" post-#Brexit. 
Leaked details from May's disastrous dinner with Juncker suggest #Brexit could be far worse than anyone imagines.

#theresamay is like gentry on holidays in 1930s Europe that thought yelling was better than learning languages for understanding. #brexit

PM's rigid and complacent approach to #Brexit negotiations risks leading Britain over a cliff edge - @Keir_Starmer 
Junker and his EU cronies are talking tough on #Brexit. Do you back Theresa May to walk away from a bad deal? #GE2017 Please RT
I went next door, blamed neighbour for all ills, insulted his wife, told him he’s not welcome hereNow he won’t do me any favours#Brexit
#Brexit deal to punish Britain damages Ireland. Juncker is our enemy & his political destruction in the national intetest
The correct response of any decent man or politician must be "we must make it a success". I think this shows Juncker is neither. #brexit

£1.4 Trillion Investment Funds.Mr May and May PM conflict of interest over #Brexit profits. Investigation underway
Welcome to  #Brexit world in which Bigot is the most commonly spoken language in British papers 
If the country is really in the mood to follow up a #brexit vote with an increased Tory majority it really is Turkeys voting for Christmas.
Whatever your view on #Brexit I guarantee you @theresa_may will completely Fuck it up.
Here's a summary of why, despite #brexit etc., I see EU membership as by far the best option for Ireland. 
'Let Britain vote on the final #brexit deal' says Labour MP Clive Lewis @labourlewis
Commissioner Juncker concludedA deal can be almost excludedAs May's stance on #BrexitEffectively wrecks it,She being completely deluded.
Dear Diary. It's 2020! Saving hard for hols this year. Hope to go abroad to Scotland, if I can get a passport in time. #brexit
Even Juncker can't get through to May that you cannot rewrite a club's rule book when you leave it. #Brexit-eers are in for a big shock.
Your tweet is more evidence of the terrible reporting in the UK about #Brexit that is helping make this situation worse due to anti-EU bias.
Theresa May's #Brexit dinner with Jean-Claude Juncker was a bit of a disaster 
I've SUSSED  why  May won't share info She's trying to hide the fact that she is SO out of her depth !As are her sidekicks !#Brexit
I'm not even shocked. Any idiot that says no deal is better than a bad deal has no clue about #brexit consequences. 
The UK Government Is Completely Deluded About #Brexit..... Basically the Tory Party is Completely Deluded 
Good English summaries of *that* #Brexit dinner from @zelo_street  and @judithmknott
Anyone with even a passing interest in #brexit should check out #@jeremycliffe's timeline now. 
Let's ask all candidates: What does #Brexit mean for food standards in the UK? #LocalElections 
It is SHAMEFUL !All our info on #Brexit comes via BrusselsNOT from our own Government.Probably because they are out of their depth !
Here's why Theresa May changed to being pro-Brexit-Her husbands company made over a Billion profit from #Brexit
Don't give Theresa May a blank cheque to hard #Brexit Britain, register to vote here by 22 May!  #GE2017
This @FAZ_Politik piece on #Brexit is astonishing, though deeply disturbing...Theresa May seems to have entirely lost her grip on reality.. 
Good to know: After #Brexit, German village of Gadheim (89 inhabitants) will be new geographic center of #EU, replacing city of Westerngrund
Read this and be very afraid. Then find a Tory #Brexit zealot and kick them in the backside. #GE2017 
#Brexit referendum has given rise to new political identities:38% identify as "Remainers", 35% as "Leavers" (research with @thosjleeper)
The underlying problem with ‘#Brexit attitudes’ is the they’re based on a believe that Britons are ‘better’ than foreigners.
UK (Scotland), Panelbase poll: Independence referendumYes: 45% (-)No: 55% (-)#indyref2 #Brexit
Yes. This would be a vote winner for @UKLabour &, given recent #Brexit reports, is now necessary. Too much at stake. Let's vote on the deal. 
Worth reading this and Jeremy's thread - The most important story for Britain this year. #brexit as seen from outside the U.K. Bubble 
My analysis of Irish-UK relations, the value of our shared EU membership & the challenges posed by #brexit. 
Theresa May's #WeakAndWobbly #Brexit strategy in full#GE2017
MPs call for #Labour to offer referendum on #Brexit terms: 
Every UK voter shd read this v worrying thread. Tories #ge17 pitch 'every vote strengthens #brexit hand'. Reality: EU think May is clueless 
Remoaner Tim Farron has no principles - wants to block #Brexit but now says he is Eurosceptic to win votes in the SW 
Tomorrow we publish our report on #Brexit energy and climate change priorities. Read it at 
Thread showing just how far out of her depth May is with #Brexit. Its difficult to read this and not be hugely concerned. 
Jean-Claude Juncker says Theresa May is 'deluded' in scathing call with Angela Merkel after #Brexit talks 
The British government must abandon myth that all British will be better off post-#Brexit.
Indeed @BBCr4today made plenty of space for Line of Duty but no word on this. BBC risks keeping UK in the bubble that helped make #Brexit 
.@BBCBreakfast monster trucks. #LineofDuty & bloke who did #LondonMarathon on hands and knees. Lead is social media regulation.#brexit 
My goodness. Read all 30/30 of this  #Brexit 
Another shocking thread about May's approach the #Brexit negotiations.She is callous & totally incapable of handling this process. Be afraid 
Anyone remotely interested in #brexit should read Jeremy's thread - especially those naive enough to think this is going to be a cakewalk 
Former British PM Tony Blair announces return to British politics to fight against #Brexit. 
Yeah, but all of that only worked inside the European Union. We even spoke English in our meetings to make you feel home, guys! #Brexit=fail 
 Clive Lewis & Rachael Maskell break ranks and say Labour should offer a referendum on any #Brexit deal
Current voting intentions . Vote , follow and retweet ! #Conservative #labour #LibDems #ukip #SNP #green #GE2017 #election #uk #brexit

Good read#Brexit will redraw investment competitiveness of the #UK #fintech #insurtech #VC @KPMG @Consultancy_uk
My new #Brexit cartoon: StrongNEVER SKIP LEG-IT-FROM-THE-VOTERS-DAYInstagram: FB: 
This has to be the mother of all #Brexit threads. The UK under May is so comprehensively screwed. 
Eventually quantum mechanics will now determine the #Brexit "... UK's disentanglement from the EU's all the rights and obligations..."

Important thread on #Brexit expectations and our Prime Minister's "illusions" 
"Our #environment must not be sacrificed during the #Brexit negotiations." Unlikely groups unite in letter to UK Gov 
Fascinating and worrying thread on May's dinner with Juncker #brexit 
Some more analysis on those #brexit revelations. Good thread.
If  #EU commissioners are going to leak  #Brexit talks to the FAZ...the Germans might wind up with their version on tv of "AlloAllo"#Brexit 
#TheresNothingMoreSexierThan Americans who support #Brexit 
Tory politics today #brexit 
This remains the best summary of the UK's #Brexit strategy. 
"If you don't give us what we desperately need we'll jolly we'll walk away without what we desperately need, that'll show you!" #Brexit
If you have any interest at all in #Brexit, this thread is a #MustRead
When Juncker tells May that #Brexit cannot be a success, would it not be prudent to reconsider? #Brexit is not compulsory, Mrs May.
'Britain WILL walk away' Theresa May vows NOT to accept a bad #Brexit deal.She better keep her word!
"Her guests then informed her that the EU is not a golf club" #TheresaMay's #Brexit negotiations sound like an ep of #ArrestedDevelopment.
We were worried when Trump said the presidency is harder than he expected. May seems to have same delusions on #brexit @JakeMaxBaker
#Brexit: In March 2 #Tory #Lords, 22 #Labour & 89 #LibDems voted for 2nd #EU #Referendum, ignoring the will of the people. Vote #UKIP @UKIP.

#Brexit proved UK is sick of this crap. I bet the people of UK are sickened by this apology.
The Conservatives have dismissed two Labour MPs' calls for a referendum on a final #brexit deal as 'pure chaos' 
Read the entire thread. This PM is not fit for office. #TheresaMay #GeneralElection #Brexit 
Startling 30 tweet thread. #brexit 
Tony Blair, the man hated by the left and right, thinks he can save the middle class from #BRexit. I guess he could come out endorsing LEAVE
How do you foresee the UK #agricultural #landscape changing with #Brexit?
Dealing w/ different definitions of "success" here. UK's definition of a "successful" #Brexit is obviously not in line with EU's objectives.
The icebergs are already in the horizon but Britanic's captain refuses to alter course. #Brexit 
The #Brexit dinner, as reported by the Frankfurter Allgemeine, in 11 tweets:
There's no actual plan. It's all just a load of delusional thinking and bluster. #Brexit #MayDay
We are on board Titanic whose captain insists that icebergs are a liberal conspiracy. #Brexit 
#BREXIT got pregnant & now there is #FRexit (Exit of #France of #EU) @51Batman @Krommsan @tomlinden0 @intelOverwatch @iamlibertyshow
Tony Blair exclusively reveals why he's returning to politics  #brexit #europe
May apparently genuinely surprised that the UK won't get special treatment. Why would EU have incentive to make #Brexit "a success"? 
England is so fucked re #Brexit negotiations. Just *so* fucked. Scotland, I hope, has a way out of this shit storm..

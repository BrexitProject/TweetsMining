in a far away dream there'll be a referendum on the monarchy, but that is years and years and years away 
UKIP can putter on but it's fucked. It was formed purely to campaign for referendum and Brexit. If UK says no then it has no purpose. 
UK has a Southern-dominated majority Con Govt on 37% of the votes(24% of electorate) in 2015. Divided country before the referendum 
The Brexit case was largely built on angry nativism, dressed up in spurious talk of sovereignty  
Postal vote could be strongly Brexit. I need wine.

1.6 million Brits signed a petition for another E.U. referendum. They shouldn’t hold their breath.  
Buyer's remorse: More than 2 million Brits have already signed a petition calling for a second EU referendum.  
Just been told that over 9,000 voters ticked BOTH boxes on the referendum ballot paper. And these people are allowed outdoors? 
I think Cameron needs to invoke article 50 now. We need put a line under the referendum and stop the stupidity of petitions and David Lammy.

Investors betting on #Brexit threw caution to the wind. Blame it on the bookies.  
A Brexit petition is a great idea. It will finally allow the authorities to count or, if you will, ‘tally’ opinions on the subject. 
What has really annoyed me is the SNPs ability to remove focus from a Eu referendum to a Scottish referendum. #NoMoreReferendums

After spending all night in office, @hughcarnegy preps special extra #Brexit edition of @FT for 10am deadline. 
Oh and this "we need time to reflect before Art 50". Bollocks. Wasn't the referendum campaign meant to be UK's reflection about EU? 
This is one of the saddest days for the #UK, #USA & the planet. Very distressed for all life today. #Trump #Brexit   
So, basically, voters hate politicians and therefore politics. But what's the alternative? How else do you settle arguments? #Brexit

England = Brexit x 2 
Poor Brits, #Brexit, then exit of England from #Euro2016 kicked out by tiny Iceland! What a colossal humiliation, what a misery! 
I look forward to the day my future kid comes home from school to tell me they learned about #Brexit in History by watching a soccer game. 
Nicola Sturgeon can be a post-Brexit voice of reason, says @LesleyRiddoch 
Look on the bright side England : 1. We can now talk about something other than Brexit & 2. We get to hear that Icelandic commentator again 
Take note Boris, that's how you successfully brexit #EURO2016 
Is this what they meant when they said Brexit would be followed by depression? #engvice 
It's official... #Brexit hit soccer too... England out of all Europe... Even from #EURO2016 now 
 BREXIT #EURO2016 #ENGISL 
Update: No government, no opposition, no plan - and no football team. Finding new ways to get out of Europe. #EURO2016 #Brexit 
Just focus on the supporters who goaded that little boy and the high proportion who’ll have voted for Brexit and it’s not really that bad. 
England Football team implementing the Brexit vote 
So two downgrades and a loss from Iceland in #EURO2016 for #England. Can't imagine how this night could go worse for England #Brexit 
Well that will get Brexit off the front pages!!! Well done Iceland - you were deserved winners  
Brexit, Exit but so far no Wexit @FAWales @UEFAEURO

So Iceland just knocked England out of the UEFA.   Does that qualify as another BREXIT. 
The #Brexit vote outcome was a surprise, but market reaction was not.Perspective from Prudential Investments →  
Commentator suggests this loss is worse than Brexit. Dickhead. 
#ENG gets knocked out of Europe twice in one week. #Brexit #EURO2016 
My wife blames the Brexit, for demoralising the players. Like for real. Well done Iceland. Massive performance. England not good enough.  
Can we shut our borders now and not let the England football team back in? #Brexit 
Iceland 2-1 England, or as I prefer to call it, Brexit 2: Electric Boogaloo 
Excellent double brexit there 
You voted to leave so karma. #Brexit #EURO2016 #ENG v #ISL 
Brexit indeed.  
We deserved that, for all the shit this week. Karmic justice for the twats in Brexit shirts. Well done Iceland, right behind you now. 
England's most humiliating result since Brexit 
It seems Iceland just won yet another war against England. A second Brexit in less than a week. 
#ENG let's just hope #Brexit means we only get one major tournament every 4 years, every 2 is beyond your footballing ability. #EURO2016 
England still in the competition as Euros needs England far more than England needs them. #brexit 
Brexit 2

130 banks to apply for UK licence ahead of #Brexit, says Bank of England #fintech
Yes, this warns of how we'll be treated once outside the #EU and desperate for US trade. #Brexit is certain economic suicide.
As critical stage negotiations on #Brexit proceed, an EU official feels confident enough to insult, berate & taunt Britain 
This is our experience, having engaged with many Brexiters over several months in the streets of #Leeds #Brexit 
If you still believe US will be the trading savour of UK post #Brexit just take a look at the #Bombardier case.
A salutary lesson as to the importance of the #EU to us and the dangers of the #brexit myths, our new "buddy" #USA will hang us out to dry.

True.So why is the Labour Party standing behind a #brexit that will free the rich from regulation and make the rest of us poorer?
Labour's refusal to allow conference to debate #Brexit is the measure of  #Corbyn 's ambivalence to #EU. Only @LibDems offer resistance now
Labour grown-ups on #Brexit ? With no debate/vote at conference and no clarity on post transition, what would squabbling children look like?

Not entirely sure what's happened to giving members a freer voice at conference if being heavily whipped in votes... #Brexit #Lab17
Keeping #Brexit, biggest issue of our time, off our #lab17 agenda is silly and undermines the claim that we are listening to our members.

And while EU27 citizens were denied a vote critical for their futures, Commonwealth citizens were allowed to vote.#Brexit injustice! /3 
Germany: At least 3,000 former UK citizens, who left Britain after #Brexit, are voting today for the first time as German citizens. #btw17
"I think it's impossible for anyone to put a figure on it" - Labour Leader says he doesn't know where the 2 year figure came from #brexit 
David Davis might well want a 'practical, upbeat' #brexit but his party's hardline approach is a real risk to our economy. #marr
Think about this if you're a Labour supporter#Brexit 
'A TREATY TOO FAR' - New EU-UK Defence Treaty: essential reading if you want indep't armed forces post-#Brexit at 
Nick Clegg makes vital point on #Marr. You can't end austerity without ending #Brexit. He's right. See Moody's credit rating downgrading UK
"The honest choice,even if it splits the Tories,is to leave the EU or stay.We can and must stay." Must read #Brexit 
Oh, there's Nick Clegg, talking crap about #Brexit.The man who made £250k off a flat, in only 5 years at the EU trough. #Marr
Looks like #Marr is following the usual @BBCNews pattern. No Scots, Welsh or NI voices to be heard on #Brexit. An English only project.
Moody's downgrade teaches hard lesson on sovereignty: UK govt announces its #brexit intentions but the reaction of others determines results
I can't take #brexit naval gazing or today's #andrewmarr guests.Am off out. Meanwhile...Labour's Policy explained
#Brexit is the single most important political issue facing the UK today. @PeoplesMomentum are trying to stop it being debated at #Lab17.
Many will have seen this wonderful demolition of #Brexit arguments, but does no harm to say it twice 
The UK is set to become the new Greece after #Brexit;  Broke and in need of a bailout. Ordinary Brits will pay a huge price for this folly. 
PLS RT In case u think this is a 'fair balanced fight'; in case u think 'yes' vote a shoo in - here r some facts & stats Beware #Brexit  
Just a lil video of yours truly rollin into town on the Elvismobile for #Elvisfest2017 in #Porthcawl#Brexit #StopBrexit #Remain

Goodnight Patriots it's already late here in the UKRemember to   #MAGA#MaBGA and support   @POTUS#Brexit@Nigel_Farage
I'm happy that UK has chosen to reconsider the car crash Brexit path that we were on. #Brexit #brexitspeech #FlorenceSpeech #Remain
What's Labour's policy on #Brexit this week?
The evidence is mounting. #Brexit will be a disaster. Tragically both May & Corbyn support it.Support @LibDems & calls for a 2nd referendum
UK, Survation poll:LAB-S&D: 42% ↓CON-ECR: 38%LDEM-ALDE: 8% ↑UKIP-EFDD: 4%#Brexit #btw17
Excellent. Given loudness of the metro Remainers we need @BorisJohnson out there campaigning for REAL #Brexit 
Yes, as Brits will no longer be EU citizens if we #brexit , unless negotiations provide otherwise (unlikely)
We need a modern day Thatcher negotiating #Brexit on our behalf, not a latter day Ted Heath wearing a frock#florencespeech #MayMustGo
A woman with serious problems. And it'snot just Boris Johnson! Tories couldn't organise a pissup up in a Twyford Beer tent or #Brexit. 
Proud to have put my name to this vital @UKLabour letter to avert the disaster of a hard Tory #Brexit 
Brexit: all over by Christmas? - out of the EU faster than we think ...  #Brexit. 
Put this on a big red bus.#Brexit 
Theresa May sacrifices the next election to stay in the EU and give Britain to Corbyn. Treachery abounds! @Nigel_Farage #Brexit
Gove: All our data says #Brexit will be a disaster. However, we can't tell you this as it undermines our lies.
#Brexit critic Colin Firth opts for Italian passport for ‘family reasons’ 
I checked out the PMs speech in Le Monde this morning. #Brexit was the 22nd news item, apparently they will cope without us, who knew?
The report the MEPs backed was drawn up by @TheProgressives – which includes @UKLabour. Does Britain exit the UfM scheme after #Brexit...?
#Lab17  Labour voted for Article 50 & Corbyn wanted it day after manipulated Referendum. They need to get their act together & dump #Brexit
UK's credit rating suffers due to #Brexit fears, at least we have got our country back innit #morons
A HARD/SOFT #Brexit will be DECIDED & delivered by EU27 UK will take or leave it in the end! Current debate is only trading water #remain

#Brexit has done it for Mr Darcy :)) 
Excellent article on the tax-dodging rich and media barons using #Brexit to avoid the EU clampdown on tax-avoidance 
How many millions are you going to spend this time to try to foist #Brexit on the British people @Arron_banks?#StopBrexit
Should the Brexiteers in the Tory Party 'force' Theresa May to resign for her 'great' #brexit betrayal?Please Retweet
May’s Florentine fudge simply highlighted Tory #brexit divisions.See my article in @LabourList :
Theresa May says Britain and Europe should come together as if in some sort of Union after #Brexit
Indeed, that is the nature of parliamentary democracy: no #brexit agreement w/o ratification by both European and UK Parliaments.
#EU did not declare Nationalist @Nigel_Farage and @UKIP terrorists BUT allowed #BrexitWhy can't @UN #EU #UK #USA support #BiafraReferendum
The UK's credit rating has been cut over concerns about public finances & fears #Brexit could slow economic growth 
We have just 1 year, 186 days and 8 hours to get #Brexit back on track.
This woman couldn't deliver a bleedin pizza let alone #brexit #WalkAwayMay
First downgrading from triple A came only days after #Brexit. So the 'Remoaners sabotaged the economy' line doesn't really wash here Gandalf 
Future generations will say to us'You lived through #BrexitWhat did you do to help stop it?'Books will be writtenHistory will damn us
Want to understand what will be going on behind the scenes this weekend at #Lab17 on #Brexit? READ our explainer. 
Brits worried about their Moody's rating is like the Titanic's captain worrying about his Tripadvisor rating #Brexit
Oh God, Charles Moore on #bbcaq blames Remainers, BBC, Lords, Bxl for #Brexit negs mess - everyone except Tory govt which has wasted 15 mths
Theresa May is first person to unite country on #Brexit. The Remainers think she's a traitor & now the Leavers think she's a traitor too.
....and the Leave Campaign had the gall to claim that #Brexit would help the #NHS !
.@theresa_may you`re Playing Self Preservation Games & you`re fooling no one. Your never ending #negotiation delay tactics nauseate.#Brexit
Theresa May said 'UK has never been comfortable in the EU'.How comfortable do you feel as part of EU?#brexit#florencespeech#indyref2

It's 'like Merkel heading to Cambridge to patch up her coalition'. Some on May's team are baffled by the location of today's speech. #brexit 
So basically, May’s Florence speech will say that she’s going to copy Labour’s #Brexit transition plan, now that Boris has said she can... 
WATCH: @heidi_mp and how she finds it 'absolutely staggering' PM has only just realised, after 12 months, the need for a #Brexit transition:

Join me @brightdome on 24 Sept with @BHforEU, @britainforeurop, @pollytoynbee & @IanDunt for a #Brexit event - 
#Brexit means throwing away over 40 years of #EU progress for no good reason. Please share our guest article. Link: 
Can someone let May know that the world is aware that the majority in the UK now no longer want #Brexit. If they ever did. Dead horse.
Delighted to have @JolyonMaugham writing for @UE: '#Brexit will turn UK into a safehouse for Europe’s polluters' 
At 2.15pm UK time, Mrs May will deliver her long-awaited 5,000-word speech hoping to break the deadlock over negotiations with EU #brexit
I have given up watching #bbcqt .It's absolute torture knowing the education system has failed so very many. So much #Brexit bullshit.
Theresa May is today going to embarrass Britain again speaking in Florence to a room full of Brits... Europeans don't care anymore. #Brexit
Latest poll shows a 52% to 48% #Remain majority. #StopBrexit #Brexit
England, a country where the young are hated almost as much as foreigners. Who will chose and staff #Brexit voters future care homes? 
.@HMcEntee: There cannot be return to hard border in Ireland, common travel area must be maintained & Good Friday agreement upheld. #Brexit
Guess which Gov Dept has worst record currently for replying to FOI requests? DExEU, granting just 10% fully. Hiding the true #Brexit cost.
Demand that Gov't make public the #Brexit Impact/Risk assessments. Why are they hiding them? If you want #StopBrexit please sign & RT 
Good luck to Theresa May with #FlorenceSpeech. Supremely difficult task to deliver an unprecedented constitutional change. #Brexit
Are you more or less certain that a complete #Brexit is essential one year on?
If Mrs May *really* wants "the best deal for Britain" she will realise that there is no #Brexit deal that is better than EU membership. 
If #Brexit is such a good idea. If the country is united. If May really has the support of parliament, why is she running away to Florence?
#Brexit is bad for the EU, but it's 27 times worse for the UK.
#Brexit: Majority of British people believe UK should stay in the EU, finds latest poll 
#EU wants May to make firm offers now for #Brexit deal 
Buongiorno Firenze! #Brexit road trip live on @business @BloombergTV with @ManusCranny
Is almost £20 billion too much for Britain to be paying in a #Brexit 'divorce bill'?
Dear parents, Today is our trip to Florence! Don't forget the lunch-boxes. Theresa will talk about #Brexit. Boris: please behave. Back at 6.
This country is known for its #CommonSense.It's kicking in.#Brexit
Theresa May using security issues as blackmail for trading rights will not work with the EU & shows her desperation. #Brexit#bbcqt
Thanks to our brilliant guests in studio @OireachtasNews :expert analysis on the #Verhofstadt visit & #Brexit negotiations. @michelledevane
If Tim Martin of JD Wetherspoon is the eloquent voice of #Brexit, then we're in a worse mess than I thought #BBCTW #ThisWeek God help us!
Getting to the crux of what #Brexit was really all about. Further deregulation of the City of London. 
I find it odd that people who disagree with Tim Martin on #Brexit find it necessary to call him an idiot, which he obviously isn't. #bbctw
EU won't be impressed if that's all that's offered. UK seems to want credit for not being divided & delivering sheer basics, late. #Brexit 
NHS now has 40,000 jobs that can't be filled as EU workers leave for fear of #brexit #brexitwontwork
Brexit: a pre-emptive strike - Barnier has the measure of Mrs May's Florence speech ...  #Brexit. 
I wish this lady on #bbcqt was running #brexit So intelligent reasonable, articulate.And HONEST ! 
And just a reminder. The #Brexit press barons are all tax-dodgers who won't like the EU clamping down on their offshore finances. 
And this is before the full costs of leaving have been felt. We can and must stop #Brexit. Join the @libdems to help us save the country
Theresa May gets ready for her big speech in Italy - Latest @guardian cartoon...#florencespeech #TheresaMay #Boris #Brexit 
Cameron's father avoided taxes via an offshore company. His wife worked for a company that avoided taxes via a trust in Guernsey.#Brexit 
The EU introduces a plan to curb tax avoidance, and within a month Cameron changes his mind to favour a #Brexit referendum.#StopBrexit
Some of us absolutely love and live in a rustic town with the  family butcher. Some of us really don't like pompous, superior pratts #Brexit 
The Tories have brought in some new #brexit negotiators, especially for Article 127 leaving the single market #thicktories
The Brits shot themselves in both feet with #brexit.  Thresholds for a referendum should be higher, like with a constitutional amendment.
Peter Bone MP - "Any divorce bill will be too much for me because we’ve paid in net to the European Union £200 billion." #Brexit 
Tim Martin - "Five years for #Brexit is quite a long time. It’s a partial step to not leaving the EU, that’s how I see it." 
Follow this thread about the experience of two young Irish @UNYouthIRL who took on BJ on #Brexit- I would rather have either of them as FM 
1. By now all but the very dimmest and most steadfastly deluded have worked out that a no deal #Brexit would be a disaster.
I think Mundell and Ross Thompson need to get their stories straight over where our fishing rights are going #brexit

Brexit: timewasting from Johnson - what a waste of space that man is ...  #Brexit. 
The joke of it is, if Gove & Rees-Mogg et al thought for a nanosecond that #Brexit meant £350m pw for the NHS, they'd have been remainers.

The Trojan Horse has revealed its contents. #Brexit is nothing more than a right-wing authoritarian opportunity for oppression. Angry yet?
This Saturday. #Leeds. 1pm onwards. Protest against #Brexit. We are angry. Leeds voted #Remain.

#Brexit : EU repeal bill wins first Commons vote -  Our thanks and congratulations to @DavidDavisMP
Webcast starting at 2pm today: Helping UK businesses navigate #Brexit. Tune in for expert debate.
The Great British Repeal Bill. #Brexit #Bakeoff
#BREAKING: #Brexit wins again!! The EU repeal bill wins the first Commons voteSo proud of our U.K. cousins 
290 traitors to the will of the people who have no business being MPs #EUwithdrawalbill #Brexit
There are 318 MPs who respect the democratic process and 296 who think they are above the people#EUWithdrawlBill #brexit 
Every single #libdem MP voted against the supreme leader tyranny #brexit bill! Well done, all of you!
If Jeremy Corbyn wasn't Labour leader he would have joined Denis Skinner in voting with the Tories #brexit #GreatRepealBill
So we lost the vote to Govt determined on a sovereign power grab, but we still have the Committee stage to make them see sense #Brexit 
The Lib Dems have tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill so MPs can take back control from Ministers and give vote on exit from #Brexit
I voted to progress #Brexit through 2nd reading of #EUwithdrawalBill, it is what the electorate voted for & it must be delivered.
Govt should take no comfort on winning Second Reading vote on EU Withdrawal Bill. Real challenge will come at #Brexit Committee Stage.
We are delighted that the #EUWithdrawlBill has passed second reading and will now move to Committee Stage. #Brexit
#BREAKING #Brexit bill passes at second reading, allowing it to move to next stage of parliamentary process 
I have voted i) for reasoned amendment; ii) against second reading of #Brexit bill & iii) against programme motion (and for more scrutiny!)
You're getting the hang of it...#Brexit #powergrab
Labour Amendment fails-but this was the result-No-318. Yes 296. Gov't's going to have a hard time with their #Brexit.#EUwithdrawalbill
In closing minutes of #Brexit debate  - I'll be voting against this constitutional outrage - people didn't vote for a Government power grab 
British parliamentary democracy essentially broken. You’re so right @PeteWishart. #brexit 
Govt attempts to blame Brussels for the costs of #Brexit and the chaos of its own negotiating failures are pathetic 
#PowerGrabTheresa has already pulled the trigger but she can be stopped#ToriesOut #EUwithdrawalBill #brexit

#Brexit - threats of violence and a government power grab. The stench of fascism rising up from the swamp. #StopBrexit
What would happen to Remainers if we made threats to pick up a rifle if #Brexit goes through?One law for Farage... 
#EUwithdrawalbill Theresa Mays version of Hitlers Enabling Act 1933Has to be stopped!  … … #Brexit #EUWithdrawlBill
A vote against the #EUWithdrawalBill isn't a vote to frustrate #Brexit. It's about preventing a Tory power grab & protecting our rights.
Here's Labour MP Daniel Zeichner in tonight's #Brexit debate 
Our position on the #EUWithdrawalBill is clear: It’s critical that our hard-won rights don’t diminish after #Brexit. 
Reluctant? No. Labour have lied repeatedly on #Brexit. They don't have any respect for the 17.4m who voted Leave whatsoever. 
Hear, hear! Wake up and smell the f*cking coffee people  #brexit #EUwithdrawalbill
Labour's Frank Field confirms he is on the side of the majority who voted for #Brexit 
When Labour vote against the #EUwithdrawalbill they shout loud & clear "We despise the people's #Brexit & will do anything to stop it"

Forget #Brexit for a second, ask yourself if you'd support #EUwithdrawalbill otherwise. This is a genuine threat to parliamentary democracy.
Here's why I'm voting against the EU Withdrawal Bill tonight. #Brexit 
Government warns of "chaos" if it's defeated on #Brexit vote, by which it mean "more of the same chaos" that it's currently delivering.
Exploiting the narrow outcome of a flawed referendum for a hard #Brexit will go down as the stupidest decision ever taken. For most of us.
I'd be grateful if you could help embarrass David Davis by retweeting the linked tweet #StopBrexit #Remain #Brexit
This is what Henry VIII powers are and why everyone's fighting about them. #EUwithdrawalbill #Brexit 
Right now at #Parliament #RepealBill #Brexit #StopBrexit #Remain #SODEM @EUflagmafia @No10Vigil 
Britain must never surrender to cynical exploitation of threats of extremism such as this by Zac Goldsmith #Brexit
Any MP who says handing unprecedented powers to govt to override parliament is "only way to respect #Brexit vote" is brainwashed or lying
The most important bill debated in this country for hundreds of years, and where are the MPs? #brexit #bbcparliament
#EUwithdrawalbill will give TM same powers as the Enabling act 1933 which took Germany from democracy to Nazi Dictatorship #brexit 
"I shall be abstaining to allow the Bill to be further discussed & amended." @CarolineFlintMP on the EU (Withdrawal) Bill #Brexit 
Are you frustrated with the lack of direction with Jeremy Corbyn on #brexit? @jeremycorbyn RETWEET & VOTE #yourvoice
Tell your MP to vote against the withdrawal bill and prevent a Government power-grab from #Brexit 
Isn't it possible that Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party have lied, and are lying, to the whole country over #Brexit? 
Caller forces Nigel Farage to admit that UK could restrict immigration while remaining in EU - destroying his main rationale for #Brexit 
You can read my speech on how @RoyalNavy can support UK prosperity post #Brexit here:

I do not not trust this government to deliver a #Brexit that makes life better for the majority. They've shown no interest in even trying.

It's likely to be a long day today, but with @theSNP colleagues, I will oppose a #Brexit power-grab by the Tories. #WithdrawalBill
this is a shocking report. The idea that #Brexit will lead to better environmental protection is laughable given the UK's terrible record. 
TUC's Frances O'Grady says there must be "no dodgy trade deals to sell off our NHS" after #Brexit

If Remainers want to stop #Brexit - and it's still possible - they must pull together and get tough, says Nick Kent.
Gearing up for a late night of votes in @@HouseofCommons for #Brexit bill. @theSNP MPs won't sit back and allow a UK Government power grab.
“Single economy” far better term than “single market” to understand #brexit Good piece by @jorisluyendijk
#BREXIT Govt set to lay out benefits of 'NO DEAL'. Good. Demands for money "before we'll talk trade" is distasteful. 
#Brexit is now leading to a constitutional.struggle for the survival of Paliamentary democracy and devolution? Can the UK survive this? 
 Perfectly democratic to have a public vote on the final deal #brexit
On #brexit, #r4today scrutinise the timeline of the plans rather than the nature of the policy. Brexit is still an 'if', not just a 'when'.
London remains the world's most attractive financial centre, despite #Brexit 
Mind blown. We are in very big trouble. It's your civic duty to read @IanDunt's #Brexit book. 
Start of a busy week; keen to vote in favour of the 2nd Reading of the EU Withdrawal Bill tonight! #Brexit  
I'm against the withdrawal bill, as I'm worried we can still get pregnant #Brexit.

Tony Blair. The only man who unites the British people on #Brexit. The Leavers hate him & the Remainers hate him too.

See how confident the UK is in its #Brexit economy!  This graph says 1000 words while #May is bragging about 'Global Britain'#remain
All-British TVR to be built in Ebbw Vale, Wales – more embarrassment for Remainers who swore #Brexit would kill UK car manufacturing.  
Labour has become adept at publicly declaring its support for #Brexit while doing everything possible to obstruct it
an important statement from the Law Society.  they're not usually so forthcoming on political events! #brexit 
"The hypocrisy of those who properly understand the legal position...is breathtaking." Exceedingly good article. Well worth reading. #BREXIT 
Hypocritical Remainers are misleading the public with their new-found opposition to secondary legislation   #Brexit
Instead of having UK officials lobby individual MEPs, @theresa_may should debate with us in public #brexit

Gagging Act, voter reg changes, boundary review, Trade Union Act, #Brexit Bill & now this. Latest ruthless undemocratic Tory power grab 
Far from 'taking back control ' #Tories are using #Brexit to smash democracy, parliament and devolution.
When is a Brit politician going to stand up and say #Brexit is a complete nonsensical chaotic load of bollocks?
“Science has always transcended national borders & there is a real will on all sides to ensure that #Brexit does not hinder that." 
Rejecting the Tory EU repeal bill isn't rejecting #Brexit, it's rejecting the biggest power grab by any gov in ages 
Ooops, this #brexit #mugwump thingy just keeps getting worse ...Why don't we just #StopBrexitNow ?
That would make the cost of #Brexit the same as UK gross EU contribution? That's uncanny!Where are they gonna find £350M a week now? 
The Tories must love the MSM & its commentators' obsession w/ #Brexit. They currently have a free pass to attack disabled people, the NHS...
It's especially sad that with #Brexit not only are we losing lots of good people, but they're being jeered off by arseholes who are staying.

Very productive meetings in Brussels the last two days where our Mep's hosted a delegation of the @FineGael parliamentary party on #Brexit 
DD has very short memory! Keir Starmer absolutely right. Tories were bragging about how easy #Brexit would be. Now look at state of talks...
Contrast between the jokey, smug platitudes of the #Brexit Secretary & the serious, forensic response from @Keir_Starmer couldn't be starker
.@DavidDavisMP: Significant progress made with regard to the situation in Northern Ireland in #Brexit negotiations 
#Brexit Secretary @DavidDavisMP says UK's approach to negotiations is "more flexible" than that taken by the EU
David Davis: "Nobody pretended this would be simple or easy." Pretty sure that's not true. #brexit
David Davis trying to deliver a worthwhile #brexit is like watching a chimp trying to wire a plug safely. It's possible but highly unlikely.
It's been 439 days since the referendum. Yet the whole #Brexit process still shrouded in confusion. Not good enough.
Leader Tory Brexiter Daniel Hannan wants a "buccaneering, offshore, low tax" Britain. In other words a tax haven for the rich. #Brexit 
Davis says he's making 'concrete progress'. Would hate to see what a lack of progress would look like... #Brexit
The amount of effort David Davis and Theresa May have put into getting a good #Brexit deal is demonstrated by this dog... 
DUP say a border poll is divisive & destabilising. Yet supported #Brexit, one of most divisive & destabilising things to happen the north .

So many careers are being sacrificed on the altar of Brexit. So many more to come. #Brexit is racist poison; economic lunacy.
Expectation vs reality. #LaughingStock#Brexit 
Vince Cable should either stand up against #Brexit or resign. We have 2 main parties attached to Brexit. The @LibDems must oppose.
Instead of talking Brexity wibble, @vincecable should have forcefully argued that any #Brexit is bad for Britain.

I genuinely cannot answer this. Does anyone have a plausible answer why Davis committed to schedule in June, only to backtrack? #brexit

Lets remember that at its heart #brexit is a disagreement inside the @Conservatives on how to exploit the rest of us most efficiently

The idea that those behind #Brexit weren't part of 'the elite' is the biggest con of all. 
It's here! Welcome to the very first edition of POLITICO London Playbook: Never-ending #Brexit talks 
5) informing public of #Brexit reality is not "teaching a lesson". It's doing Nick's job, because he can't or won't
This is outrageously bad journalism. He was saying that people in the UK do not fully understand the consequences of #brexit and he's right. 
No, he didn't. Inaccurate, unhelpful. Playing to the #brexit gallery? 
If only someone had made a commitment abt a £350m extra boost to the NHS. And won a vote on that. #Brexit 
This is really bad news. #brexit 
In short, Labour & Tories are not to be trusted to deliver #Brexit.  Right? 
So when Farage talked of violence as the next step he was exploiting a terrorist threat for political advantage. #Brexit  /3

#Barnier is a complete amateur - he has not a clue - he is and will be completely eviscerated by UK negotiating team #Brexit 
Just for the record. In the 97 min #tvduell neither Merkel or Schulz mentioned #Brexit, but EU and its future role frequently.

#Brexit is emphatically NOT the #WillofthePeople. It is the mad plan of a minority. 17.5M voted Leave, 29.1M of electorate didn't. FACT!
The UK created the #Brexit "time pressure" - as Tories & Corbyn's Labour rushed to trigger Article 50 with zero plan of what to do next!! 
We need to keep Europe strong to avoid the horrors of conflict and war. Stop #brexit. Let's not live in a crazy time again. 
No one can "make a success of #Brexit" Prime Minister - the most that can be done is mitigate some of the damage  
If the EU is such a bad trading partner to be in bed with, why is David Davis begging them to start talking about a post #Brexit trade deal?

Ford to consider closing UK factories in Leave towns. #Brexit once again bites the #Leavers where it hurts
#Brexit idiot Liam Fox shouting "We want, we want". This little man should not even be back in politics after what he did. He's a disgrace

Ford has factories in two of the biggest Leave areas. After #Brexit, it's considering closing them 
No deal on #Brexit is looking increasingly likely.
Great to see @Open_Britain #Reading on the front page of local news @getreading campaigning against hard #Brexit
Time to end govt secrecy around #Brexit impact studies. In interests of openness & transparency I've put in #FOI 
As you say, Labour Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott can be relied upon to take an anti-British line on #Brexit 
This is of course what the wealthy hard Right lust after, a no deal #Brexit forcing Britain to slash taxes/welfare/regulations to survive.

1) thread on #BrexitEvery MP on all sides who voted through A50 did so knowing there was no plan in place & 2 years wasn't long enough

Seems to me the #Brexit:iers have moved from "look at all the great things we can do!" to "oh come on, it's not going to be that bad".

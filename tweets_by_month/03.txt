@charlottechurch utter cynicism would be the appropriate response. He's simply freeing himself to campaign without restraint for Brexit.

Cameron "puzzled and disappointed" by #IDS resignation. What that really means is PM utterly fuming and could happily throttle him.#Brexit
IDS enjoys sticking the knife into Osborne in a similar way to his approach knifing the poor and disabled. All about Brexit and his ego.

The Tory war over Brexit that made Iain Duncan Smith fire his gun
Having orchestrated the financial victimisation of the disabled, IDS is now using them as pawns in a game of #Brexit. He's beneath contempt.
Iain Duncan Cough obviously thinks Boris Johnson will make him Chancellor when he takes over at number ten following a vote for brexit.
The Tories thought their stupid EU referendum would bring their fractious party together. It's now blowing up in their callous faces.
The 'out' referendum needs a figurehead. Farage is toxic. Now suddenly IDS has a social conscience ... Scumbag
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I introduce the post #Brexit dream team. Please be careful how you place your votes.

THE INDEPENDENT FRONT PAGE: "Welsh First Minister raises the stakes on Brexit" #skypapers
So did IDS not notice Tory manifesto pledge to cut welfare even more deeply then? This is all about Brexit and discrediting Cameron/Osborne
Man who introduced bedroom tax, tax credit cuts &10 fold increase in food banks finds conscience? Or just maybe this is about Brexit. #IDS
IDS resigning by pretending he has a conscience: hope no one is fooled. This is really about #Brexit
DISTRACTION: Iain Duncan Smith gets to resign from problematic government, claim moral high ground and legitimise his Brexit campaign.Win.
IDS resignation theories so far: face value; EU referendum; jumping early; row with Osborne; UC about to go pop; joining Team Boris.
Labour polling ahead, Iain Duncan-Smith resigns, budget 'unfair', EU referendum splitting the party.. The Conservatives are in crisis.
IDS jumped before pushed. Picked best time to hurt Cameron and Osborne. He's left so he can fight harder for Brexit. Things will get nasty
There is also a Brexit dimension to IDS resignation. He felt frozen out over the EU deal by No 10 and sensed he would sacked post referendum
No10 have feared IDS would resign for a few weeks. Tone of his EU attacks too strong ever to serve under Cameron again post referendum...
I'm surprised #IDS is quitting, but can't help feel he was wearing his #Brexit underpants when he wrote that letter.
Agreed, all about EU referendum and aftermath...but still...
So the cynic in me thinks IDS has resigned to position himself on Brexit. Don't trust him at all
Ian Duncan Smith has resigned over pressure to cut benefits.  Bravo - a good stand to make. Hope it's really about that not EU referendum.
Odd. He's done it for six years. What a difference a referendum makes...
At least Iain Duncan Smith will be able to wake up tomorrow with a clear conscience and enjoy a good #brexit. Sorry, I mean breakfast. #IDS
But it's also so nakedly about the EU referendum. IDS's tenure has already seen some truly awful misery inflicted on people #IDS
I simply don't believe in any way whatsoever that IDS would be resigning if it wasn't for the Brexit vote.
Well that has seriously screwed Osbo's leadership bid. It's also done the #Brexit campaign no harm at all
I salute Iain Duncan Smith for resigning over the disability benefit cuts but the bitter EU referendum battle will have been the catalyst.
Iain Duncan Smith's resignation as Work and Pensions Sec leaves him free to speak his mind over #Brexit from back benches.. and he will
Discussing this tomorrow on LBC from 7am: IDS resigns because of his dislike for Osborne, his anger at Budget, his desire for Brexit.
He says PIP reforms go to far .... Was likely he would go post referendum but this timing puts huge spanner in all of govts works -more soon
The fragmentation of the Tory party due to the EU starts early with IDS resigning. Prompted by Budget, but made easy by referendum.

Brexiteers had years - years - to hone common arguments, get lines straight, plan for this referendum. What were they doing all that time?
When those arguing for Brexit, talk about lifting the burden on UK business, they mean scrapping vital workers' rights.
I'm actually less wise about Brexit now, which I suspect wasn't Boris's intention.
The lack of a "Nanny's Day" has long been a source of irritation to many. Post Brexit I may well dedicate my efforts to securing just that.

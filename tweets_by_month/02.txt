I'll be voting to stay in the EU referendum. Overall I think we gain far more from the EU than we lose.And also I'm not a paranoid racist.
It's like England have turned up fur the second half while Scotland was there from the beginning of the game.... #Brexit
Cameron to announce EU referendum date after cabinet meeting
Good to see Alex Salmond giving advice on how to win a referendum.
If you lose the EU referendum will you resign as leader of UKIP............. oh wait - you did that already
Nothing in @David_Cameron EU deal will halt biblical tide of migrants. immigration not minor benefit changes will decide referendum
This ‘special status’ business reminds me of when we allow the kids to be ‘toilet roll monitor’ just to shut them up. #Brexit

Sajid Javid backing IN a blow to the Out campaign. It had hoped that he would help persuade voters that Brexit wouldn't be bad for business
Having spent 40 years demanding a referendum on the EU the Out camp will now accuse Cameron of rushing forward a referendum on the EU.

As a Brit I'd like to apologise for all the time my govt has wasted on this needless EU renegotiation & for the reckless referendum.
Promises : Alex Salmond says you shouldn't believe what some people promise before a referendum. Except oil boom promises.
My take on Cameron's deal & how to argue for Britain to stay in the EU:  #brexit #Bremain @OpenEurope @CER_London
So Scotland, tell us more about how the EU is good for jobs. Go on. Exactly.#Brexit
Alex Salmond on BBC telling us he is "deeply insulted" by referendum timing. What a shock. The SNP seek grievance constantly.

Percentage of our laws deriving from EU obligations is about 15% - not 75%, as the #Brexit brigade pretend.  #Remain
Gove’s support for Brexit might just bring Boris too
Russia's favorite people leading the #Brexit campaign.
Important to remember today the referendum is only going to happen because David Cameron promised it, campaigned for it and delivered it.
I campaigned for an EU referendum after a fundamental renegotiation process. David Cameron has totally failed to deliver latter Vote#Brexit
We, the Commonwealth people, shall stand together. #Brexit

Thats it then . "Renegotiation" over causing barely a ripple on the EU pond so now it's time to choose a side. I choose freedom #Brexit
Now you know the 'deal' that Cameron has come back with, how will you vote in the EU referendum?

How much money is Cameron wasting on this EU referendum? Isn't he always saying we have no money for hospitals and public services?

Scaremongering will be the Nemesis of EU Referendum. I am looking for the POSITIVES. To date they are only manifested by VOTE LEAVE!
Why have @SkyNews got 2 lefty proEU paper reviewers the day after #EU deal. Portraying #Brexit as a party not national issue. Disgraceful.
I'm a British national with a valid passport but I can't vote in the #Brexit referendum.

Brexit could trigger end of European Union, (Sir?) (Self-interest>)@richardbranson claims.

If 53% of voters in England vote in favour of a #Brexit, whatever voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do, it will be irrelevant.

Who do you think you're kidding Mr Cameron? Our parliament is not sovereign that's why I'll be voting for #Brexit
Cameron is selling #EU deal through a message of fear. #Brexit offers a message of optimism, sovereignty and liberty - this is what matters.
No treaty change, no border control, no renegotiation. Have never been so disappointed with the man I voted for last year #VoteLeave #Brexit

BREAKING: Cameron predicts what Britain will look like if we vote for #Brexit. #ProjectFear #HowWillWeCope
@David_Cameron Basically saying we can`t trust the French to honour an agreement - but let`s stay In the EU shackled to them.#Brexit
(3/3)The failed EU immigration policy created the ‘Jungle’ camp at Calais. The idea that #Brexit would reduce border control is preposterous
(1/3) The claim that #Brexit will bring the 'Jungle' camp in Calais to southern England is simply desperate scaremongering
Australia is member of Europol as well as Interpol. Am sure that Brexit UK would still be in. Dave is getting silly.
Let's face it David Cameron the only tent cities Britain has to worry about is from the homeless not refugees swimming here b/c of #Brexit
You didn't vote for this couple! Now's the time to stop them controlling our lives. Vote to LEAVE EU. BREXIT
Ten days ahead of the Brexit summit, here are the main known unknowns in the EU-U.K. talks
French to release giant spiny lobsters to invade & occupy South-East Coast ports if we vote #Brexit, says Cameron
PM should not make irresponsible argument about 'Jungle' in Calais moving to UK if #Brexit -not only fear mongering but stigmatises refugees
Cameron is wrong: Brexit will not somehow shift migrants from Calais to Kent - @DanHannanMEP
There's clearly only 1 way to settle the Tory row about Lady Thatcher's view on #Brexit, & that's to summon her ghost by means of necromancy

The biggest scaremongering lie by Cameron so far "a Brexit could result in migrant camps like the jungle along the south coast" UNBELIEVABLE
To honour Cameron's migrant camp scaremongering, I propose we start referring to the Jungle in Calais as Camp David.#Brexit
Arrogant PM takes us for fools: the immigration crisis is caused by the EU. After #Brexit, & as an island nation, we'll control our borders.
#Biafra-ns calling for 'Scottish-style referendum' - how will the Nigerian government react to these calls?
BREXIT ministers should grow balls and start campaigning.
Brexit will bring the 'Jungle' to southern England, DC warns - There's Lies, Damn Lies, then there's camEUron!

West 'taking great pains' to avert #NATO membership referendum in #Montenegro
Cameron says #Brexit could lead to migrant camps in the South East. But the real risk is staying in the EU. A million in Germany; 75m Turks.

Scottish EU referendum poll:Remain: 44% (-3)Leave: 21% (+3)(via TNS-BMRB / 06 - 25 Jan)Changes from September.
Parts of Cameron's EU deal could be vetoed by the European parliament, even after the referendum. First it was trivial, now it's shaky too.
#Brexit is an opportunity to renew strong relationships with Commonwealth and Anglosphere countries - currently growing faster than Europe
We must see #Brexit as a great opportunity to refocus our economy on global, rather than regional, trade

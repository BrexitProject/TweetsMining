Tomorrow on @ThePledge I will be debating the so called 'divorce bill' from the #EU #Brexit
On @Channel4News. £50bn net #Brexit divorce payment. Why? Stay in #EU, save the money and spend it on #NHS
Question: Why doesn't #Labour have a massive polling lead? Answer: Because of their shameful enabling of #Brexit.
"What do you mean, DON'T mention the war?" #brexit(that last one sent in by @CerneAstro - thank you!)
First the Remainers said we couldn't leave the restaurant without paying our share of the bill, now we've offered to pay our fair share they codemn the cost #MakeUpYourMinds #Brexit
Dear Britain, this time one hundred years ago Ireland was, 'taking back control'. Now, as a sovereign independent state, they are exercising that control. Suck it up! #Brexit 
Nick Watt on #newsnight says UK gov will use carrot and stick w/Ireland. Stick is Dublin isn’t standing up for unionists because it’s anti-#brexit. Hmmm that’ll go down well....
Coming up at 11pm on @TV3Ireland @drumurtransport, @HMcEntee, @RBoydBarrett & @LCreighton talk borders and #Brexit and we’ll go live to @lukeming in Brussels #TonightTV3
My colleague @RoryPalmer has set up a petition to keep Britain in #Erasmus even if we #Brexit:  
Fact of the matter is, if you voted #Brexit, you're never actually going to get what you thought, and your neighbour will still be Polish.
Like father like son?Stanley and Boris are leading remarkably different yet similar lives right now.#ImACeleb / #Brexit 
UK gov will say Dublin is only standing up for nationalists - even though Ni votes remain and polls show no support for leaving CU/SM. Sectarianising NI like this is a very dangerous political strategy. Where’s London’s duty of care? #brexit 
Ignore the new found love from Boyd Barrett on Trade, he & PBP are pro #Brexit 
Anyone remember the £350 million per week promised for the NHS once #Brexit was completed?#DivorceBill 
BREXIT/IRELAND: UK is reportedly planning to devolve powers to Northern Ireland to avoid hard border after #Brexit 
Taxi driver also told me ‘don’t worry about it all love, these things all work out alright in the end, they always do’. Staggering level of complacency Re complexities of #Brexit
.@thetimes cover suggests #Brexit NI deal involves 'no regulatory divergence' on matters including energy... Kind of half way there anyway with Single Electricity Market. Does this mean NI has to stick with EUETS and EU renewables targets etc? #tomorrowspaperstoday
#brexit OK, so now I get it! We pay the €50 million, which is about €1000.00 for each one of us, and that might allow us to try and negotiate a new trade deal which won’t be as good as the one we already have! Is that what we voted for?

See @Channel4News in Clarke’s Bar in Drogheda City tonight chatting about #brexit. Pity they relied on the cliché of trad music. I have never in 25 years heard trad music played in Clarke’s.   Not to mention the cliché of interviewing Irish folk in a pub. expect better from C4 
"So Arlene Foster parrots the British government position about the big bad Irish government interfering. Play to the gallery, the thickos, the bigots." #Brexit #premium
The BBCs role is to inform, educate, entertain. Has @StephenNolan ever chaired an in-depth, knowledgable, calm, rational discussion on the #Brexit implications for NI? As this would require sensible guests, and a well read host, I doubt it very much 
#Brexit will cause █████, ███████ and a lot of ██████.  To mitigate this, the plan is to █████ ███████, ███████ by means of █████ ███, and to prevent the ████ from ██████ ███.  This is the will of ████ ███████.
@thefelonsclub packed tonight for @sinnfeinireland Cúige 'Plus' meeting.Dynamic discussion on political situation north & south and#Brexit 
Interesting. Big question is will the DUP swallow a system which means NI converges more with Ireland and less with rUK? If they want out of the SM and CU, then they have little choice. #Brexit doesn’t look so good now, does it, DUP? #StopBrexit #FinalSay

No One Knows What Britain Is Anymore  #brexit #fbpe

Some commentators need to realise there is no problem with the ‘Irish border’, there’s a problem with the unwanted British border in Ireland. Only long term solution is an end to partition and Irish Unity #Brexit #NolanLive
Because of #Brexit, we have the disgusting spectacle of @LiamFox cosying up to a homicidal maniac in the Philippines and @theresa_may cosying up to a racist and sexual predator POTUS. This is a discredited, amoral government prostituting itself for the sake of trade.

Norway is in the EEA... the UK under their hard line  version of #Brexit would not be... big difference #tonighttv3 P.S. the laughs and smiles of the panelists is a little condescending and adds nothing to the debate
A reminder that ISIS praised Brexit for destabilising 'crusader Europe'.  And we all know that Putin regards attacking the EU as a means for weakening Western democracy and unity. So #Brexit can most definitely be seen as undermining European security.
Rafael Behr (Guardian): "Britain is undergoing the wrong treatment for a fever of discontent. It risks incubating an even more virulent strain of anger." #Brexit

Oh, and what is Norway in? The European Free Trade Association, which the Govt has carelessly ruled out... before we have even got onto the 'trade talks' negotiation phase - where is the logic? #Brexit @EFTA4UK
No wonder they can't draw the border...they probably think there's nothing below the 6 counties. #Ireland #Brexit 
The man who referred to black people as 'piccaninnies' fails to condemn Donald Trump. Who could have guessed...#trump #Brexit 
When discussing #Brexit, it's important to consider all migrants affected and to include the voices of low-paid workers, naturalised EU nationals, dependants - Great discussion 
Agree. Let the EU produce a fully itemised bill that states how much they say the UK owes. They won't do it because the EU doesn't do transparency & accountability. Not surprising since auditors have failed to sign off the EU's accounts from 1994-2016. 22 years in a row! #Brexit 
Gina Miller’s clear and concise commentary on #Brexit is typically spot on!Total shambles from UK @Conservatives @Anna_Soubry Why do we not get this clarity from the shambolic Brexit opposition provided by @UKLabour @Keir_Starmer ?#FBPE

This #Brexit thing. It’s not going to work. Ireland, #EU divorce bill and EU Courts jurisdictions are insurmountable problems given #Tories domestic commitment to a hard #Brexit They’ve blindly negotiated the county into a dead end cul-de-sac.

And @brianbrianquinn has done it again over in @iresimpsonsfans with the best post I've seen all week. #channel4 #Brexit 
Daily, Britain is being humiliated by its crypto-Remainer politicians taking every opportunity to surrender to Brussels. The fabricated #Brexit “divorce bill” is nonsense. Britain does not owe a penny. 
John Redwood MP - The Irish border will not pose a problem even if there is no #Brexit deal. What people fail to understand is that adopting WTO rules would only add a single line to already existing paperwork. No Brexit deal, no problem. 
Priti Patel has attacked Theresa May for being “ill-equipped” for #Brexit negotiations, insisting Brussels should have been told to “sod off” over its ‘divorce bill’ demands.

Good discussion with Chancellor Angela Merkel on state of play of #Brexit negotiations. EU stands united ahead of December European Council 
Keir Starmer explains why Labour's shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott is wrong to call for a second #Brexit referendum. Now perhaps he can explain why she is wrong on everything else.

Take back control. Cancel #Brexit and use the money to fund the NHS, invest in education and skills, new homes. You know, stuff that matters. 
#Brexit has taught me something about the British colonial mentality, which I thought died in the early 20th C. These people are absolutely barking & they're leading this country into annihilation.
I've written a personal piece about how Britain feels to a European resident, post #Brexit. And why I will not be applying for British citizenship. For over a year, I've been told I must try to understand Brexiters' feelings. Will they understand mine?

Today's #brexit bill estimates match those prepared in March 2017. UK's delay seems mainly due to internal party politics, external posturing & media love of a 'conflict story'. 
#Brexit a divorce bill of £50 billion as reported today is not what Leave voters signed up 4. We’ll be in hock to EU 4 years
Problem with parliamentary debate on #Brexit studies is that they all want to keep studies inside Westminster bubble. But we all need to know what the impact of Brexit will be. The #SecretStudies must be published!

Tell me the story again, Uncle @Nigel_Farage about how your gang of useful idiots will march on the streets if #Brexit is stopped... Please!
Good call. Meanwhile, #Brexit is slated to be responsible for spike of #TokenGhetto boys.
Last observation before bed. Reading loads of people in disbelief at how the WM gov. is treating the Irish over #Brexit/borders & I agree it's awful. But it pales in comparison to how they treated Scotland during the #indyref.
#TonightTV3 #RTEPT #PKNT #TodaySOR #Liveline #MorningIreland #BBCR4today #BrexitJust when you thought some UK politicians couldn’t be any more out of touch with reality or had reached peak arrogance, along comes Iain Duncan Smith with this gem...... 
We've resloved the #Brexit border issue: 
On #channel4news this evening, Iain Duncan Smith looked and sounded really rattled on #Brexit - a much diminished figure and voice, sounding like a man who's run out of excuses.
[#Brexit & #RoO] UK-based carmakers: "We won't find enough local parts to qualify for UK's future FTAs". EU-based carmakers: "We will disqualify ourselves if we keep using UK-made engines".

£89bn financial settlement to leave. Insane. How did this happen. Disaster for UK. #Brexit
I'm actually more pissed off with the British people over #Brexit than the shyster politicians and the press. If you read the Sun or Mail you've chosen to eat shit and deserve what you get. It's the rest of us I'm angry for.
Uk to pay a gross financial settlement of £89bn to the EU.What an incredible waste. 254 instalments of Boris Johnson's promised £350m NHS funds post #Brexit
And another... #Brexit 
I’m not so sure. Ireland really want to hold off phase 2 nod into New Year, when expect a raft of v neg business announcements for UK, heaping pressure on May. Reckon rEU likely to support them in this #brexit 
#FBPEMay and Hammond both know that #Brexit will be a disaster yet they continue to press on.There must be an alternative agenda.It will involve money, sex and power.I have never in my 50+ years seen anything as disgraceful as this in government #FBPE #StopBrexit
So no extra money for the NHS or anything else for decades. Confirmation of the lie at the heart of the leave campaign. Those who voted for #Brexit were conned! pic.twitter.com/KVnfg5Ptrv
Time to make the Brexiteers take responsibility for this expensive mess: next Wednesday my amendment (new clause 17) would ensure MPs have to vote specifically to authorise the ‘divorce bill’ £bns. Boris et al should be made to own this debacle #Brexit 
This £40billion government sellout to the EU will unite the British people in disgust  #Brexit
AWOL as usual, - but only when it counts. We need the Remainers to get a collective spine and coalesce around @vincecable and kill off #Brexit. #FBPE @ChukaUmunna @Keir_Starmer @DavidLammy @Anna_Soubry
#Brexit - supported by Trump, Murdoch, Farage, Rothermere, Johnson, Putin, Desmond and other charlatans. You have to be seriously fucking gullible to believe in bastards like these.
“In the referendum that we had just a year ago 70% of Labour held constituencies voted to leave the European Union. This is something that very many people when they encourage Labour to try and scupper Brexit are completely and simply ignoring”#LIVE #Brexit 
We can’t afford #Brexit! 
£55 bn (if it is as low as that for the #Brexit divorce bill) is £350mn per week for 3 years, 1 week and 2 daysAnd that's just the downpaymentReal financial cost will be slowdown in economy announced in the Chancellor's Budget last week. #ThinkAgain
Haha my old friend Martin - a great hack who taught me how to read company accounts - draws by far best border (only one to include Donegal). Some of responses are woeful #brexit 
#brexit is making us poorer. Stop now! #stopbrexit
Pro-science budget is not enough for a #Brexit world. Our President, Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, on why clarity in UK & EU policy must come soon, so science funds can be spent well 
It's all beginning to add up when you start to join the pieces...Farming, Flying, Trading, Banking, Pharmaceuticals, Automotive industry, Fishing, Environment, Health Services, Global Control & Influence, Economic growth. the £ etc...one big #Brexit debacle..best we #StopBrexit.
Watching this & other recent UK declarations on Ireland feels like living with someone for years, knowing everything about them including their grandmother's birthday, only to realise that they still don't even know how you like your tea#brexit  
UK and EU agree #Brexit divorce bill that could reach £57bn. This was about the size of it all along, so all the histrionics have merely trashed goodwill and undermined negotiations without reducing the bill
Ian Duncan Smith tonight accused Ireland of “showboating” over #Brexit because we have a presidential election coming up. There are no words..... Oh, wait, there is one: Eejit
.@FT “Letters” features a rather apt note by Chris Huhne on #Brexit and Ireland’s moral high ground @campaignforleo @simoncoveney
Just saying #Brexit 
What is happening with #Brexit talks? 
The implications and unrest #Brexit will cause on the North South divide has 1 very long overdue solution.End the British Occupation and give Ireland back to the Irish. If the Brit settlers don't like it I'm sure the mainland could accommodate them on Brit soil  #ProblemSolved
Britain and the EU. Well I think the 48% shouldn't be expected to pay any of the £50,000,000,000. Get it from the 52% who were stupid enough to vote for #Brexit.
Adding insult to injury: After being ripped off by the EU for decades, British taxpayers will now be forced to fund a c.€50billion 'divorce bill'  #Brexit
Anyone trying to attribute the blame for the state of the economy solely on #brexit is either being deliberately misleading or has been deliberately misled. Brexit hasn't caused this mess, the government and Cons @Conservatives have. Don't let let them pass the buck. #ToriesOut
#Brexit divorce bill:We started with:Go WhistleThen £18bnThen £40bn-Now £54bnShambolic 
BREAKING: @FT on UK’s #Brexit divorce bill: “Negotiators are working on how to present the settlement as a net estimate, with the UK side pressing for an implied figure of between €40-45bn once UK receipts and other deductions are taken into account”  1/2

What I like about #Brexit is now the rest of Europe can experience  the clueless high-handed nonsense that Scotland has had to put up with for years from Westminster!!
British #Brexit negotiators, ill prepared, unrealistic and outclassed by @MichelBarnier and his team. The EU side were clear on their priorities from the start, the British side have folded on every issue. Give it up @DavidDavisMP
It's Boris & Gove undermining the PM's negotiations, not the #Brexit impact reports which the govt are seeking to cover up. Please RT: 
Britain will not get a #brexit with dignity. We are no longer a great power and will fade into the sad twilight life of has been nations.
OUTRAGEOUS! The so called #BREXIT divorce bill seems to have been agreed by the #Conservative gov’t.... at somewhere between £45 billion & £55 billion of our money! Or around £850 from every man, woman and child in the U.K.!
£100 billion #Brexit divorce bill says @FT plus £billions for contingency planning - the true cost of this shambolic #Brexit policy @Open_Britain
The UK pulls a Full Tsipras. #Brexit #Kolotoumba
"Terms of #Brexit bill agreedFinal figure will be between €45bn & €55bn"This is scandalousWe shouldn't be giving the grasping EU a brass farthing of our hard earned taxesWe should offer a free trade deal & walk away.EU would soon come running.@AMDWaters@ForBritainParty
Good Housekeeping Instutute says #Brexit has pushed up the price of Christmas lunch by 18% compared to last year. No doubt #Leavers will say it's worth it.

Pound soars against the euro on #Brexit divorce Bill agreement.
The OECD have confirmed #Brexit is already damaging our economy. No-one voted to become poorer, and people have the right to keep an open mind on whether leaving the EU is really best for our country. 
Well, well, well the real cost of #Brexit is becoming clear.  Scotland must now consider a different path 
Proceeding with #Brexit without even bothering to examine its impact is the height of #Government irresponsibility
The 'Will of the People' provides a  democratic sounding excuse for delegitimising and suppressing democratic opposition. It is a tool of dictators and demagogues and is absolutely toxic to democracy. #StopBrexit #Brexit 
I hope the British public won’t have the true costs of #Brexit hidden from them by Ministers. Public have a right to know how much it will cost - and the right to think again and change their minds 
What are the odds on the BBC news not mentioning David Davis fudging the #Brexit impact reports and being in contempt of parliament.
EXC: deal-in-principle is done on the #Brexit divorce bill - now Ireland and ECJ to fix ahead of December #EUCO. My latest:
For goodness sake Dan, it is called the Internal Market! You have been a part of it since 1973, setting the rules and standards, together with your European partners. Now you are voluntarily marginalising yourself from the d-m table. Can’t have your cake and eat it too. #brexit
Redacted #Brexit reports spark new tug-of-war with UK parliament 
Secretary Tillerson comments on #Brexit during his remarks at @TheWilsonCenter.

Big FT story coming tonight on the #Brexit divorce bill which will put @BorisJohnson £350m claim in the context it deserves.....
.@Feorlean calls for Brexit analysis to be shared with public and full version to be given to devolved administrations #Brexit 
The tide is turning in favour of @Theresa_May.Following two barnstorming #PMQs in which she wiped the floor with @JeremyCorbyn, Mrs May now appears on the cusp of breaking the deadlock in the EU talks. #Brexit #ImWithMay
The EU has openly and transparently published all its reports. If #Brexit's so great, I for one, want to be adequately prepared for the downpour of milk, honey and unicorns from its bountiful coffers.
UK should be asking for an annual payment FROM the EU for a free trade deal.Can anyone explain the mystery of why the UK Gov is so pathetic over #Brexit?most Tory voters voted to LEAVE.they can't be happy with the supine surrender they are witnessing by their Gov 
Ministers are holding Parliament, and more importantly the British people, in contempt. Voters have a right to know what #Brexit is going to mean for them and their families 
Chaos in parliament over the #Brexit impact studies - and still 7/9 @BBCnews ‘top stories’ are the royal wedding, and *none* on parliament.
.@hayward_katy: Pushing Northern Ireland to decide whether to be closer to Britain or Republic of Ireland "contravenes the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement" #brexit 
Just a THOUGHT !I wonder if the amount we owe the EU in terms of our #Brexit liabilities will feature in #Budget2018 next year ?ANDNo prizes for guessing who will bear the brunt !#JustThinkinAloud innit.
EU DEMANDS extortionate RANSOM money in return for trade talks...Priti Patel: "My views on money are pretty clear, I don't like spending money so I would have told the EU, in particular, to SOD OFF with their excessive financial demands"#Brexit #EU
And there it is. Sinn Fein's not-so-subtle threat of violence if there's any harder NI/RoI border. This is what they mean when they talk about #Brexit damaging the 'peace process'. UK Gov must NOT bow down to Sinn Fein/IRA threats. 
"David Davis" there is no point trying to hide the fact that #Brexit is SHIT. It's quite clear for anyone with a shred of common sense & decency to see that we must stop driving headfirst to economic, social, political, environmental and cultural suicide.#StopBrexit #DavidDavis pic.twitter.com/4UXdkNpEQY
Yes I was quite incredulous at the Minister's total failure to even engage with my question about the seeming absence of #brexit impact assessments for Scottish economy #BrexitImpactReports
#Brexit is proving hugely divisive, but it is also bridging the political divide. Three SW MEPs have united over concerns about Kremlin meddling in the #EUref. We're demanding action. @ClareMoodyMEP @juliegirling
This is just so completely wrong. Ireland are not holding back the #Brexit border issue, it's the UK Government being unable to come up with a solution to its own problem. 
Is this what David Davis is trying to hide? and why has Theresa May not read the #Brexit Impact Reports? 
"We must take back control from those who distorted the result of the EU referendum." #Brexit @MollyMEP
Peter Schrank on the effect #Brexit might have on the border between North and South in Ireland - political cartoon gallery in Putney 
All these impact assessments support the work of the European Parliament. Under the terms of #Article50, the European Parliament must consent to any final UK-EU agreement:  6/6 Ends. #Brexit #EPonBrexit
And the @EP_Environment Committee are holding a workshop on the impact of #Brexit on the #environment, #PublicHealth and #FoodSafety, LIVE now:  5/6 @CharlieBEU @ginny_acha @AdinaValean
The European Parliament also organizes regular Brexit hearings and discussions which you can watch online - @EPInstitutional committee have a workshop today at 3.30pm GMT on the implications of #Brexit for the #IrishBorder. Watch the #livestream:  4/6
The studies on #Brexit also cover other critical topics such as the internal market and #consumerprotection  and #financialservices  3/6
They include studies on the areas in which the European Parliament has set red lines for its approval of any Article 50 deal, such as #citizensrights  & the effect of #Brexit on the #peaceprocess in Northern Ireland  2/6
It’s clear now the Article 50 letter was written without even a basic understanding of the economic implications of #Brexit. There needs to be a stronger word than incompetent. Criminally negligent probably covers it. 
.@jon_bartley was on #skydebate this morning calling for a ratification referendum on the final #Brexit deal. Watch here  
Ireland’s deputy prime minister resigns in a move that is likely to avert a government collapse, snap election that could have threatened #Brexit talks 
Govt must disclose #Brexit Impact Assessments as identified by DD in his evidence to #Brexit Select Committee & determined by Parliament
Great speech by my new @UKLabour colleague @darrenpjones in the Budget debate straight talking on #Brexit 
Doublespeak of which George Orwell might have a grudging admiration: "we have not edited or redacted reports... we have collated information in a way that doesn't include some sensitive material" #brexit 
Shocking that @DavidDavisMP has left it to his junior minister to explain failure to comply with promise to provide #Brexit impact analysis to DExEU Committee
In any case @Keir_Starmer, do you think your voters are hoping when you get hold of hard evidence #brexit is a bad idea @labour can then justify a u-turn towards #remain?
DExEU minister Robin Walker squirming, David Davis absent. They’re doing everything they can to avoid releasing the #Brexit impact statements in full. Even Brexiters are annoyed. If not in contempt of the House, they are in contempt of the people @Labour4EU #FBPE
Viz did this about a year ago. #Brexit #RoyalEngagment
Utterly contemptuous response from Government on #Brexit papers - trying to hide truth from Parliament and the public. @Open_Britain
Urgent Question from @Keir_Starmer on the release of #Brexit Impact Assessments is starting now. Watch 
.@OwenJones84 - I wouldn't trust this government to wash my windows. Do we entrust the future of  this country to Liam Fox David Davis and Boris Johnson?  John Whittingdale couldn't get out the #bbcdp studio fast enough. #Brexit 
Bank of England predicts that under No Deal scenario, the £ and property prices will drop by a third. That is the wonder of a hard #Brexit for you.
‘What a bloody nuisance #Parliament is to the #Tory government these days, when all the Prime Minister wants to do is get on with #Brexit.’ Read and share @Jon_Danzig’s satirical account of Tory rule. Link: 
The EU is doing incredible work in Europe and in the rest of the world. We need to make sure everyone knows this, please do your part. If we’re going to win this we need to combat the negative #Brexit mindset.
I'm delighted to be among this year's @ERC_Research Consolidator Grant awardees, but am deeply concerned for the future of UK science post-#Brexit if this much-needed source of funding becomes inaccessible to us. What has this country done to itself? #ERC #Consolidator
Darren Jones MP...been waiting so long to pick up on a speech in Parliament like this...reporting the direct link because this is so important...direct challenge to #StopBrexit..we need this leadership now...#Brexit harms the UK!!
Increasingly clear that the Government knows how bad #Brexit would be, is intent on concealing the impact, & being driven by fear & political considerations, not the wellbeing of the country. 
Today's Urgent Question from @Keir_Starmer on the release of #Brexit Impact Assessments is expected at 12.30pm. 
Irrespective of one's position on #Brexit or party loyalties there is a case on its face that1) DD lied to Parliament.2) DD acting on behalf of Gov is in contempt of Parliament.If these actions have no consequence then it is a major turning point for UK Democracy.
Russian interference in the #Brexit campaign is not a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory. It happened & it needs to be properly investigated, writes @MollyMEP.
"We should have a ratification referendum on the final #Brexit deal with the option to stay in the EU." @jon_bartley #SkyNews
Another potentially devastating impact of #Brexit. New stats show Britain is 2nd largest beneficiary of EU research funding. Our schools and unis now in peril. 
I went to a restaurant last night. When I asked for the bill in order to leave, the waiter told me I had to work out what I owed. When I told him that was his job, the whole restaurant told me to stop messing around and come up with a figure. #Brexit
One Urgent Question today: @Keir_Starmer - Release of #Brexit Impact Assessments And one statement: @Jeremy_Hunt - Maternity safety strategy
Hi David Davis can we have the #Brexit #SecretReports in full & unredacted please? Otherwise guess @mollymep & @JolyonMaugham will see you in court...
Call me crazy but withholding information on the impact of #brexit from the same public that was given the responsibility for voting for it is a tad conspicuous.
Since the June 2016 referendum, UK GDP has fallen by 1.6% - the equivalent of £300 million per week or *£60 billion* by the end of 2018 #Brexit #economics
#Brexit was always gonna be a cock-up..It'd have been a cock-up in the hands of someone actually competent..You can't polish a turd..#stopbrexit#BrexitGate@dontbrexitfixit@Andrew_Adonis@RemainingKind@spaceangel1964@IanDunt @HardingMike @Keir_Starmer 
It is absolutely clear David Davis is correct to redact his #Brexit reports. Seema Malhotra has already leaked the Davis letter before the committee have sat proving they cannot be trusted not to make political capital with information that could harm UK interests.
Part 65536 in our series "Tweets from Brexiteers that haven't aged at all well" #Brexit #StopBrexit #BrexitWrecksIt
Government must hand over full 58 #Brexit assessments unedited today, simply opting out of parliamentary scrutiny is undemocratic
If the allegations of Russian interference are true, the #Brexit vote would be utterly invalidated, says our @MollyMEP
Important letter by Ambassador @AdrianGONeill in today's @thetimes. Now is the moment for 'creativity, imagination and courage'. #Brexit 
WATCH: on @GMB this morning explaining how it's Boris & Gove undermining the PM's negotiations, not the #Brexit impact reports which the govt are seeking to cover up. Please RT: 
#Brexit Sir Keir Starmer getting on my bloody nerves!!  Talking bollocks everyday trying to derail Brexit. We voted we’re leaving idiot.  
Amazing how many in UK are only just getting to know that Northern Ireland exists & is part of the UK,that there is a separate Irish Republic,that there is a border,that there was war & a peace process, that the Republic remains in the EU & that the border is an issue for #brexit
It’s offensive to be accused that I couldn’t be trusted to act in national interest by colleagues of #Brexit Select committee @BBCr4today
I don't shirk from the challenge but one of the most unfortunate things about #Brexit is the rapid pace with which a government is having to make hugely consequential policy decisions -domestic and foreign- in such a short order. Little room for normal consultation, scrutiny etc.
Very instructive charts that help understand the economics of #brexit 29 charts that explain Brexit 
Mark Carney should have been fired. His hysteria and anti-#Brexit stance is entirely political and everyone knows it. The Bank of England is run by Remoaner Hammond and oh look, more negative claims this morning.
The real ‘moment of truth’ will come when the government is forced to admit how bad #brexit would be for the country. That won’t happen any time soon. But the longer it takes, the worse it will be for them, and for us. #stopbrexit
"I would have told the EU to sod off with their excessive financial demands." And that is why we love @patel4witham #Brexit #TeamTory
A Tory friend describes Hannan as ‘a fool’s idea of a smart person’. Can see why #brexit 
They claim that Brexit is patriotic, but leading Brexiters are tied into transatlantic netwworks of wealth and power corrupting our democracy.#BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #Brexit 
Wednesday's first @theSNP @HouseofCommons debates since #ge17 focus on justice for @WASPI_Campaign women & #EUNationals - let's hope we get cross-party support & force action from Tory UK Government #WASPI #brexit 
Until such time as proven otherwise, it must be assumed that the contents of the 58 impact assessments are so damaging to the British economy that the government dare not publish them. Brexit must therefore be cancelled as it is not in the best interests of our country. #Brexit
The threshold of what's considered acceptable conduct in public office continues to fall. Davis won't resign or be sacked over this, just like Johnson hasn't been over Nazanin Zaghari#Brexit has contributed to this decline. 
Dear @chrisdeerin - we may not agree on everything, or even on much, but on this from today’s Herald we can most certainly agree! #Brexit  1/ 
My piece in today's @theipaper - we don't want a Canada style trade deal, favoured by No 10, for the UK #Brexit 
Why not #StopBrexit and rather than wasting 10s of billions on the lies of #Brexit populism, give people real control over their own lives through education & training.#BrexitBetraysBritain
Its very very simple, #brexit can not be allowed to happen.#Brexit means a hard border between ROI & NI.A hard border between ROI and NI means a high probability of a return to the troubles.A return to the troubles means murders and bombs in NI & mainland UK.#StopBrexit
Reminder to Leavers. Democracy includes the absolutely fundamental right to campaign against any government, majority or policy. Get over it!#StopBrexit #Brexit #BrexitBetraysBritain
People are saying #Brexit can only be reversed if there is a 60/40 split in public opinion in favour of staying in the EU. Even though only a marginal advisory vote was required to take us out.
No, Iain - wrong on both counts,   It is #Brexit which is completely mad and now being seen to be so.  The  border issue is about peace , politics and choices.   The freedom to trade without hinderance is the outcome of those choices if made sensibly . 
If Bristol Council is able to detect me veering even a micron into a bus lane and send me a fine within 48 hours, the technology exists to manage the NI border. #Brexit
Great start to @LiamFox visit to Sydney. Media - tick. Business - tick. @BritishChamber - tick. Upbeat convos on #Brexit &  relations. 
No, the sovereign state of the Republic of Ireland is using its membership of the European Union to help defend its national interests. #brexit
Aye, after all, it couldn’t possibly be the case that they just don’t want their country fucked up by our #brexit bullshit could it? 
Everything you will hear here is WRONG. Unbelievably so. Can someone buy copies of “WTO Negitiations for Dummies”, please. Lots of them. Forget about Ireland, the rest of the WTO would slaughter the UK if it tried this lark #brexit 
#MeghanMarkle is lucky. A successful wedding and she gets the UK citizenship straight away.I'm here since 4 years, might not be able to stay after #Brexit day, not eligible to UK citizenship and a wedding will not help me.I'm just an EU citizen #InLimbo.
Well said, well done #IrishTimes! Britain looks to you and other Irish newspapers to tell the sobering truth about the idiocy that is #Brexit. 
Failure to release #Brexit impact documents “weird on both sides”. A clear example of when strict impartiality rules become ridiculous 
I think that many Remain voters continue to be taken in by the feeling they should accept the democratic mandate of #Brexit and are unaware of the edifice of chicanery and deceit which makes the whole thing into a mockery of democracy.#StopBrexit
Sorry Sammy, the Irish are the EU & we're clear we want detail on the future of relations on this island as the we agreed #brexit negotiation timeline 
It’s gotten so daft, @simoncoveney, who is doing a v good job in Foreign Affairs, sacrificing #Brexit strength for party politics.
Politicians think to the next election. Statesmen and women to the next generation. We're lacking in the latter #GE17ِ #cblive #brexit
Leo Varadkar hasn't walked to the edge of a cliff... Britain walked itself into a crisis of its own making & is now trying to blame the Irish government #brexit

With each day that passes the impossibility of #Brexit becomes clearer, except to the @Conservatives Government and @UKLabour Opposition, apparently. Meanwhile the clock is ticking #StopBrexit #FBPE
Neither Govt nor Official Opposition have the solution to UK's #Brexit problem. The first wants to drive us off the Brexit cliff. The second wants to drive us off the cliff and hover for 2 years before also  crashing to the ground. We need a vote on the deal & an exit from Brexit
Dear #EU please accept our charityI enclose cheque for £40bn as agreedYou will notice it's post-dated March 30, 2019 & will bounce without a free-trade agreement as I mentioned on telephone.Sorry you find yourselves in such dire need of our help#Brexit
Where's the Bremorse?Two tribes dig in#Brexit #EU
For those looking for #Brexit prophecy @DanielJHannan provides a rich source of amusement. He was literally wrong on everything
Well done @Channel4News & @mattfrei who had to resort to kindergarten graphics tonight to explain the #brexit border problem to the multitude of people who just don’t seem to get it 
Great to see @fotoole on @Channel4News explaining clearly that the #EU27 are rock solid on the  Irish border question & have been from outset. Not just an issue for Irish Govt #brexit
Seems to me the 48% are not represented in the commons. Given the chaos #Brexit is becoming how many of 52% would still vote the same way now? #brexitshambles
If I were a Brexiter, I’d want the impact studies published in full, to show the sheer glory of #Brexit shining out against the evils of Project Fear.
Rome, once a mighty empire, is now just a city in Italy.  The UK needs to get over itself.#Brexit
Keep rocking the leaking #Brexit boat. At some point it will sink without trace and the UK can start tackling its real problems. #StopBrexit
David Davis must release the 58 sectoral reports for all to see.  We will not let him get away with redactions made for 'commercial reasons'.  What is he trying to hide? Everyone is entitled to an accurate description of the impact of #Brexit .

Here is the list of the 58 sectors covered in the #Brexit papers handed over to MPs by the Government tonight. The papers - numbering 1,000 pages - could be published as early as tomorrow. 
Parliamentary scrutiny being treated as an optional extra by a Government which treats our democracy with utter contempt. #Brexit 
this #brexit tweet has aged well. #IrishBorder
The biggest #brexit misconception made by Brexiteers is that "Remoaners" are working with the "elite" against the poor. We are doing quite the opposite. We dislike such capitalism derived abuse as much as you.
Nov.27 Gina Miller, Founding Partner SCM Direct, on #Bloomberg discusses the Brexit process and why she says the British government isn't being straight with the British public Also @vincecable says 1 in 5 chance #Brexit wont happen ...
It is the Govt that has decided on the course of #Brexit, not the British ppl. If we can't have our cake and eat it, as Leave leaders promised, then Britain can reconsider what's best for our future. Democracy demands the option to change course 
They told us that #Brexit would help the #NHS, but in fact #BrexitReality (if we go ahead with it) will be somewhat different.

EU are USELESS at trade deals.The EU is holding the UK back.After #Brexit the UK will boom cos we will be free to make trade deals with all the major economies in the world.And we can stop paying tariffs on non-EU imports.Cost of living will be down 8%
BREAKING: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are going to distract you so Theresa May’s shower of fools can press on with their #Brexit idiocy.
Fitting that a border the British forced on Ireland when trying to escape their empire is becoming the obstacle stopping them leaving EU. #Brexit
Spotted the #EU flag flying at Addenbrooke's Hopsital lunchtime today...a reminder that Cambridge knows #Brexit is a grave mistake! #StopBrexit
RT It’s 40mins into #Bbcdp & torygirl @Jo_Coburn has started her DAILY attack on @UKLabour & @jeremycorbyn but wouldn’t dream of airing this #Brexit & Tory scandal #Bbcdp @BBCNews #WATO #r4today #Newsnight #Bbcpapers
The shocking anti-Irish/"Eire" sentiments on the right of British politics that have suddenly surfaced. Any chance they were always there? #Brexit
The *public* should have been given unedited copies of the Impact Studies *before* we triggered Article 50. #Brexit 
6) And then there’s #Brexit. That threatens everything - and forcing the UK out of Single Market and Customs’ Union won’t help build a ‘Britain fit for the future’, indeed it threatens our economy for years to come. 
#Brexit suspense-o-meter ticks up another notch: "None of the parties – neither the European Union nor London – are happy as the negotiations have not made the expected progress," says President @KerstiKaljulaid of Estonia, which currently leads EU meetings.
#Brexit CONDITIONAL- Accept NEW EU rules with NO say!Nigel Farage “Here's another set of unreasonable demands from Barnier making no deal seem more attractive#EU clearly not interested in genuine negotiations.It’s better for us to walk away & save time"
That's always been the intention of #Brexit Ultras - they want to destroy the EU. Putin loves it - anything to divide the western alliance.
So much for #Brexit making the UK Parliament sovereign again. Obviously only when it suits #UKGov.
Much of the perceptive, informative and significant coverage of #Brexit is being written by Irish journalists these days. Putting many UK hacks to shame. 
The right wing Brexiiters would sooner have people killed by a resumption of the troubles than give up their hard #Brexit #tax haven. #StopBrexit
Utterly contemptible.  #Brexit has become a nasty & vindictive affair, with nasty vindictive views going unchallenged, much less the flat out lies 
Someone say something about the #RoyalEngagement being timed so as to help take the focus off #Brexit and that it’s all just another shape-shifting lizard conspiracy 
At 12:30, I will be speaking about #Brexit at the #EP office in Edinburgh (@EP_Edinburgh )
Finally a book for all the #nomads: with the current redefinition of sovereignty (#Brexit; #Catalonia; "rebel cities") and #migration (refugee  crisis; climate change) it's worth rethinking what the #State and #citizenship could mean in our near future.
Jean Monnet was a founder of the EU. He is no friend of ours. He says to disguise political integration with economic measures that can be disguised. Hence the Euro and the political union imposed on us.And the people? Well they don't matter!#Brexit #Ukip #EU #Labour #Swindon
Since when should the democ right to change minds, & reverse #Brexit if the Will switches, be prevented on the basis that some ppl will become violent? Surely if a maj now want to #StopBrexit Brexit must be stopped? After all only 37%of the electorate wanted it in the 1st place.
Nothing quite like a #RoyalWedding to distract the population from thinking about #Brexit, austerity, welfare cuts, food banks, local government spending freeze, a housing crisis, looming environmental disaster, continued selling of arms to Saudi Arabia etc...But hey, day off. 
VOLUNTEERS REQUIRED!Help @Open_Britain engage with people in communities across the UK as part of the 9th December action day to raise awarnes of the dangers #Brexit poses to the #NHSFollow the link to sign-up at an event near you: Please RT
I genuinely congratulate Prince Harry & Meghan on the wonderful news of their engagement. I also hope that Meghan won't have difficulty with her visa situation unlike many In Britain right now married to 3rd country nationals. There you are @IanDunt a #Brexit royal wedding angle
I think we've now reached the stage where #Brexit has to be an utter disaster to reassure Leavers that it has actually happened. Any attempts to mitigate its effects will be greeted as a sell-out.
This is what state funded and directed propaganda really looks like... Will need more than this though to insulate from the forthcoming calamitous #Brexit that's on its way.  
Over 3 million EU citizens have lived in the UK for many years + over one million Brits live in Europe - WE ARE EUROPE, alive + kicking!We live in Europe + we lived in peace - until Brexit came along. Now #Brexit also threatens the stability in Northern Ireland. Europe=peace!
EU Committee writes to @michaelgove, asking for more information on how he plans to address the post-#Brexit environmental #governancegap: 
If we could just stick to the facts, the #Brexit mess the UK has imposed on Ireland, would be hard enough to sort out. Sadly, some British voices either don’t know the facts, or distort them. As here. 
Wonder how long it will take for the brain cells of HMG to collectively realise that the only workable solutions to the NI border issue is, either to stay in the SM and CU, or to cancel #Brexit and stay in the EU.
We do not want to see a hardening of the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The UK must come up with detailed solution to the Irish border question. #Brexit 
Irish PM Leo Varadkar has EVERY right to be worried 1) ECONOMY2) SECURITY is damaged by #Brexit MORE than any other CountryIt’s NOT “blackmail” it’s SURVIVALThese ”5” obfuscate the issues#Brexiteers
Who were these West Coast American astrophysicists, and who paid them? #Brexit 
BBC could keep 20 researchers researching #Brexit dark money for cost of one #r4today John Humphrys. Instead #Humphrys trousers £650K for what? And @PeterKGeoghegan breaks stories in his spare time
#Brexit was not a "revolt against the global elite".It was a con trick promoted by liars, crooks and cheats. They cared not a toss for the electoral laws that protect our democracy.And they were bankrolled by the very wealthiest of that global elite. 
She actually should be in UKIP or the DUP - her views are closer to both of those parties. Not just her views on the issue of #brexit.
#Brexit would be a disaster whoever was in charge. Parliament can & should go against an advisory referendum. Saying they can't is like saying you agree with mob rule. This is exactly the reason we have a parliamentary democracy.
Leading private equity firm says it is likely to ditch UK as top investment destination because of #Brexit. Founder describes the data behind this decision as "mindbogglingly obvious". #StopBrexit
#r4today Kate Hoey giving classic example of leavers' ostrich approach to #brexit: there's no problem and if it there is, it's everybody else's fault except the UK. No recognition of the disaster she and her chums have created.
The issue of the Irish border screams out the dangerous idiocy of #Brexit and its potential to break up the UK. Remainers called it out and Brexiters called it part of "Project Fear" The Idiocracy is Ascendant!
50 years ago to this day, Charles De Gaulle said for the second time that he would veto the UK's application to join the European Economic Community. He also accused Britain of "a deep-seated hostility" towards European construction. #Brexit 
EU27 consultations. Good meeting in Tallinn w. President @KerstiKaljulaid. Thks to the Estonian Presidency & #eu2017.ee teams. United we stand! #Brexit 
It’s now clear that May can only get the Brexit she wants by throwing more of our money at it. The UK cannot afford #Brexit. We are much better off remaining in the EU #StopBrexit #FBPE
It is a Member state. Work your EU laws. Ifeel sorry for the english to have such low level MEP...but i understand where #Brexit come from
Ignorance of Irish history means #Brexit talks will not end well 
WRONG. Not about bureaucrats not "communicating."It's about absence of representative government.That's why #BREXIT & @realDonaldTrump.
20% chance it won't happen? Not good enough. After all the deceit & political incompetence to achieve a #Brexit which costs more for even less return, based on the supposed Will of 37% of the electorate in a non-binding vote, we need 100% certainty it won't happen! #StopBrexit!!
#BrexitPromise. Make Britain great again- £350M /week to NHSReality- WTO rules- NI leaves UK- Spain takes Gibraltar- Scotland stays in EU leaves UK- Trident rehoused in Devon (too dangerous for Portsmouth)- United Kingdom of England (and Wales?) tries to be world power
#Brexit 800 years of genocide, wars, famine, starvation and troubles. The legacy remains written in stone, word and memory  but not in deed since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. And now in their blind madness the #Brexiteers repeat the errors of the past and re-engender war.
Some ultra-wealthy backers of #Brexit made an even quicker killing - not least hedge fund manager Crispin Odey. 
Agree. It’s what #Brexit is founded on. We once had an Empire let’s free ourselves from the time of the EU and once more sail the seas in our power & glory. Utterly ignorant of reality, of the Global world in 2017.
Mess up the Ireland/NI issue and #Holyhead / #Anglesey / #Wales will pay dearly. Another #Brexit mess that we warned about.
The last thing #Ireland will ever do is be bullied or browbeaten by a London GovernmentWhy would they?They’ve come through centuries of hell to escape London’s mailed fist#Brexit
less than 40% of the electorate vote for #Brexit. In previous referenda the 40% bar was necessary for a mandate, it wasn't applied in the EU referendum because it was ADVISORY ONLY. There is no mandate for #Brexit
Britain just really doesnt give a fiddlers how Brexit will effect us in Ireland.The English Tories have got themselves into an unholy mess by their incompetence & ineptitude & we're all meant to suffer as a consequenceDon't think so! #Brexit
18 months after #Brexit referendum, #Ireland & border finally on UK front pages - 2 weeks before EU summit.
Northern Remainers - your country needs you! Next Saturday 2 Dec join @albawhitewolf as she takes a picturesque trans-Pennine train journey from #Sheffield to #Manchester to spread the word about stopping #Brexit. The BBC will be filming the trip so let’s make it huge! 
So Ireland relies on UK for its existence! We Irish could teach UK all about sovereignty. Our knowledge & expertise comes from having had our own sovereignty denied by a nasty violent nationalist (imperialist) neighbour for many centuries. #Brexit  
#Brexit won’t happen. Here’s what I think (& hope!):.@Conservatives will end up with ‘no deal’. .@UKLabour have said they would reject ‘no deal’.We have a GE with @jeremycorbyn offering a second referendum. He wins by a landslide, referendum happens fast & Brexit is stopped.
Attenborough comes out hard remain. Game over. May unilaterally calls off brexit. Leavers shrug in agreement. We all go back to cat videos. #fbpe #BluePlanet2 #brexit #stopBrexit
To all the  folks suddenly  shocked by UKs attitude to Ireland re #Brexit You do all know the UK at highest level is still covering up its role in arming paramilitaries, and refusing truth and justice to families of innocent it's army murdered. But yeah, some rude tweets..
ICYMI: I got annoyed w/Uk media coverage of Ireland today and did a wee thread #brexit 
Appears to be a significant #Brexit poll by @QUBelfast researchers, finding unionists support post-Brexit border controls at the Irish Sea, despite DUP opposition:
The DUP yesterday told world N Ireland ‘wanted’ the opposite of this. Increasingly looks like the dreary steeples of Fermanagh and Tyrone is where #brexit rhetoric will hit reality 
Score One for the Experts as #Brexit Costs Grow 
Speed at which media are coming out to bat for Legatum is remarkable. I wrote this earlier today. Features almost no Russia but raises questions about access, influence and #brexit 
For those who thought the racism of the #Brexit referendum campaign was bad enough...now begins the hate against Ireland & the Irish. People like @GerardBattenMEP really do want the 19th century back
The EU is still an oasis of peace in an increasingly unstable world. We can help keep it this way by ditching #Brexit.
Keep talking like this and you may find Ireland will be a bigger country and the UK a smaller country than you ever dreamed before #BrexitYour bravado is foolhardy and unconvincing 
Already 26% of people who voted for #Brexit believe they were duped by the Leave campaign:  via @LondonEconomic
The BBC always wants to blame things on #Brexit. I’m not saying this is a conspiracy, I’m saying it is a fact of life. 
The government is now thinking about selling #Britain out to the #European Court of Justice after #Brexit. An independent, sovereign country should not submit to unaccountable foreign #judges - this would be a huge and unacceptable betrayal! @theresa_may?
Job losses. Thousands and thousands of them.Did you vote for that?#Brexit #StopBrexit #StopBrexitHour #ExitBrexit #FBPE
#DUP lost #Brexit referendum in Six Cos & political unionist majority in north has ended...No veto, No authority!#SpecialDesignatedStatus
If patriotism means loving your country & wanting its best, I plead guilty. As a UK citizen, I believe #Brexit will damage us irretrievably. 
ICYMI: here’s my interview with Irish govt on why they’re preparing to veto #Brexit talks 
The @LibDems have written to @theresa_may calling on her sack Chris Heaton-Harris who wrote to #universities asking for the names of those who teach courses on #Brexit and the content of their lectures.

A clear, balanced, deeply worrying must-read piece from my colleague @Lewis_goodall #ireland #Brexit 
More shocking revelations about how the Vote Leave campaign in #Brexit referendum didn’t just tell lies but also broke the rules.  What will be the consequences?
I don't regret voting Leave. In fact, I'm proud to be a #Brexit Leaver and no amount of political objections, economical pessimism, EU threats, media bias, Remoaner whingeing or personal abuse would ever make me change my mind.  
Wise words, from a British perspective, on #Brexit and us: “The Good Friday Agreement has been almost too successful: it has allowed us to put Northern Ireland’s troubles in a box marked ‘history’.” 
Boris Johnson & Michael Gove, #Brexit is far from simple. Costs of your cavalier approach could be huge #StopBrexit
NI voted to remain. Then DUP promised a #Brexit deal recognising "the reality of our geography and of our history". Now DUP blocks NI deal? 
Be nice to the Irish, Gerard, you will need us in a few years to rescue you from bankruptcy, brought on by your suicidal #brexit.
I suspect, given that #Brexit is turning toxic, Mrs May would be glad of the chance to re-run the referendum, this time stipulating a super majority being needed to trigger leaving. 
The PM does NOT believe in *sharing* - remember she didn't want to involve Parliament in #Brexit discussions until the Courts overruled her ! 
Dear young remainers. The original vote was sold to us a trading agreement. Nothing else. Over the years it has morphed into an unelected body that controls every aspect of our lives. We were duped. That's why I voted out.#Brexit
Hard Brexiters can't complain; they should have thought long and hard about the importance of Britain's EU membership to peace in Ireland before trying to foist hard #Brexit on Britain and the rest of the EU.#StopBrexit /2
As usual Liam Fox is trying to mislead us. It's simple, Britain has to agree that a final trade settlement will impose no hard border in Ireland, but that does almost certainly mean staying in the Customs Union & Single Market.#StopBrexit #Brexit /1
This week I talk to a dumb animal (Tim), and a lovely clever little doggy. #AnimalRights #Brexit #Tories #FakeNewsMedia
1. Most nations require a super majority for constitutional change. They are right. 51% winner takes all is simply not good enough. Virtually the same amount of people said no as did yes. #FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit
"Votes for #Brexit were influenced by lies, deciet and false promises."Which voting process anywhere in the world, anytime in history wasn't?We voted out. We want out. Get over it and help us build Great Britain.
I believe #Brexit could be stopped if we offered the EU, say, Lincolnshire and Morrissey by way of an apology. We could even throw in James Corden for free. A small sacrifice.
Only 37% of voters c.26% of the UK Public actively voted 4 Leave/#Brexit in a legally non-binding test of public opinion...what followed incl. the decision 2 make it mandatory & deny all right 2 a #FinalSay + #StopBrexit option is pure politics. Not heard 1 MP say this..amazing.
So many reasons to abandon #Brexit, all of them enough on their own.The liesThe financial cheatingThe GerrymanderingThe fact it was an advisory referendum and MPs have not voted to leave.......and much more.When will May stop it or quit? 
Voted against a 3 line Whip on Monday for Britain to stay in the #CustomsUnion which would eg solve the #NIreland #Brexit #nightmare
#Brexit: Liam Fox says no deal on Irish border until the end of trade negotiations with the EU - Contradicting the agreed negotiating schedule agreed between the UK and EU. 
Irresponsible for politicians  like Owen Paterson to suggest Irish border can be solved with technology alone. Issue also about regulatory harmonisation, security, stopping smuggling etc #brexit politicians are undermining our economy and good relations with our neighbours #bbcsp
Agreed. Would listening back to Paterson on #wato. A very level, magnanimous Irish politician faced w/raised voice and nonsense statements. This is how #brexit looks from Ireland 
#Clueless & #DELUDED @vincecable thinks the public should have a say on whether or not we leave the corrupt #EU. We already have! Vince, I have something to tell you mate...    #VinceCable #Libdems #BBC #BREXIT #SKY #TORY #UK
Owen paterson talking nonsense on #brexit and Ireland on radio 4. Goodwill plus electronic invoices will solve the issue. He sounds like a madman
My late dad worked 40 years on an assembly line making tin cans-at night because the night  shift paid more money and he was our sole provider. So, yeah, I get why people voted #Leave. And why folks voted #Trump,too.But they made a mistake. #Brexit -and Trump-is against THEM. 
Alex Deane - "We were told we would trigger a recession and go into economic meltdown if we voted to leave but face it, the dire predictions that some people want to be true simply are not true." #Brexit 
After #Brexit, #Israel senses a chance to boost #trade with #UK. It is hard to sell fruit into the #EU, but when #Britain leaves it could become a big market for #Israeli agriculture and for its burgeoning cyber-industries   #BBC #SKY #ITV #TORY #NEWS #EU
‘There are perfectly sensible technical solutions to the Irish border’ can someone tell me what they are ... anyone? #SundayPoliticsNI #Brexit
The #BBC, subtly helping Ireland exploit #Brexit to advance the cause of a united Ireland.It hates NI's Unionists b/c they are:(1) small-c conservative;(2) religious;(3) patriotic; &(4) supporting a Tory Govt.
If the crew of a ship knew it was being captained by someone knowingly steering it to disaster, it would rightly mutiny. Time for the UK population to mutiny over #Brexit.
This's what #Brexit means no? 2 keep sovereignty, control openness, transparency, honesty accountability, good govt, human rights, freedom to go anywhere, border control for others, cake & eat it?Oh..no..sorry..that's what membership of the EU gives... 
I got angry - again - w/UK media's vacuous coverage of Ireland and #Brexit so done a thread. There's a big problem than just colonial mindsets in this....

Sick and tired of journalists and politicians saying EU budget is a lot of money. It is only 1% of UK government budget and outweighed ten times by the economic damage of #brexit in terms of lost export markets and inflation caused by lower pound  @pestononsunday

Excellent thread on #Legatum from Liam Byrne. If you care about our democracy you should care about this. #brexit 
Hold on: #Brexit will cost £350m a week? That's not what @BorisJohnson and @michaelgove told us
Sorry Remainers. I know you’re just gagging for it all to go horribly wrong but... #Brexit 
Now remind me, wasn't #Brexit something to do with preventing foreign powers from interfering with our democracy? 
#Brexit will cost Britain £72 billion in lost economic activity annually, according to an analysis of government figures.  
The irony of this palaver is it’s the best illustration ever of a country’s increased strength through pooled sovereignty (Ireland’s) and the weakness of going it alone #Brexitِ

Thanks to everyone who participated in the #Leeds for Europe Day of Action yesterday. Great discussion about impact of #Brexit on science, research & innovation. Powerful contributions from @mikegalsworthy @LindaMcAvanMEP & @Vie_Promo & an engaged audience of passionate people.
More evidence accruing - both on data, messaging and personnel - that @vote_leave and @LeaveEUOfficial illegally colluded during the #Brexit campaign. Meanwhile Banks et al try to distract us by being rude about Hannan.
And fellow citizens, don't forget that £600,000 of tax payers money was given to @vote_leave to fund the xenophobic, mendacious campaign led by Boris Johnson, Michael Gove, Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott #Brexit 
When the topic turns to #Brexit, the usual response on BBC is to big up Europe, but put down the UK.@ajcdeane takes none of that & rattles off facts, like a Browning of old.
If #Resistance is #Deza because Russia is pushing it to sow chaos, surely #Brexit is #Deza because Russia is pushing it to weaken Europe. 
Remoaners need to get over #Brexit and stop spreading rubbish about Russian 'fake news'. Let's not forget the £9m government booklet telling people to stay in, the 2 day extension of voter registration, BBC bias & Cameron/Osborne/Clegg 'project fear'. 
It's actually quite inconceivable that the #brexit vote was not influenced given what we now know about #US presidential election.

Are skilled people leaving the UK because of #Brexit?I met a lovely British family today, who are looking to relocate to Germany or Denmark. They feel UK is no longer a good place to bring up their childern, and Brexit has exposed a nasty side of British society.
If @jeremycorbyn is finally coming round to seeing sense and opposing #Brexit, he may yet win my support. I hope @pollytoynbee has it right.
Would you vote differently to last time if the #EUREF was to be held again? #Brexit #EUPlease RETWEET POLL after you vote for a larger sample.
The simple truth is if you handled your responsibilities at work with the same arrogant incompetence as Theresa May has handled #brexit, you'd be sacked without severance.
Everybody accepts - including DUP privately - that there must be a fudge, that #brexit for NI will be different than rest of UK. So why keep using hardline language? Makes climbdown *much* harder

A great #Brexit context fact from Ivan Rogers in @prospect_uk
The UK is free to agree trade deals, free to protect its interests. It is NOT entitled to walk away from the Good Friday Agreement, and NOT entitled to silence when its actions threaten a neighbour and friend  #brexit 
The only logical conclusion from the following tweet is that MPs charged with enacting #Brexit are too stupid to even understand it let alone find the best policy solutions.

So the Brexiters' Empire 2.0 plan isn't going too well then!It must be the fault of Australia and New Zealand as it can't be the fault of #Brexit as for a Brexiter it's never their fault.We need to #exitfrombrexit
Excellent thread on a very important question - why hasn’t @ElectoralCommUK confirmed whether or not they know who gave @duponline £435k for #brexit? 
UK Brexit Use these tags its follow back Saturday. We can stop this thing#FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit 
A little noted feature of the #EURef was the asymmetry of the consequences. A narrow #Remain win would have left open the chance to push for another referendum. But, #Brexit once implemented would have irreversible consequences.A super-majority clause was necessary.#StopBrexit
New reports that intelligence services fear wholesale Russian interference in #Brexit - we need a US-style judge-led enquiry NOW! 
Something for the weekend, Sir/Madam? Why not allow yourself to be 'kimbelled' by following @RedHotSquirrel ? Think of it as a warm massage of stimulating & diverse facts to power your day. As used & recommended by the #Brexit Facts4EU Team  
#FBPEThis, from the Govt’s own Office for Budget Responsibility #Brexit will COST  £72BILLION in lost GDP by 2021.Let. That. Sink. In.#BrexitIsCriminal#STOPBrexit #Remain
#BREXIT will hurt Brussels more than the UK, a German MEP has admitted in a crushing blow to supposed European Union solidarity.
Had the #EURef electoral franchise included EU 27 nationals & 16-17 year olds as in the Scottish 2014 referendum, #Remain would have won. So far from being based on the 'Will of the People' #Brexit is based on the government's choice of who was allowed to vote.#StopBrexit /1
Prof. Patrick Minford - "We don’t have to agree to any divorce bill at all. It’s astonishing that the EU is so inflexible about the negotiations." #Brexit 
Excellent thread from @JolyonMaugham on even more trouble possibly in the offing for the Electoral Commission re EURef funding. And thus for #Brexit.#StopBrexit
Oh wow! It looks as if @EUflagmafia have struck in #Leeds today. Perhaps it is a show of support for our Day of Action including our public meeting at 3pm with @mikegalsworthy #Brexit 
#Brexit is going to be a godsend for anyone who wants to be cut off from the world – just ask Gibraltar 
Interesting, #Brexit supporter & ex Tory MP @LouiseMensch says Referendum legitimacy may be undermined by extent of Kremlin meddling
“I am convinced the Commission just wants to show every exit will be punished. The pragmatic solution would be to immediately replace Mr Barnier with a much more generous negotiator.” Says @JTP07 Czech MEPGive that man a meddle! #Brexit
Further evidence of the insanity of #Brexit: 
I think the best way to take on the Tories & stop austerity is to stop #Brexit I'll be saying that at Labour Against Brexit's lunchtime meeting at #Lablon17 with @IvanaBartoletti of @labour4europe @seemamahotra1 @heidi_mp & Terry Maher of @Labour4EU @LondonLabour
Also makes the case @UKLabour will inevitably become more anti #Brexit. Hope you’re right Robert @Peston
If the Brits are dumb enough for #Brexit they might be dumb enough to Take Trump for Murray. 
The UK has had long enough to realise that this farce of a negotiation must end now. The #EU makes demands. It dictates. It doesn’t negotiate. The narrow margin by which I voted #Brexit is now a very firm resolve. We must prepare to greet the world instead of wasting our time.

Multiple sources with links to UK intelligence say Theresa May will be warned the #Brexit referendum was so corrupted by Russian money and influence as not to be 'free and fair' 
EXCLUSIVE: #Brexit May Need to Be Redone 
Desperate to block #Brexit at any price liberals in the British media have stopped pretending they are impartial on the subject and are waging an open war against the very idea of Britain leaving the EU. The concepts of free speech and free press are dumped unceremoniously.
‘Don’t fall for it!’Barnier’s strategy to "squeeze" UK for CASH“It's good to see Barnier backtracking on what was already a rather ill-advised suggestion.The EU will always try to use time pressure to squeeze UK & we shouldn't fall for it”#Brexit #EU

Stanley Johnson says to @kezdugdale we must talk about #Brexit & Labour Party policy on it. She says yes maybe you could explain it to me  #TeamKez #ImACelebrity
Right. Strap in. Contraversial words coming. I am not in full support of Jeremy Corbyn. He has undermined his voters, and his euroskepticism has been mistaken for virtuous stoicism. He has, by supporting #brexit, made his promises untenable.
Tomorrow's news:The English football team quits FIFA and demands to play in the World Cup while fielding 12 players and not being tied down by the offside rule. FIFA says no!Howls of "FIFA punishing England!"#StopBrexit #Brexit

Potential switch from integrated EU market to fierce competition with US causing alarm. #Brexit makes no sense! 
Dear @DavidDavisMP, you have so far shown no sign of intending to comply with the demand for the 58 sector studies for #brexit. Is it your intention NOT to comply? Please explain why anyone would NOT find you in contempt of Parliament? #FBPE
By giving relatively little coverage to #Brexit, the @BBCNews gives an impression that it's going on more smoothly and is subject to fewer problems than is actually the case. It's a form of pro-#Brexit bias by neglect.

Young Labour party members & supporters need to understand that if there's a hard #Brexit, Britain will be forced to become something not far short of a tax haven economy, just to survive. It will be the end of all Labour stands for. That's why the Tory Right want it.#StopBrexit
Brexit Hurts: In the year following the referendum, almost 10,000 European health care professionals quit the N.H.S. (I go there less for work, but the pound’s #Brexit plunge makes London a cheaper destination. Photo: leaving National Gallery) 
As Theresa May said herself 18 years ago, "we want to be in Europe, not run by Europe".We're not leaving #Europe because of #Brexit; we're leaving the anti-democratic union. 
EU often blamed for failure to conclude trade deal with india. Fact is UK led by then home office minister May torpedoed EU progress because she wouldn't allow Indian immigrants. So no prospect of a UK #brexit trade deal with India. EU without UK might get a deal #brexitshambles
The UK's former ambassador to the EU is certain: There will be no final trade deal before #Brexit 
 #Christmas time is coming and we need to tell our #European friends how we feel about #Brexit  I've collected 1000 letters from YOU GUYS and i'm delivering them to #Brussels  Please support the project if you can
Sufficient progress in #Brexit talks at December #EUCO is possible. But still a huge challenge.We need to see progress from UK within 10 days on all issues, including on Ireland.
#brexit in all its glory, the government can spend £billions on the #brexitshambles but when it comes to pay for victims of terror than suddenly there is no money. @theresa_may should resign forthwith @BrexitBin @timfarron @ThatTimWalker
You don't need a PHD in geopolitics to figure out that Brexit serves Putin's interests. Same goes for the election of a man-baby as the President of the United States and stirring up problems in Germany to undermine Merkel. #Brexit #Trump
If there's clear evidence that Russia put hard cash into #Brexit the #EUReferendum should be declared illegitimate and rerun. In particular, the source of #AaronBanks millions must be closely examined.

#Brexit: So Leave lied throughout? They committed a criminal offence by overspending? The state broadcaster's political journalists were helping it? The Russians funded it? They had 1000's of bots working for it, it was an advisory ref & we are going ahead with it? 
I am getting increasingly frustrated with #Remain voters who now accept #Brexit as inevitable. Taking bad policy and pretending it can be made into good policy when all the evidence points the other way is wrong, weak and dangerous. Bad policy must always be called out.
UKIP collaborator and political ignoramous @KateHoeyMP holds up Swiss border as a shining example FOR #Brexit without realising Switzerland is part of Schengen, and accepts new EU laws and has freedom of movement and immigration.  Why is she there? 
#brexit is making you poorer #brexitshambles Public opinion is being reshaped by the cost of Brexit

The Sun is reporting that the PM is now backing regulatory divergence with the EU after #Brexit - our members are totally clear, this would be a disaster for #ukmfg who see regs and standards as badges of authenticity, conformity, safety, etc.
Housing shortage even though we are building more. Schools full despite low birth rate. NHS under pressure, hard to get a doctors appointment. Unemployment and low wages despite more jobs created. If only there was something to link them together? #Brexit #FridayFeeling

I do hope you’re right @pollytoynbee. Corbyn needs to give an interview and spell out his position on #Brexit.

An offer in the offing on #Brexit bill - but the issue of the Northern Irish border - has anyone figured out how to solve that yet? #EUCO
“We are leaving the EU, we are not leaving Europe” is as cynical as “Brexit means Brexit” is dishonest. #Brexit also means we're strengthening #Russia & #China thus weakening the #EU (& we expect the EU to give us favoured treatment?!). Our collective GB arrogance beggars belief.
I’ll believe it when our opposition party provides some actual opposition to #Brexit. Labour’s actions in the past week haven’t exactly filled me with optimism.

There are lessons from today’s European Capital of Culture stuff for other #Brexit issues.The UK has made no solid commitment to Erasmus *either*.If EU then says OK, no more Erasmus for UK as UK is not paying for it, is everyone then going to scream “evil EU!”?
“Hi, I’m John Glen. No, not that one. I proudly support my government and its extreme #Brexit, even though I’m completely unaware of the consequences of doing so.”
If the UK had said - from sometime around when Art 50 was triggered - that UK govt will contribute to EU Capitals of Culture, whatever form of #Brexit, we’d not have today’s mess.UK government didn’t do that.
Notable how, for last 24hrs, Labour-Remainer MPs been disingenuously comparing #Brexit £3bn w/ £2.8bn for #NHS in #Budget2017.But omitting to mention that £2.8bn is £2.8bn on top of the £110bn already committed to the #NHS....

Nothing says snowflake more than leaving in a huff, then complaining b'cos you can't play anymore. #brexit 
Disagree with the reporting on European Capital of Culture. The story should be 'Britain choses to leave EU competition in line with British #Brexit plans. HMG neglects to inform regional bidding cities' etc 
No the Crazy Decision is following this ridiculous charade of #Brexit it needs to be cancelled NOW.
We’ve chosen to diminish ourselves, to hide away, to pull up the drawbridge, to pretend we’re ‘better’ than Johnny Foreigner. We have to own that. #Brexit
Just heard @Rosiemillard on @BBCPM  say the EU is throwing its toys out of the pram in cancelling UK bids for #EuropeanCapitalofCulture . What in the name of Farage does she think the #Brexit vote was?
Rather disappointed by @hilarybennmp’s attitude over the European Capital of Culture. It was inevitable. That’s the #Brexit that Labour’s backing.

Thanks @Conservatives & @UKLabour for #brexit- the nation is literally indebted to you because of this.The Institute for Fiscal Studies says:"Workers are facing the worst squeeze on pay since the mid-19th century""Workers are facing two lost decades without earnings growth" pic.twitter.com/TIRc6Y5fee
The leaked #Irish report has it spot on : the UK government’s approach to #Brexit is ‘chaotic' 
Few things personify the ignorance that drives #Brexit as the ignorance of a UK Member of European Parliament (DUP) not knowing that EU, EEA or Candidate-Country status is required to have a city name "European Capital of Culture". 
As UK loses eligibility to host European Capital of Culture, government announces formation of new team to plan new #Brexit Capital of Culture. 
‘EU reg 445/2014/EU says that only members of the EEA & countries which are cands to join EU can participate.’ Cake/eat unstuck again. Damn #Brexit 
My timeline is filling up with #brexit folk absolutely enraged that UK no longer allowed to compete for "European capital of culture" in 2023. What a strange psychological universe these people inhabit. Literally incredible

Today at FMQS I asked the First Minister @NicolaSturgeon about the collapse of Dundee’s European City of Culture bid due to #brexit. 
My @Twitter feed is full with a great cross section of #StopBrexit campaigners from @Conservatives @UKLabour @LibDems @Greens and no party at all. Many like me quit their own parties in disgust.Jo Cox was correct because we all have #MoreInCommon #Brexit 
Sky news, it would be intreresting for you to read the eleigibility criteria to be EU capital of culture: -EU countries-Candidates to join the EU-EFTA/EEA countries. As one of the many concrete consequences of #Brexit -29 March 2019- UK cannot host the EU Capital of Culture
"Chaos in the Conservative government, with ministers and civil servants unable to agree a coherent policy on #Brexit."So says Irish Dept of Foreign Affairs in new report. #brexitshambles
Out-of-touch #liberal luvvie #PalomaFaith calls #Leave #voters "#criminals" and suggests they are "guilty as hell" in new anti-#Brexit song. RT to let her know you don't regret your decision and you'd vote Leave again! #BREXIT @theresa_may @Conservatives #Conservatives #BBC #SKY
The @Europarl_EN fully backs @campaignforleo & the Irish people over their #Brexit concerns. Essential the Good Friday Agreement is safeguarded in all its parts & peace process protected. 
When asked by LibDem MP Tom Brake to address EU leaders' concerns about Tory handling of #Brexit, Andrea Leadsom told him “stop talking the country down," echoing May to Corbyn. This cynical, undemocratic line - that criticism of the govt is unpatriotic - exposes paucity of ideas
Those rules were adopted in 2014, with UK voting for them. I thought #brexit meant Brexit? Honestly, there’s no pleasing some people.

The Leader of the House accuses me of pessimism over #Brexit. Has she spoken to business leaders in sectors as varied as automotive, hospitality and meat processing? If she had, she'd know I am realist.
BREAKING: Dundee's dream of being the European Capital of Culture is over - because of #Brexit. 
Brussels says European Capital of Culture can’t be in the UK.  European Commission says #Brexit vote means a British city can’t be awarded the title in 2023.  Bothered?
Dundee has just had its bid for European Capital of Culture rejected because of #Brexit. Looks like all UK cities are now officially off the list.
The @EU_Commission says the UK cannot host the European Capital of Culture post-Brexit and calls for the 2023 bidding process to be discontinued. We call on both the UK and the EU to redress this as soon as possible.  #Brexit
I’m very pleased to see this out #brexit 
Rebate, Rebate, what Rebate!Brussels plan to keep £4.5 BILLION of UK’s fee rebateEU are Blackmailers & Extortionists - now common Thieves!So glad we're Leaving EU#Brexit #EU
Never forget the #Tories are the most ruthless cynical party machine capable of an extraordinary ability to cling on to power & over #Brexit Labour fundamentally do not have clear Blue water..both are 4 Leave & a denial of a democratic #FinalSay & neither for SM or CU.#StopBrexit
Dundee's European City of Culture bid disqualified due to #Brexit, which Dundee & all of Scotland voted against. Another lost opportunity. 
Just putting this out there: according to @resfoundation wages don’t return to 2007 levels until 2025. Puts #Brexit, the emergence of political extremes and general disillusion with the entire system in context #Budget2017
What’s going to be interesting is when the realisation dawns Russia has played all sides on all fronts, from #Indyref, to #Brexit, to #Trump, to #Catalonia. Infesting the social networks on every side of the debates (e.g. from #Maga to #Resist) to drive wedges and gather intel.
UK faces longest fall in living standards since records began. So rather than try to keep immigrants out, maybe we should expel the politicians and press owners and editors who have lied and cheated their way to creating this disaster.#StopBrexit #Brexit

Extraordinary, revelatory article from @JolyonMaugham - thank you. Massive implications for the legality of #brexit result surely?  
Are the UK Govt planning to abandon their promises to Gibraltar? Could this explain their mealy mouthed response to Spanish state repression in Catalonia & their retreat from commitment to principle of self determination? #Brexit 
“Are you sure these square wheels are a good idea?”“Square wheels were the will of some people, so that’s what everyone will get!”#r4today #Brexit #Budget2017
Office of Budget Responsibility confirms our economy is slowing and standards of living are being squeezed further as a result of #Brexit. Nobody voted Leave to become poorer.  Govt's incompetence is truly shocking.
Remainer Phil's money for #Brexit assistance (excl admin) shows he's not serious. EU will never take a "no deal, we're walking away" seriously. Read: 
Decent English people? Decent English people don’t support the xenophobia that #Brexit has unleashed. Decent English people   support freedom  & travel. Decent English people don’t damage their children’s future. Decent English people fight the undemocratic coup & #StopBrexit
‘That Brexit preparations will cost the taxpayer more than the promised extra cash for the NHS underlines just what a wasteful and exhausting exercise leaving the EU will be’ @guardian editorial End #Brexit!
“Far from receiving extra money, today’s #budget revealed that the Government will actually be spending less money on the #NHS than it will waste on #Brexit” 
Time to call it. #Brexit is insane and needs to be stopped. #r4today
As Greens we don't fetishise growth and think that much of the 'national product' is pointless or destructive. But this graph of declining growth, largely as a result of #Brexit, shows what a disaster leaving the EU will be in conventional economic terms pic.twitter.com/as2Cqw7AWZ
My dear sons Sorry about the loss of freedom of movement in 27 countries, your massive uni debt, the 7% going nowhere, no chance of a home of your own, 0-hours contracts & the tanking economy.Sorry about the dying planet.(but er, a railcard?) Love, Mum #brexit #budget2017
Still no #Brexit impact assessment papers. How are the  government; and the opposition for that matter, taking meaningful and considered decisions about the future of an entire nation, without understanding the consequences?
To be clear: The @Conservatives can find 1bn to pay off the DUP and 3bn in preparation for its own failure to secure a #Brexit deal. But no extra pay for our teachers and only a paltry 350m all winter for the #NHS.It's the "Fund our own balls-ups" strategy.
Remember all those young Brits the Brexiteers want to train up in supersonic time in order to replace the EU citizens set to leave the UK due to #Brexit? Looks like we'll have a shortage of people to train them.
The real irony of #Brexit is that by the time it actually happens everyone who voted for it will likely be dead...#ThursdayThoughts
Failure of British diplomacy is leaving #Gibraltar vulnerable after #Brexit. Spanish government source said Britain had consistently misinterpreted Spain’s position: “Almost as if we speak a different language.”
Clearly not. Expect for exceptions such as  #BREXIT and #TRUMPtrain.
This is one of the people forming the views of the group Corbyn belongs to. If you hold out hope Corbyn will start opposing #brexit - find out about Milne - then have a good long think about it.#StopBrexit 
My loyalty is to the country before any political party. #Brexit is wrecking the country, therefore I will support any party that campaigns to stop it. 
When #Brexit happens, the political elite will use that as an excuse to destroy and sell off what's left, then they will be free to squirrel even more money offshore. Democracy will truly end and you will be owned #NHS
The reason it's an "unexpected roadblock" is because Brexiteers didn't give a toss about Northern Ireland during the campaign #Brexit  via @WSJ
Just wanted 2 say "thank you" 2everyone who's joined my Twitter feed recently. I hope you find what I post useful, interesting &  even funny. I've seen so many good people in my Twittersphere since joining post #EUref - fighting #Brexit & #Corbyn We will prevail! #StopBrexit
Not only can my dog feel pain, he can sense and understand when I’m in pain better than anyone the #dwp employs for health assessments. #brexit #AnimalSentience @CarolineLucas 
Here's the thing we learned from #BRexit. Expert economists don't have a clue how to predict the economy. They still don't, but #Newsnight still assumes they do.
Let me get that straight. £3 Billion expenses for #Brexit and only £2.8 Billion for the NHS. Weren't we promised 350 Million a week?? Plus unicorns.Ok, we've all had a good laugh about how gullible we are, can we now stop the charade and #Remain please.
It is perhaps unfortunate, but there is no more place for a middle ground on #Brexit. Either you stand alongside the Tory right lusting after a tax haven or you oppose them and fight to #StopBrexit. It is time for @jeremycorbyn and Labour to choose where they stand.
Interesting that #Brexiters still adamant #Brexit vote must not be undermined by so called "remoaners", but unconcerned that it may have been undermined by electoral fraud and Russian interference. Patriots?
So Corbyn accepts a referendum result built on a mountain of lies & hate peddled by Murdoch, Dacre, Desmond et al. And he denies the British people the right to vote on the final deal. Another politician betraying Britain.#StopBrexit #Brexit
Northern Ireland local official: “If a bor­der re-emerges, some young peo­ple in our com­mu­nity will be for the U.K., oth­ers will be for a United Ire­land and they will blame each other. This will cre­ate a prob­lem where we didn’t have one.” #brexit 
Calling all #Tories - if you like the Chancellor's Budget statement today, just think how turbo charged the U.K. economy would be if we simply reversed #Brexit. Plus we could spend the £3bn extra funding for Brexit on the NHS! Now that would be a plan!
If implemented, your White Paper/ 'Scotland's Future' would certainly have destroyed the UK. As an elected British politician up to the FM to make the very best of #Brexit rather than running UK's efforts down.

Are you happy about #Tory government committing more on #Brexit than #NHS in #Budget2017?Please RT to increase sample
I did speak to a #Brexit supporter today. Elderly woman. Turns out she hopes that immigration will drop after Brexit. Conveniently forgot about the #Commonwealth which includes 1B people in India. So I asked - who's going to fund your retirement?
The voices of Irish border communities where #brexit is real life speak about silent hurt and building bridges without "over-egging their true level of worry"How Brexit looms over the Irish border: 
#Leave has become a farce. Spending more on #Brexit than the #NHS - where did that come from? Who voted for that? Nobody I know who's sane and willing to stick their head above the parapet.
The Government's lack of #Brexit plan showed in #Budget2017 | Prof @D_Blanchflower sees a minority government on its last legs 
I just heard that the Brits will have to pay £40BILLION in order to leave the EU!!!That's even worse than Paul Mc Cartneys divorce bill.So, here's a little something to all you Brits who voted in favour of #Brexit 
Just been with a multi-millionaire businessman involved in manufacturing.  He is now helping a Luxembourg company, 2 German, and a Swiss co. relocate to the #UK for manufacturing because they believe opportunities will be greater here after #Brexit because of our worldwide links.
Some in the #Conservative gov’t apparently saying “we can’t start preparations [for #BREXIT] on the basis of ‘No Deal’ as that would undermine our obligation of ‘sincere co-operation’ with the EU. @_HenryBolton says “If you don’t, you are undermining our country! Sort it out!”
Spain's position on #Brexit: Fully back @EU_CommissionOrderly withdrawal in stages  Citizens are first priority Reach fair financial agreement  No EU-UK agreement on Gibraltar without Spain-UK agreement first
So, in last General Election many  voted @UKLabour to avoid a hard #BrexitNow what?#StopBrexit  but how?
Labour MP Jonathan Reynolds says #Budget2017 shows the government “spending more freezing alcohol duty than fixing universal credit, and more on #Brexit than on the NHS” 
So far #Brexit has cost us £700m.#PhillipHammond is expecting it to cost another £3bn.WHERE IS THAT MONEY FOR THE #NHS?#Leave campaign was funded by tax dodgers because the #EU was clamping down on #tax havens.#Brexit is the BIGGEST CON ever perpetrated on the British public.
Are you baffled by Corbyn's stance on #Brexit? You should look at Corbyn's stance on Putin's aggression in Ukraine, his silence about Assad & Putin's war crimes in Syria & his appearances on Russian ally Iran's TV.Then ask again why he supports Brexit.#StopBrexit.
No £350m extra per week for the NHS over the forecast period (up to 2021/2022) which continues well beyond the scheduled #Brexit date. £2.8bn for the NHS but £3bn for Brexit. #NewBrexitFacts
Are the government deliberately concealing the 58 #Brexit impact assessments until this weeks round of votes are in the bag? That would have to be some form of offence surely @JolyonMaugham
.@ChukaUmunna on #skynews: The driver of poor economic news in the budget is #Brexit...There is no sign of the promised £350 million a week for the NHS. Brexit is going to cost money, when the leavers told us it would save money
Secret doc FCO 30/1048 kept truth about #EU from British for 30 yrs.Govt kept British public in dark about what EEC membership means predicting would take 30 yrs for voters to realise what was happening & then too late to leave.Never too late #Brexit
False @carolecadwalla - Robert Mercer has been under investigation by MI5 and MI6 for his role in #Brexit since late 2015. 
With @MichelBarnier to prepare for my meeting on #Brexit with PM @theresa_may on Friday.
So #Budget sets more money aside for the #CostOfBrexit than for the desperately needed extra money for the #NHS (not to mention the lower tax take due to #Brexit induced lower growth) 
If you want an illustration of the austerity that #Brexit will create - just look at the Treasury’s own figures predicting a collapse in revenues available for our public services. We can still prevent this! 
A clean #Brexit means returning- The Supreme Court to London, not Luxembourg under the ECJ- Full control over our own borders so WE can decide whom we let in- The power to negotiate our own trade treaties with #EU and beyond& all that means having to leave the Customs Union.
Missed #Budget2017? Here are the key announcements:  £3bn to prepare for #Brexit £2.8bn for the NHS in England, including £350m now  Stamp duty scrapped for some first-time buyers  £500m for AI, 5G and broadbandRead more: 
While economic growth accelerates across the EU, it is falling in the UK. When will most Leavers realise they've been lied to and cheated by the greedy lying Brexit leaders who are thinking only of their #Brexit tax haven!#StopBrexit.
When will people wake up to truth #Brexit is about sweeping away all rights & protections standing in way of profit? 
I see the magic money tree is now being harvested for #Brexit. Another £3 Billion flushed down the crapper to keep the right wing Tory paymasters happy. No doubt the poor, weak and disabled will see more cuts to pay for it.  Has there ever been a more morally corrupt government?
The NHS now has just £350 million to see it through the winter, rather than the £350 million a week it was promised by the Leave campaign  #Brexit #Budget #NHS

Dark shadow cast by #Brexit over Chancellor’s #Budget2017 with massive downgrade for growth, deficit lingering past 2022, productivity revised down and revenues for vital public services cut by £20bn by 2021.
So we know, as if we didn’t already, that growth will be clobbered by #Brexit. Remind me - why are we doing this? #StopTheMadness #StopBrexit
Are you optimistic or pessimistic about when the UK leave the European Union? @theresa_may @jeremycorbyn #PMQs #brexit RETWEET & VOTE  #YourVoiceMatters
£2.8bn for #NHS over 3 years. So govt spending more on #Brexit no deal prep (£3bn) than NHS; and that’s b4 we get onto divorce bill

Chancellor has admitted today that #Brexit will already cost the UK £3 billion. That wasn't on the side of any bus. Costs still growing.
Chancellor dodges ending public sector pay freeze and fully funding a public sector pay rise. Remember, this decade the worst in 210 years for wage growth. Coupled of course with increasing household costs from #brexit inflation.
May: "New immigration rules will take account of the needs of the British economy." #PMQs #BrexitHere's a reminder of what the British economy needs. #1daywithoutus #weareinternational
Well worth reading by anyone outside Northern Ireland who wonders how #Brexit could wreck much of what the Good Friday Agreement achieved, and why facile talk about electronic monitoring of goods etc avoids a deeply serious problem. 
The freezing of duty on alcohol means that it'll be cheaper to get drunk and ignore #brexit in 2019#Budget2017
Whilst I welcome any money going into schools it’s totally out of touch with what the issues are facing our education system. It doesn’t even paper over the cracks. Where is the bold plan for Britain post #brexit
The dashboard is flashing red and the government wants us to ignore it #Brexit 
British Chancellor says "economy continues to grow" Didn't say that it is among lowest growth in G7. Economic growth in North at 1% — & forecast to slow further! Economic growth in South of Ireland above 4%. Austerity (& #Brexit)  counterproductive. #ToryDUPAusterity #Budget2017
£350 million a week for the NHS? Nope - another £3 billion of taxpayers' money poured down the #Brexit drain #Budget2017
Yup - I did hear it right - no red bus £350 million for the NHS... instead a #Brexit BILL for £3 BILLION!!! #Budget2017 @Open_Britain
#Budget2017  £3bn allocated to #Brexit preparations in addtion to existing funds. "We are embracing change not running from it as do #Labour"

Expect a budget that pays lip service to the marvellous opportunities of #Brexit - the reality is an unfolding economic calamity. My thoughts on #Budget2017 for @HuffPost  #Budget2017 #BrexitReality
Seems @realDonaldTrump is looking out for America whilst @theresa_may is screwing #Brexit and the UK! Oh for a strong leader instead we have an appeaser in May.
Successful people make mistakes, but they quickly recognize them and change course. Failures shut their eyes and plough blindly on. #Brexit is a mistake. Let's be like the successful and #StopBrexit!
“sir” Edward Leigh & “sir” Bill Cash waxing eloquent about “real human rights” in #Brexit debate today whilst preparing to vote to destroy actual protection for every UK citizen.  Mad or Bad ? Doesn’t matter - result will be the same & it is one that Scotland never voted for.
Sums up the cult of Brexit very well, they don’t know why they want it but they want it at literally all costs.  These people shouldn’t be indulged, post enlightenment, people like this should be ignored and ridiculed, otherwise you end up wrecking the country on a whim. #Brexit 
I’m wondering why UK citizens aren’t demonstrating on the streets by nowIt’s not just #BrexitIt’s the sheer incompetence and outright lies of @Conservatives Government/@UKLabour opposition & media alike We’re “embarrassed” by itWhy aren’t we raging mad?
If the government thought Ireland would be an ally in #Brexit talks, they clearly didn't reckon on a shrewd operator like Leo Varadkar.
I despair at the #UK gov & @theresa_may. They've had since 24 June 2016 to get  this right. Massive support behind them if they'd done so, which they didn't. You do not waver publicly in the face of an opponent. But they have not merely wavered, they've capitulated! #BBC #BREXIT 
I'm sorry you find true democracy tiresome...personally when the future of my country's at stake & #Brexit is proving to be the most stupid policy decision in decades already inflicting harm I can't take the same position. Non-binding 37% of electorate..enough justification. 
Never forget. This man created #Brexit chaos because of an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all his mates (and f***ed off) 
.@guardian covering @IanBlackfordMP's letter to Jeremy Corbyn asking why his front bench abstained on one of his MPs own amendments, which would have helped protect the UK's place in the customs union. #Brexit 
NHS England might lose all EU nurses by June 2021. Read more about my research here @The3Million #Brexit #nhs
Does anyone know if its legal for Govt to hand over taxes raised in UK to a foreign Govt without any concrete independent verification that the monies are owed? #UKIP #Brexit #Leave
£5bn to settle legally binding obligations, possibly £10bn when all said & done. But £40bn? Without any justification for doing so, other than to feed the FAILING #EU so we can talk about post-#Brexit #FreeTRADE? The #PM @theresa_may is fleecing the #UK #taxpayer to pay a BRIBE!
The Sun has called Irish PM Leo Varadkar a "#Brexit buffoon" and told him to "shut his gob". A sure sign he's put together a shrewd argument against Brexit.
A student just did the maths on #Brexit and #NHS staffing that the government won’t do. The situation is dire. My #exclusive - must-read and please share.
Such a perfect summary, I had to do a gif. #Brexit #CarefulNow
The fact every single pupil in this school thinks #Brexit is a bad idea just proves how biased our Pro #EU indoctrinated #schools are & how they brainwash #British children on a daily basis into thinking that #BRITAIN simply is not good ENOUGH! SAD! You are Shameful @ChukaUmunna!
You know there's still a part of me that doesn't really believe the UK will be so fucking stupid as to actually go ahead with #Brexit
#EasyJet profits plunge due to weak pound. Airline must be majority owned by EU nationals to keep operating in EU after #Brexit 
Isn't it odd that @BorisJohnson and @theresa_may aren't acknowledging Russia's hand in #Brexit vote, asks @BenPBradshaw.
More neoliberal rubbish. The govt can always afford to fund its public services. #Brexit 
May's alienation of EU27 and her arrogant disregard for the #IrishBorder question means she is doomed to fail. #Brexit 
How much should Britain pay to the EU as a divorce bill? #brexitRETWEET & VOTE  #YourVoiceMatters
incase you missed it - Labour made sure #SNP attempts to stop a hard #Brexit were outvoted last night, enabling the Tories to recklessly drag us out the customs union 
ARE WE JUST GOING TO ACCEPT THAT THE 58 DETAILED BREXIT IMPACT ASSESSMENT REPORTS NEVER EXISTED? WHY IS NO ONE RAISING THIS? #brexit #StopBrexit
MPs are debating the details of the #EUWithdrawalBill today. We will be fighting every step of the way to ensure that leaving the EU doesn’t mean losing our rights, and we hope you’ll be right there with us.  #Brexit
This article by @OwenPaterson is bang on. Singapore, an island with no natural resources used to be poorer than us. Now it’s people live to 85 and are twice as rich. We can be the next Singapore #Brexit #nodeal
Every morning I wake and think #Brexit is a bad nightmare. Then the harsh realisation hits me - it’s real
What hypocrisy of Corbyn ordering the whipping of Labour MP’s to support the Tories on #Brexit , this from a pitiful man who voted against the Blair Labour government over 530 Times. He has no credibility whatsoever. We need shut ASAP.
It appears the sun is setting on the Brexiteers dream of Empire 2.0 before it has even risen as we hear the UK has lost its seat on the International Court of Justice for the first time since 1946 #FCO #Brexit

"The Charter is already part of UK law" - @joannaccherry. Scrapping our rights would undermine the Government's plan to provide certainty with a smooth #Brexit transition 
“The Charter has added a lot. Why are we getting rid of something that has done no harm?” - Ken Clarke MP asks the Government to protect our rights after #Brexit 
For how long will we allow the establishment to ignore the millions of British People opposing #Brexit ?
If you want someone who understands #Brexit even less than David Davis, let me introduce you to Arlene Foster...
.@DavidDavisMP said it wouldn't happen, but London loses two agencies to Amsterdam and Paris post-#Brexit: 
Of course PM May's £36bn offer is not enough. The aim is to humiliate the UK, and scare others so they do not leave EU. Therefore, no reasonable amount will be accepted. #Brexit
Thank you @mikefarb1 for your tenacious insistance on truth.The current attacks on democracy are unbearable.Stay strong, we're behind you. #unhackthevote The #Brexit referendum was hacked, too.We need a world of #Resistance
Hey fishermen & farmers of Moray, Douglas Ross (Con MP) voted against staying in the Customs Union last night. He's the guy you voted to replace @AngusRobertson. Unreal. #Brexit
UK firms are being 'excluded' from space contracts because of Brexit.Although the European Space Agency is not an EU body, many of the contracts, including Galileo, are EU funded and so require EU membership.#StopBrexit #Brexit
Naturally what UK does after #Brexit is of interest to EU, if UK wants to trade with EU. That means UK must respect EU trading rules. If UK wants to be a low regulation, low wage, low standards partner there will be no deal. Simple really. Nothing to do with Hitler either 
#StorepBrexit #BrexitPoll:Do you believe that without ECJ jurisdiction, the rights and status of EU nationals in the UK would be safeguarded?
#Brexit excludes British companies from bidding for space contracts - It’s a requirement that the companies that participate and get funding for their contracts are part of an EU country. More self inflicted damage! 
If someone owed me a tenner, but they offered me a fiver to settle the debt, before going on to offer me the tenner, I'd wonder why they were taking the piss if they had the tenner in the first place. I know what I mean anyway. #Brexit
The fact every single pupil thinks #Brexit is a bad idea just proves how biased our schools are. And why are politicians like @ChukaUmunna so proud that their supporters are ignorant children rather than pensioners – aka actual adults with experience working, paying taxes, etc.?
The Irish in the Republic had no vote in Brexit ...those living in Northern Ireland voted to stay in Europe...what part of this #Brexit problem did the Irish create?
So long as nobody else upsets him by posting this every time he dares tweet about #Brexit... 
EU law will no longer apply in the UK in 2019. With 80 % of current animal welfare legislation coming from EU, #Brexit could be a backwards step for animal welfare. Crueller conditions may apply to farmed animals. PETITION to stop this now: @RSPCA_official

One stunning but simple example of how #TrumpRussia #Brexit works Billionaire Robert Mercer is using Putin's lawyers to try to silence the Guardian 
#Tory Brexiters are urging @Theresa_May ‘to exploit #Merkel’s crisis.’ They don’t get it. The #EU27 are resolved in their handling of #Brexit. That’s not going to change whoever is the government of #Germany. Share @Jon_Danzig’s report: 
We've begun legal proceedings against the govt. Everyone has a right to see the #Brexit impact studies - in their entirety. 
We urgently need trade transparency: “Trade affects every area of our lives - that’s why this campaign is so important,” says @CarolineLucas #TradeBill #Brexit 
Noteworthy that outspoken antiwar campaigner Corbyn has struggled to make even a squeak of protest about Assad & Putin's mass war crimes in Syria, while justifying Putin's aggression against Ukraine. No surprise then that Corbyn backs #Brexit!#StopBrexit
To be clear, I don’t oppose Labour’s hard-#Brexit policy because it’s too left wing. I oppose it because it’s fundamentally right wing.
Our politicians must not be allowed to pay the bribes demanded by Brussels  #Brexit
Data shows that trade with the South is more important for the North's workforce (167,175 employees) than trade with Britain for the norths workforce (150,791 employees) #UnitedIrelandEconomy#Brexit#UnityRef
oops David Davis shows us #brexit BY TRIPPING off the stage #janeygodleyvoiceover
As a STAUNCH *remainer* I reluctantly accepted the results of #EuRef.I have TRIED to take a mature & balanced approach.BUT I have yet to hear a coherent & EVIDENCED argument in favour of #Brexit.Just confusion-chaos & mayhem !
.@DavidDavisMP summing up #Brexit negotiations so far.  
David Davis just fell off stage after #Brexit speech & it's a perfect metaphor for this Governments #EU negotiations.
Worth remembering that British net favourability to EU membership changed little throughout the period of 'mass immigration' (post 1997). UK had already become sceptical of desirability of post-Maastricht, post-ERM Europe #brexit 
So why did Labour vote with the Tories last night for a hard #Brexit putting the peace agreement at risk?It’s dangerous myopia from Westminster. #Brexishambles
UK patients amongst 1st to benefit from new drugs bcos we had European Medicines Agency. Move to Amsterdam means pharma investment at risk, slower access to innovative medicines, & loss of 1000 high quality jobs #Brexit 
As a responsible government it's right we make "every plan for every eventuality" - @DavidDavisMP on #Brexit 
UK #Brexit minister Davis: It is possible we won't get a deal with the EU. More: 
Thank you @MichelBarnier for meeting with @The3Million and @BritishInEurope to discuss how we can truly safeguard #CitizensRights at this crunch time in the #Brexit negotiations 
Best deal for Britain is best deal for Germany - says @HansOlafHenkel at #dealornodeal conference. Says 20% drop off in car sales since #Brexit vote. Uk no longer Germany’s number 1 trading partner 
Watch live: EU Committee hearing evidence on #Brexit and Court of Justice of EU from former @SupremeCourtUK and #ECJ judges:

Although this is nonsense, @JamesCleverly, & shows just how out of touch/deluded @Conservatives are.Brexit ref. happened BEFORE GE. @UKLabour ran on a clear message of SUPPORTING the referendum result NOT stopping #Brexit.I voted Corbyn for many reasons. Tories don’t get it! 
Animals can feel pain and have emotions - some even stronger than the ones we feel. Please sign the petition to reverse the vote to remove animal sentience after #Brexit 
MPs who believe in freedom, fairness and standing up for their constituents’ rights should vote to keep the Charter of Fundamental Rights today - our joint statement on the #Brexit Withdrawal Bill with @AmnestyUK @unisontweets @publiclawprojct
During the Scottish Independence referendum campaign we talked of our desire to reach out to the world. #Brexit is becoming about UK closing doors to the rest of the world #contrast
Rapporteurs on #Brexit: The Netherlands must be pepared for there being no agreement with the United Kingdom #UK after Brexit. Report by Dutch MPs @A_Mulder, @PieterOmtzigt and @KeesVee: 
@BritishVets are continuing to lobby government on the need to enshrine the principle of #AnimalSentience in UK legislation following #ExitFromTheEU #Brexit  #AnimalWelfare #sentience
Nigel Farage: 'Demands made by unelected people in Brussels are frankly wholly unreasonable.If Theresa May agrees to pay 60bn euros as our parting shot from EU don’t think conservative grassroots would put up with it & frankly nor should they'#Brexit #EU
Excellent from @IanDunt demolishing the fringe left arguments for a hard #Brexit

"Britain's banks will start moving staff abroad early next year because of #Brexit"-@BrexitWeird that eurosceptic  #Tories, who've been pushing for an exit for 4 decades, have no Plan in place.Just like GOPs in the USA.
The public are becoming aware of Putin's intervention on #Brexit vote. But just as important, probably more important, is the role of Trump backer, Breitbart and Cambridge Analytica owner, hedge fund billionaire Robert MercerAnother blow to national sovereignty 
Really disappointed to see Midlothian MP @DaniRowley abstain on this crucial #brexit amendment in customs union. Not representative of how Midlothian voted. 
So the @UKLabour left hand doesn’t know what the far left hand is doing. No plan, no clue over #Brexit. What a #LabourShambles.
Very interesting report on #Brexit from a left Eurosceptic position
Just 12% of MPs Vote to Stay In Customs Union. Staying in the EU Customs Union is not #Brexit.It’s good to see an overwhelming Commons majority now agrees. #Remoaners are forever demanding Parliament has its say – well Parliament has spoken…
Really good to meet Michel Barnier this morning. EU citizens didn’t get a say in the referendum yet they have the most to lose #Brexit @MichelBarnier @SebDance
UK: MPs have voted in #Brexit Bill 'that animals cannot feel pain or emotions' This defies scientific knowledge & gives legal legitimacy to the abuse of animals in circuses, farms, sport, zoos & medical laboratories. SHAMEFUL!  @AnimalAid @AnimalEquality
So when @BenPBradshaw @ChrisLeslieMP are the majority of Labour MPs going to do something about the front-bench position on #brexit ?If you can't change it or even influence it, leave on mass & remove Corbyn's status as leader of the opposition. 
#Brexit Can we get some politicians with a BACKBONE sort out Brexit!!! Absolutely useless all of them Conservatives & Labour. Pathetic.  
Brits who think that trouble forming a majority in Germany is anywhere near as stupid and calamitous as #Brexit are wrong. Lots of parties having to negotiate and compromise is how representative democracy works. FPTP systems generate dumb results, repeatedly.
There is no such thing as a “jobs first” #Brexit outside the Single Market & the Customs Union. 
I said it once, I've said it twice and I'll say it again. @theresa_may will give much more away to the EU. I guarantee it. #Brexit #WalkAwayMay
Gisele Stuart: the 2 agencies were always going to leave.Me: No...not if we hadn't put the #Brexit gun to our head & pulled the bloody trigger!! StopBrexit soon or it's going to get worse. Binding #FinalSay Ref in 2018 + #StopBrexit & #Remain option 2 save current Best Deal
A sign of #Brexit #Britain ‘s waning influence in the world....
Securing #Brexit that meets needs of British economy is more important than some pseudo intellectual ideological game played out on Twitter. 
The billionaires who bought #Brexit must be cock-a-hoop at how easy and cheap it is to play our system.
Class Act, just like their fraternal @LiberalAus cousins >> UK Tories have voted that animals can't feel pain as part of the EU bill, marking the beginning of UK's anti-science #Brexit #auspol #ukpol
Those who suggest this- don't know how Germany works,- don't know how the EU works,- don't know how #Brexit works,(to be fair on last point: nor do I).
Seems to be a lot of misunderstanding around twitter todayPlease read @BarryGardiner explanation as to why @UKLabour voted against amendment last night#Brexit 
Maintaining a tariff-free Europe is vital to protect jobs and living standards - and Labour should be defending this. There were more Labour MPs voting pro-Customs Union last night than those who voted with Government. #Brexit 
There goes the EU again, with its unreasonable meddling. Let's have this in our #Brexit plan, Theresa! 
A more appropriate fine would be £40bn. Hand the #Brexit divorce bill to Vote Leave's billionaire backers.
Take the anti #Brexit pledge: I pledge that I will vote only for those candidates who demonstrate a clear and unwavering commitment to keeping the UK a full member of the EU, and that I will work actively to support such candidates wherever and whenever I can. 
All those Brexit opportunities for #GlobalBritain, eh? Truth is, being an EU member state has enhanced UK influence on world stage, #Brexit shrivels it 
Unfortunately, she’s not a leader. She’s trying to please everybody, and she’s letting us all down. The #EU is negotiating in bad faith. They want to make #Brexit as difficult as possible as an example to others. We should call their bluff and walk away. 
#Brexit feels like death by a thousand cuts at the moment 
We thunder against more May #Brexit giveaways.  Read article pls, @theresa_may. Don't underestimate the people.
As #Britain loses European medicine and banking agencies to Amsterdam and Paris due to #Brexit, a reminder of past promises 
Sharp #Brexit column from @wallaceme this morning:"Various countries which claim not to understand why the UK is leaving the EU are notably very unwilling to inherit our role of actually paying for its largesse" 
Lord Adonis: #Brexit a national tragedy 
#1 Lost European Medicines Agency to Amsterdam#2 Lost European Banking Agency to Paris#3 Lost representation at International Court of Justice#Brexit: Taking back control.
Remoaner ‘logic’’...Cry, whine & bitch about 900 EU agency jobs relocating to... er... an EU member stateIgnore & dismiss 100s of 1000s of jobs created in Britain since #Brexit voteSkewed #Remain ‘logic’ peddled & pushed by @BBC & MSMHere they are  pic.twitter.com/rc4boO8DXB
  No End in Sight to the Brexit Madness Brexit has already cost each British household about six hundred pounds (which is roughly 675 euro or eight hundred dollars).#Brexit #UK #EU #Europe #economy
The fact that the details of the UK & Irish border is being dictated to us by an unelected anti democratic European Union is every reason why we must #Brexit and lead our Irish friends to #Irexit
We experienced 45years of lies and deceit as treaty after treaty of the #GreatDeception project was railroaded through parliament without the consequences understood and with poor debate. #Brexit 
Of course Goldman Sachs will look elsewhere.Legal consequence of #Brexit means UK financial service providers lose EU passport which allows them to offer their services to a market of 500 million consumers and 22 million businesses.#StopBrexit
MUST WATCH VIDEO FROM @RedpillShark! Very #NewRight #EU army is here and it belongs to #Germany, Good luck #BREXIT!@Nigel_Farage @BBC @UKIP #UKIP
It seems that the @Conservatives are interested in "Disaster Capitalism" via their support for #HardBrexit whilst @UKLabour are interested in "Disaster Socialism" via their support for #HardBrexit The UK will lose so many jobs due to #Brexit #ScrewTheManyNotTheFew#StopBrexit

Absolutely brilliant video (depressingly so) @mikegalsworthy. The simple truth is that UK was a great friend and ally of Ireland in the EU and Ireland do NOT want UK to #Brexit. #Brexit is NOT being seen as an opportunity in Ireland, but as a threat to stability & security.
Britain without a judge on the International Court of Justice for first time since 1946And so it begins..#Brexit the biggest self-harm since we lost America! Explain this one away Brexiters..we R losing our status day by day! via @telegraphnews
Sick to my guts with @UKLabour, the very party I grew up with on my council estate. Depite Labour I WILL fight #Brexit. #Corbyn hang your head in shame. Goodnight Twitter.
Peter Robinson wasn't wrong when he said the DUP had the strategic vision of lemmings.#Brexit 
So Cottrell worked for Abramovich and then Farage. And Mercer offered Farage Cambridge Analytica services for #Brexit *for free*Mercer also had Farage working on #Calexit
By voting to leave the customs union, Labour have effectively endorsed a peace-process-wrecking hard border in Ireland. Shambles. #Brexit
The 28 good eggs from Labour. The rest just helped the Tories hurt the poorest, doing so whilst in *opposition* #brexit #FBPE
I’m sure those 1,000+ workers who work at these agencies and whose are jobs are moving to Paris/Amsterdam as a direct result of #Brexit will find that very reassuring. 
Tonight a Labour MP's amendment to #EUWithdrawalBill to keep UK in Single Market was supported by Labour Remain MPs but opposed by Labour front bench, whipped Labour Remain MPs & Labour Leave MPs. If you're confused, here's a simple graphic explaining Labour's #Brexit policy. 
Yes, Tory MP Owen Paterson would like the Singapore model. There's no capital gains tax, a top income tax rate of 22%, immensely long working hours, A paradise for the rich!And there's a very high immigration rate. #StopBrexit #Brexit#TaxHavenBrexit
Also even if Germany *were* in paralysis as Brexiteers claim (it isn’t), how does that help Brexiteer case?Germany’s position is UK pays €60bn plus. If paralysed Germany can’t move from that position…#Brexit
It is bizarre that some Leavers think that the EU should do anything other than negotiate in the interests of the EU27. Instead having claimed or believed that Britain held all the cards, they now wail that the EU is punishing Britain.#StopBrexit #Brexit
I shared this last week, and told all you remainers that underneath the mask of @jeremycorbyn he despises the EU. Now @uklabour are shocked after voting in favour of a key #Brexit matter tonight.Hate to say it, but told you so!#LabourFail ☭
Repeat after me.All. The. German. Parties. Except. AfD. Have. The. Same. Brexit. Line.WHATEVER happens in coalition negotiations will have NO IMPACT on #Brexit bill.Brexiteers: there’s no way what you’re telling May here will work. 
Out of these 4 #Brexit scenarios, what would you rather have:
Some days when I read the  from people who are supposed to be ’s top journalists about  that I want to say, look, , f**k off and see how you suffer.Then I recall the economic and personal pain #Brexit will inflict.And it’s back to determined opposition.
Just when we thought no one could make a dog’s dinner out of #Brexit better than the Tories, enter Arlene and the DUP 
It’s been a bad day for #Brexiters it’s been a worse day for #Britain 1) we lose #EMA 2) we lose #EBA 3) we lose our seat on the #ICJ 4) #Labour votes with #Brexit tories to take the #UK out of customs union 5) which makes the #Irish problem intractable. We are screwed 
Poll Tax on Steroids ...Theresa May facing a MASSIVE REBELLION with resignations from her government if she tries to push through a £36 BILLION EU Leaving fee.Pitchforks at the ready ...#Brexit #EU

#brexit is stumbling in the dark looking for a cliff to fall over.
Wishful thinking is not a plan,@DExEUgov. #Brexit 
#Brexit has become like someone who booked an appointment at Dignitas, is then told by a doctor that they are actually fit and healthy and their diagnosis was in fact a deliberate lie, but they decide to still go ahead with euthanasia anyway because decisions can't be changed
It’s like the loony Right and the loony Left have both gone around the bend and bumped into each other. #Brexit#StopBrexit
From London to Amsterdam #EMA & Paris #EBA, voted. @MichelBarnier briefed #EU27 ministers on #Brexit negotiations 
And over 1000 jobs leave UK - what a dire and unforgivable waste... #Brexit 
So today in #Brexit news:EU Medicine Agency is leaving for AmsterdamEU Banking Authority is leaving for ParisUK has withdrawn it's candidate for the UN Court of Justice. 1st time no UK judge since 1946.Brexit is closing doors not opening them.
Voting now to stop Tories from ending Customs Union and harming our economy with tariffs #brexit
Following the loss of the EMA & EBA, now the UK fails to get its judge onto the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for the first time. An extraordinary day of loss of British influence. #Brexit #infamy
Can’t believe it.  Labour - with some honourable exceptions - have just voted to effectively leave the EU customs union #Brexit
One unexpected consequence of #Brexit is the decline of the @BBC, in particular the quality of @BBCNews. We expected the UK to decline economically, politically, culturally, but who foresaw this pillar of the nation crumbling so quickly and completely?
Oi @theresa_may you promised you'd give EU citizens in UK and UK citizens in Europe certainty over our residency rights. We're 500+ days in from the #Brexit vote and we're still in limbo. Either you lied, or your bloody incompetent. Which was it?
Dan Hannan: The Republicans' astonishing, Orwellian change of heart on PutinBy a fellow #Brexit supporter who is a patriot and, like me, honors @Russia but despises @PutinRF  via @dcexaminer
The idiocy of #Brexit: The transfer of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) from London to Amsterdam is just one example of the many, many damaging consequences which will snowball in the coming years 
Nigel Farage - "The EU are asking us to commit to £53 billion and in return for which, they’re guaranteeing us nothing, but that we’ll be able to talk about trade."“It’s almost like a ransom demand, isn’t it?” #Brexit 
Theresa May said she wanted a red, white and blue  Brexit. Today the UK lost hundreds of EU agency jobs to France and the Netherlands.#Brexit
The #brexit negotiations are an embarrassing omnishambles. We don’t have to do this. Most of us don’t want to do this. We shouldn’t do this. Halting and reversing the brexit process would be the best thing Britain could do for itself and the world.
David Davis... telling us we wouldn't lose Medicine and Banking bodies in #Brexit. We just did 
To find £2bn for social care is peanuts, UK is about to piss away £40bn+ to the EU as a #Brexit bribe. #Dispatches
Has there ever been a time in human history when so many stupid people simultaneously wielded such power? #brexit #trump
Who can we sue for the #Brexit debacle? How did we sleep walk into this mess? What was Cameron thinking off ?
The UK loses the European Medicines Agency to Amsterdam and the Banking Agency to Paris. Another  catastrophic effect of bonkers #Brexit.
What is this? Seriously?If EU did not pay attention to national election cycles it’d be blasted for not being adequately attentive to its Member States.AND German parties unified on #Brexit anyway, so impact overdone. 
Sad and ironic that if Scotland had voted Yes to Independence in 2014 we could have been attracting these agencies. #Brexit #Indyref2
You’re absolutely right @M_AndersonSF, children in border areas already suffer higher levels of poverty, #Brexit will exacerbate this exponentially. We must achieve designated special status in the north of Ireland. 
At a stroke thousands of jobs just transferred out of London as a direct result of #BREXIT Tory / DUP fairytales & flights of fancy won’t save us from this disaster #SpecialStatusNow
Said this before and will say it again. Many will only accept that #Brexit was a bad idea when it bites them *personally* in the arse. Likewise Scottish "No" voters. And the teeth are getting sharper and closer. pic.twitter.com/iWkkCvTADH
Brexiteers in DUP ‘People Before Profit accuses me of scare mongering Well Today it was confirmed that the EU banking and medicines agencies will move from Britain to Amsterdam and Paris. SF Project Fact #Brexit 
If you want a Twitter feed with some great insight and wisdom on #Brexit - please follow @SamGhib. He really knows his stuff. One of the best anti-Brexit Twitter feeds out there.
A new report says so far #Brexit has increased average household costs by £404 pa, and cut real terms pay by £448 pa 
Remember this false claim from the Brexiteers? Today it was confirmed that the EU banking and medicines agencies will move from UK to Amsterdam and Paris. #Brexit 
It's about time we remoainers posted the good news about #brexit, so I've decided to make a list of positives so far, which is shown below: 
Following on from #brexit voting Grimsby wanting to save itself with "EU Freeport status" for its fishing industry, brexit voting Stoke now demanding EU trade protection from "Chinese dumping". Slowly the penny is dropping.... 
New elections in Germany on the cards. That means Chancellor #Merkel will be playing hard. She won’t want to tell the German people they’ve got to make up the shortfall in the EU budget post #BREXIT. So she’ll try to squeeze the UK for every penny she can.
Just in: European Banking Authority will move to Paris from London after #Brexit.
OMG Ian Murray MP just said in the Commons debate that during a UK trade delegation to Peru last week, Peruvian Trade Ministers said they wanted the right to bottle and label "Scotch" whisky as part of any trade deal with #Brexit Britain...
European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the European Banking Authority (EBA) from London to Amsterdam and Paris. The relocation of the two EU Agencies is a direct consequence and first visible result of #Brexit
That’s another 167 jobs in addition to the 900 from the European Medical Agency. So, 1,067 jobs losses in UK as a direct result of #Brexit vote 
Another Agency leaves. #EuropeanBankingAgency-Who else affected:  drivers; small local businesses; local bankers who can't/won't relocate; security guards; pubs; gyms ; taxi drivers;  beauty salons; restaurants; ...#Brexit 
First visible result of #Brexit: #EU27 agree on relocation of #EMA and #EBA from London to #Amsterdam and #Paris respectively. @EU_Commission welcomes agreement: 
This is the disastrous reality of #brexit. The EU, utterly ruthless, has already moved on. The UK, utterly clueless, has no idea where it’s going. 
The British people, at the end of this #Brexit negotiation, have the choice whether to proceed with a hard Brexit or not. Art 50 is revocable and there’s nothing inevitable about this process - as the Government has conceded in Parliament today  
As Britain struggles to come up with a coherent #Brexit, two important EU agencies it hosted are being relocated:- European Medicines Agency to Amsterdam- European Banking Authority to ParisTotal: nearly 1,000 jobs
How dare the EU try to dictate to us what kind of an economy and society we will be when we’ve left. We will decide that, thank you. At least, if this government finds some gumption, we will. #Brexit
#Brexit: £40 Billion to swap EU migrant workers for Rest of World migrant workers.Even Baldrick could have come up with a better cunning plan.
In case anyone is in any doubt of the tangible effects of Brexit, here is another example. European Medecines Agency (EMA) to leave London and move to Amsterdam because of #Brexit. Significant loss to the UK and diminishes its role in regulating medicines. 
Has the price of prime real estate in London’s financial district fallen? Check the #Brexit tracker data. 
Nigel Evans MP refers to #Brexit settlement as "ransom money". The #ToryParty has no rival when it comes to political numpties.
Its the EUROPEAN Medicines Agency - an Agency of the European Union. Its leaving because the UK is leaving the European Union and thus cannot host EU agencies. Its 100% about #Brexit.
Legatum are the great #rascals of #brexit. We who voted Remain have been lectured for a year about not getting people's struggle, while they have been working for a hard, crashing and therefore deregulation #brexit 
This is the EU saying they don't want a deal. The whole point of #BRExit was taking back control, i.e. ditching undemocratic EU regulations. It is a red line that the government cannot cross, along with migration. 
#Brexit: Electoral Commission reopens probe into Vote Leave. And what happens if #Referendum was won, not just by lying, but also by cheating?
#EMA to move to Netherlands post-#Brexit. Now Amsterdam is really the drug capital of Europe. #Brexitspoils

Another @ElectoralCommUK investigation into alleged illegal donations to the Leave campaign in the #Brexit Referendum 
Instant analysis from @pkelso on decision to move #EMA from London to Amsterdam. Big moment in the #Brexit story. 900 jobs lost as direct result of vote to leave EU 
#Conservative government in chaos over #BREXIT. Theresa May is preparing to double the ‘divorce’ payment to £38bn. That should be spent on better public services, support to post-BREXIT trade and reversing cuts to Border Force, all in preparation for BREXIT.
Oh come on. Treason is acting against your country's interests.#Brexit is against the country's interests. Should I explain democracy too?
Well done Brexiteers - some of the first fruits of Brexit - loss of c900 posts (many of them medics, pharmacists, scientists, etc) from London to Amsterdam. Rarely has there been such a concerted attempt by a country to reduce its international influence. #Brexit
This is the reality of #Brexit: 900 well-paid jobs flying across the North Sea because the people of the UK committed an act of needless self-laceration and there isn't a politician in the country with the balls to do the necessary. 
Amsterdam will be the new location of the European Medicines Agency (formally based in London). The #Brexit exodus has started. #Brexiteers told us it wouldn't happen.
The European Medicines Agency will relocate from London to Amsterdam after #Brexit losing 1000 well-paid jobs. Post-Brexit we will either have to pay for our own medicines agency without the help of 27 other countries, or accept the rulings of the EMA.#Brexinsanity!#StopBrexit
EU nations will block #Brexit deal if Britain ditches Brussels regulations, warns Michel Barnier 
Whenever it comes to drugs, Amsterdam is usually the favourite destination. #EMA #Brexit
We officially just lost the European Medicines Agency and hundreds of jobs along with it. We have nothing to replace it nor staff it. We are going to see UK patients put at risk. It's a scandal. #Brexit
Will there be a mass exodus of jobs from London’s financial district post-Brexit? Check the data - #Brexit tracker: 
Told you so.And in return?Barnier in effect demands #EU controls, or has veto over, UK post-#Brexit tax, environmental & business-regulation policy.Enough. Time to withdraw all offers made to date, cease discussions, & prepare for No-Deal exit.
Been saying since the beginning of this #Brexit shambles that a united Ireland is inevitable!  Also been saying the same about an independent Scotland. It is inevitable!
Vote Leave was amongst the most misleading campaigns in the history of British politics. How can #Brexit in any way be called democratic? I’m still waiting for millions of Turkish migrants to flood into my street now Turkey has joined the #EU. We must have a 2nd ref.

The sorry spectacle of @DanielJHannan projecting his own egocentricity and disregard for the welfare of the British people onto Remainers. It will be no consolation for Remainers that we keep our reputations while #Brexit wrecks Britain. #StopBrexit
Of course they will. That’s what #Brexit meant from the beginning, (and nothing to do with Barnier). - UK banks will lose 'passporting rights' after Britain leaves EU, Michel Barnier says

The Torus Hall at Culham @fusionenergy - a massively impressive piece of science that MUST be saved from a ‘no deal’ hard #Brexit the takes the UK out of Euratom - otherwise it’s lose-lose for the UK and the EU27. 
Rather than take regular flights like a peasant, David Davies demanded an RAF plane that cost five times as much. And May caved. Our futures are in the hands of this vainglorious whopper. #Brexit 
Fascinating presentation on #Brexit by @M_AndersonSF in Stormont. Urgent requirement on British Government to guarantee rights of 1.8m people in North who are citizens of Ireland & of EU. Thnx @guyverhofstadt for standing up for Good Friday Agreement.
Someone who still doesn’t get it. #Brexit is the correct long-term choice because 27 nations on different political cycles and with their shifting coalitions will always struggle to be as nimble as our fast moving world requires

Barnier, speaking at #CERFutureEU, says Northern Ireland needs a separate status to rest of UK to prevent a hard border on the island after #Brexit. He notes that the territory already has rules different from rest of UK.
Spoiler alert: Important bit about govt agreeing to pay higher #Brexit divorce bill is that the new large number is higher than the old large number. For many the actual figures involved are difficult to grasp and dependent on context. 
Why are Tory Remainers so hypnotized by a 37% vote in an advisory referendum! The Tories won't allow a public sector strike on anything less than 40%. #StopBrexit #Brexit

This thread is not about stopping #Brexit or talking Britain down. It is about impressing on people -especially people who voted for and still support leaving the EU- that demanding we overplay our hand and risk walking away with nothing is the biggest disservice to their cause.
The UK exports millions of tonnes of waste to the EU. What impact will #Brexit have? Watch live on Wednesday at 10.30 (GMT) to hear a range of experts give their view: 
Should the UK pay double for the #Brexit divorce of around £40 billion up from a proposed £20 billion? @PhilipHammondUK puts @theresa_may under pressure to pay more for Brexit divorce bill'   RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters
If #Brexit were genuinely a good idea in the interest of the UK and its people, it would stand on its own merit. Brexiters conducting these dirty, dangerous campaigns, censoring debate and trying to drug the public with a fake vision of Brexit wonderland proves it is not.
Dear Tory #Brexit rebel MPs, Do you want a Labour gov, led by a terrorist-loving, Marxist liar? Then keep on doing what you're doing, as that's how we'll end up with a Labour gov, led by a terrorist-loving, Marxist liar.

#Brexit will benefit a few billionaire tax avoiders. Rest of us will be worse off in every conceivable way. Can't put it plainer than that.

Hard hitting editorial in 'The Guardian' says UK's attitude to Irish question "is a national disgrace for Britain" and #Brexit is "a gratuitous act of hostility towards the Irish economy".  
Today EU countries vote on who gets to have the European Medicines Agency and Banking Authority, which the UK will lose post-#Brexit. A sad day. UK will not vote. 
#JamaikaAbbruch is not good news for #Brexit - while new govt is formed/new elections are held, technocrats will govern in Berlin.

Edward Heath in 1972 understood Britain was joining much more than a common market. He said its aim was to improve the quality of life of the peoples of a Europe. It was and it has. Let’s not throw it away. Fight #Brexit!

If the UK agrees to pay the EU all it owes; and if the UK accedes to all demands on EU citizens rights, there's still the unsolvable Irish border problem. So whatever way you look at it, #Brexit can't be delivered. No wonder Davis wants to chuck the towel in.

@albawhitewolf speaks for the 48%+ of the population whose views are rarely heard nowadays on the BBC. More please... and a lot less of the likes of Owen Paterson who speaks only for himself. #Brexit @BBCAnyQuestions #bbcaq
A very valid point. #Brexit was obtained on the back of deception and lies. There must be many who are sorely disappointed that there won't be penny more for the NHS (as govt has confirmed) and it will certainly be hugely understaffed. 
Next Saturday! #Leeds for Europe Stop #Brexit Day of Action, including public meeting 3pm at Leeds Civic Hall: "Brexit: How Will it Impact Education, Research & Innovation?" Tickets available now from 
Looks like these #Brexit sabotage ads targeting certain Tory MPs have been organised by @TBorwick - former CTO Vote Leave. Indistinguishable from @LeaveEUOfficial 'traitors/saboteurs' rhetoric of @Arron_banks How else did the two campaigns collude during EUref?
If you are very rich, then there are excellent profits to be made from the chaos a no-deal #Brexit would bring. With that thought in mind is it really surprising that the Tories are conducting the negotiations so carelessly.#StopBrexit
One of most disturbing side-effects of Brexit is the significant lowering of what's considered acceptable conduct in public office.#Brexit 
My view is that David Davis isn't actually that incompetent or ignorant. He simply doesn't care because he belongs to the #Brexit faction that wants to crash the talks and profit from the resulting chaos before getting the tax haven of their dreams.
Is it just my impression, but it seems to me that most government rhetoric on the #Brexit negotiations is mostly directed at providing a justification for walking out of the talks?#StopBrexit
Huge admiration for bravery of Russian former employee of "Internet Research Agency" fake news factory (just one part of the propaganda/misinformation campaign around #Trump & #Brexit). Speaking out like this is a very dangerous thing to do in Russia.

Here’s my HuffPost blog on the misunderstanding at the heart of our #Brexit approach.  
This is why investment has slowed in this country. Not #Brexit . Labour will wreck the country. 
We have family and friends all over the world, and many nationals from those nations here in the UK. We're interconnected globally from Canada  to New Zealand, from Sri Lanka to Trinidad and Kenya to South Africa. We, all of us, have a brilliant future ahead of us. After #Brexit.
There have been far too many Breaches of the Ministerial Code over #Brexit.  People deserve truth from the #MPs they elect & the Lords they pay for.
Here's the proof that The Sun editorial is a win for Leo Varadkar. Type of press release you don't see very often from the Opposition benches. #Brexit 
US to fight UK at WTO if it adopts EU-style approach to crop protection rules: classic example of #Brexit as Trojan horse, in this case for undermining of precautionary principle and regulation of pesticides
I went to bed last night thinking what a diabolic job @Conservatives are doing with #Brexit negotiations, which they are!  I awoke in a cold sweat this morning after having a nightmare that these clowns were handling the negotiations instead  
Writing in @BrexitCentral MEP William Dartmouth says that the UK could trade with the EU after Brexit on WTO terms like Australia.His claim is entirely false. Lying or ignorant, who knows? Either way, unfit to represent us!#LeaveLies #StopBrexit #Brexit
If we hadn’t joined the EU, there are 50+ legal protections which simply wouldn’t exist for women. We need to be talking about the gendered element of #Brexit  #FeministFutures
#Remain hero @KenClarkeMP made the most pertinent comment this week: if #UKGov didn’t intend watering down workers’ rights after #Brexit, why wouldn’t they back @UKLabour’s amendment to protect those rights? Share @Jon_Danzig’s blog. Link:

Labour’s following the Tories over the cliff is the biggest shock, and the most horrifying part, of #Brexit. It’s stupefying negligence.#StopBrexit

If, as rumoured, #DavidDavis throws in the towel, who should replace him?#Brexit
Again - and this is important (and historic when it comes to Putin) - the main thrust of his #Brexit Bots was "fuelling anti-Muslim sentiment in the United Kingdom"  
Accusing the #BBC of “gloomy” #Brexit coverage is like blaming their weather reports for the crap weather outside.
No.The rules the EU has for its external borders are clear. Britain is leaving and has to comply with those rules.#ireland #brexit 
TThe language from the Sun here today on the Irish Govt & Ireland is utterly indefensible, especially as its on #Brexit problems entirely of the UKs own making that UKgovt has dumped on the people of Ireland without any concern for their views @tnewtondunn
That horrible moment when you realise 'take back control' means for the 1st time in c800yrs Ireland can exercise power over England. #brexit 
ICYMI: Days into his new job, the latest #Brexit minister Martin Callanan was forced into an embarrassing correction in the House of Lords.
DUP’s current stance on #Brexit amounts to “Everyone else should look after the UK’s interests... except the UK.”Let us be very clear, there’s nothing in the referendum result which inhibits maintaining a common Customs Union or continuing to participate in Single Market.

Despite #ParadisePapers, David Davis' #Brexit impact study idiocy, cabinet resignations, the calamity of #UC, multiple allegations of inappropriate sexual behaviour and a study implicating Tory policy in 120k deaths, Tories are narrowing polling gap. How? #weallknowhow #bentmedia

Very interesting thread. There are so many unintended #brexit consequences. Irish border is obvious but some in Uk gov deny that. Imagine all the issues that are being completely ignored? 
Patently obvious that @BorisJohnson & @michaelgove campaigned for #Brexit without understanding the Single Market or the rule of law and have persisted with ignorance and/or indifference ever since.  Hence failure to understand the border issue in Ireland.
Who says young people aren't interested in #politics? Really enjoyed talking to Year 6 at @henry_cavendish this morning. One pupil asked what I thought of #Brexit, so we had a show of hands on whether they thought it was a good or bad idea. Most said bad idea... #Streatham

Okay, then peeps. LONG THREAD. Put down your union flag for a moment and just take some information in. I will try to explain the approaching #Brexit nightmare using a single, calm, factual example, so far largely ignored. I urge you to think, share and talk about this. Ready?
Varadkar tells me: "After 40 years of marriage- most of them good, now Britain wants a divorce but an open relationship the day after." #brexit #SocialSummit17
Irish PM Leo Varadkar tells me in interview for @SkyNews that on #Brexit talks the UK hasn't done nearly enough to move to second phase in December: "I can't say in any honesty that it's close- on the Irish issue or on the financial settlement." #SocialSummit2017
How to tell the party leaders apart on the #Brexit issue ... 
There's only one remedy for this intransigence is to leave with no trade deal without paying the #EU a penny and then we can immediately start negotiating trade deals around the world with our friends. #UK then would trade with EU under #WTO rules #Brexit 
Discussed with PM @theresa_may the calendar of #Brexit talks. Only if UK makes progress by early December, will I be ready to propose new guidelines on transition and future relations at December #EUCO.
Whip out your opera glasses to view the parallel universes of #Brexit My thoughts: 
Hints and clues from Leave EU* We used Russians* We had Bristol bots* We had AI My take #Brexit and #Trump is where the dark money from offshore US billionaires and Russian oligarchs mingled and had the same agenda
I resent being called a traitor by some when 2B treasonous is to seek to harm your country... #Brexit is harming & will continue harm the UK economically & reputationally, public services will diminish & its citizens will lose rights & be worse off. Is it treason to prevent this?
Does David Davis have a great sense of humour or amnesia saying to the EU 'don't put politics before prosperity'? Wasn't that exactly what #Brexit was, putting Tory politics before the UK's prosperity?

Davis' speech to the Suddeutsche Zeitung Economic Summit. This description of post-#brexit relationship with EU is so similar to UK's current membership that a German journalist ask him why we were leaving. Beats me. Maybe we aren't?

@DavidDavisMP is compromising the UK’s future prosperity and not honouring our full financial commitment to EU, so why on earth should they endorse him and his misguided objectives? The whole #brexit concept is unviable and unenforceable #StopBrexit #BrexitWontHappen

Paradoxically I imagine many people voted for #brexit because they were tired of being fooled.
.@MichelBarnier: passionate about Europe, factual on #brexit, & a personal touch = speech of the week 
The #Brexit referendum was ADVISORY. It was to ADVISE the Government on what to do. They triggered #Article50 to leave the EU. A second referendum to ADVISE them to carry on or not, given what we now know, is not anti-democracy. They have a duty to ask again.
How is @theresa_may doing on #brexit? Views have changed during 2017... 
It's make up your minds time! On #Brexit, which would you rather have: a “really bad deal” or “a really, really, bad deal”?
Attended bilateral this morning with @campaignforleo & Theresa May. Taoiseach reiterated that we cannot take a leap into the dark without assurances on the border. #Brexit 
Coveney has said this in front of Johnson after publicly disagreeing w/Johnson saying Uk should now move to stage 2 of #brexit talks. UK-Irish gov relations are deteriorating

“Here in the UK, there’s lots of hand-wringing from CEOs over #Brexit... So much is at stake, why not make sure a consensus is still there?"Establish a thoroughly presented EU referendum based on facts not lies. Whether leave or remain, honesty not falsehood. 
Emily Thornberry is a perfect example of Corbyn's Labour party on #Brexit . All over the place, no ideas, no clue. Smugness, sniping & scaremongering is all she can do. A useless excuse of an opposition & never fit for government #bbcqt

What kind of #brexit do you want?#BBCQT Please Retweet
One other thing on #BBCQT . @EmilyThornberry would do well to recall that the labour party are so split on #Brexit that they refused to debate it properly at their recent conference, in order to avoid the split showing.
#bbcqtSo why the bloody hell don't you ALL work together for this country instead of playing oneupmanship..... #Brexit
#BBCQT Walking away from a deal in a business negotiation means staying with status quo. But in #brexit the government’s saying that no deal is not the status quo but a cliff edge departure with costly legal limbo.
What has Lady Nugee been smoking? Why would we not be able to trade with the EU whatever the outcome? Every other country does. Ridiculous hyperbole. #Brexit.

A victory for Parliamentary democracy despite 7 @labour MPs who were planning to vote with the #Brexit extremists. Yes @UKLabour MPs!
If he had any self-awareness whatsoever tonight’s @DavidDavisMP quote might be taken as admission #Brexit is a bad idea: “Putting politics above prosperity is never a smart choice.” But clearly he hasn’t: 
The perspective of #Brexit leads the Prime Minister of a proud nation to making unfortunate remarks. She calls Polish PM, who breaches rule of law and disregards rulings if European Court or Justice “my great colleague.” #disappointment #RuleOfLaw
The German political class has always thought the Brits lacked substance, but made up for it with rhetorical skill.Tonight has perhaps shown that even that silver lining is not true any more.#Brexit
Goldman Sachs boss demands a second #Brexit referendum. That should clinch it. #foreignagents
Mwwaaahhh.That’s *precisely* what the referendum DID do.#Brexit 
Goldman Sachs say leaving EU will destroy the economy. It’s companies like Goldman Sachs who’ve destroyed hope in the people of the UK who voted for #Brexit
How long is the list of #Brexit problems that no one mentioned at the time of the referendum?
Labour opposing #Brexit is quite simply the best thing that could happen in the UK right now. Please @jeremycorbyn , the majority don't want it any more. You'd get to be PM and austerity would end. The NHS would be saved. There would be dancing in the streets. PLEASE!!!
I don’t believe anyone looking dispassionately at our political system could disagree with this. #Brexit has brought its dysfunction into sharp focus. 
During the EU Withdrawl debate last night, I stated that in its current state the Bill risks leaving dangerous gaps in #environmental law and gives Ministers huge unaccountable powers. #Brexit

If Leavers are so sure #Brexit is right, if the government is so sure it can get a great deal for the UK, what do they have to fear from a second vote to make sure that Brexit really IS the "will of the people"?

anna Soubry claims she is doing everything she can to bring about Brexit, to respect the will of the people, and yet everything she does and says indicates the opposite…she is out to stop #Brexit in its tracks
It can be difficult to keep up to date with all that's happening in #Brexit so I will be sharing regular updates as the Bill makes its way through parliament.  Here's my take on what happened this week. 
So @theresa_may must not give way to the rebels on the date of leaving. If she does, Remoaners will only demand more and more concessions to block #Brexit. Face them down! 
Embarrassing for newest #Brexit minister, forced into correction in House of Lords. Apparently #Article50 definitely is reversible...
#Brexit today:-Leaked EU paper kills any bespoke trade deal-Dutch prepare for 'chaotic Brexit-'We are trashing own interests' - DMilibandNot going well
I'm shocked, shocked! that Russia was meddling in the #Brexit referendum. No, I'm not shocked at all. This is part of Russia's active measures campaign & we should expect to see more of this in the future.

Anna Soubry…the most pugnacious, bullying, lying, divisive Tory MP?  Maybe.  Crying that she is being bullied as the #Telegraph outs her and her collaborators for being ‘mutineers’ on #Brexit….quite happy though to name call and label #Brexiteers as “ideologically driven”
Fabulous clip of @patel4witham and @JamesCleverly chastising those on the opposite benches for portraying the UK as being unable to govern itself#ThankEUGoodbye #ProudToBeTory #Brexit 
.@patel4witham and @JamesCleverly speaking sense on #Brexit and taking back powers, and drawing our attention to @uklabour being unable to govern themselves Only the #tories will deliver on #Brexit for us all.
#Brexit & the #NHS :The negative impact on staffing levels, skill mix, regulation of medicines, research, treatments available & supplies should not be underestimated. The #NHS is on the brink. #Nurses4EU @keepnhspublic
I've been asked by a few journalists recently why #Munich is a great #startup city. In short: Leading tech unis attract young talent. Excellent quality of life attracts more seasoned talent. It's in the heart of Europe with easy access to the continent #startups #Brexit #München
Biggest Cause of Personal Bankruptcies? Medical Bills Consider now the impact of the #NHS being privatised after #Brexit especially with years of #austerity & the rolling out of #UniversalCredit . More people will die.
Tories said they wouldn't support EU ArmyNow they are?Why?EU are refusing to negotiate on #Brexit so why did we not veto the EU Army?It is the art of the dealThis is what @realDonaldTrump & Maggie would have doneWe should be playing hardballInstead we are just a soft touch
BREAKING: Russian Embassy slams 'groundless accusations' of alleged interference in #Brexit 
Here in UK, lots of hand-wringing from CEOs over #Brexit. Better sense of the tough and risky road ahead. Reluctant to say, but many wish for a confirming vote on a decision so monumental and irreversible. So much at stake, why not make sure consensus still there?

I want to #stopbrexit so others don’t experience the loss of a twenty year old company, as I have. #Brexit is not building small companies like mine, it’s killing them.
Tell me again why people voted Remain? #Brexit #ThursdayThoughts
Pleased to see @LibDems MPs supporting @Plaid_Cymru amendment on giving @AssemblyWales veto on #Brexit . National interest > Party interest
#Russia used hundreds of fake accounts to tweet in favour of #Brexit, according to new data:
Russia was behind at least 150,000 Twitter accounts that tweeted disinfo around #Brexit 
Oh just occurred to me. Presumably free mobile phone roaming in EU countries will end soon too. So many little things. #Brexit
.@Anna_Soubry says Tory #Brexit rebel are bullied. Truth is 17,410,742 Brits who voted for #Brexit are called old, stupid, gullible, misinformed, uneducated, xenophobic & racists. When they couldn't win democratic vote, they are pretending pathetic victimhood. 
Leader of the House confirms Govt still intent on hiding the 58 sectoral reports from the public. They contain the true cost of #Brexit. The truth must out.
I just called for UK Government to act after reports of Russian interference in British politics and #Brexit @HouseofCommons #BusinessQuestions
Firstly: You were told, but refused to listen.Second: If 'special dispensations' are on offer, let's have one for the whole of #Scotland & NI; who both voted to Remain. No reason why we should pay for your stupidity.#BrexitShambles #Brexit 
Who do you think REALLY are the 52% who voted for #Brexit in 2016?
If #Brexit was supposed to make us more prosperous why on earth is a #Whittlesey carpet company advertising "Beat the Brexit Price Rises!" in the @peterboroughtel today?
I don't GET why Davis & Co resist meeting UK financial liabilities #Brexit.On reflection - they DON'T honour their responsiilities to the UK poor the disadvantaged & dispossessed.So I guess it's axiomatic they *swerve* on EU liabilities !
It's #FolkloreThursday so let's tell each other stories about mythical things like unicorns, innovative jam and making a success of #Brexit Thread: No debating or tagging
Very proud of @SoMSwansea PhD student @AnhTho_Pham being the 1st student to use the new media suite to talk about her and @SashaTalavera's research which suggests that Twitter bots influenced #Brexit! It's amazing to see the impact this research is having @SwanseaUni @PGRSwansea
If there’s an election in the next year an anti #Brexit alliance could win it. But political tribalism would destroy the #Remain cause. We must put normal politics aside to win this battle otherwise Britain will be damaged for generations to come.
Lots of praise for Gove recently because he made some good noises on the environment.  Last night he voted down two withdrawal bill amendments on keeping & altering EU-derived environmental standards and principles after #Brexit. Not much noise from his new fans today.
If @RT_com were trying to break up Britain why employ me, a prominent enemy of separatism? Achieve #Brexit ? Why employ @DelaneyMan and my erstwhile friend John Wight, both mad for the EU? Break up Spain?Why allow me to broadcast my distaste for Catalan independence @RT_sputnik ?
It’s a good job the NHS is funded to the hilt, social housing fully functioning, sexual harassment resolved & child poverty ended, so we can spend 8 days debating 500 amendments to a #Brexit bill that half the country didn’t want in 1st place.
Mutiny? When the admiral is scarcely competent, the ship full of holes, crew discipline shot to pieces, the engine room full of incompetent wannabe engineers and the navigator got no map or compass don't put to sea. Stop this #Brexit madness. #Brexitshambles
Food price inflation (enhanced by the #brexit induced fall of £ ) rises to over 4%, while wages stagnate @InFactsOrg
If you don’t like current petrol prices, overdraft fees or the collapse of your house price, perhaps you shouldn’t have voted for #Brexit #ThursdayThoughts
Mishal Husain seems unaware that there actually has been a run on the pound since #Brexit causing massive devaluation. #r4today @johnmcdonnellMP
Despite best efforts of the media and knee-jerks on social media, we must not let #Brexit divide us as a nation. Whatever side of the argument you’re on, try to keep friendships and respect for those on the other side.
The lives of 65 million men, women & children at stake & the most RECKLESS Tory govt in living memory. What could possibly go wrong? #Brexit
In case you missed it these are the crucial environmental protections that the Government voted down last night #Brexit 
Trying to understand democracy today is figuring out why it’s not ok to question a referendum result but it is ok to attack MPs for wanting a vote in Parliament #brexit

#ThursdayThoughts#Brexit now DEVASTATING & RETROGRESSIVE for UK animals. Govt won vote to END EU law on animal sentience by ONLY 18 MPs 
Again,its Brexit, Brexit, Brexit on this visit to London.Despite interesting global economic/financial developments, #Brexit seemingly remains all that people here are thinking and talking about.Risk that the rest of the world moves on while the #UK remains single-issue focused
The Home Affairs Committee which I sit on has just released this very concerning report on #Brexit and customs chaos - Government unprepared and huge costs!! We should stay in customs union @Open_Britain
MPs have rejected the opportunity for animals to be considered sentient post #brexit what a shameful vote of course animals are sentient 
Listening to a recent phone in programme on Radio 4 about #Brexit one caller suggested Britain could go it alone because they were good at trading in the 1600s. Ah, the 17th century. *gets all misty eyed*
And in 20 years from now history will look back and wonder how 52% of Britain was able to be brainwashed into thinking #Brexit was still a good idea when it was proven Russia interfered in the Referendum. #StopBrexit
Basic protection for animals through EU recognition that they can feel pain will not transferred into UK law after #Brexit. Another reason why we need to #StopBrexit
Follow the money, #Brexit only benefits those who can afford to exploit #trading opportunities derived from the extreme political & economic disruption it brings. That means the 1%. Why let only 650,000 people lead the rest of our entire country to its detriment? #StopBrexit
Brexit: prior approval - an analysis of the EU's regulatory philosophy, and why we can't make a clean break from the Single Market ...  #Brexit. 
The volume of fake accounts, Russian bots and social disinformation on Facebook and Twitter over #Brexit and #TrumpRussia with stagger you (HT @J_amesp)
The mutineers will be unable to delay and frustrate #Brexit if the exit date is set in the Bill. That is why they are so vehemently opposed. 
Dear @guyverhofstadt please ask @DavidDavisMP to explain to my children why his #Brexit means they lose their #EU citizenship & #FOM whilst he proposes senior bankers get to keep theirs #StopBrexit #FBPE
I note that the MPs are really concerned about #Brexit withdrawal Bill - are they all in the bar?? 
Absolutely brilliant article with extraordinary analogy of Ireland breaking from U.K. in '30's and #brexit from EU today. Lessons from history indeed. 
You might well ask....lost the animal sentience amendment by just 18 votes - so disappointing #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit

Researcher finds just 400 tweets from Russia aimed at #Brexit vote 
So @Anna_Soubry says Tory #Brexit rebel MPs are being bullied. Meanwhile 17,410,742 Leavers have been called old, stupid, gullible, misinformed, uneducated, xenophobic racists. So, Anna, spare us your pitiful victimhood.
Let’s be clear here: The votes of Scottish Tory MPs could’ve made the difference but instead they acted as lobby fodder to make it easier to tear up employment rights, environmental protections, health & safety standards, consumer standards and standards of equalities #Brexit 
Every time this exposed agent tweets a #Brexit Unicorn dies.Keep tweeting comrade. You now only help #Remain by doing so.#BrokenBrexit#ToxicBrexit#StopBrexit
I particularly enjoy "Peat Seeking Missile" as the handle for the other Russian troll replying here - both posing as @TheSNP Scots #Brexit Russians are funny, if not subtle :) 
Grimsby voters waking up to the cost of #Brexit reports @Channel4News They’re realising what a terrible mistake they made. #BrexitChaos

Traitors, a cancer, the violent intolerant language given license by #Brexit. Is this who we want to be? 
When you start to wonder if the Brexit negotiations could get any worse, just imagine if these numpties were negotiating...#NoDeal #brexit 
Excellent @UKIP protest tonight for #Brexit against the @BathforEurope meeting!They think they have free reign over the city. I have news for you - they don't.
It is simply and obviously our patriotic duty to stop any treasonous act ie an act that is against our national interest, plotted to serve a foreign and malevolent country. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit #remainernow #remainersnow
“If you listen very carefully, you can hear the tide starting to turn on Brexit.”Russian interference, the #50SecretStudies, and 'Lexit' myths in @MollyMEP's latest #Brexit newsletter: 
I see scope for a deepening of Irish-US relations post-#Brexit when Ireland will be the sole English-speaking country in the EU. A bridge between #US & #EU.
Alongside the Electoral Commission's investigations into Leave campaigners, all these Russian Twitter revelations are making #Brexit look less and less like the "will of the people".
Daniel Hannan MEP - "Our total trade with the EU amounts to 12.6% of our GDP. We have a large domestic economy, we’re a big home market and most of our trade is outside the EU." #Brexit

"#Brexit has become like someone who booked a trip to #Dignitas who were told they were dying but now have been told the diagnoses was wrong. But they are going to go ahead with #euthanasia anyway cause they already decided... My take on @robertshrimsley's reader comment in @FT
Channel 4 news has a dispatch from big Leave voting Grimsby on how/why fishing industry wants ‘special status’ after #brexit. Likely to be a running theme
"The man (John Redwood) who will not let one day pass without emphasising how well Britain is going to do out of #Brexit is at the same time talking down markets & encouraging capital flight. That's what disaster capitalists do." (Jon Luydendijk, Guardian)
Sarah...good news in part but 37% of the electorate expressing an opinion in a non-binding test of opinion neither justifies the political decision to act as if #Brexit's mandatory nor the denial of a democratic #FinalSay in 2018 2 Confirm or #StopBrexit. Democracy not Autocracy.
Beyond the "I'm the rebel" quote, the clip of Ken Clarke went on to say in his splendid speech is the best summary of the con that was pulled -and continues to be pulled- on the British public by the #Brexit extremists. A vital two minutes, absolutely worth your time and your RT. 
Thank you @EmbSpainUK for meeting us yesterday & listened how #Brexit is impacting into Spanish Nurses living in U.K. I'm looking forward to start collaborating together & to our next meeting in January.  
#EUWithdrawalBill Claims that the #Leave campaign said that #Brexit must mean leaving the #SingleMarket are certainly not true of all their campaigners:
What ending Freedom of Movement really means. One rule for bankers. Another for the rest of us #Brexit 
I am both saddened and amazed at the pro EU propaganda and scaremongering that is still prevalent in the mainstream, when the #EU has shown a real hatred towards the UK throughout the #Brexit negotiations. I cannot wait to bear witness to the independence of our great nation.
What is with the right wing press that anyone expressing a dissenting view is  seen as some kind of traitor? Disagreeing with the @GOVUK is called #democracy. It happens. Get over it. #brexit #bremain #BrexitMutineers
Dear UK citizens,The #Dutch government is debating right now whether to slash divident tax with 1,400,000,000 euros for big companies. Their main argument: Big companies will move from Amsterdam to London AFTER #BrexitSo, 'REMAIN' lied? Media lied? #dividendbelasting
The idea that Russia puppeteered #Brexit is a chattering-class conspiracy theory, says Brendan O'Neill 
Why the delay? Surely these papers are framing the governments #Brexit plans and so should be immediately available. Unless @DavidDavisMP lied !!!
#Brexit is causing many people to forget the lessons of history. History has taught us that we ignore the rise of right wing populism at our peril.  As such, these wise words from @SarahButter4 really resonate right now. 
Meeting with PM @theresa_may in 10 Downing Street today.My impression is that progress in the #Brexit talks is possible. There is a willingness for compromise. 
David Davis' migration plan: 1. Privileges bankers and the better off.2. Treats people as commodities not individuals.3. Will create more red-tape.4. Depends on EU countries' agreement.#StopBrexit #Brexit

"Welsh" Labour MPs didn't support Wales having a say in Brexit. "Welsh" Labour Gov wants a say in Brexit.No matter if you support #Brexit or not, our country deserves a say in negotiations. The union we need to leave is the UK! 
Patriotism is about seriously inquiring into the consequences of #Brexit.Yelling "We won!" and "Get over it" is a betrayal of this country and its people. It is the behaviour of yobs and vandals, not of patriots!#StopBrexit

MPs REPEAL 1972 European Communities Act which brought Britain into EU 'trading' bloc on Jan 1, 1973.Voted 318 to 68, majority 250 to repeal Act giving #EU law supremacy over UK law.This provides orderly #Brexit regardless of outcome of Brussels talks.
Theresa May sings her Govt's praises at #PMQs. Inflation up, wages falling behind, investment slowing, business confidence down, #Brexit talks stalled. She is clearly a glass half full person.
They've been doing it for months, but it doesn't make it any more acceptable.Look at the language: it's the language of war. Over opponents of something that's supposed to be about free speech, democracy, sovereignty#brexit #journalism /1
Will Corbyn raise #Brexit, the biggest issue of the decade at #PMQs? Of course not, he is in favour of #Brexit and has to keep his head down.
The worst, most incompetent government in my lifetime but @labour barely manages to draw level in the polls. Their pro #Brexit policy isn’t working... 
And I am quite used to mainstream press gnashing their teeth at my true reporting then parroting it nine months later. Russia ALSO interfered in the General Election for its asset @JeremyCorbyn. If he knew, he should be jailed. #Brexit
Not only did I (and I alone) break Russian bots for #Brexit last September, I also broke the story of @Comey’s #TrumpRussia investigation on Nov 7th, thus scooping both UK and US media on both their biggest stories of the last year
UK tweeps should know: Jeremy Corbyn also benefited from Russian propaganda in the General Election and if he knowingly cooperated, he should be arrested, like anybody in #Brexit who knowingly colluded. @ me all you want; I broke Russian bots for Brexit last year.
You have got to ask, did the £450,000 given to the DUP by Scottish Tory members come from RUSSIA?What are the Tories & DUP hiding We have a right to know where the money came from.   Who funded the #Brexit Tory/DUP leave campain? 
The 15 Tory MPs aren’t in the same party as me, and I disagree with them on many important issues. But I respect their thoughtfulness and integrity. Your inflated use of aggressive language helps no one at this difficult time in the life of our nation. #brexit 
"If you listen very carefully, you can hear the tide starting to turn on Brexit" says @MollyMEP in her latest #Brexit newsletter  #StopBrexit

I don’t actually CARE what politicians think about #Brexit. We, the people, instructed them to LEAVE the EU. End of.
A foreign power is accused of 'disrupting' our democracy.Anyone who loves this country should now be asking for #Brexit to be halted until an enquiry is completed.#russiagateUK

Kremlin influence over #Brexit story finally breaks....even the Times is covering it. Only happened thanks to the relentless work of @J_amesp, @carolecadwalla, @PeterKGeoghegan and @adamramsay at @openDemocracy. Watch @Nigel_Farage & @LeaveEUOfficial as they squirm and lash out.
The #Brexit referendum, flawed in so many ways as well as being marginal and advisory is now treated as an unquestionable mandate to do anything in its name. 
Must say if I were a brexiteer I would be chuffed to bits at how #brexit is taking back Parliamentary sovereignty.

419 accounts tweet 3478 times 78% AFTER Brexit that’s 2713 tweets. So 765 tweets swung #Brexit away from the Remain bombardment of a £9 mil state controlled leaflet, TV, most politicians & journos, corporate Britain, Luvvies United, EU funded academics etc that’s believable not! 
Did Russians force parliament to vote for Article 50? Did they block the single market amendment? Did they make Nick Clegg a giant pussy? Did they make Cameron a lying bastard? Did they make the EU an antidemocratic kleptocracy? No.#Brexit
Brexit: an unrecognised bombshell - without equivocation, when the UK leaves the Single Market, UK will no longer be able to export cars to the EU ...  #Brexit. 
What is happening to Britain is heartbreaking. Yes, the EU has its flaws, but, the positives far outweigh the negatives.Tragically, far too many people have been influenced to look inward, rather than look outward. That breaks my heart. Surely, we are better than that.#Brexit
Labour might have some explaining to do on why MPs abstained on #withdrawalbill amendment to give devolved parliaments vote on #Brexit deal 
Grateful to all 'Brexit mutineers', 'saboteurs', 'enemies of the people' and 'remoaners' for standing up for democratic values despite the bullying of the tabloids. #Brexit #Mutineers
EU Withdrawal Bill will transfer all EU legislation into UK law. UK gov’t is looking for a trade deal very close to current arrangements. We will safeguard rights of EU citizens in the UK. We’ll pay a big bill to leave EU. So can anyone explain what we are achieving with #Brexit?
Voted tonight to stop a Hard Brexit by voting against repealing the European Communities Act, and for the European Court of Justice. #Brexit 
Tories had a chance (thanks to @joannaccherry) to amend the #EUWithdrawalBill bill tonight & ensure that domestic rights don’t fall behind international standards. They rejected that chance. Shameful. #Brexit
Can someone please tell Peston it was done to flush out all the rebels and it’s worked like a charm! #Brexit 
Never forget. This man created #Brexit chaos because of an internal Tory party feud. He then knighted all his mates (and f***ed off) 
"RESPECT MY DECISION" you protest, having voted #Brexit or #Trump. But this isn't some journey you alone will take. You chose a wretched course for the ship in which we all must sail.And those of us who see icebergs ahead will not stop pointing them out, until you see them too.
#Brexit Ministers cause yet more confusion and uncertainty for business by refusing to confirm whether the ECJ will apply during any transition.
Less than a week ago useless May dared Tory rebels to defy her on #Brexit. Today they did and 40 Tory MPs are planning to oust her. She got it wrong AGAIN and made herself even weaker, AGAIN. This is well beyond a joke #MayMustGo
AKA 'Just some of the very many MPs, who might actually be working on your behalf, to limit the damage that foolhardy gung-ho, lunatics like John Redwood want to wreak...' #Brexit

SkyNews has seen 400 tweets supposedly of Russian origin, meant to have influenced #Brexit. 400 – among millions. UK net trolls were paid to undermine #indyref 2014? Where’s the outrage?
Now Oliver Letwin slamming #Brexit Bill warning that Govt will get "massacred" in the Lords over the mess in Clause 6...
There are four circumstances in which 29 March 2019 may not be the #Brexit date — the #Government ‘s attempts to fix the date in the #WithdrawalBill are a silly attempt to tie #Parliament ‘s hands: via @RCorbettMEP
Surprised I haven't seen more UK psychologists sharing @DaveBrownToons excellent #Brexit cartoon for tomorrow's    @Independent
Nigel Farage - "George Soros recently gave Open Society, which campaigns for free movement of people and supports supranational structures like the EU – $18 billion."His influence here and in Brussels is truly extraordinary." #Brexit 
Tory Brexiter MP George Freeman: #Brexit could produce an “entrepreneurship revolution” or could turn Britain into an “old people’s home that can’t pay for itself”We weren't told about any such risk during the referendum campaign.#StopBrexit #LeaveLies
The PM receives Jimmy Krankie, Mayor of Scotland, for some more irrelevant moaning over #Brexit.
Leavers, pay attention! They said the Eurozone was going to collapse. Here's the reality!Euro zone growth, eclipsing U.S. economy, set to be best in decade #LeaveLies #StopBrexit #Brexit
Given the chance tonight to vote for an amendment on a Holyrood veto over #brexit, Scottish Labour MP's did precisely what you'd expect. They sat on their hands and #labstained #WeakerForScotland
Here's how many MPs from each party that supported our amendment to #GiveWalesASay on #Brexit. 
Absolutely.Likewise Kate Hoey, Gisela Stuart, & one or two others.#Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill #CleanBreak
It takes an MP from England to back an amendment to give Wales a final say on #Brexit when Welsh Labour MPs ABSTAINED. #EUWithdrawalBill
"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me"Jacob Rees-Mogg taking us for fools#Brexit#BigRedBus
Last night British PM  called out Putin for meddling in their #Brexit referendum, which resulted in her own subsequent rise to power.Two days ago, Trump on Putin’s meddling in U.S. 2016 election: He didn’t do it. I believe him. We have a good feeling for each other. 
So, Carwyn's party have voted against #Wales having a say in the #Brexit negotiations, Not really any fucking surprise there,Labour serve only two things, Themselves and London...
"I'm the rebel" says Ken Clarke in a #Brexit bill debate, apparently he's not very happy  
British society is currently not going through its finest hour due to the ongoing process of #brexit. It is understandable that an external enemy is direly needed to distract public attention for which role Russia has been chosen. It is deeply regrettable 
Just voted for @Plaid_Cymru amendment to #EUWithdrawalBill to give devolved administrations a greater say on #Brexit  - don’t understand why most Labour MPs didn’t
 Tory and Labour MPs joined together to reject the place of devolved administrations within the #Brexit process. Get the fact here. #EUWithdrawalBill
#DavidDavis and the #Brexit vote illusion... my cartoon for tomorrow's @Independent.
So here’s @Nigel_Farage thanking Ken Clarke for calling him the most successful politician of his generation #Brexit 
Frank Field is far too good to be a member of this @UKLabour party!#Brexit#EUWithdrawalBill
‘This house cannot veto #Brexit’ Bernard Jenkin MP. Wrong, yes it can. Parliament is sovereign!
Surely then, Labour MPs, especially Welsh ones should be supporting the @Plaid_Cymru amendment tonight to make Wales's voice matter on #Brexit? Otherwise they are voting to deny Wales a say. 
We now have the leading political figure behind #brexit railing against gays & Jewish money. Guys trust me as a resident of Germany this is not going to end well. #brexit 
Dominic Grieve says he seriously doubts the competence of the UK Govt in light of amendment 381 which fixes exit day in stone and he won't vote for it. He's not alone #EUWithdrawalBill #brexit
Emerging from court, I gather I might have missed a storming Ken Clarke MP calling out a lot of nonsense. #Brexit
As a #PATRIOTIC #BRITISH #JEW who voted #Leave, this is how I see the so called #EuropeanUnion which was founded by Ex #Nazis such as #WalterHallstein founding President of the #Brussels #EUCommission! #UK #EU #NEWS #BBC #SKY #TORY #LABOUR #UKIP #Libdems #USA #BREXIT #ITV
Dominic Grieve now describes Government amendment to its own Bill as "mad" - very strong stuff from a figure respected across the House of Commons #Brexit
Division that #brexit created no more obvious when biggest cheers came from the other side of the chamber 
This Government’s in total denial about the impact of #Brexit on the NHS staffing crisis - my question this morning. 
.@theresa_may & @NicolaSturgeon are expected to discuss #Brexit, the UK budget, & sexual harassment in politics
Ken Clarke delivers an outstanding speech during #EUwithdrawalbill debate and he gets a hearty round of applause at the end.  #Brexit 
How many Brits know anything about Georges Soros? But here retweeted by Arron Banks is Nigel Farage attacking him. Guess who does hate and loathe Soros, that's right, Vladimir Putin! Putin's #Brexit tools!#StopBrexit
Pretty clear today from #FrankFields principled speech on #Brexit that most Labour MPs are still in thrall with the EU.....even if their constituents aren’t.  Top bloke Frank. 
A fantastic speech by @StephenGethins. He absolutely shredded the Leave argument. Wonderful to watch. #Brexit #EUWithdrawalBill
For crying out loud, exploiting the narrow referendum win for full-blown turbo #Brexit is nothing short of insane. #StopTheMadness #StopBrexit
Jacob Rees-Mogg speech today on plan for extreme hard #Brexit race to the bottom Britain backed by Liam Fox - until his Department caught out and had to delete their tweet... Thanks to @guardian spotting and screen-grabbing.
#brexit Ken Clarke gets huge round of applause for making the pro EU case. It's amazing what you can do with a good vocabulary, experience, evidence, facts and an unimpeachable logic #eudebate #parliament
Tory Traitor trying to wreck #Brexit & keep us in the #EU by the backdoor @NickyMorgan01
Not funny: The official account of the Leave (the EU) campaign in the UK posts a video depicting Guardian journalist @carolecadwalla being repeatedly physically assaulted. The journalist has been investigating the campaign's financing and Russian interference in the #Brexit vote. 
Magnificent speech from the Big Beast #KenClarke on why it’s so important we get #Brexit right
Putin wants #Brexit and @Theresa_May and the Tories are delivering it. #StopBrexit
Ken Clarke points out the idiocy of fixing an immovable #Brexit day in law; negotiations couldn’t be extended even if all parties wanted so to do.
Setting a date for withdrawal from the #EU in the Withdrawal Bill is mere political window dressing by a government in chaos #Brexit 
‘Our departure from the EU is a settled matter’ @PaulBlomfieldMP (Shadow Existing the EU Minister) just now in the Commons. No it’s not! If the #Brexit deal is ruinous to Britain we must have an option to #Remain
Another ridiculous excuse following on from all Brexiteers were either uneducated, racists or taken in by the £350M ! Grow up and realise it was more the thought of an #EU experimental superstate run by unelected elitist #liberal politicians! #Brexit 
What a bizarre country we've become. The PM complains about Russian interference to destroy western institutions but demands everyone carry out the results of Putin's interference just the same with #brexit. 
Aston Martin warns "semi catastrophic" no deal #Brexit would mean temporarily stopping production. People’s jobs are on the line, but still the hard Brexiteers are peddling the fantasy that we could crash out of Europe with no deal.
Frank Field argues with fellow Labour MPs about the views of Labour voters on #Brexit 
Astonishing.Lab MPs are trying to shout down their elder statesman Frank Field just because he is speaking in favour of #Brexit.He tells them some home truths.Many of the Lab MPs represent #Brexit constituencies but they are hell bent on keeping us in the EU.
A great shot of @frankfieldteam standing up for #Brexit and facing down colleagues in his own party during #EUWithdrawalBill debate.
Frank Field is making some great arguments, much to the annoyance of his own party, especially highlighting the Barnier rule of 'All take and no give'. #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit
Grim #Brexit news from recent days (1/6): Food price inflation at 4-year high.#ThanksBrexiters
#Inflation has peaked at 3%. Interest rates have soared to 0.5%. #Employment at record highs. #Unemployment at record lows. All sectors of the economy growing. Budget deficit still falling. Damned #Brexit  
So much for the SNP listening to people. They will use any excuse to have #IndyRef2. It’s a complete outrage. Nicola Sturgeon needs to take this threat off the table immediately. End the games - and stop using #Brexit to try to split our country in two. 
who needs Putin or Russian bots when we have Theresa May and Paul Dacre #brexit

On my way to London. I've been invited to the Spanish Consulate to talk about the impact of #Brexit onto the recruitment & retention of Nurses from Spain into #NHS.

“Tory policy chief warns of 'very real prospect' of national decline after #Brexit” Are the current government & MP's the ones who will turn the UK into a 2nd or 3rd tier nation, or will they finally take a stand? 
The existing deal is better than a good deal, a bad deal or no deal. #Brexit
Oil & gas billionaire Jim Ratcliffe is very happy about #Brexit.He thinks the EU is too expensive.He also thinks workers' pensions are too expensive.Brexit: sticking it to the global elite. 
The Public Accounts Committee report exposes the major threat Brexit poses to our ports, businesses & food supply. Thousands of businesses risk being left in the lurch because of the extreme #Brexit this gvt has chosen.  
On #BREXIT @ForBritainParty is clearWe should LEAVE without further delayNO divorce paymentsNO transition periodNO more open door EU immigrationNO more foreign boats in UK's fishing groundsNO more kowtowing to EU lawYES to free trade with EUYES to good relations with EU
They have done more damage to the unity of Europe  Than the Russians have done in the last 70 years#Brexit weakens the very fabric of Europe’s security 
A new poll reveals that 62% of Brits believe the EU is trying to punish the UK for #Brexit. 
Why is an official Government Twitter account endorsing a report produced by discredited, voodoo economics who support a hard #Brexit 
Eh? Any decent human being wouldn't have appointed #Johnson, never mind got rid of him. UK is screwed by people like him. #Brexit
A referendum is the natural conclusion to the #brexit process. On December 11th Parliament will debate a motion for a "referendum on the final Brexit deal". Demand your MP let the people decide what kind of Brexit, if any, we want! Sign the HoC petition!

#brexit European parliament president Antonio Tajani wants to double spending to £250 billion. Thank heavens we're leaving
It's perfectly obvious: #EUWithdrawalBill vote forces Labour to vote for it, or be blamed for the no-deal #Brexit disaster. The vote is about Tory survival, nothing else.
Does anyone really believe this, apart from Hardline Brexiteers? #Brexit is biggest act of UK economic self-harm since mid-70s when IMF support was needed. At least then Jim Callaghan was honest about how bad things were! 
If you want to understand what kind of racist misinformation and propaganda Russian paid-for accounts have been spreading, tune in tomorrow...We have made a collection, and it will disturb you #Brexit #BrexitRussia
Every single person in the UK is a victim of #brexit and this shambolic government.
What if there is no #Brexit deal before 29/3/19?We leave anyway.Adopt WTO tariffs.UK will be £7,000,000,000 a yr BETTER off.We can use that windfall to fund NHS,elderly,schools etc.#HappyDays
For the #Brexit Steering Group in the European Parliament the priority are the citizens' rights. EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU should not be the victims of a Brexit #Eplenary
Last week we have seen again that there is no progress in #Brexit negotiations. It cannot continue like this. We only have one more year. Let’s move forward #EPlenary
Ooops...looks like we've taken back control from Europe and ceded it to tiny group of self-interested, wealthy (many with their money safely invested offshore) Eurosceptic ideologues, instead!#Brexit#TakeBackControl

When will it sink in to ministers' heads that the way the government is taking us on #brexit has catastrophic consequences for the British economy:
Theresa May is currently the worst PM in the world.Using #Russia as scapegoat for her failures in #Brexit negotiations and other domestic issues won't help her to regain popularity. 
Not what he says on TV when extolling virtues of #Brexit which he campaigned for: John Redwood criticised over advice to pull money out of UK 
I much prefer this photo ..... #farage #brexit (c/o @SebDance)
A worrying number of doctors are considering leaving the UK as a result of the #Brexit vote; we need an end to the uncertainty about what the future holds for our EU workforce 
More clarity on #Brexit. I thought #Scotland was staying in #EU ....come on @NicolaSturgeon you're not going to get anything out of May . Time to go.
Investigation into #brexit leave campaign – including possible links to Russia and offshore funds - reaching “hysteria”, claims Nigel Farage 
Almost one in five of the #NHS ’s European doctors have made plans to quit Britain, according to research that has raised fresh fears of a #Brexit-induced medical brain drain.
Most Conservative MPs voted remain to keep David Cameron happy and improve their chances of promotion.  That’s how it works, in all parties. They are now quite happy to #Brexit 
#Matt on life in Parliament right now! #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit  
No @Anna_Soubry you haven't accepted 'the will of the people' or do you want to #Brexit. You need to stop pandering to a select few metropolitan remain elites and lay the foundations for a clean break @BBCBreaking

SNP threatens #indyref2 if Scotland ignored on #Brexit 
The PM has said a foreign power interfered with the EU Ref. We need to revoke article 50 and have an independent inquiry into the EU referendum. #StopBrexit #Brexit 
Parliament must have a vote on #Brexit BEFORE the deal is signed otherwise it is meaningless. Knowing 70-80% of the deal is sufficient. Art50 also allows the March 2019 deadline to be put back.
Euro Economy Is Heading Towards a Golden Period. But it’s a very different story for Britain because of #Brexit 
Brexit: will business pull the plug? - Yesterday, business leaders met Mrs May, someone who knows even less than they do about Brexit ...  #Brexit. 
The linked article to this argues that a second referendum is a statutory requirement. Subject to the views of constitutional lawyers it makes sense to me. What I can't understand is how it's been overlooked until now. But it might mean the end of #brexit. 
We know @LeaveEUOfficial encouraged the death threats to @thatginamiller. If there's ANY sign any other #Brexit campaign colluded with the foreign sponsored racism of the last two years, they should be barred from public office

So, this evening @DavidDavisMP played a blinder by backing #Brexit rebel MP’s into a corner..And our lovely PM @Theresa_May just called out Putin &Russia’s interference in Western Politics. All in all I’d say it’s been a great day to be a #Brexiteer & a #Conservative. #Proud
When I met you after #Brexit @OliverHealdUK you said that #A50 was not the time to object, rather that time would come with the #EUWithdrawalBill. That time has come, so I hope you  be true to your word and stand up against this bill to prevent our country from further damage.
So we acknowledge Russian interference in elections such as #Brexit but to stay in power I’m gonna plough ahead with it.  #StopBrexit Ps she confirms @J_amesp ‘s #AlternativeWar !
Somehow there has got to be a way to get ourselves out of this #Brexit mess. If only we could turn the clocks back 2 years, rather than 70...

Great news on #Brexit today and clever stuff from the GOV either support us in getting a deal or be responsible for no deal. #ImWithMay #BecauseOfTories
Jesus. I know you’ve got the right to protest but Good Lord, it’s enough to make you want to leave with No Deal #Brexit 
Wouldn’t it be great if #Remainers in @UKLabour @Conservatives @LibDems @TheGreenParty @Plaid_Cymru @theSNP got together to form a national anti #Brexit government? A nice dream!
When Mike Hind of @TheNewEuropean talks about elderly #Brexit voters being killed off by a "bad winter" and predicts their grandchildren will "spit on their graves", he's referring to men like Geoffrey Pattison.

All the UK's big car plants are foreign owned, and mostly ship their cars abroad to Europe. #Brexit is therefore a big problem. 
So UK vote Leave. Tories go hard #Brexit that no one wants, call election for mandate, don't get it, carry on regardless, now pretend only 2 options - their deal or no deal, when reversing perfectly possible. And no one thinks this is a coup??? 
Davis David will give Parliament a vote on #Brexit deal, but it is a classic “false dilemma”. Totally ignores the option of abandoning #Brexit 
In July 1997 we accepted the surrender of the Provisional IRA. In November 2017 we now accept the surrender of @sinnfeinireland.Onwards to #DirectRule and #Brexit.  
I presume the MPs gasped because it’s a load of tosh from Davis, not because they actually believed him?#Brexit 
In what amounts to parliamentary blackmail, David Davis has stated that Britain will leave the EU without a deal if MPs vote down any EU #Brexit deal. So much for all of that Brexiter "taking back control of parliamentary sovereignty."
She said it. She meant it. #DealOrNoDeal #Brexit
@Russia tried to recruit me in every possible way, including by my pro- #Brexit ideology. I told them to go and pound sand. USIC and UKIC doubtless were all over me and liked what they saw. God Save the Queen :)
That’s what we call “moral consistency”. If @putinRF meant the vote was not free or fair we must redo it.I will still campaign to Leave. #Brexit

Judgement in my and @mishcondereya case will be upheld! #Parliament will get binding vote on final #Brexit deal!
.@DavidDavisMP A parliamentary vote simply isn’t good enough. The people voted to leave the EU, they should get to decide whether to accept the deal the government has negotiated. If they reject the government's Brexit deal, they must have the option to stay in the EU. #Brexit
BBC News - Parliament to get binding vote on final #Brexit deal 
At a popular level #Brexit is about an English nationalism for which Ireland is a far away country of which we know little and care less. #StopBrexit
Pretty funny, though, to watch #DavidDavis argue points of law re: #ECJ with a QC:#KeirStarmer#Brexit 
Parliament will get vote on final deal before. Start writing, texting, tweeting your MPs now. Let them know how you feel. Stop the madness. #Brexit

The Eurozone is heading toward a golden period of low-inflationary expansion in  stark contrast to the outlook for the U.K. The claims that the Eurozone was collapsing were just more #LeaveLies.#StopBrexit #Brexit
From punching above our weight to punching each other: how #Brexit diminishes Britain on the world stage
#KeirStarmer obfuscation over #Brexit is just a smoke screen. All Labour want is power to introduce their totalitarian Marxist agenda. That’s it. Nothing more to see.
Some British Asians voted for #Brexit because they believed promises that it would lead to freer immigration from south Asia. They should note that much support for Brexit stems from a xenophobia which could quite easily turn against them. #StopBrexit
Speaking of campaign posters ...The #Danish Social-Liberal Party has this one out:“Worried about #Brexit? Let #Denmark fix it!” 
#Brexit is going to be bad..@Lord_Sugar knows it. Encouraging the .@Conservatives to jump out of the moving car then claim no responsibility. Shameful.
I don't normally recommend articles so highly but this from @J_amesp lays out convincingly & well sourced the way democracy in UK & US is being subverted by Putin & his western allies. A must read for those interested in #brexit & #Trump
Poor old Ian Duncan Smith clearly not in the loop that as matter of law under #Art50 a transitional deal means we stay under jurisdiction of #ECJ #brexit #RealityCheck @BBCr4today
Sir James Dyson has said that “the time has come” for the UK to walk away from the EU without a #Brexit deal...
The economic consequences of #Brexit are becoming clearer by the day. Self inflicted damage we can still reverse. 
Michael Gove's 'Green' #Brexit ?  What a tragedy.  
Trade deals made by #EU are subject to democratic control: ratification by @Europarl_EN & (often) 28 gov’ts in Council. Seems UK gov’t wants to avoid parliamentary scrutiny of post #Brexit trade deals. 
Interesting @Keir_Starmer interview on @BBCr4today re Labour's new position on #ECJ.  However it's really pretty clear that UK will remain subject to #ECJ during transitional period. Time for @theresa_may to fess up #Brexit #RealityCheck
The dream team is back together, not just trying to rescue Boris but also holding a gun to the PM's head. Is this desperation because they can see the wheels coming off #Brexit?  I think so. 
Suffering from #Brexit blindness? Here’s three reasons why businesses should prepare and plan now > 
As May faces possible defeats on #Brexit votes, ministers are ‘aghast’ at demands for hard Brexit from Gove &Johnson 
500 days since #Brexit vote summarized:- Jun '16-Mar '17: UK preparing Art50- Apr '17-Jun '17: UK preparing election- Since Jul '17: UK preparing May successionWhen will UK prepare Brexit?
UK's #Brexit negotiator: “(British taxpayers) would not want me to just come along and just give away billions of pounds" On the other hand, they seem happy to follow a strategy that costs hundreds if not thousands of billions...
Barnier confirms how petty minded, shallow and vindictive the EU are. Time to plan our walk out. #Brexit 
Polls now consistently showing a majority believe #Brexit was a mistake. This is in the face of overwhelming forecasts ranging from "bad for our country" to "total economic collapse." Why are our elected representatives letting this happen?! #StopBrexit
Dyson wants less workers rights, no Corporation Tax, he took his manufacturing away from UK, he wants to avoid paying Tax....Sounds like he's looking out for himself, rather than UK Public.Well, that's put me right off buying #Dyson Products.#Brexit or #Remain Go #HENRY
I am increasingly concerned that we are headed for a no deal #Brexit that will lead to rapid collapse of our economy. I predict that we will shortly see the collapse of May's govt & a snap GE early 2018. What's next is anybody's guess; is there still a chance we can #StopBrexit?
I’m pro #Brexit because our laws should be made by our elected representatives not unelected officials in a foreign country and because as a major economy we should trade worldwide unrestrained by #EU restrictions.
Quite right Jess that's why the majority voted for #Brexit and kept Labour out. 
Feeling sympathy for @Anna_Soubry on @BBCWestminHour where the 2 other pro #brexit panelists seem to wish to portray reasonable scrutiny of #EUWithdrawalBill as treason & sabotage. Ridiculous
It gets worse. Politics is not about putting one’s finger in one’s ear and saying, “I can’t hear you”. Leave if you want one, but for Christ’s sake do it competently #brexit 
The EU is an abscess in the TORY Party that cannot be drained #BrexitIt has been the *Nemesis* of Tory LeadersIt *did* for Major, Hague, IDS, Cameron - and it will *do* for May.It will haunt the Tories like Banquo's Ghost.
Thanks @ChukaUmunna for keeping up the pressure - need the whole of @UKLabour now to stand up and protect us from the abyss #Brexit #Remain
The Tories have sunk the ship, and now they are over-turning the lifeboats. Only an idiot would want to drown alongside these fools. Cut them adrift. Sail to oblivion, failures #Brexit
Brussels negotiator Michel Barnier admits UK may QUIT trade talks WITHOUT paying Brexit blackmail of £88Billion.On 29 March 2019, Britain will become an independent sovereign nation free of EU interference...#Brexit #EU
#Brexit is for the few, not the many . Surprising Labour hasn’t woken up to that yet… 
As someone on here reminded me, what about Gibraltar? Haven’t heard anything about there in ages but obviously would pose huge issues too #brexit 
In the 70's @theSNP said that the oil in Scottish waters was worth 10 times what the UK Gvnt said. In the 80's SNP said Thatcher would decimate Scotland's industries. In the 90's SNP said UK intervention in Iraq would be disastrous. SNP said #Brexit would be bad for Scotland. 
Wanted, an opposition to #Brexit @TheGreenParty @LibDems @theSNP @Plaid_Cymru most @UKLabour members and voters (Just not the leadership) So join forces!

James Dyson - "There is fantastic opportunity outside Europe, there is an opportunity within in Europe, but Europe is the slowest growing area in the world, all the other areas are much faster growing." #Brexit 
A pleasure speaking to @bbcnickrobinson for his @BBCRadio4 “Political Thinking” series on #Brexit, leadership, @UKLabour, the Centre Left, my family and much more
Sorry to be thick but why are the views of James Dyson, a manufacturer of electrical goods in Malaysia & Singapore, relevant to #Brexit? Can’t we get the views of someone who believes in Britain?
Somewhere in the DUP's dark soul they know he's thinking 'Way around it? Irish unity!'#Brexit 
Patrick Minford says #Brexit's great because there's a growth dividend by mid 2020s.  But....

A major reason for us to #StopBrexit, so that creeps like  James Dyson, Richard Branson, Tim Martin, Arron Banks etc don't do us over for their gain. Advocates of #Brexit are billionaires who don't care about the ordinary people, let alone the poor.
50 London banks are in advanced talks with the European Central Bank about moving operations to the European mainland. As #Brexit nears, they are considering Frankfurt, Paris or Dublin.

The true meaning of #Brexit revealed by James Dyson: "Britain should scrap corporation tax and make it easier to hire and fire workers". A Dickensian future beckons.
Those that say #Article50 can be reversed (including Lord Kerr) have obviously not seen this...  #Brexit #EU #Freedom #Leave
How much more suffering can our badly led country take is the real question?! There's doggedness & there's arrant dogmatic stubbornness in pursuit of #Brexit at any cost...the cost will be high & we'll all be the losers. Stop her #StopBrexit now.
The real #Brexit agenda creeps further forward - & another reason labour must oppose leaving the EU. 
The disaster that is #Brexit continues. 62% voted Remain @ScotTories @RuthDavidsonMSP
An open #border and leaving the #CustomsUnion are mutually exclusive - @Toibin1 tells #twip #Brexit 
Being callous about the deaths of anyone doesn't show your strong support for Europe only for intolerance. And you won't keep Britain in Europe with that attitude. #Brexit 
I mean the way the Irish political class accept a situation where the German government has a veto over our relationship with the UK is baffling to me. Tell them to get stuffed. We're an independent country. #Brexit 
Pay less tax, and be able to fire people at will. #brexit was always a plan to enrich the wealthy by impoverishing the poor.
James Dyson has torn into the EU for demanding a sky-high divorce bill and said Britain should walk away from the #Brexit talks. via @MailOnline

10 UK regions to hit Fishing JACKPOT after BrexitBritain to see UK Fishing industry BOOM by 50%, creating 30,000 extra jobs & regenerating seaside towns & BOOSTING UK economy by £3 BILLIONLet's get on with #Brexit#EU
Dyson on #Marr said the government should give car manufacturers £10billion /yr post-#Brexit to help with tariff but EU membership only cost us £9bn. I am no engineer, brexiteer  or a Sir but the maths doesn't add up.
I don't disagree, Al. As a businessman, his mind is finely honed. My point is, he's supporting #Brexit for his own narrow purposes, not the greater good he purports.
"We will be ready if that happens" - says @DavidDavisMP of a potential 'No Deal' #Brexit #Paterson

John Redwood: Lets have a budget that helps UK for a change!Instead of giving away our money for talks with #EU the Treasury should spend UK taxpayers money on UK priorities.That's what we voted for in referendum.There is no need to pay to talk!#Brexit
John Redwood MP: The EU overplays its hand...It is a bit rich EU demanding more money or else no talks on trade.There can only be one answer to that bullying – NO money...There is no need to pay to talk!#Brexit #EU
Dyson is economically illiterate about #brexit. On #marr he stated the government (aka taxpayers) should compensate car manufacturers for 10% EU tariffs on UK car exports. He wants to retain engineers in UK but leaving EU means quotas on foreign skilled workers #brexitshambles
Sir James Dyson giving a great account of WHY #Brexit is such a good idea DESPITE #Marr.
#MichaelGove "backed the EU" and "Experts praised him for listening to the evidence" How about you do the same regarding #Brexit??? Tosspot. #Stopbrexit
Dyson, one of the few business people supporting #Brexit, who has no production in the UK, is interviewed on @MarrShow. Why not interview the huge number of UK based industrialists at risk from Brexit?
Jeremy Corbyn is the only politician who can get us to a second EU referendum. He should state his Euroscepticism, but announce that a Labour government would legislate for a second referendum because he's come to the conclusion that #Brexit would be an economic catastrophe.
Anyone else desperate to see the revival our fishing industry and seaside towns? This part our identity, as a small island nation, was stolen from us and can’t be returned soon enough #BREXIT
It’s almost like there’s some kind of connection but I can’t think what it is.Why would they want to leave the EU?The EU’s bringing in the Anti Tax Avoidance Directive on 1st January 2019.Nope, still can’t think of a connection. #PanamaPapers#ParadisePapers#Brexit pic.twitter.com/NiVbG4PxUU
Showing remarkable patience with an abusive #Brexit ranter, @EdwardJDavey sets out reality. #EU membership enabled UK to multiply its influence in many fields - foreign policy, trade etc.
The EU have agreed to spend half a trillion euros by 2020 investing in development programmes across member states - in particular to poorer areas. The spending aims to promote growth and free trade. The UK will receive none of this new EU investment because of #Brexit.
#Brexit Britain alone will be economic carrion preyed on by vultures. In trade there is strength in EU numbers 
Imagine a project manager coming back to his paymaster 500 days after getting his brief and admitting he's got no plan, nothing at all. That's David Davis and his #Brexit negotiations.
Heart sinks at prospect of more #brexit “advice” from Gove and Johnson ... 
Cornwall (#brexit supporting county) says crops ‘rotting in fields’ due to Brexit labour shortage 
There is only one coherent Tory #Brexit policy - to turn Britain into a brutal ultra-free market economy, in which the #NHS and the welfare state are all but eliminated. But that is a policy they cannot publicly admit to. So instead they spout mendacious drivel.#StopBrexit
You can't negotiate credibly when any threat you make involves hurting yourself much more than the other party.And you can't negotiate credibly when you won't offer something the other party wants, such as Single Market membership.#StopBrexit #Brexit

British ppl now waking up to the truth abt #Brexit. Being in the EU gives Britain huge advantages that we lose if we leave. Why throw our future away? 
Its is a scandal.Its also a scandal its so under reported. Many who are pro remain don't even realize that they are now in the majority - the press keep saying remainers have reluctantly accepted #Brexit but this is just another layer of lies. 
But we haven't changed our minds and we won't. Additionally, the worse the negotiations become the stronger and more united the #brexit resolve will become.

Even if you dispute the accuracy of the polls, they show the folly of implementing #Brexit on the basis of such a tiny majority on one day in June 2016. A small shift in public opinion is all it takes to invalidate the referendum result.

Margaret Thatcher reiterated Lord Attlee's warning that the referendum is a "device of dictators and demagogues" May's comment on not being willing to "tolerate" attempts to slow or block Brexit shows just how right their warning was.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FinalSay
#Brexit is not merely a matter of leaving the EU. It is being used by this venal, mendacious & incompetent government to drive an authoritarian wedge into the heart of our democracy. The struggle against Tory #Brexit is a struggle for democracy.
The #Brexit Network and its Russian Origins. Artfully explained by @J_amesp
"We will not tolerate attempts to..." A democratic leader would say something like "We will resist attempts to...". But Theresa May prefers the language of a dictator seeking to silence democratic opposition. /1#StopBrexit #Brexit #FinalSay
I have applied for an exemption to #Brexit.You can do the same.Just write to:The Prime Minister (for now)No 10 Downing StreetLondon SW1
Labour could throw out May and her rabble of self interested, crooked xenophobes, if they just came out against #Brexit

Yeah we knew. That’s the Article 50 deadline.Might you possibly tell us *how* and under what terms the UK will leave? Might be handy!#Brexit 
RT UK Government confirm Northern Ireland will be leaving the Single Market and Customs Union along with rest of the UK, and there will be no internal border within UK. It's up to EU if they impose a hard border between North and South of Ireland. #Brexit

Once again: If you voted to leave the EU, then trusted the Labour Party at the general election, you've been well and truly conned.They want to overturn your referendum vote, and aren't even trying to hide the fact now.#Brexit 
Dear @MichelBarnier, I just wanted to say that I am one of the 16,141,241 decent British people who voted to REMAIN in the EU;  and whatever happens, I am immensely proud to be a EUROPEAN...#Brexit #RemainInEU

Good Friday Agreement may prevent north from being cut from EU after #Brexit, says SDLP  
This might surprise a few but if #Brexit wasn’t happening the economy would still be crashing and ppl would still be starving. Stop blaming Brexit for the effects of austerity.
Labours #Brexit negotiating stance translates to “ The meek shall inherit the earth.....if that’s all right with the rest of you “.
Reminder: When weighted by circulation there was an 82% to 18% bias in favour of Leave in the national press during the referendum campaign. Why respect the referendum result?#StopBrexit #Brexit #FinalSay
& this more than incompetence is why May & her autocratic #Brexit cabal must go...because she states categorically we the Ppl aren't allowed to change our minds; that is a patent denial of a fundamental democratic principle.We can & we will. #FinalSay 2018 #StopBrexit #LeaveGate
Quite. @theresa_may has added the date and time to the #Brexit bill because she's aware that more and more people want to #StopBrexit. She's trying to take the option of changing their mind away from Leave voters. WHY?
Sorry but the EU made very clear the substantive trade elements of #Brexit wd only be discussed in phase II. For goods (esp) moving across Irish border, that cant be tackled suddenly now as a condition for "sufficient progress"
THE GOOD NEWS: From 11pm, 29 March 2019, Britain will no longer have the highest rates of childhood obesity, divorce, cocaine use, gonorrhoea & teenage pregnancy in the #EU. THE BAD NEWS:  That's because we'll no longer be in EU.#ExitDay #Brexit #brexitshambles #Withdrawal
Beyond the spin, each round of #Brexit negotiations is the embodiment of nationalist post-imperial fantasy crashing into implacable economic reality.And -despite horrific consequences for me personally- I recognise it's an adjustment to the British psyche that was well overdue.
"We are not required to withdraw just because Mrs May sent her letter. We can change our minds at any stage during the process," says Lord Kerr, the architect of Article 50 #Brexit 
On #BREXIT @ForBritainParty is clearWe should LEAVE without further delayNO divorce paymentsNO transition periodNO more open door EU immigrationNO more foreign boats in UK's fishing groundsNO more kowtowing to EU lawYES to free trade with EUYES to good relations with EU
Enjoying the benefits of tax-havens - the right-wing Brexiters cheating the British people, including Rees-Mogg, Arron Banks, Andrea Leadsom and the owners of the Daily Telegraph. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FinalSay

If no significant progress is made on #Brexit negotiations very soon, I see no chance for opening of 2nd phase @EPPGroup
We have 2 weeks to explain how we are to pay the ‘divorce bill’ - how about we give them 2 weeks to explain how they came up with the figure and why! #Brexit
We fully agree with @MichelBarnier on divorce financial settlement: we have waited long enough and need concrete results. #Brexit @EPPGroup
Author of #Article50 is clear that no legal barrier to revocation if the public changes its mind on #Brexit. Thanks Lord Kerr.
“I think the British people have the right to know this. They shouldn’t be misled.” “We are not required to withdraw just because .@theresa_may sent her letter.” #Brexit 
 Read @MichelBarnier’s statement from today’s press conference following this week’s #Brexit negotiations:  @EU_Commission
This will come as no surprise to those of us who have been consulting with businesses in our constituencies & across Scotland. It's time for the @ScotTories to start listening to business on #Brexit & #immigration
Barnier confirms UK has 2 weeks to progress on #Brexit divorce issues otherwise won't begin talks on trade and transition in Dec
 Encouraging that the weaker £ is starting to boost both manufacturing and exported goods. A positive from #Brexit I guess.

The national debate about Brexit should take account of all the facts. Once out, there is not easy way back in, and there would be a price to pay. While still in, the option to stop the clock to consult the British people is always open, says Lord Kerr #Article50 #Brexit
Reminder: Prominent Brexiter John Redwood advised investors to avoid Britain as the country’s economy “hits the brakes”. Before the vote Redwood advised that the “economic gains of leaving the EU will be considerable”. …#StopBrexit #Brexit #LeaveLies
Incredibly important #Brexit intervention this morning from Lord Kerr, who wrote #Article50. The British people have the right to unilaterally change their mind on Brexit, despite what the Government says. #Article50 can be revoked.
David Cameron knows #Brexit is a disaster for Britain. But he stays quiet as he makes his millions. Shameful 
I am really puzzled by UK suggestions that agreements on the future relationship can be done by next year. Canadian agreement took 7 years. Getting widely drawn agreements ratified can be tricky, says Lord Kerr #Brexit #Article50
Most #EU leaders think #Brexit would be a disaster, worse for us but bad for all, says Lord Kerr. #Article50
May’s #Article50 letter was only notifying of the UK’s intention to withdraw. But intentions can change and people can change their mind, says Lord Kerr. The letter can be taken back. #Brexit
Reconciliation is still possible, and we are not required to withdraw just because of May’s letter... Time limit can be extended if all parties agree, says Lord Kerr #Article50 #Brexit
Packed house for Lord Kerr's crucial intervention on #Brexit. We can change our minds if we want to. That's democracy. 
Hard Bredixteers are attempting to hoodwink the British people by not being clear about the options available in the Brexit process. The Government are also refusing to publish their legal advice or #Brexit risk assessments. #Article50
Public opinion on #Brexit is shifting, the Tory party will be left holding the baby, says Lord Heseltine 
The Government has accepted the first of my four amendments for a slimline, Lords-proof #Brexit bill 
Fixing a date is "a panic measure" reflecting growing hostility to #Brexit, says Lord Heseltine 
#Brexit is "biggest disaster in peacetime", and announcing a date is going to "choke off the democratic process", says Lord Heseltine 
NEW REPORT CONDUCTED BY LEADING CITY ANALYST BOB LYDDO -EU Membership actually costs the UK £980m per week! Much more than what Vote Leave claimed (£350m) per week in the referendum campaign! 'THAT' bus looks like a very small charge now!  #Brexit
BIG news today:Article 50 author says Theresa May is misleading the public on reversing the result.#brexit CAN be stopped.RT 
In #Brexit news, Prime Minister @theresa_may has revealed that our EU exit date is to be enshrined in UK Law. 11pm, 29th March 2019, is party time folks.
Brexiters must be worried when @MailOnline publicises how children will be damaged by #Brexit Suffer the little children to have their future in hands of heartless Brexiters. Anyone happy with no deal Brexit wants no care for our neediest in society. Scrooge would vote Brexit 
#TheresaMay proposal to fix 29 March 2019 in law as  the exact and unchangeable #Brexit date is tying #Britain’s hands in the negotiations. “In ANY circumstances we’ll jump on that day”
Important reminder - UK can reverse #Article50 if it chooses #Brexit 
So true..am near despair with the lack of real inspiring Remain voices against this illegitimate unmandated #Brexit coup...how dare May say the Ppl have no right to reverse it & Corbyn just sit by waiting for his chance at power...what happened to the national interest? #FinalSay
The damage of #Brexit is clearer daily. The Government can - & should - rescind triggering Article 50: 
PM May is weak, the Tory gov is a shambles & our #Brexit negotiations are pathetic, but even if things were 100 times worse, they'd still be better than a Labour gov led by Jeremy Corbyn.
Talented women of #Brussels: you're 4 of the top 8 articles on @POLITICOEurope right now. More interesting to our readers than #Trump or #Brexit  #EU #women
Article 50: Theresa May and the government have been deliberately misleading the public about the most important aspect of Britain's most important post-1945 political decision.#JailTheLeaveLiars!#StopBrexit #Brexit
Writing a binding #Brexit day into law rules out an Art 50 extension. It keeps the impossible time pressure on us. Idiotic.
UK ministers must privately dread move to phase 2 of #Brexit negs. Will actually have to agree what they want & make choices.
After triggering article 50 Brexit date should be final but now there is a talk about transition periods and delays. Both EU and UK are making up the rules as they go along, this is not what the electorate voted for. It's a deliberate attempt to stop #Brexit. #Brexiters
#BrexitReports #BrexitPapers By contrast with #DavidDavis studies, the #Brexit Impact Studies by the European Parliament (@Europarl_EN ) are publicly available for all to see:
.@BBCRadio4 interviewer -'over 50% of the population voted for #Brexit'.Not true!Only 37% of electorate voted for Brexit, 27%  of population
Your morning briefing: @Theresa_May sets #Brexit time & date, Steven Seagal accused of sexual harassment, & other stories 41926787
I'd like to know why the deadline to publish was allowed to pass by without any ramifications. The Speaker gave Govt until Tuesday 7th November. Isn't the Govt now in contempt of Parliament? #Brexit
The Irish have no negotiation strength with the UK. But they will still try to stab us in the back over #brexit 
#Brexit dangers are becoming clearer by the day. Democracy must cope with the people changing their minds. Article 50 notice can just be withdrawn 
Lord Kerr on #BBCR4today: We have the ability to take back the Article 50 letter. We can change our minds on #Brexit whenever we want.
The Brexiters who put their money offshore including Leadsom and Rees-Mogg. Please share with Leaver friends the real motivation for #Brexit
Hugely important intervention on #Brexit by the man who invented Article 50 - John Kerr - we *can* change course:  
It is clear that David Davis has lied about the impact studies. He obviously cannot be trusted to be honest about #Brexit. Once again public being deceived about reality of what it means to country #FBPE  1
*** @jwsal: “If you voted to leave the EU, don't bother wearing a poppy”***What a bastard of a journalist! We voted to leave the EU to protect the freedoms & liberty so many gave their lives for!#Brexit
The shit that EU Citizens are being put through during this farce called #Brexit makes me sick to my core. If this is what being British is about in this day & age I am thoroughly ashamed of my country. Looking at Brexiteer sentiments makes it even worse. All ignorant.
#Brexit  negotiator Guy Verhofstadt is calling for Donald Trump to be ousted to make way for the unelected European Union to “protect the liberal world”.
When Trump won USA it seemed all the US press went to work to oust him, and he took them head on and won. I think Mrs May needs to see that and get started on the UK press. How do they not see we need to be perceived as strong and united for the benefit of all in the UK #brexit
Some people are saying we should stop using the #Brexit tag. That is where the neutrals, wavering and uncertain will look. We have to ensure that when people look at it they see our arguments. Retreating into a #StopBrexit echo-chamber will only aid our opponents.
May told to admit that #Brexit can be stopped. Lord Kerr — who drafted Article 50 — says she is making "a political decision to withhold the truth". 
Britain’s exit date from the EU - 11pm Irish time on March 29th 2019 - is to be enshrined in legislation, namely the EU Withdrawal Bill. This would make the UK’s first working day outside the EU April Fools Day #Brexit #ExitDay
Apparently it is a shock for the UK to now learn that there’s this whole, you know, #Brexit Irish border question? And - wait for it - Ireland can block progress on talks if it’s not solved. Wow. I honestly thought repeating empty platitudes would make it all go away.

Good read on what #brexit inflicts on uk politics  @nickreeves9876 @BrexitBin @Bregretears @acgrayling @jphcoleman
There's two ways of looking at this absolutely incredible video. Either the head of #NHS is expecting a #Corbyn led govt sometime soon or alternatively he is looking for a change of career. A politically devastating speech which keeps the #Brexit "£350m a week to NHS meme" alive. 
“The City of London and financial institutions will lose 1000s of jobs if we vote #Brexit”Errrr, No! 
1/ THREAD on how EU citizens in the UK could make a human rights complaint against both sides of the #Brexit negotiations.Based on law expert @dimitriosatBLS's article: 
As the EU and UK continue #Brexit negotiations, check out Parliament's position 
Barnier: we want to succeed in these negotiations - with the UK, not against the UK. #Brexit #obbligatiacrescere
The #UK is leaving the EU. It is now high time to clarify essential principles of orderly withdrawal. #Brexit
Good to hear Remainer, Robert Peston, now admitting that voting for #Brexit was the right thing to do...
Once article 50 had been triggered the date of leaving was set in stone, now we have talk about transition periods and delays. Both EU and UK seem to be making up the rules as they go along, this is not what the electorate voted for  it's a deliberate attempt to stop #Brexit.
Ireland relying on solidarity of other EU countries during #Brexit  negotiations. Most important AGRI meeting yet on the issue is on now. Only 3 out of 40 MEPs from outside ROI and UK are here. Alan matthews speaking to a near empty room. Solidarity? 
If the Brexit Impact Assessments say what we fear they will, then Labour must change its stance on #Brexit 
If you disagree with Iain Duncan Smith that "we are all #Brexiters now", you can let him know - email address on the webpage. Just a quick, polite email so as not to block his office inbox. One each. #Brexit
Last week MPs voted for the #Brexit studies to be released - now the Government faces contempt for failing to do so.
1. New round of #Brexit talks in Brussels today & #Prexit behind us, let's take stock of what EU papers are saying in Ep 100 of 'Nothing Has Changed.' (Thread.)
Round 6 of #brexit talks or dancing round a standstill? What I'm hearing: 
"We are all Brexiteers now," says Iain Duncan Smith on #R4Today. No. Only 26.7% of the population actually voted for #Brexit...and many of those probably now have buyer's remorse. 
Useful #brexit discussions in #Dublin. In both Norway’s & #EU’s interest to find orderly solution. Integrity of single market crucial #EEA
So Iain Duncan Smith told @BBCr4today that we're "all #Brexiteers now". Just for the record - no we're bloody well not! There are a huge amount of people in the UK who hate #Brexit and want to #StopBrexit . #r4today
I hope that the many scandals involving #Tory politicians aren't distracting people from the #Brexit papers that might or might not exist... #StopBrexit @Conservatives @UKLabour @LibDems

Brexiters are saying that people are going after Johnson and Patel because they were leading figures for #Brexit. I think it's more they are both liars, cheats and FOUND OUT. #getagrip
Priti Patel is sorry she has served as a distraction from the disastrous #brexit cock up and Westminster Sex Scandal, involving 36 Senior Tory Sex Pests 
We support #PritiPatel @patel4witham who supported #BREXIT & 17,410,742 people! Priti you may have resigned today, but you will be back in Government soon! Hopefully in a #BREXIT one without the #Remainer @theresa_may! #NEWS #SKY #BBC #UK #EU #ConservativeParty @Conservatives
#Brexit: European Parliament says Britain's new offer on EU #citizensrights is inadequate.
Voters were massively misinformed on major issues before the #Brexit referendum, in every case in favour of #Leave. John Major said it would be deceitful if a vote for Brexit was based on inaccurate information.#StopBrexit
I share your concern, @BBCNews is now totally out of control, absolutely no attempt to provide a balance. Relentless and gleeful, anti-government, anti-#Brexit propaganda. 
So let me get this right: #brexit doesn't have a risk assessment but that's not the scandal. #boris has condemned a UK citizen to 5 more years in Iran, but wait #damiengreen, but hang on there's #PritiPatel, and Theresa May is definitely strong & stable but can't sack anyone.
Riots predicted if #Brexit is cancelled, really?More likely to be riots if it goes ahead as the already disadvantaged get poorer and cannot feed themselves anymore. They will have nothing left to lose#Brexit is perfect breeding ground for civil unrest
Thank you @GuyVerhofstadtLet's put #PeopleB4Politics and deliver the #Brexit @LeaveEUOfficial/@michaelgove promise :"There will be no change for EU citizens already lawfully living in the UK, they will automatically be granted indefinite leave to remain and nothing will change"
Much hubris on the Patel story from the left, surely wouldn't have ANYTHING to do with their general widespread hatred of #Israel or #Brexit, no, not at all
Another #Brexit Tory MP defending Priti Patel on the BBC news..they don't give a toss about Parliament or its rules. Absolute pond life.
Someone tell me why @UKLabour is pro #Brexit, the most reactionary, illiberal, xenophobic policy ever foisted on the British people by super rich tax dodgers.
The British government is in the midst of a nervous breakdown #PritiLittleLiar #Brexit #WhipsOffice #DamienGreen #DUP #StrongandStable #May #BorisJohnson oops running out of characters...
& this is it Ladies & Gentlemen  - the reason why all those billionaires were happy to chuck a million or two into buying #brexit. They have still saved money. You won't. You will be paying for them to benefit. #ParadisePapers #stopbrexit
Progress towards a #Brexit deal on citizen's rights remains inadequate. Citizens were promised nothing would change. UK gov't now needs 25 paragraphs to explain how lives will change. Unacceptable! Full statement: 
Key to keep our eyes on #ParadisePapers & #Brexit referendum scandal & reports.Likely to be cats thrown on tables galore in the midst of these revelations . #PritiPatel
It takes a lot of British humour to understand that Caribbean islands with a corporate tax rate of zero should not be classified as tax havens, says my colleague @sven_giegold We must use #Brexit negotiations to shut down UK’s tax havens.

#Moody's say immediate economic impact of #Brexit "small" negative. No increases in unemployment or interest rates. 
#OEBrexit conclusions: in almost all plausible scenarios, the UK economy is smaller post #Brexit 
Telegraph columnist trying to capitalise on #Brussels by making political point for #Brexit - shameful! 
Quite wrong to exploit #BrusselsAttack for #Brexit. Equally wrong to use it to muzzle assessment of security and rational debate on policy.
All trains from London to Brussels cancelled - because we're safer being connected to Europe. #Brexit 
Brussels was a disgusting attack on ordinary peopleIt has FUCK ALL to do with #Brexit or NIreland 30yrs ago Simply condemn or fuck up.
Those trying to use #Brussels to further a political point (e.g. #Brexit) before the blood is even dry should just stop it.
Unsurprising but disgusting: #Brexit supporters + anti-refugee populists already trying to make political capital with #BrusselsAttacks
Thoughts are with the people of Brussels No nation in the world can protect its citizens without protecting its borders. #VoteLeave #Brexit
Please lets not conflate debates over #Brexit with the terrible news from #Brussels - safety, security and sovereignty is not that simple.

At least Iain Duncan Smith will be able to wake up tomorrow with a clear conscience and enjoy a good #brexit. Sorry, I mean breakfast. #IDS
Well that has seriously screwed Osbo's leadership bid. It's also done the #Brexit campaign no harm at all

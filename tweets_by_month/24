Do you want a second referendum on #Brexit? Vote and retweet for a big sample
#jumpedtheshark It’s almost disturbing to note how many remainers have, one by one, lost the plot over #Brexit. Someone will study this phenomena one day 
Even The Brexit Secretary Doesn't Believe Brexit Will Happen  #SkyPapers #Brexit #StopBrexit
Opposing #Brexit might be the best strategy for #Labour in 2018, says @eloisetodd in @LeftFootFwd :
AC Grayling is absolutely right in his assessment here:“One of the largest ever Twitter polls conducted on #Brexit180k votes, 20k RT's and from a public figure, not some bot buried deep in some echo chamber.67% for a second referendum on #Brexit.”A resounding result. 
The Domino Effect of #Brexit...  
This by Arron Banks about Russia could have come word for word from many a Corbynista. It is troubling that both the far-Right & far-Left share the same favourable attitude towards the de facto leader of Europe's fascists Vladimir Putin. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
British government & even @hmtreasury surely understand we cannot both increase UK diplomacy in Europe post #brexit and pursue new global agenda within same and already much reduced @foreignoffice budget. #notrocketscience
Just finished @DougSaunders book. Well-observed, intel, fact-based case for an open, growing in real 21st century trading world. Stark contrast to too many UK journo’s ideology-first #Brexit fantasies. 
Just when you thought #Brexit couldn't get any more embarrassing - Dad's Army as our border security. Across the country, octogenarian Kippers get their first stiffy in a decade. "Is there a uniform? Walkie-talkie? Hut and kettle? Do we get to hit brown people with a stick?" 
Abattoirs - one prominent #Brexit supporter’s example of “over regulation” by the EU. I’d say “give us more such regulation” and would like to see all abattoirs meet Soil Association Organic standards for animal welfare: p.78 
Lord Ashcroft poll: of 180,480 voters, 67% voted yes to a second #Brexit referendum, 28% voted no, and 5% voted don't know/don't care. This result is consistent with several others recently and is indicative of a significant shift in public opinion. #FBPE #StopBrexit
It's depressing, but since the #Brexit vote has been called, I've heard most of these. Any nice pro Indy Scot fancy marrying me? Then I could probably tick two more off!  Hey, it would give you an EU passport, so I'm not that bad a catch! #inlimbo #brexitshambles
Good idea let's see hundreds of "Brexit Will Make You Poor" in every town in the country #Stopbrexit #FBPE #Brexit #GuyVerhofstadt
#Brexit zealot who never misses an opportunity to spout bile about "Remoaners", which is one of her favourite ways of expressing how much she despises so many of her fellow citizens. That's #Brexit patriotism for you, folks. 
1. Agreed; strongly suspect if we leave there'll be no going back...soft #Remain won't want the Euro or a Fed EU nor soft leavers + soft #Brexit is harder in waiting anyway as Brits will not likepart PAY & OBEY but have NO SAY...we have to #StopBrext & STAY with the current deal
Nice little #Brexit dictatorship you got going there, @theresa_may
Adonis on #Brexit: ‘No mandarin backs May. Government has broken down’ -  lots of great quotes, to wit:
Not sure how this result can be dismissed as somehow rigged by Remainers. A sample size of over  180,000 with more than two thirds wanting a 2nd referendum on #Brexit. Interested in how the “conventional” poll goes. The tide appears to be turning at last. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Unbelievable default abusive & violent response to a principled stand. What do these people want the UK to be like post #Brexit? #Fascism
This...  Nail on the head.A percentage of those who didn't vote did not vote out of complacency. As most of the #Brexit news has been negative, non-voters will turn to #RemainAdd in those who are #RemainerNow + elderly #Leave voters now deceased.... #StopBrexit #FBPE
"After looking at the Brexit impact studies, we have decided that the best deal is no #Brexit. We demand a final say with option to #Remain, or you call a #generalelection2018 before this sham goes too far"Now you try @jeremycorbyn#FBPE
Here is my article today @ft surveying the #Brexit agenda for the year ahead and why #2018 is the time to look before we leap.... 
If the nation's conscience  sleeps when the government announces that  it's  going to corrupt its minors, like it happened in Britain, then this nation has reached the end of the road. Nothing else to add really.  #Brexit or no Brexit, the curtain has fallen.
#Brexit trade negotiations around the world finally turbocharged 
16. Truth is, the average person who voted for #Brexit is going to lose out financially. Power ultimately does not lie in Brussels as Brexiteer’s would have you believe. It lies in the Corporations, Banks, and City of London which have held UK democracy hostage for decades.
14. The #Brexit campaign was fought on the back of decades of lies. The Remain side started from an obvious disadvantage. But @David_Cameron, himself a PR man, must have known this when he called the EU Referendum.
#Brexit vote was largely manipulated by millionaire tax exiles and their subservient media. Don’t let them steal our European future! #FBPE
ObamaCare has been materially undone. Don't be gloomy, there's never been a better time to live. Media is UNDER-reporting #Brexit. UK parents of special needs kids are being forgotten. Today's #underreported themes 
Let’s make 2018 the year when this #Brexit madness is laid to rest #FBPE #StopBrexit!
MPs will be debating the EU Withdrawal Bill in the New Year. Here's how it puts workers' rights, LGBT equality laws and protections for disabled people at risk after #Brexit 
There will also be the immense task of flushing out the key fascist political ideas and habits which #Brexit has introduced into our political culture: nationalism, xenophobia, scapegoating, irrationalism and the toxic "Will of the People". #StopBrexit #FBPE
I'll accept and get behind #Brexit when just one person offers a valid proven reason why it will make this once great nation better for every one and not just those with a vested interest #StopBrexit #ExitFromBrexit #FBPE
#Brexit news ... apparently Marr won't be doing the usually anti EU pro Brexit BBC bias tomorrow ... something to do with NYE I guess - normal level of outrageous and shameful bias will resume 7th of January ...  
Here we see where Farage's true loyalty lies. It lies with Vladimir Putin whose war of aggression against Ukraine he shamelessly and fraudulently blames on the EU. Farage is a traitor. . #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
You can tell right-wingers, Blair, Coup MPs & a lot of money is behind it. A fortune on marketing,co-ordinated attacks, devious tactics. Adonis, the pro-privatisation 'Labour' guy who is anti-Corbyn....Read between the lines. It's an attack on Labour rather than #Brexit per se. 
The #Brexit journey is like a mystery tour; no one knows the final destination. Half the bus is excited and are determined to make the trip a success. The other half are angry; they wanted to stay home and are determined to be miserable regardless of how fantastic the destination
Germany! Don't make the same mistake as in 1930s. Remove #Merkel NOW before she starts WW-3 with her 3rd world army.#EUisTheProblem #Brexit#PVV #AfD #LePen#Nexit #Orban#abmerkeln#merkelmussweg#ÖVP
The people are calling for an #euref for the many, not #brexit for the few. @jeremycorbyn @Keir_Starmer @Number10gov #StopBrexit #BrexitShambles
Remainers are starting to look quite stupid and they will look even more stupid and unemployable on the other side of Brexit? #Cable refuses to rule out POACHING Remainer politicians to THWART #Brexit 
It's been a long time since the EU ref. Now that people have had time to learn more about the EU and see how negotiations are going, is there an up-to-date list of the expected benefits of any of the types of #Brexit? The expense time and uncertainty must be for something, right?
When you’ve crashed the UK economy with #Brexit, turned the country into a laughing stock and are feeling isolated and alone >>  #TeamTory
Tories R in Gov't,so 'Follow Back Pro EU' (FBPE) should be lobbying ToryMPs &criticising Tories about #Brexit . Instead FBPE attack Labour. Some FBPE are Tories/right-wingers/SNP/Liberals,who have an ulterior motive2attack Labour,rather than concern4Brexit per seAlias #TeamTory
What a horrible, horrible lie!“Rape gangs have been part of the West for centuries”No, you treacherous lying leftie.Show me historic proof of rape gangs raping and killing white children, from the 1500 till 1960s.You filthy traitor.#BrexitSHARE 
.@Andrew_Adonis got a hunka hunka burnin love for you right now Sir, keep it up and good luck convincing your fellow #LabourParty members that #Brexit just ain't the way to go. Not soft, hard or deep fried#StopBrexit is the only sensible route. Thankyou very much.

How rich is Lord Ashcroft, and how much richer will he be after #Brexit?That's pretty much it. Of course, "balancing" that is the other 65 million people in the UK, who will be demonstrably worse off.
Wanting a real Brexit is not an 'extreme right' stance either. Sovereignty transcends the right/left divide. #Brexit 
Voting for Brexit is not an 'extreme' position. It's simply a desire of ordinary British people for self-government. #Brexit 
EU collapse is now 'practically IRREVERSIBLE' after #Brexit, says #GeorgeSoros
2. But at the same time whilst NI citizens get to keep Irish/EU citizenship we in GB will have our rights removed & become #2ndClassCitizens in our own country.Jjust give us that Binding #FinalSay in 2018 to Confirm #Brexit or #StopBrexit..& stop this #Tory Cabal
Stanley Johnson “It’s very simple. I changed my mind on #Brexit1st, because the British people voted for it”2nd, Britain is better off outside #EU & shock plans for United States of EuropeA “federalist” vision for Europe made me feel “very depressed”

I have shared some tweets from Julian  before but here is a good example of a #RemainerNow being proactive and taking positive steps against #brexit  Julian! #FBPE #ExitBrexit #FinalSayForAll
What a monumental own goal #brexit is turning out to be for the DUP ,all that squandered dodgy cash for a broken Britain, a United Ireland and themselves a future of irrelevance !!
What it does show is that no-one wins with #Brexit. The brexiters aren't going to get the brexit they want with May in charge and remainers are going to get a brexit which they don't want. All that is left is a divide country of which the reverberations will be felt for decades.
These clowns tagging their names #FBPE are just desperate remainers who would rather see our country crash & burn, than make a successful #Brexit - how very sad, to be so bitter & twisted to feel this about your country!
Forget 48%...the real majority is now for #Remain & the Ppl must be allowed a Democratic #FinalSay in 2018 to Confirm #Brexit or #StopBrexit. We're with you & other Democrats who still believe in the right to rethink & change minds.

The Kippers say May is selling out to the EU.The remoaners say she is selling out to UKIP.Sounds like she is doing a great job putting our country first to deliver the best #Brexit deal for the UK.
Dad spent 37 years working in a Yorkshire coal mine. Mum was a miner's daughter & school "dinner lady". My sister & I both graduated and went into teaching. Nice to know that voting #Remain means we're now part of "The Elite"! #OrdinaryPeopleRemain #Brexit
Who said it was all doom and gloom. As someone who will happily admit I was anti #Brexit all the doom and gloom made me change to pro. The future is not written and it's up to us to make the best of it. So far a lot of the 'experts' have been wrong! Here is to a great 2018  
#BBC continues to plug the non-story about Lord Adonis resigning, repeating his absurd attacks on #Brexit and his ridiculous assertions that the Labour government he had served in had integrity and coherent policies. That was the most corrupt and inept government in history.
Yes, there should be a second #Brexit referendum 
An extraordinary story which proves that the  “global Britain” reason for #Brexit was a myth (or lie as it should properly be called)..” Asian embassies cut by Boris Johnson to fund EU diplomats | News | The Times & The Sunday Times 
Hardline brexiteers can't argue with the substance of Lord Adonis's arguments.... instead they resort to personal attacks."... if they attack one personally, it means they have not a single political argument left." Margaret Thatcher.#Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE
#Brexit has been a great exercise for weeding out those not mentally strong enough to BE in Westminster.If they don't feel they can govern the UK, without being overseen by unelected drunkards in Brussels, perhaps they are just not up to their chosen profession?
And, reacting to Gisela's words, I argue that coverage of #Brexit (and Trump) reflects deep, tech-enhanced biases in journalism to the new (short-term), controversial, negative and speculative (probably more so than to Remain) 
Lord Adonis quit over #Brexit chaos & Rail bail out Tom, you do your followers a disservice by not highlighting Tory Brexit mismanagement, which lets face it is far more important.This is why people find @UKLabourBrexit position confusing.
Do you want a second referendum on #Brexit? Vote and retweet for a big sample
 you couldn't make this up! #brexit vision of 'global britain' looking more and more like 'little britain' - people are allowed to reconsider as facts like this emerge @Open_Britain
Managers say it's becoming more difficult to attract new workers as well as hold on to their current ones.There are concerns, the lack of clarity over future EU #citizensrights in the country after #Brexit is putting off applicants.
#Brexit is what will benefit the establishment. It's a rouse to avoid the new tax laws the EU are bringing in the day after brexit is supposedly happening. #Remain
Happy New Year, Jeffersonians. Thanks for keeping everyone in touch with the wonderfully innovative and rocking world of British manufacturing in 2017. Next year is going to be great. #Brexit 2019 will be better still ! 
The UK’s drive to turbocharge its global trade links after #Brexit has passed a crucial milestone. @LiamFox has announced more than 100 experienced trade negotiators have been hired by @tradegovuk to strike new deals around the world#ThankEUGoodbye
Neil has deleted his tweet from my previous post.(Like they all do)Luckily, I screenshot it so you can still see his remoaner ramblings @thestaveros #Brexit  
“I’m @Andrew_Adonis & I’m the epitome of the sneering, metro-elite Leftists who hold the British public in contempt for taking a decision we disagree with. I’m a sanctimonious, preaching wanker who puts the interests of a corrupt, authoritarian EU above those of Britain”#Brexit 
The #FBPE crew are hilarious.1. Pro-Brexit arguments are upsetting so we block #Brexit supporters.2. We find and follow each other so we don't feel lonely.3. We believe in democracy, but only if the result goes our way.But we're hard cos we started a gang innit.    
Most foreign investment comes into Britain because of our Single Market membership. Without that Britain will need some other means to attract investment. The Tory Right know what that is - low taxes on business & wealth, low regulations & low welfare.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
This is Neil.Neil believes that ppl who voted #Brexit are ‘coffin dodgers, dunces & paupers’.Neil also believes that we should accept lots of immigrants bc they will all be brain surgeons & save our lives.Neil also owns an old, grey wanking sock that smells of his chihuahua. 
It appears that Hard Brexiters see any economic decline as worthwhile collateral damage to “get their country back” and “take back control”. They are deluding themselves. Economic decline is a loss of control and the only thing they are getting back is another recession.#Brexit
.@Andrew_Adonis one of few political figures willing to work on cross party basis. Not compatible with #Brexit hardliners who dominate government. He should work with @LibDems to secure #ExitFromBrexit .
Must-read as we head into 2018. But my fear is that UK government will continue to fudge and muddle its way along, without being honest about #Brexit trade-offs and without #Labour or pro- #EU Tories holding it to account before it’s too late.
More than a hundred key negotiators have been hired in the Department For Trade (@tradegovuk) to help @LiamFox with various Trade Talks as we leave the EU.#Brexit#BecauseOfTories 
They're denying us a #FinalSay referendum, so the local elections on May 3, will be our only chance to vote to express our opposition to #Brexit. EU 27 nationals can vote, so lets make sure pro-EU parties get the maximum support. It is our only opportunity!#StopBrexit #FBPE
Red faces after ‘black’ passport turns blue  better go to Specsavers @theresa_may #Brexit
The government's become "hypersensitive to any criticism" which is a symptom of the "#Brexit malaise sweeping Whitehall", says Lord Adonis, who's quit as infrastructure adviser 
One of the dangers of #Brexit is that it becomes an all-encompassing project for the UK government and the senior civil service, crowding out consideration of other important issues. As @Andrew_Adonis points out this is now happening.
Plenty of focus on @Andrew_Adonis’s damning words on May’s vision of #Brexit. I want to know more from him about the “full facts” of the Stagecoach/Virgin bailout which he claims could cost Grayling his job 
Lord Adonis interview. Is it my imagination, or are John Humphrys' chunterings about "the 17.4 million" becoming less and less effective as the full horror of #Brexit unfolds?
No idea what @Andrew_Adonis was on about, saying Norway regretted not joining EU. Most recent poll had 66% of Norwegians against membership & only 16% in favour. We’ll end up similarly grateful for #Brexit within a decade as EU’s 27 member states fail to agree reforms #BBCR4today
I disagree on his solution re a UK Government but I share much of @Andrew_Adonis  analysis re #Brexit.  This is particularly true : “If Brexit happens, taking us back into Europe will become the mission of our children's generation ”
I'm not a fan of "Lord" Adonis; but his comments describing Theresa May as being "the voice of UKIP" over #Brexit ring true.
I am amazed at how easily this whole #Brexit CON trick could unravel & be consigned to the dustbin of history if only we had an Opposition party worthy of its name & MPs of stature capable of putting country before party & blind ideology. It seems the good guys are in the Lords. 
#ThankYouBrexit for bringing together the UK in a way I have never experienced before in my lifetime. Brexit can and will be stopped #FBPE #Brexit #UKIP #brexitshambles #StopBrexit #FBR
I think you'd be surprised how few people would take to the streets to defend hard #Brexit & their right to be poorer
Sheer brilliance from UK’s Commonwealth brethren (You know the ones clamouring to sign trade deals after #brexit  
Nick Clegg is why people voted to leave the EU, Nick being awarded is why even more people would vote to leave the EU. Lord Adonis is why the House of Lords should be abolished. #Brexit happened because we are sick of these self serving parasites who think they no better.

Lord Adonis quits government role with #Brexit attack. So enthralled by a foreign power is he. Sometimes one has to wonder where some people's loyalties lie. 
How can he say Theresa May has no mandate for #Brexit didn’t we vote to Leave the EU or was I dreaming 
Disturbing but accurate observation by Lord Adonis to @theresa_may : #Brexit is a dangerous populist and nationalist spasm worthy of Donald Trump…#FBPE
This is why it drives me mad when #Remain folk say "I respect the result of the referendum, but..."NO! Let's **NOT** respect the result of this flawed, unjust, undemocratic, fraudulent, shambolic & therefore irrelevant #Brexit referendum!!

The fact that people are still asking "What should Labour's BrExit policy be" 18 months after we voted, 9 months after we triggered Article 50 and a month after we agree #Brexit exit terms and moved on to post #BrExit trade talks says a lot about Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. 
24% of Labour voters could switch party by the next election because of #Brexit, a proportion which will undoubtedly grow when the 32% of Labour remain voters who believe Labour is “completely against Brexit” finally realise the truth.#StopBrexit #FBPE
If there is a general election the best thing for Remainers to do is to aim for a hung parliament with a larger number of LibDem & Green MPs than now. And the way to do that will be to follow the suggestions made by #Remain tactical voting organisers.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit

Only 3 countries will have negative growth, Italy, Spain & UK and we're the worst. Read the article and you'll see both @The_TUC & @CBItweets  both cite cause as #Brexit. And we haven't even left yet. Time to #TakeBackControl & #StopBrexit. 
If the pound had not devalued against the Euro when it did, 70% of farmers would have gone bust, you cannot produce milk at 16p/l, or grain at £87/t and survive! There will be challenges with labour after #Brexit, but big opportunities too. #Farming always adapts to change!
Unfortunately #Brexit is sidelining Britain not just Davis... 
Scotland’s vital food and drink brands must be protected after #Brexit.
What most infuriates about critiques of "hill & heather Scottish nationalism" is that this is *actual financial value*, in terms of Scotland The Brand. The logic of #Brexit needs to eliminate/subsume this. Good to see @Feorlean stepping up.

It's appalling that you have faced such abuse. I got tired of the hard left and joined the @Lidems and found really progressive people who care about opposing #Brexit & strive for a kinder and more caring society.
Well, of course, one of the "Bad Boys of #Brexit" is a convicted money launderer in America. 
Labour may or may not be playing a clever long game: But we Remainers should not count on it. We should keep pressing Labour in every possible way until it makes clear that it wants to #StopBrexit.#Brexit #FBPE
“Project fear was wrong about #Brexit, a major new economic report has concluded today, as it revealed the UK will bounce back to overtake the French economy in 2020. “
Exactly. Does no one in parliament have principles anymore? If #Brexit is wrong, it doesn’t become right just because some people have unpleasant & misguided views about immigration amongst other things. Stop the electoral calculus now & fight for what is right. 
Heseltine should be lauded the length of the land for speaking truth unto the People & putting country before party...more than our deceitful, lying, autocratic Govt is doing in its blind pursuit of a ruinous #Brexit..#FinalSay 2018 #StopBrexit
I say it again - If you support #Brexit and think that the country is still behind you, you should not be scared of a second referendum on the deal. If you are right, you will win.
In the New Year, the Government will set out its plans for our post #Brexit immigration system. This could be our chance to end indefinite immigration detention for good. Add your name to send a message to @theresa_may: 
A positive #Brexit story! After weeks worrying that we would suffer abuse if we spoke German in public (wife Austrian), on two occasions shop assistants enthusiastically broke into German to offer assistance. Heartwarming. Obviously #FBPE folk ....
‘#Brexit: @jeremycorbyn is playing a clever long game that could benefit us all’
I am #Europe. And #Brexit will never take that identity away from me. #EU loud and proud! 
As a young person, all I have to say about this is...Bollox! Bollox! Bollox!#Brexit is not an era of opportunity, it is stealing opportunities from us.It is damaging, it is divisive, it is dangerous.Corroding our national pride and destroying years of work towards tolerance.

The overriding impression we got from people we spoke to was that #Brexit was a lousy idea but was now unstoppable. This is very depressing. Outrage at the usurpation of an opinion poll was muted to non-existent.#StopBrexit
It matters because Monday June 27th 2016 was the first day back in America after Team Treason finalized their “social media targeting” with Russia and Cambridge Analytica, plus complicit U.S. media executives, in Scotland right after #Brexit 
UK, YouGov poll:Labour (S&D) VotersStop Brexit: 63%Proceed with Brexit: 22%#Brexit
Remainers had Labour, Cons, Libdems, POTUS, Whitehall, BBC, CBI, the EU and the Lords all on their side, but think they lost because Leave used a gross, not net statistic on a bus. Their desperation is getting embarrassing #brexit
NEW POLL for Thursday Given the state of things as they are now  Should the UK still continue with #Brexit? Help #RecycleElectrons in order to #StopBrexit with the #FBPE
It has also brought with it, a couple of problems.I assume that like me we have followed everyone back, like the hashtag says.This in itself has created an echo chamber and the sense that #Brexit is beaten and we have won..Point 1..we have not won.. 2/x
I'd like to make a couple of comments about #FBPE..It's been an amazing hashtag TBH.. It's brought 10s of 000s of us pro EU ppl together here in a spectacularly short time. It's been great to not feel so alone in my daily squabbles about #Brexit 1/x
Another reason that #Brexit won’t be reversed 
No real socialist would defend the actions of kleptocapitalist & de facto leader of European fascism Putin. That is why I believe that Corbyn is a fraud. Here he recycles Kremlin propaganda to defend Putin's war on Ukraine: #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit /1
I'm a former @UKLabour Party member. I've voted Labour all my life by this year was the last time. I'm now with #StopBrexit & am not afraid to state the fact that the Labour "leadership" is now in an informal coalition with the @Conservatives over #Brexit #FBPE
There is no need for a “Royal Yacht”. But there is a need for a state of the art Clyde-built “State Yacht” called Britannia to sail the seven seas showcasing us, our language, our culture, our expertise. And our determination to make the whole world our Oyster post #Brexit
This is my uncle. He comes from France to visit me at home every 3 months since I moved to the UK in 2013. According to post #Brexit #ImmigrationBill, he won’t be able to do so after #BrexitDay because he doesn’t have a passport. He’s my only family.Thanks Brexiters. Merry Xmas
France is asking the U.K. to pay for new French customs posts post #BREXIT. If France wants new Customs posts they should damn well pay for them themselves. @UKIP 
Want to trigger a Remoaner? RT the latest #Brexit news...- FTSE 100 climbs to record high after Xmas break- YouGov poll shows a 9 point lead for leave voters- CEBR admits it was wrong to say UK economy would slow down. Now predict we’ll overtake France by 2020.
Great video from the Department of Trade on what having the freedom to do our own deals means and how it will help our economy prosper.Building a country #FitForTheFuture#Brexit 
#Tory Legend #NormanTebbit calls #LordHeseltine a "Backstabber" & should be “kicked out” of the #ConservativeParty & “if he doesn’t resign he should be sacked!” for trying to derail #Brexit, urges @theresa_may to withdraw the whip.  
I voted Labour in the snap election. Despite having my admiration for your personal efforts in the fight against #Brexit (thank you!), the #Libdems will have my vote hereafter unless the #Labour leadership establish a clear position of ACTUAL opposition. #StopBrexitSaveBritain
In a choice between the democratic demand of #Brexit and the Leave-fearing Labour Party, the old Tory picks Labour. Lord Heseltine has unwittingly illustrated how radical Brexit is, and how un-radical the Corbynistas are.
If large numbers of people have changed their minds on #Brexit then I see no reason why a second referendum can't be a real option. #FBPE
“ATTENTION!I ‘rule out’ a 2nd EU referendum.I’m quite happy that I was a lifelong EU sceptic, betrayed my principles by voting Remain, undermined British negotiations, nurtured a purposely opaque @UKLabour policy on the EU & lied to our core voters on #Brexit.I’m an idiot” 
"It's easier to fool people than to convince them that they have been fooled" - Mark Twain #Brexit 
The FT today: UK output is now about 0.9% lower than if the country had voted to #Remain in the EU. That's almost exactly £350m a week lost to the economy. It's what #Leavers promised would be available to the #NHS if we went for #Brexit. It's time to #StopBrexit.
David Davis sidelined as civil servant Oliver Robbins takes over #Brexit negotiations 
"The Architect of Project Fear" Lord Macpherson now believes #Brexit impact on British economy will be limited if govt:"seizes policy opportunity & looks forward not back... There is still all to play for..."A change of mind when faced with reality.#EU
And somehow we managed this magnificent achievement without being members of the EU at the time. #madeinUKKeep up-to-date with #Brexit Britain news here: 
“Take back control from unelected bureaucrats in Brussels” and give it to unelected bureaucrats in London.#Brexit 
The SNP want to take action to avoid a hard #Brexit - but will Corbyn join?
EU's PLANS FOR 'UNITED STATES OF EUROPE' go down like a lead balloon across northern EU.  Full story from #Brexit Santa & his elves at Facts4EU: 
A @YouGov poll shows that a quarter of @UKLabour voters could switch party if they continued to back #Brexit. Two thirds of those who voted #Remain said they would be disappointed or angry if Labour said it would proceed with Brexit.
Brexit studies were 'being prepared' a year before Davis said they didn't exist, So...1) Davis lied, is in contempt of parliament so must resign2) Davis is telling truth, guilty of dereliction of duty so must resign3) Davis continues fucking up #brexit
Nigel Farage joins Boxing Day fox hunt?I would expect as much from #Farage I wonder if #Theresa joined him? "84% of the population oppose #fox hunting" Soon 84% of the population will oppose #brexit when they realise it is equally cruel and obscene 
Hard thread to read.Logically I know we need to make it easier for #Brexit regretters but understand the pain of EU citizens who were thrown under the bus by the 52%.Don't know what to say 
“Seventy Labour councillors from south London have signed a letter to the shadow #Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, urging a shift in the party's Brexit position.”#LabourFail
God help us. The sooner Labour supporters realise this guy is a disaster for our Labour, the better. He is, quite simply, a disaster, on #Brexit , on anything. We are doomed under this bloke  
Could #Brexit sound the death knell of the #Tory party as we know it....? This  coalition of calamity that is the modern #Conservative Party is not fit for any purpose. It governs for the sake of government. It has no intellectual heart. I doubt RA Butler would recognise it.
I would normally be a Tory, but in Tory #Brexit and in you in particular I smell the stench of fascism. Here's something Margaret Thatcher said about referendums. She would have crushed you under her heel.#StopBrexit #FBPE
We now know that the  “counter  insurgency” techniques honed by the British Army in Africa were used in  Ireland. This is a history of the British State and it is no accident it’s being destroyed at this time, at this moment:  #Brexit pic.twitter.com/AmCRD86DQ0
Jesus wept-just when you think #brexit Britain has lost its ability to plumb new depths of embarrassment it does it again. Tory MPs want to set up lottery so desperate poor people can fund the new royal yacht to impress foreigners so they sign trade deals. @christopherhope
Decision time is nigh for Labour to swich to an #ExitFromBrexitIf Corbyn & McDonnell won't shift, then Starmer & Thornberry need to pull the rug.If they don't, Labour are likely to be the biggest electoral losers from #Brexit
I find myself concluding that #JeremyCorbyn is, intellectually, a Little Englander. #Brexit
I’m a liberal conservative voter. I would vote Labour - even with #Corbyn - if they went anti #brexit or unambiguous pro soft #brexit. I will also vote Labour if Tories lead very high over Labour whatever EU policy to avoid too big hard brexit majority
Corbyn backing #Brexit can no longer be portrayed as him appealing to Labour's traditional voters.His backing of the Tories on #Brexit can now only be attributed to his own political dogma. Labour need to switch to back an #ExitFromBrexit
We haven't forgotten how you snubbed us, Obama dear 'friend' #BackOfQueue #Obama#Brexit 
Jacob Rees-Mogg: Everybody in Govt said they would implement the result of the EU referendum.Remoaner: But it was an advisory referendum, there is no need to implement Brexit.JRM: So you want politicians to lie?Says it all! #Brexit 
No such thing as #Brexit  "inside the customs union".Not sure why folks keep thinking there is.We've been told  #NoParallelEU.Hey, but maybe they're just  making us sweat...
The sticking plaster holding together the 2 wings of the Tory party is being stretched to breaking point over #Brexit! If @iancolintaylor is voicing this, the split could be about to become irreparable.Many have already left the Tories, looks like many more could follow them.
Why does Britain like tea so much?Because tea leaves. #Brexit  
Should @jeremycorbyn & @UKLabour now come out and say they will commit to stopping #Brexit?Please vote & RT.
I’ve joined other @UKLabour colleagues today demanding the Chancellor publishes #Brexit impact studies on the economy - yet more evidence the Government is hiding the true costs of @Brexit - good piece covering by @GuardianAnushka
If #Brexit Britain wants a trade deal with India then it will have to accept more immigration from Britain. I'm sure most Leave voters weren't told about that. And so much for taking control of our borders. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Globalist Brexiters, like Daniel Hannan, who dream of some kind of buccaneering low tax (for the rich) north Atlantic Singapore haven't bothered to mention that such an economy requires high levels of immigration. More #LeaveLies.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
‘63% of self-identified Labour supporters say they would be “delighted or pleased” if #Labour said it would stop #Brexit and stay in the EU... By contrast, only 22% said they would be delighted or pleased if Labour said it would proceed with Brexit’ 
Fudging has been successful, but doing great damage to body politic: "32% of Labour remain voters believe Labour is “completely against #Brexit”; 31% of Labour leave voters believe Labour is “completely in favour of Brexit”. @TheGreenParty says #StopBrexit 
For anyone interested in the #Brexit open letter quoted by the @guardian today, here is the full text: 
63% of Labour voters oppose @jeremycorbyn over current pro-Brexit stance, YouGov poll finds. The tide turns against #Brexit
.@uklabour are under pressure to clarify their stance on #Brexit, after polling showed that 25% of voters could switch party and more than half would oppose Labour backing BrexitWhat an utter mess @jeremycorbyn has got #Labour into. #LabourFail
And he called me 'grubby' for asking if he was planning to stand down We now know he was lying, and went out of his way to maintain his deception The #Brexit lies continue 
The City, we were told, would collapse with a “Brexodus” to cities such as Frankfurt and Paris. In reality, The City now has more jobs than before and is recognised as being even more dominant as the global financial centre. #Brexit
Germany’s foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel has defied EU leaders by insisting Britain should be given a bespoke #Brexit deal. 
My father visits the UK, from France, every day as he’s trying to learn how to eat a bacon sandwich. As he hasn’t got a passport, he’ll be unable to learn now, thanks to #brexit. Thanks Leavers. x 
.@LibDems have responded with incredulity to reports that Home Office will have to recruit staff from Europe to admin #Brexit"This is an utter farce presided over by a government that doesn't have a clue what it is even trying to do” says @thomasbrake
If Carlsberg made Prime Ministers... "f we Leave under Article 50 without a deal under UK, EU and International Law we owe NO MONEY at all, not a brass farthing!"#MoggMentum #Brexit

New twist to saga over government #ImpactAssessments on the economic costs of #Brexit - they have done some after all (in #Treasury) but don’t dare reveal them! Don’t we deserve to know cost of #BrexitReality ?
Merry Brexmas: So much for Remain having an 11-point lead; support for staying in the EU has collapsed to 39 per cent! #Brexit 
Link to @Independent's report on our open letter to @Keir_Starmer, calling for a shift in @UKLabour's approach to #Brexit: 
@BrugesGroup President Lord Norman Tebbit  has called for the expulsion LordMichael Heseltine from @Conservatives after Heseltine implied that a Corbyn led Govt would be better than the current Government #Brexit@ConHome @The_Bat_Gotham @CamillaTominey @_katedevlin @CalgacusEd
One of the most enraging things about #Brexit is how it has revived the careers of Farage, IDS, Howard, Paterson, Redwood - certainly on the BBC - and boosted those of Moggers & Johnson. All the more reason to #ExitFromBrexit
There will be local government elections on May 3. EU 27 nationals can vote. There will be much less need for tactical voting than in a GE, so we have an opportunity to give a really big vote to pro-Remain parties!#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
The Bow Group is pleased to announce that our President & former Conservative Party Chairman Lord #Tebbit alongside @ToryProgress and the @brugesgroup has joined our call for #Heseltine to be expelled from the Conservatives in the House of Lords.#Brexit 
Without the votes of racists and fascists Leave would have fallen short of a majority. So now the government is pandering to these extremists. A healthy democracy keeps such extremists out on the margins.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
I ain't retreating one step...preparing for D-Day (Defeat #Brexit Day) we can start by not voting for Brexit supporting parties in the local elections May 3rd 2018...We have to get them to support a #FinalSay in 2018 with a #StopBrexit option!
This is damning stuff. Before the referendum the Treasury pulled a report together that made clear #Brexit was economic suicide. Why did the PM and ministers vote to trigger A50 with this knowledge ?
I entirely regret voting leave in the Brexit vote i panicked and honestly didn't know enough to vote remain #regret #brexit #brexitshambles #brexitsucks #mybad
The latest World Economic League Table states that Britain has recovered from an initial economic blip after the vote to #Leave and now looks set to maintain its position in the rankings and improve by 2020 after #Brexit.
Following Lord #Heseltine 's support for a #Corbyn lead government to stop #Brexit the Bow Group calls for his immediate expulsion and withdrawal of @Conservatives whip in the House of Lords
I've seen some dreadful/rude/condescending comments regarding #Brexit but this takes things to a new low. Some people need to take a long hard look at themselves. 
In reality, #Brexit is not allowing people to take back control. Time for @UKLabour to offer voters the chance to reconsider. Our open letter to Keir Starmer, and report by @HuffPostUK: 
Michael's crime is to understand his own party. @jeremycorbyn is main reason most #Tory #Remain MPs frightened to revolt on #Brexit 
"IF we are still subject to the European Court of Justice, we have not left the EU."#MoggMentum#Brexit 
Heseltine on #LBC: "If a Labour Government had caused the devaluation of the pound that was caused by #Brexit the right-wing press would be hysterical." He's not wrong!
This is my Nan, she comes from Germany to visit every three months since I moved to the UK in 2013. According to post #Brexit #ImmigrationBill, she won’t be able to do so after #BrexitDay because she doesn’t have a passport. She’s my only family.Thanks Brexiters. Merry Xmas!
I’m one of 25 Labour MPs who’ve written to @PhilipHammondUK demanding the public see documents examining the range of outcomes of #Brexit 
Simply unacceptable that Ministers are STILL withholding the truth about how #Brexit will hit the public & economy. Treasury officials will have the data - it’s time for @PhilipHammondUK to do the right thing and share it. #ImpactAssessments
70 Labour councillors from south London have signed a letter to Keir Starmer, urging a shift in the party's #Brexit position 
When the Treasury know the damage that #Brexit will do to the economy, why on earth can’t the public see the details? #transparency #ImpactAssessments 
Oh Fuck Off. Your true colour is prick. #DailyMail #BluePassport Fuck #Brexit pic.twitter.com/RnJpMeAhTu
"Brexit is not short-term and is not easily capable of rectification." Extraordinary from Heseltine on grave damage that #Brexit will inflict on UK and belief that Labour government is preferable to Brexit. Are you listening @jeremycorbyn? #StopBrexit

Except @jeremycorbyn ran an election campaign respecting the referendum result, which was to leave, and @UKLabour’s vote share & number of seats INCREASED. All AFTER #Brexit referendum result. Brexit & all its failings & troubles belong entirely to the @Conservatives!
I really don't know how many times this has to be said but you are not on the left if you supported an austerity that ravaged the poor and seriously damaged the foundations of the Welfare State which is what the Lib Dems did whilst in govt. #brexit 
I'm  against #Brexit but judging from the tweet below some remainers are just as vicious & radicalised as some who support brexit - that should worry us all. Moreover it seems that some who fight for remain are fine with austerity for ordinary folk and that isn't winning hearts 
#Brexit is, by its very nature, collusion in Putin's hybrid war against the EU and the Western democracy that makes him live in fear of a democratic revolution which will sweep him away, and quite likely end in his execution. #StopBrexit #FBPE
Billions being wasted by our #Brexit government and untold billions wasted by industry. The impoverishment of Britain while the NHS and other vital public services crumble. We have to end this madness in 2018! 
Consumers face rising prices after Brexit unless Britain can replicate trade deals negotiated by the EU with dozens of other countries, the British Retail Consortium has warned.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit

As a British Citizen born in Hong Kong, with family in China, I find the whole branding remainers who are "talking down #Brexit" as "traitors" and "saboteurs" disturbing and odd. Especially coming from those who insist this is to defend democracy.
The EU is deeply immoral: its tariffs and regulations harm the poor by pushing up living costs  #Brexit

#Brexit as a concept is increasingly drifting from having anything whatsoever to do with the mechanics of leaving the EU. It is now primarily a culture war and both sides will totally ignore the details except for when they are temporarily convenient.

#Boris Johnson said that #Russia interfered in the referendum on #Brexit, but "unsuccessfully." I do not understand something, so Russia, according to Boris, was agitating the British for Britain to remain in the EU ???   
The trolls seem to be out in force today. They haven't got anything relevant to say, so they just hurl insults. The state of the #Brexit camp is pretty sad and pathetic. #StopBrexit #FBPE

Spending this amount of money on changing the colour of a passport is outrageous and unnecessary when we have public sector workers on the breadline and thousands homeless. Whatever your views on #Brexit this is a travesty & waste of cash. #BluePassports

Entrepreneur Peter Cruddas gave Vote Leave £900K and is now facing an 'inheritance tax' bill of £180K. Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and other BIG banks gave the Remain camp similar amounts of money. They have not been slapped with similar taxes. What do you call this?#Brexit 
Make sure you tell everybody you know that the colour of a country's passport isn't dictated by the EU. It's such a non-issue anyway, but since the #Brexit extremists are trying to turn it into one, let's be sure to comprehensibly shoot them down in flames. Show them this picture

With her rhetoric about the "Will of the People" and "betrayal" Theresa May is reinforcing the entirely anti-democratic misconception that democracy means the dictatorship of the majority (a minority in the case of Brexit).#FBPE #StopBrexit #Brexit
If you believe in evidence led not dogmatic policy making then you, like me, will be horrified that the government is making decisions about #Brexit and our future without any research into the impact of leaving the Single Market/Customs Union.
If you are a sensible pro-Brexit person who wants a negotiated (causes as little damage as possible) Brexit……you should argue #Article50 ought to be extended.UK instead is going to waste loads of time and effort on #Brexit transition & it’s going to end up being damaging.
If you're still wondering why UK-US post #Brexit trade deal negotiations have to be conducted in secret.... the below is a helpful hint 
Completely iconic. What an icon. Definitely in the top 10 most iconic passports of 20th century. Absolutely unforgettable. What a colour. What a passport. What a time to be alive. Really the David Bowie of passport world. #iconicpassport #incrediblepassport #iconicblue #brexit 
There is still uncertainty about how the UK's decision to leave the European Union will affect some #citizensrights on the island of Ireland, according to @sinnfeinireland 's #Brexit spokesperson.
Not just black; too big for pockets. Survey quoted on #TheLastLeg showed #brexitpassport is second to #hanging as #Brexit benefit from taking back control. 
One of the many pernicious aspects of #Brexit is the attempt to impose a #Britnat view of collective identity on a population with a myriad of identities.
Trying to predict anything in #Brexit is a mug’s game.But I’ve been thinking a lot about the transition period the UK is demanding.I’m pretty sure it’s *SO* complex to do that we’ll soon be arguing to extend the Article 50 process instead as it’s simpler.
Comedy gold from the #Brexit impact assessments. Now we know why they were kept secret in the interest of national security! 
Meticulous dismantling of Theresa May’s current #Brexit delusions >> “The events of the past fortnight have emphasised that #Brexit is not a policy. It is a Tory fantasy and national nightmare” 
„Please name one single specific  advantage of #Brexit.”“We will get our blue colored passport back.”  
#Brexit is going sooo well, that after 9 months of negotiations, the first “victory” is something insignificant to many that we could have done whilst remaining in the EU. Still sure #Brexit is the answer to our country’s woes? #StopBrexit #FinalSay #FinalSayForAll
But blue passports is a great metaphor for #Brexit. We get something back that we never lost, it cost us money and brings no actual benefit whatsoever.
Why EU is losing support in Italy - a lost generation on the dole.  Read #Brexit Facts4EU today: 
Passports spend their lives hidden away in safe, dark places and very rarely see daylight. Their colour does not matter.#Brexit has already caused the UK to lose £340m/week in economic growth. That does.
It is the year 2019 (3 AB after #Brexit) and the May Government Replaces ‘English’ with ‘Newspeak’ as the UK’s official language. The use of the words ‘Freedom’ and ‘will of the People’ is regulated by UK directive 1207b section 7 paragraph 12 also known as the Farage Clause. 
Before #Brexit only the British passport was maroon.  After Brexit the entire UK will be marooned.#bluepassport #StopBrexit #StopFundingBrexit

Any doubts about May's backing for a #Brexit culture war were removed by her #citizensofnowhere speech 15 months ago; all she has done since, especially with today's #bluepassport nonsense, is confirm it. I don't want any of May's 'culture'.
The @UKLabour party is now dominated by the far left. In 1983 they produced a manifesto in favour of withdrawing from Europe - now known as the longest suicide note in history... if you oppose #Brexit & support progressive politics then support the @LibDems

What is triggering REMOANers about "blue passport" is that it's a visible sign that #BrExit is happening. Everything else is words so they can refuse to hear them and pretend it can all be undone. Sorry, but we had the debate and you lost it. Time to climb back on board.

Yes, getting a #bluepassport back after #Brexit is important to some people. But it's not as popular as the return of.... say.... the death penalty.

Priti Patel finally comes clean on #BrexitAll those lies, lower wages, inflation, growth decline, laughing stock of the world wasn't about taking back control of a #BluePassport it was always about: Cutting taxes for the rich!
#Bluepassport. Britain seems to have receded into a second childhood. Unable to cope with the EU and the modern world its addled mind has fixated on a simple infantile desire - "I want the blue one".#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
OK, OK, I see you architects have all gone home for Christmas. But here is something to do during the boring bits of Love Actually. Complete @RIBA #Brexit survey and help give me something to work with on your behalf as the 2018 trade negotiations begin: 
#VictoriaLIVE why are you peddling The S*n’s propaganda that blue passports are a #brexit victory? We could’ve had blue passports whenever we wanted in the EU! Please do some basic research before doing Mr Murdoch’s work at the licence fee payers expense. 
The red, white and blue #Brexit turns out to be putting the economy in the red to get blue passports to please white people.
Blue passports to be heavier so Brits can slap foreign custom officials aside:  #bluepassport #brexit #remain
Strange world we live in where the colour of passports takes priority over the issue of whether you can travel to neighbouring European countries without paying for a visa or a visa waiver #Brexit
Imagine voting to ruin your country for the sake of a #BluePassport!The only good thing to come from #Brexit is that I’ll be able to say in 50yrs time, after all the realities have hit hard: I didn’t vote for it and I didn’t want it.
The colour is not the only reason it's a blue passport #brexit #bluepassport
Apparently, leavers voted for #Brexit because we wanted a blue passport....Yep, it’s all about passports. 
I just know that one day soon I’m going to be stood in a massive ‘Non-EU Citizens’ queue at a European airport surrounded by #bluepassport holding #Brexit types whining about the wait and blaming the Europeans.  This, I’ve now realised, is how life works.
So the UK economy is growing slower, the country losing about £350m a week & British influence waning worldwide thanks to #Brexit. In return, we are getting blue passports. It's not exactly deal of the century, is it?
This is what #brexit is all about: identity politics of the banal kind. Virtue signalling for those with a post-imperial nostalgia for a pre-globalisation era. Expect more symbolic, visual rebrands to satisfy leave's control anxieties.
Join our pointless campaign to make the #NewBritishPassport a #RainbowPassport (Just to wind up the #Brexit Bunch) 
Jesus, could we have avoided this whole #Brexit drama if we'd just given some people a #bluepassport?
I’m proud to be a citizen of the European Union, unfortunately because of what #Brexit has done to my country, to its values and reputation, I’m less proud of my UK citizenship. Plus I don’t give a monkey what colour my passport is! pic.twitter.com/nHI15XW5Av
This morning we announced the return of the blue #British passport after #Brexit. Watch how our passport has changed over the last 600 years. 
Terrorism, shifts on the global stage, #migrationEU & #Brexit – these are some of the main issues the EU handled in 2017. Click  to find out how @EUCouncil helped Europe meet these challenges.
Sums #Brexit up perfectly that *this* is what they've been focussing on. This is literally the last thing that needed doing. 
Much better to have a blue one (for most people, for the first time) than a red one which lets you go anywhere in Europe visa free, no? #brexit 
When the best bit of #Brexit news 18 months in is that you will have a blue passport that will be made in France and could have been blue at literally any time the UK chose them to be, your Brexit isn't looking great!
So there'll be blue passports? Well that's alright then, I won't miss my freedom of movement at all. Suddenly I see the point of all of this... #StopBrexit #FBPE #BrexitShambles #Brexit #bluepassport
The blue passport will be a constant dismal reminder of backward-looking #Brexit, reaffirming the establishment, confirming the far right victory and refusing to allow the UK to modernise and live in the 21st century. #bluepassport
Blue British passport to return after #Brexit 
One of these passports gives you visa-free access to travel, live and work in 27 other countries.The other one is blue.The #Brexit mentality in a nutshell. 
We could have had a blue passport as a member of the EU. A ridiculous, meaningless gesture to #Brexit fanatics. 
Listening to @BrandonLewis going on about #BluePassport What a bunch of sentimental claptrap. "People will remember their blue passport." The people who will really suffer from the #brexit disaster only ever had #EU burgundy ones. #bbcgms
#r4today the government says the #bluepassport is a symbol of the UK 'regaining its sovereignty after #brexit'.  the blue passport is a symbol of national suicide and fuckwittery.
And still Facebook claims only a tiny fraction of accounts influenced #Brexit. Yet 40,000 were purged in France before the #Macron vote. How can the digital monopolies that dominate our lives continue to be so careless about that?
Didn't know that but what a great illustration as to how this whole sorry #Brexit affair chooses something this facile in place of remaining prosperous in the largest common market ever & makes us a laughing stock in the World. #FinalSay 2018 #StopBrexit Stop the Farce!
With the #Brexit reports released today, two main reactions have come through: either the real ones are concealed, or this is all there is - a hurried, botched job.I don’t think they are mutually exclusive. Here’s a possibility:(Thread.) 
Interesting image from UEA.If the #Brexit referendum was translated into Parliament seats, Leave would have a 166 seat majority. 
JUNCKER'S NIGHTMARE - Democracy!French opposition leader calls for REFERENDUM on future shape of EU...Truly a nightmare scenario for Brussels - Asking consent from the people!So glad we're Leaving #EU#Brexit
Just Wait - #EU will come RUNNING to Britain for trade dealA free-trade deal MUST include goods AND services because you “can’t have one without the other”“Why would we let them sell tons & tons of goods to us & not let us export our services?”#Brexit
Spot on from @thomasbrake “We’ve been given old information, extracts from Wikipedia, & a few choice quotes, & nothing how Brexit will hit each sector. Govt’s woeful failure to prepare for #Brexit laid bare in front of the whole country.”#ExitFromBrexit
So many options closed off so few doors being left open incl that of rethinking #Brexit & allowing us a #FinalSay in 2018 with an option to #StopBrexit & save time, treasure & lost influence all of which could be used to tackle the problems that led to 37% of voters backing it.
In fairness to David Davis, he told us his department’s #Brexit impact assessments were “excruciating”, and he was right.
Take a closer look and Brexit is foreign billionaires plus, of course, Putin dipping their fingers and money deep into British politics. #Brexit is not patriotic. Brexit is betrayal.#BrexitBetraysBritain.#StopBrexit #FBPE
The question one has to ask themselves is why are the EU so desperate to retain the UK in their Union? Why did the #EU pay €160 Million to Pro-Remain Groups?#Brexit

.@theresa_may has been in Poland today "We are building a strategic partnership with Poland from a base of shared history and deep ties of friendship, that will outlast our exit from the EU." #Brexit
This analysis of the UK economy and #Brexit is worth a read (not to mention @jburnmurdoch is the best in the business when it comes to data visualisation) 
Sorry @Montiethat bogus Oxford study on shaky ground #Brexit 
A v quick thread on the #Brexit sectoral analyses published by Select Committee today. They are easily mocked, because they are gutted. So FWIW here is an informed view from Whitehall. 1/Thread
This is the UK Government’s #brexit sectoral impact assessment for tourism. If I was marking this as undergraduate work, I’d go for about 57.  
Theresa May wants a stronger relationship with Poland after #Brexit

#Brexit (in any form) means unavoidable austerity for a very long time no matter who is in power . (Historically this then increases likelihood of a series of ineffectual governments and increasing extremism ) 
You know when people say Remainers lost #brexit referendum & should just not fight it? Below is what we are fighting - you want to give up? Really? "Giving up" cannot be an option - its too important to "just let it go". 
Noooo, @jeremycorbyn @UKLabour#LabourParty membership is #RemainYour dithering leaves me no option but to cancel my membership. Enough of your #Brexit nonsense. You are losing support every day. #StopBrexit #StopBrexitSaveBritain
Coincidence or not, the first school census post #Brexit included to register kids nationality. It was then forwarded to the Home Office for immigration checks purpose.Lovely little Britain isn't it.And @AmberRuddHR wishing us a Merry Christmas "You'll be fine" 
4,800+ schoolchildren have endured a year of uncertainty over whether they can stay in this area as they are classed as EU nationals.The figures – which schools have been obliged to collect for the 1st time – reveal the human face of the #Brexit negotia'. 
Was #Brexit was Russia's dry-run for #TrumpRussia.? Sure looks like it. It worked, so #Putin decided to do it again. It worked, and is still working. How many #TrumpTrolls are from #Moscow's troll factories?

All forms of extreme views are hostile to our democracy. Defenders of #Russian interference in #Brexit referendum are naive fools.

I don’t understand why @UKLabour and particularly my pro EU #Canterbury MP don’t support giving the British people the final say on a Tory #Brexit? With a few honourable exceptions most sat on their hands last night. It baffles me. @LabourWhit
A flood of meaningless non-stories is provided by British mainstream media to cover up May's treachery over #Brexit , the scandalous introduction of sex education for minors and the real reasons why Damian Green had to step down. That is how #censorship works in Britain.
The extensive #Brexit sectoral analysis for fisheries has revealed that fisheries activities are concentrated near the sea. #mindblown
My highlight from the Government Sectorial Analysis of #Brexit and Fisheries.@DavidDavisMP has worked out it happens at the coast a lot
I will be calling for a debate on this issue in the New Year. #Brexit
Bit odd for Richard Leonard to go on jobs and the economy at #FMQs when he's happy to let the Tories destroy thousands of jobs, slash GDP and productivity growth, and squeeze people's incomes and living standards by ripping us out of the single market & customs union #Brexit
I asked for the rules to be emailed to me. I’m still waiting for them. If you can find any analysis of the impact of #Brexit in any of these repetitive, copy & paste, school homework level reports do let me know! 2/2
A letter to my local MP @alexsobel about #brexit, asking for a #secondreferendum.  I’ve changed my mind and others have as well.  Please respect the #willofthepeople by finding out what they really think, now that the facts are better known and the lies of 2016 have been exposed.

To be blunt, The #Brexit Creative Industries Sector Report is an absolute disgrace. It is in no way at all an impact assessment, rather it is a series of descriptive statements, & the views of the sector have been redacted.

Kate Hoey MP - "I don’t really trust the EU. They want to punish us for that brave decision to actually leave something that, when we look at what we are discussing here, we are simply asking to leave." #Brexit 
EU Committee urges @DavidDavisMP to publish #Brexit sectoral analyses in full, saying that they “pose no risk to the UK’s negotiating position” and would “promote an informed public debate”: 
Some people aren't worried about #Brexit damaging our country. These 'BREXIACS'  (Brexit At Any Cost) are not owning up to what it has already cost us - before we've even left and try to pretend the economic evidence either doesn't exist or is irrelevant
So worrying to see people pretending #Brexit isn't a problem for the economy. Latest figures show #Brexit has COST the UK around £350m a week - that's money we CAN'T invest in NHS or other priorities!
The @rcgp are pleased to be supporting @TheBMA with this letter to the Prime Ministers urging the Working Time Regulations to be retained post #Brexit #TeamGP

The new Highland Clearances: will #Brexit usher in a new era of depopulation for northern Scotland, a model of EU economic success? 
#DavidDavis just bluffing when he said he would resign if #DamienGreen was made 2resign. Mr Davis also 'bluffed' about Impact Assessments. He is a Chief Negotiator 4 #Brexit . How can EU take him seriously, he shows a lack of integrity/sincerity. Broken promises & empty threats. 
 politics is weird.Damien Green: has to resign having told untruths about existence of porn on Parl PC (not its actual existence, but statements about it)David Davis: no sanction whatsoever despite having been untruthful about #Brexit Impact Assessments for 12+ months
Labour continue with their cynical, follow the public, triangulation exercise on #Brexit. And people blamed Blair for being over-attentive to focus groups. Sad to see that on the greatest issue of our times Labour are entirely without principles.#StopBrexit #FBPE
A beautiful chocolate teapot. After tonight's vote on #Amendment120 to the #EUWithdrawalBill -  which could have passed had #JeremyCorbyn not whipped his MPs to withhold their support - I feel this accurately depicts the efficacy of the #Opposition #Labour is offering on #Brexit.

Remainer elitism is becoming a serious menace to the two foundation stones of modern Britain: democracy and press freedom:  #Brexit
All of our MPs voted tonight to keep Customs Union membership on the table after #Brexit. Jeremy Corbyn and his colleagues abstained. 
Well, that’s another promise our Brexit minister won’t be honouring then...#damiangreen #brexit 
Labour and Tory MPs are lining up to vote through the #EUWithdrawalBill right now. A bill that will see a Tory Power Grab on the Scottish Parliament - just let that sink it. #Brexit 
May has lost three cabinet ministers - Green, Fallon, Patel - in seven weeks. Just few weeks back, consensus was she’d be loathed to let Green go, but #Brexit breakthrough has made her stronger than she’s been since election
Hey @DavidDavisMP don't forget your promise. Have you send your letter of resignation to @theresa_may? Or was just another bluff like the #Brexit Impact reports? 
Just spoken in favour of Lib Dem amendment 120, which would give everyone a Vote on the Deal the UK government secure with the EU and, if it is the will of the people, an Exit from #Brexit . How many MPs  will back the amendment?

When a politician like T May talks of the country 'uniting' behind a policy, then she is denying a fundamental feature of a democracy, namely that it is based on the principle of uniting around the right to disagree about policies. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
Am not allowed to say what IS in the #Brexit sectoral analyses but I have said quite a bit about what is NOT. And they are sub-C grade GCSE essay cribbed off Wikipedia.  
In a democracy there are government & opposition and majority & minority, all part of the healthily bickering democratic community. But once you talk of the "Will of the People", then there are the people and their enemies. And democracy is under threat.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Ken Clarke is making a wonderful speech in the House of Commons. Tears apart every #Brexit argument.
Disappointed by patronising reaction by @KateHoeyMP to @AnnaMcMorrin in #Brexit debate - who dared to question her. Kate Hoey claims she’s “not a rebel” - the fact is that she’s rebelled 26 times this year - mostly to vote with hard Brexit Tories. 
All these can be done before #Brexit.Stop immigration from Muslim countries.Ban jihadis returning to UK.Deport jihadis who are in UKAll illegals to be deportedBan sharia lawBan non-stun slaughter.Stop #MuslimRapeGangs
May thinks the EU's trade deal with Canada is a template for #Brexit. But that would be bad for Britain, the Canadian deal doesn’t include services, which makes up 80% of the UK's economy. @MichelBarnier has been clear, a trade deal won’t include services.
Cat out of bag - Steve Baker just refused to rule out attempting to undermine the historic Parliamentary vote on #Brexit last week at the next stage. Deeply concerning. 
In case you missed my Guardian articles this year on #Brexit and the Tories attempts to rebrand themselves as animal loving greenies, they are listed here (for holiday reading!): 
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "The European Union produces its laws in a form of gobbledygook. They write stentorian, sesquipedalian sentences nobody can ever understand." #Brexit 
I’m asking the UK Gov why the Welsh Government hasn’t seen the #Brexit impact assessments for the #Welsh economy? Do they even exist? Because we have a right to know.
Another step on the road to #Brexit - #EU wants end to transition by 31 December 2020. Brexit deniers note - #Brexit is happening.

You know when people claim that "everybody knew what they were voting for in the #Brexit referendum"?  What if they voted for democratic representation not realizing they already had it? 
I don’t think @theresa_may knows how to-or has the ability to- answer a question. She’s woeful in #PMQs & in this #LiaisonCommittee she remains as evasive & defensive as ever. We are learning nothing. I’d argue she only got past Phase One of #Brexit negotiations thanks to the EU!
Theresa May admits no impact assessments were carried out. Hilary Benn says we're about to publish what the government gave us and the public will soon realise there was no assessment of the impact of #brexit. #StopBrexit #FBPE

EU27’s “.. confusion (over #Brexit) is akin to that of passengers wondering what to do about a disruptive drunk on a bus. They are unsure whether to laugh nervously at our antics, try to reason with and help us in some way or just give us a wide berth to ensure their own safety.”

1. What strikes me about the #Brexit debate is the wave of negativity poured over anything remotely ambitious or optimistic. The default position is defeatism. Does seem to be a natural state for Brits.
There's an argument that #Brexit must be pushed through to avoid a loss of faith in democracy and civil disorder. The question we face is how to combat that argument. #StopBrexit #FBPE
1. Always the 'Best Possible Deal' never a 'BETTER DEAL' as U can't promise that can U? All UK citizens will be worse off & lose rights if #Brexit goes ahead. We lose FOM & the right to take the Govt to the ECJ when rights are infringed. British rights only as safe as 1 Parlmnt

When they said #Brexit was ‘taking back control’ they didn’t say that what they meant was the bosses taking back control of our rights at work by scrapping the advances our ancestors fought hard for. Don’t let them do it. #FBPE

How many of the British MPs, I wonder, have received money, freebies, hospitality or offers of jobs in the future from the EU? Because the way so many of them undermine #Brexit can't be explained by anything else than corruption.
Not sure this far-right extremist is getting the #Brexit poll result he wanted. Very different from Autumn last year when the Leavers were winning most polls. We've come a long way on Twitter. It would be interesting to know how we're progressing elsewhere.#StopBrexit #FBPE

The UK membership of this EU is built on 45 years of lies and deceit. We were lied to on the 1st referendum ‘Just a common market - no political integration’, we were denied referenda at Maastricht & Lisbon (cause we’d have overwhelmingly rejected it)#Brexit

#Brexit fans either don't care about The City of London or arrogantly just think that we'll get a deal for the financial services sector. Why would that happen? Paris, Frankfurt etc. would jump at the chance of those jobs coming to them. They won't relocate to Barnsley.
More facile posing  @Keir_Starmer. Maybe you could show what @uklabour "true colours" are when it comes to #Brexit. You are as chameleon-like as the Tories: no idea of the impact, no clear direction, just playing it for party gain while UK falls apart. No principle

It isn’t acceptable that we could get to ‘exit day’ and only have a sketchy framework outline of our future relationship with the EU. Public & businesses need FULL details of the proposed future trade deal, otherwise uncertainty will linger for years and years. #Brexit

Labours strategy re #Brexit is to deliberately confuse. This way, they hope to appeal to remaining remainers and leavers. Without exception, every single business owner I have met who voted remain tells me, ‘get on with it, leave won.’ Public mood has noticeably shifted.
The alt-right coup that is #Brexit has been driven by the divisive rhetoric of the Daily Mail @MailOnline and now Mail staff are becoming the mouth piece for the government.  Is Brexit a power grab by that man of the people Viscount Rothermere?

We were all expecting a downturn even before the Brexit vote happened. The centrist liberal media are trying to spin the effects of austerity to frame them as a consequence of #Brexit. No. This is entirely the result of Tory economic choices.
And the next shit who tells me that #Brexit is going to save the people of Ebbw Vale… agh, f off, the whole lot of you.The people in places like Ebbw Vale were sold a dud. Leaving the EU is going to make it harder to sort their predicament, not easier.
"Theresa May is due to meet her "#Brexit cabinet" to discuss for the first time what the UK's future relationship with the EU should be."Just a thought, shouldn't that have been done in great detail before even calling a referendum?! 
The real price of #Brexit begins to emerge and, ironically, it is about £350m a week
For nearly 8 years, Austerity measures by Tories, have attacked the Working Man, depleted the #NHS etc#Brexit under Tories will be a disaster, True.But Austerity will continue with or without #BrexitTory Austerity has ruined Britain, not #Brexit 
#Brexit: ‘Even before the UK has left the EU, the referendum result is costing the UK government more than can possibly be recovered by ending net contributions to Brussels’ @FT
Let's be clear #brexit is simply a stepping stone for the rise of the Right. It is nothing more to them than that. And when I say rise of the Right I mean the rise of the Reich. This is not some tea and biscuits Party, this is a global shift that threatens our future.
Goldman Sachs boss tells it how it is on #Brexit    Anyone listening out there ? 
All I want for Christmas is my country back and the #BREXIT 17.4 million people voted for! 
It has been clear throughout that Johnson’s idea of having our cake and eating it was nothing more than bluff. Barnier confirmed this last night with clear statement we face binary choice between single market or vanilla trade deal #Brexit

#Brexit: Theresa May to discuss end deal with ministers for the first time! 18 months since the referendum! This level of incompetence should not be tolerated. 
Labour's quandary on #Brexit is due to it cynically appealing to both Leavers & Remainers by being ambiguous, so it cannot now lead with a positionWhilst this is understandable it's *not* honourable, honest, straightforward politicsIt's that simple
And by supporting #Brexit @tom_watson & @UKLabour fulfil his life's work, supporting a victory for slashing of workers rights, intolerance, jingoism & backwards thinking.Possibly more important than Nigel's pension but by all means use it as a distraction Tom
Seeing these every day now on Twitter.  Respect & gratitude to every hero who has the guts to say "I was lied to, I'm now against #Brexit" - these are the ones who will turn the tide 
You hypocrites fought your #Brexit campaign claiming it would bring power back to UK Parliament now you want to marginalise the UK Parliament. You obviously know that Brexit will be a disaster 
This is why I cannot understand why  any Labour supporters can bear to back #Brexit. Look at the company they're keeping#StopBrexit

#FBPE #StopBrexit #Brexit The time has come. Gloves off, Brexit now needs to be stopped by a second referendum before we are damned by the stupid and self-interested. Persuade everyone you know to build a head of steam that the UK’s weak politicians will be unable to ignore
Top Politics Tip: When a government says 'We're not telling you our plan, we're keeping it a secret', it's because…IT HAS NO PLAN#Brexit
#Brexit is a faith based ideology. Asking a #Brexiteer to supply factual, rational evidence to back up their claims of a Brighter future out of Europe will forever be as fruitless as asking a priest for proof of an afterlife.
My mother voted #leave because she trusted the commitment to £350m for the NHS. She is angry that promise will not happen. She’s not online, so persuaded by press & bus. Mum wants another referendum. She feels she’s been lied to. #Brexit
Why is the BBC so sloppy in its reporting on #Brexit? Future spouses are not covered by the withdrawal agreement. This is something that still needs to be negotiated. 
#Brexit decision belongs to UK citizens, and I'm not one. But GS built its Euro biz in the UK on certain assumptions, pays taxes and employs thousands of UK citizens concerned about the economy and their futures. On their behalf, at least, I have to be interested in the outcome. 
The Working Time Regulations are the incorporation of the *EU* Working Time Directive into GB law, and yet Labour will *still* not stand up and unequivocally oppose #Brexit. You're failing working folk.
David Davis has lied to public and parliament over sharing #brexit assessments or incompetence.Now betting on a result he has an impact on would get you suspended for a long time in most sports.@JolyonMaugham how can he get away legally with this??
You @theresa_may have no right to speak on this. Your rhetoric of "subverting democracy" and the "will of the people" has demonised opponents of #Brexit as enemies of the people. It is the language of tyranny, and an incitement to hatred & violence. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
“The British public are too stupid to be involved in governing themselves” - Edward Heath, when asked why he lied to Parliament and the British people to get Britain into the EU.#Brexit 
The BBC states that family reunification rights in the latest #Brexit deal extend to future spouses/partners. This is not correct. They only extend to spouses/partners at the time of withdrawal (future ones still up for discussion btwn EU/UK) 1/2 
Theresa May says she'll not be derailed on #Brexit. Remember when she swore blind that there'd be no snap election? Yup. Time to #StopBrexit. We're winning, so keep the pressure on, #Remainers!

Labour is now a Remain Party.Corbyn played a game at the election - he appealed to Leave voters in Midlands & up North saying 'Trust Labour - he went down South & said 'Nudge, nudge, wink, wink, I want to protect the single market & champion #EU'#Brexit
Murdoch's papers coverage of bosses ability to force us to work more post #brexit was illustrated with "slave shackles" being broken. Think about that for a moment. The removal of workers' rights sold as workers' freedom. Think long & hard about that & then think about it again. 
This was always what #Brexit was about: removing all our rights, food and environmental standards, so no barriers to profit for the few. 
After #Brexit workers' rights, of any sort, will be at constant danger of being undermined by UK govts. That's why workers' rights are best defended by remaining in the EU. With the changing public in opinion polls, it is time for Labour to recognise that @Manuel_TSSA @Labour4EU
I asked a couple of newfound post-ref. trade enthusiasts who were on a bent about #Brexit + Global Britain this week what they thought of WTO appellate body dramatics + #MC11 developments. Just to make conversation, not to make a point. They had no idea what I was talking about
Voted #brexit to take back control did you?  Scrapping the  #WorkingTimeDirective takes away your ability to control the hours you work & hands it to unaccountable corporate power. This is just the beginning, those who sold you #brexit will be the only true beneficiaries.

It would help if the #BBC didn't restrict its vox pop interviews on #Brexit to old codgers out shopping. Youngsters, too, next time, please! It's their future at stake.
We voted, you appear to have misunderstood the result. To clarify for you the 'will of the people' was to LEAVE #Brexit 
It seems @JonathanPieNews might have overdone it on the eggnog. He's annoyingly happy & even #Brexit wont bring the mood down. Watch Jonathan's festive message:  Merry Christmas
I was born in the rough and ready year of 1923 in Barnsley to a family that had been miners for as long as there had been pits in Yorkshire. So, I've known the heartache of poverty but I can tell you #Brexit won't deliver anything for the working class but more penury. 
He also, sadly, is still the UK’s Foreign Minister.We do indeed tend to forget that, in amongst all the piffle.#Brexit 
My take on why #Brexit not only adversely impacts on unis but also on fight against sexual violence & online abuse 
When nationalism rears its head in an established nation it almost always represents a power-grab by a group that is at best careless of democracy, and almost always results in damage being inflicted on the society.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
This is the thing I can't understand. The majority of over 60's voted for #Brexit. They enjoyed 40 years of freedoms (many having settled in the EU), only to deny them to their own grandchildren. So totally selfish. I'd like to hear one defend that decision.
It's bizarre that anyone can think leaving the EU and going into a world of ruthless capitalist competition, and tax-dodging multinationals & billionaires is going to deliver some kind of British socialism. #Corbyn #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
We cannot be an EU colony for 2 years to 2021, accepting new laws made without any say so of British people or Parliament or Govt.That is not leaving EU, that is being a vassal state of #EU & I would be very surprised if that is Government policy.#Brexit
I dont know but @UKLabour should have debated #Brexit at conference rather than try & hide the squabbling, because we all see it now!Diane Abbot last week - 2nd referendumToday -  No referendumTom Watson today - referendum possible.I am confused. 
Boris is right! We must not be a vassal state of the EU after #Brexit.
We're at war, folks. The globalist elites ain't gonna let us #MAGA or #Brexit w/o a fight!
Remember #brexit was never about getting our country back it was always about returning Britain to the rich and privileged. 
We must not normalise hatred. Maintain respect for difference - different views, different, race, different religion. Extreme views on #Brexit must not preclude honest debate and careful consideration of alternative views 
RT - Tory ministers already looking to scrap workers rights at their cabinet meeting tomorrow.Scrapping holiday pay Safe working hours The right to breaks Tory hardliners will use #Brexit as an excuse to hammer workers into the ground.

Oh yes you did Ken, but nice try. To be fair, Ken is such a huge political figure, he is possibly the only rebel, one cannot accuse of inconsistency. He would demolish #Brexit and ignore the #EUREF result is a heartbeat- and do it with honour bcse he has always believed in the EU
…and in so doing destroy the Scottish economy.  Explained to him face to face last Tuesday the problem in Highlands & Islands where fifth of workforce due to retire in next few years but like most of @GovUk seems ideologically fixated and impervious to reason and facts. #Brexit

I voted for #Brexit and I’m educated.I got a feeling I'm not the only one. R/T if you’re like me.
#bbcsp Fat chance that the government will be prepared for the key Phase 2 of the #brexit negotiations when they unbelievably still haven’t even discussed (let alone agreed) what they want to secure (& also haven’t done impact assessments) 
Presumably Boris Johnson’s ‘liberal Brexit’ means more immigration to strike all those FTA’s across the world? The knots you get yourself into when you seize upon a protectionist vote to become more ‘open.’ #Brexit
How many times do we have to point out-working time directive does not prohibit overtime. Of course if you have an agenda that wants to scrap ANY protections for workers then I can see how you would continue to propagate this rubbish....   #DontbuytheSun. #Brexit #FBPE #Labour
Politicians be warned. If you push through #Brexit against the will of the majority (an ever more likely scenario), and things do not go well, then the consequences for you and our democracy are likely to be very damaging. There must be a #FinalSay.#StopBrexit #FBPE  /1
The 'issue' of the border between Norther Ireland and Ireland has been blown by Remainers out of all proportion to complicate #Brexit It's not even an issue and would have been decided easily, if not for Ireland's prostituting PM and weasels in Brussels.

"British workers set for overtime 'boom' as Ministers plot scrapping EU directives on working times & holidays limits". At present workers can decline by law excessive overtime or shorter holidays but post #brexit they will be free not to have the power to do so.

A reminder that many of the leading Brexiters want the #NHS privatised, which is something that a trade deal with the USA would go a long way to achieving. If we want to save the #NHS we have to #StopBrexit. #Brexit #FBPE

Ex #MI6 chief ‘not convinced Russia influenced #Brexit’ 
The key national priority should be prosecuting Blair for an illegal war. #Brexit is an important step for Britain to take.
1. On the basis of this latest poll MPs have no option but to put #Brexit back in the hands of the Ppl...only a #FinalSay in 2018 can give the real answer & if the real Will of the Ppl is to #StopBrexit then it must be stopped, no ifs, buts or maybes.
For the lulzMore than half of Britons now want to stay in the EU #Brexit 
Yup most small farmers love seeing big farmers get £365000 a year from single farm payments. They’re equally overjoyed when people move into the countryside,buy farms,pocket single farm payments and rent out the land to working farmers. It’s why most farmers I know voted #Brexit 
I hope someone has sat Corbyn down with some figures to explain that if #Brexit goes ahead, Corbyn's ambitious plans for the UK are utterly impossible. The longer he waits to work this out, the more culpable he is for the resulting shitstorm.
#Brexit: Britons now back Remain over Leave by 10 points, exclusive poll shows. The British public has swung behind staying in the EU by its largest margin since the referendum, with those backing Remain outstripping Leavers by ten points.

Billions of pounds of EU subsidies to encourage green farming were pocketed by farmers who did nothing to protect the environment with the money  #Brexit
It still astonishes me that people can't associate "bonfire of regulations" with "removal of workers / environmental/ human rights". This is the reason for #Brexit.
Our comment in @guardian tomorrow's Observer on need for Parliament to control #brexit not brexit controlling Parliament 
Very concerned about what's happened to our country #brexit vote was to take back control by Parliament not bullying from one group 
#FBPE and #StopBrexit is a growing movement. Let's build it into a tidal wave. People are starting to see #Brexit for what it is: a bunch of lies spread by power grabbing elites to exploit the dissatisfaction of the masses by blaming immigrants. It's a slippery slope, fascism...

Unreal! #Brexit blamed for higher price of cod IMPORTS when the reason we have to IMPORT cod is that British fishing waters are a free-for-all for other EU countries and OUR fisherman can't fish for OUR cod!

Having seen what #Brexit is likely to look like, Britons now back Remain over Leave by 10 points, new poll shows.No wonder Brexiters are so keen to quash the idea of a ratification referendum.  @MollyMEP
A clear & growing majority now want to stay in the EU. The fact that sentiment can change so fast highlights why it is lunacy to implement such a drastic constitutional change as #Brexit on an evenly split 52/48% referendum vote.

Has @Theresa_May made any statement to condemn the incitement by the #Brexit press, or is she content to carry on inflaming the climate of violence herself with her use of "Will of the People" rhetoric which demonises opponents as enemies of the people"?#StopBrexit #FBPE
Another #Brexit myth exploded and this time amazingly by the FT “The UK’s biggest international banks are set to move fewer than 4,600 jobs from London in preparation for Brexit — just 6 per cent of their total workforce in the financial centre” -not the tens of thousands then..
Then what is the point of #Brexit?

Here it is. All the inside juice.  My blow-by-blow fireside weekend long read on how #Brexit *really* went down. 
Good to talk to @BBCRadioWales this morning about the Government's #Brexit shambles of this week - apparently I was supposed to have a pro-Brexit opponent to debate but they didn't dial in...! @Open_Britain
You have no idea what they voted for, conditions of #brexit were not on the ballot and you failed to get a mandate in the last election. Did you forget that you are only in power because of your deal with the DUP devil? 
Sorry to repeat this, but when May called an election to check it still wanted a Tory #Brexit, she lost her majority and less than 50% backed her. So remind me again, how is #Brexit still the will of the majority?. Where is her mandate?
If #Brexit goes ahead, the Tories will prolong #Austerity to pay for it. Their harsh regime will continue, the numbers using foodbanks or becoming homeless will increase and the #NHS will be gutted. Yet you support #Brexit. I don't know how you live with the cognitive dissonance.
And let's not forget that they've already killed one MP and threatened several others to further the cause of their nihilistic #Brexit death cult.
 correspondent of the ARD on the disgracefully unbalanced BBC coverage of #Brexit #shambles #falsebalance @annettedittert more of this, please!
Leaving the EU with no deal and entering World Trade Organization rules would lead to the greatest economic losses for the UK post-#Brexit.This would reduce future GDP by nearly 5 percent over 10 years — a loss of $140 billion.
On #May19 the British state will use a wedding as a neurotoxin to calm political disquiet over #Brexit. In Scotland we should hold the mother of all independence rallies. Let's start planning.
As I said to the All Party Parliament Foreign Affairs Group on Wednesday, investigating the alleged Mercer (Cambridge Analytica) and Putin interference in #Brexit is not about Remain or Leave, but safeguarding our democracy
Labour’s #Brexit Positions  
David Tennant: Do you think there will come a time when Jeremy Corbyn will say ANYTHING about Brexit?@AngelaRayner: Jeremy has been very clear on #BrexitAudience: *laughs*Rayner: We want a strong economy with good jobsTennant: That’s an aspiration, not a policy.  
Its official. @UKLabour have not got a clue on #BrexitTrying to explain #Labour Brexit policy, Angela Rayner said “we want a strong economy and good jobs." So out of touch its not funny. This is our future and country you are laughing at#LabourFailpic.twitter.com/H5SYZ33kVl
'Taken for mugs!'#Brexit trade talks won't start until MARCH !Nigel Farage: “If trade talks don't start until March why did Theresa May leave Downing St so early last Friday?“We've been taken for mugs, no wonder #EU leaders applauded her last night”
You can't make this nonsense up. The sheer patronising, ignorance of these responses. Ireland is seen as not being able to come up with its own foreign policy. The truth is it's the UK that doesn't have any, whereas Ireland has a nuanced, settled #brexit stance for a long time . 
Almost irrelevant...if #Brexit goes ahead it'll be lose lose...UK will be tied to EU rules & regs into the long term or there'll be divergence & then there's a hard border somewhere...so we end up with PAY & OBEY NO SAY..economy damaged, control & influence lost. #FinalSay & STAY
I think I'm fairly switched on !BUTI haven't a clue where we are with this PESKY #Brexit gig !You know what ?I don't think the Govt have a clue either !
11 Conservative MPs placed the wellbeing of their country before the undemocratic power grabbing aspirations of their party. They deserve our gratitude. That they numbered only 11 is shameful.#StopBrexit #Brexit #WithdrawalBill #ExitFromBrexit #UKPolitics #leave #meaningfulvote
EU nationals in the UK have my complete sympathy and support, I pay UK taxes but live in the EU 27 and had no vote or voice either, #Brexit is a travesty, stand up for the disenfranchised #StopBrexit #ExitFromBrexit
Loving @AngelaRayner on  #HIGNFY. #Brexit, DUP, women’s rights and anti Tory jokes plus nice ability to laugh at herself. Well done comrade! 
And of this climate of violence is being whipped up the #Brexit billionaire press, and by @Theresa_May who with her talk of the "Will of the People" is portraying political opponents as enemies of the people.#StopBrexit #FBPE
“70% of Labour constituencies voted for Brexit. That’s 70% of Labour MPs that are going to have to explain to their constituents why they betrayed the Brexit. If Farage comes back into frontline politics both Labour and the Conservatives will pay a price for it” #LIVE #Brexit 
Anna Soubry receives messages calling for her to be hanged as a traitor.Enough is enough! #Brexit must be cancelled immediately. To continue is to surrender to terrorism (by the govt's own definition).#StopBrexit #FBPE
Seems all Conservative MPs are happy with the proposed EU Withdrawal Bill amendment. The PM can now focus on getting the best #Brexit deal for the UK, and we should all give her 100% support.
“Boris to go the full Gandhi”Whaaaaaat?Rather demeans Gandhi to be mentioned in the same sentence as Johnson!#Brexit 
Varadkar giving a not-so-subtle reminder of what the UK is leaving by leaving the EU - strength in numbers.Ireland is a tiny country, but the #Brexit talks have shown being part of the EU gives it more power. UK is not quite the "major" power it thinks
“Don’t talk to me about parliamentary oversight like parliament is something God sent us to oversee our affairs. Parliament gave the Brexit decision to the people to make. The people made it and parliament has cheated them of it” @georgegalloway exclusively on @talkRADIO #Brexit 
So when #Brexit politicians like @theresa_may claim to be carrying out the "Will of the People" they are not making a numerical error. They are directly attacking what is perhaps the most fundamental of democratic rights - the right to oppose.#StopBrexit #FBPE /4
The #Brexit positions of @Conservatives and @UKLabour are increasingly confusing. We've tried to make them as clear as possible, despite the ambiguity.While Labour is being unclear, Tories are being unrealistic and misleading public about what can be achieved.(RT)

Leaving the EU has never been the settled will of the British people. The referendum produced a marginal result based on many falsehoods. Since then opinion polls show a small but growing majority against #Brexit. People deserve the chance to think again.
How can you call it the "will of the people" when only 26% voted for it, millions were cynically denied a vote, dodgy psychological warfare tactics were used, huge lies were told, false promises made and so much isn't even decided by the people? #Brexit #StopBrexit
When Dominic Grieve & Bernard Jenkin & Government are all happy with the #Brexit date amendment you know we’re in a good place. 
EU Demand too much...German Chancellor Mrs Merkel says it's "not acceptable" for EU member states to protect their people from unlimited immigration & should meet minimum migrant quotas as demanded by Brussels.So glad we're Leaving #EU#Brexit

Phase1 of #Brexit negotiations is officially over. Thanks to so many on the Irish team in Dub & Brussels who worked to secure Ireland's interests. Well deserved rest for many before we move into new year and Phase2 begins. 
Answer to the problems ahead is to abandon the Tory madness of #Brexit or at the very least insist on continuing membership of Single Market & Customs Union.  Answer is not hysteria about progressive taxation.

If the decline in small farms continues, farms under 50 hectares could all but disappear from the English countryside by the middle of the century. We need the government to ensure any new funding models after #Brexit can help farms of all sizes.

Leave promised a #Brexit in which the UK could have its cake and eat it. They then scrambled for cover, knowing it could not be delivered. They don't now get to redefine the mandate according to misconceived theories on whether most people were interested in eating the frosting.

"Quite significant progress made" but next phase of EU-UK talks "even tougher" - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on #Brexit 
EU leaders have agreed to proceed onto the next phase of #Brexit negotiations. Getting the best Brexit deal for our country will mean we can build a better future for our country by getting control of our laws, money and borders. 
This will definitely be true for the transition and more likely than not also for the long term relationship.But this realisation is the sound of Brexiteers political fictions crashing with the realities of international politics. #brexit

The 2nd phase will be the tougher part of #Brexit negotiations. The EU27 must stand united. Sectoral interests should not make us forget about the big picture. The defense of EU citizens is the priority. #EUCO
This will be the biggest fight of #Brexit talks Phase 2: Theresa wants a full trade deal for her £39bn, EU so far just offering a “political declaration accompanying the Withdrawal Agreement”. That’s quite a gap. 
The #BrexitVote was the biggest #vote in #UK history & all @theresa_may can do is to betray the country, Instead of working to make #Brexit #BRITAIN a Global #Economic success! #TheresaMay is working against her own people! DISGRACEFUL #BBC #SKY @Conservatives @ConHome #TORY
#EU27 agreed: #Brexit negotiations can move on to 2nd phase. Sufficient progress made on: citizens' rights, Ireland & financial settlement. More info: 
When #Brexit is finally done, someone will list all the things we’ve lost and the price we’ve paid. They’ll point out that the gains are invisible to all but the wealthiest, yet the losses are palpable. Only then will the UK realise how it was duped. That it was all for nothing!
"You're stabbing us in the back!" - A #bbcqt audience member in Barnsley who voted for #Brexit lets rip.

According to @bbclaurak, a priority in phase 2 of #Brexit negotiations is now putting the Irish border guarantees in more formal, legally binding language. This is a situation entirely created by @DavidDavisMP's loose tongue. Incompetence eating into an already tight timetable.
Dominic Grieve says he received death threats after #Brexit vote.The Daily Mail, The Express & The Sun all bear responsibility for Jo Cox's murder; by dehumanising & hating Remainers continually in the press they're inciting violence.

Detailed story of the London-Brussels-Dublin-DUP negotiations that led to agreement on moving to phase two of the #Brexit talks.Says Varadkar told May in Sweden he’d use Ireland’s veto ‘to take the hard border off the table’.Fascinating stuff. 
How have we got to the position where MPs voting simply to uphold the power of Parliament against executive arrogance are labelled 'traitors' by one rag while another calls for them to be  deselected? The dogma of #Brexit is blinding them to both the injustice & the irony
Dear @NickyMorgan01 just wanted to say your a brave woman to go on #bbcqt in Barnsley the day after your #Brexit rebellion
Too right! @IsabelOakeshott last night told @NickyMorgan01 what we’d all love to ie that she has done nothing but "humiliate" the Prime Minister & undermined her negotiating position #bbcqt #Brexit
I don’t think a lot of remainers have figured out that #hard #brexit is more of a possibility now because of those rebels. If parliament rejects the final deal it will mean WTO tariffs for trade. #planning

A key criticism has been that Labour's #Brexit position is muddled & unclear.As the opposition Party, it is important for it to hold a coherent policy on the #EU.What do you think?
ATTENTION a very important moment is fast approaching: the moment when Leavers switch from saying #Brexit right policy because economy not so bad ("project fear") to claiming only hard Brexit will stimulate growth & solve UK economic problems
Many people used to ask with astonishment how fascism could have taken hold of a rich and advanced country, and whether it could happen again. The last two years have provided a large part of the answer. Never take democracy for granted!#Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE

It isn't even about #Brexit per se any more, but about mass democracy itself.At least half of the combined Commons & Lords can barely conceal their contempt for the demos, & their intolerance of being subject to it.

Make no mistake, people, #TheresaMay had been appointed as PM to destrpoy #Brexit and she did just that, both through foul play and her appalling incompetence. All those votes in parliament mean nothing. The deed is done. The farce  that is now played out is just that, a farce.
#Brexit is making some people seriously cray cray, bordering on unhinged
Asked one EU diplomat if thought that May's defeat would change how she seen among capitals ahead of summit. 'I don't particularly think so. We all knew her situation." #Brexit
Even only 29% of *Remainers* want to stop #Brexit.It's a minority opinion, but that minority is disproportionately concentrated in the legislature, ~60% of which wants to stop it.The real rift in UK politics is now between People and Parliament.Where is our Oliver Cromwell? 
The DAILY MAIL tries to attack the Tory rebels, but they forget that they achieved what the Brexiteers had failed to deliver. Namely to take back control and return it to parliament. They should be singing the prises of the rebels for keeping a #Brexit promise to 17.4m people.

The worst thing about the latest #Brexit vote in the UK #Parliament is that 305 so-called MPs voted AGAINST parliament being sovereign. Every one of them is effectively saying their job is pointless. Make sure of that at the next election.

Tomorrows Daily Mail on those #brexit rebels that disregarded the Nations interests tonight. 
UK business lobbyists constantly say we need certainty re a #Brexit plan so I await the concern over events today where the gov “deal” seen as +ve yesterday is now more uncertain. 
I cant wait for those celebrating tonights defeat to realise that they have now increased the chances of a no deal #BrexitWell done for putting your selfish interests before those of the nation. 
Little tip for EU negotiations: if those you’re negotiating with think your position is more legitimate, they are more likely to listen to it.Tonight’s vote means May has to listen to Parliament, and her position is hence more legitimate.#Brexit 
This dreadful woman & failed Minister @NickyMorgan01 wants to derail #Brexit. Let her know what you think of her. I think she’s an evil anti-democrat.
Toby Young, Jacob Rees Mogg, Boris Johnson, John Redwood, Bill Cash, Nadine Dorries, Julia Hartley Brewer, Paul Dacre, Rupert Murdoch, Tony Parsons, Rod Liddle, Julie Burchill & Michael Gove -its almost as if #brexit is a tool to enable identification of the very worst in society
Never forget - we did this by voting Labour at the last election. If Theresa May had got the 100 seat majority she wanted, the Tories would have been able to force through an unaccountable hard #Brexit. #Amendment7
Control and the final say on #brexit is now back where it belongs in Parliament. Well done to the MPs who followed their principles. Shame on those who abstained #Amendment7 #brexitbill #EUWithdrawalBill
I’m sure the Brexiteers who voted Labour at the GE will be happy to hear that!#LabourLies #Brexit 
Any Conservative MPs who voted against the government on #Amendment7 - including Dominic Grieve, Stephen Hammond, Kenneth Clarke and Anna Soubry - should be deselected as they have betrayed the will of the British people and clearly cannot accept a full #Brexit happening.
Not a Tory but incredibly proud of my MP Dominic Grieve today! #DominicGrieve #brexit
Everyone? I voted to Leave the EU. You are clearly working to stop #Brexit. How dare you claim to act in my interest. 
This week phase I concluded with a soft #brexit and Parliament got its vote on the final deal. I have blocked more bots than in all my time on twitter. Someone panicking?

Just 12% of British voters want the government to “abandon #Brexit completely” and keep the UK locked inside the European Union, a new YouGov poll has revealed. 
Disgusted at Remainers trying tactic after tactic to delay the #Brexit process. The majority of British people have spoken. Let's get on with it, Britain's finest years lay ahead. #ProudBrit
No; I was trying to get Tantalotoo to take his blinkers off for a sec. If you took #Brexit out of the equation, nobody would ever accept the way the Tories have run rough-shod over parliament. Sadly, most brexiters can't see beyond *Brexit* so are blind to the harm being done.
Congratulations Dominic Grieve. #article7 #Brexit
Isn't Parliament's meaningful vote on the #brexit deal the way to make sure 'the people' are now adequately represented regarding what they voted for? I thought that was the whole point of asking us in the first place.
Stand tall Theresa May. Vast majority of #Conservative MPs & members are behind you tonight. No pathetically small amount of egotistical Tory rebels or opportunistic #Labour MPs will stop you & the gov delivering in the national interest. #ImWithMay #EUWithdrawalBill #Brexit
The oddest thing is environmentalists applauding Remainer efforts to keep us in the EU. The EU’s Common Agricultural and Fisheries policies have absolutely wrecked our natural environment. #Brexit is the best opportunity for environmental regeneration we’ve ever had.
Very telling that not a single @ScotTories MP stood up to the government on this #Brexit vote tonight 
Living in Scotland watching England make most of the vital decisions for you, I get a sense of what it must have been like as a suffragette, watching the men folk make all the big decisions. #brexit
Remember this: Not one single Scottish Tory MP voted against keeping the terms of the final #Brexit deal entirely under control of the Conservative government, or to enable the UK Parliament having any say. Party comes first. They are no democrats.
Given @theresa_may has just sacked this chap instantly for voting against #Brexit never, ever, question her loyalty to the public to deliver #Brexit

Tonight you did us proud Mr Grieve! You spoke to our conference in October and gave us hope and now we see the fruits of your labours. We thank you. @_Britain4Europe #Brexit 
How come so many people in Britain are so afraid of no-deal #Brexit ? The EU has a huge positive annual trade balance with the UK and its economy will simply collapse if it loses it. So telling Brussels to go fuck itself is a great option.
Barnier is now negotiating with the House of Commons as the PM @Number10gov has been effectively rendered impotent. Chances of a no deal #brexit have gone up having gone down last week.

Good on U @Anna_Soubry...here's one in the eye for the haters...millions more back your stance. These ppl must not be our future..37% voters isn't the Will. All options must be retained incl a Binding #FinalSay in 2018 when Ppl should be allowed to Confirm #Brexit or #StopBrexit
Tonight MPs have taken back control for the British people. We will scrutinise the Brexit process on behalf of our constituents, and we will not tolerate a #Brexit that damages our economy or our great country. (4/4)
The Commons has been absolutely clear tonight that we will not permit our country to be railroaded into a job-destroying hard #Brexit, or even a no deal Brexit, without Parliament having a meaningful vote on the matter. (2/4)

BREAKING: British Prime Minister Theresa May loses key #Brexit vote in British parliament, 309-to-305
Government defeated by 309 to 305  on a meaningful vote on #Brexit this is good news for eventually staying in the single market.
Parliament erupts In shouts & cheers! Ayes 309, No 305 - thanks to all who campaigned so hard for parliament to have a meaningful vote on #Brexit - we did it!
Just voted for Amendment 7 - to give Parliament a meaningful vote on the #Brexit agreement. Don’t be fooled - this is a vote to give Parliament the power to control our country’s destiny!
AYES 309 - NOs 305. VERY close vote, but government LOSES for first time on Brexit. Hugely embarrassing for PM. Ultimate drama today! #Brexit
The House of Commons has agreed a proposal that the final #Brexit deal has to be approved in a new law passed by Parliament. MPs vote 309 to 305 to approve Amendment 7 to the #EUWithdrawalBill.
Just going through the voting lobbies in one one of the most important votes - respect to all those who are putting democracy & national interest above party interest - crossing fingers that cross party collaboration will pay off  #Brexit 
The vote on Amendment 7 at 7pm is crucial. It would keep Parliament in the driving seat on #Brexit - taking back control! - rather than be treated as a rubber stamp, leaving the country’s fate solely in the hands of the Prime Minister. Time for Parliament to assert itself.
"Denying the devolved countries a say on the final deal risks subjecting Wales to policies and an ideology that has so far caused our country grievous harm." @HywelPlaidCymru urges Labour to support our calls for Wales to have a say on the final #Brexit deal. #EUWithdrawalBill
I will back Dominic Grieve's amendment giving Parliament a proper say on the Brexit deal if he pushes it to a vote tonight. The terms of our future are not for the government alone to determine. #brexit
Let's start an avalanche of votes against this #Brexit madness. Hundreds of MPs on the government's side are against it. Stop being whipped. Start protecting the UKs interests. The referendum was advisory, it's now clear that the advice was bad.
.  @UKGov still don't get that the problems for EU nationals are not something that needs to be sorted by March 2019; the uncertainty and anxiety is happening right NOW #BrexitShambles #Brexit 
Jacob Rees-Mogg just DESTROYED the Wets argument.The government has already given a meaningful vote to the house regarding the final deal.What Dominic Grieves' amendment is doing, is trying to deny the ability for ANY deal to go through at all, good or lacking. #Brexit
I stand up for everyone’s right to hold an opinion even if I cannot always support that opinion (life would be so boring if all agreed!) However I cannot support any opinion that puts #Brexit in jeopardy Roll on March 2019!  #EUWithdrawalBill
Any special #Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland must also be available for the sitting and accountable parliaments of Scotland and Wales #EUWithdrawalBill
INCREDIBLE: November 2002 and David Davis MP is explaining to the House of Commons why referendums are dangerous - particularly when the electorate is not fully availed of the facts. It's brilliantly put and absolutely correct #Brexit #Amendment7

Grieve making absolutely clear now he *will* vote against Government in pushing his Amendment 7 and that if it doesn't win he will vote against Clause 9 of #Brexit Bill. Crucial stuff. Brave speech defending basic Parliamentary democracy and sovereignty. #YesTo7

Brave Tory "mutineers" should take David Davis' promise this morning with a pinch of salt, writes @Hugodixon. They should stick to their guns and get copper-bottomed guarantee that Parliament must approve #Brexit deal.
In 2012 David Davis called for a double referendum strategy, with a mandate referendum and a final decision referendum. Now he denies the British people the democratic right to a decision referendum!#Brexit - built on hypocrisy and lies.#StopBrexit #FBPE #FinalSay
Its vital that #Brexit is a moment of democratic &  Parliamentary #Renewal.  And that public trust in Parliament is enhanced. Which means people must SEE that Parliament (and @Conservatives Party) is working for & representing all views on #EUbill #Article7 #PMQs

MPs are debating the EU Withdrawal Bill today and our rights are at stake. Here's why you should tell your MP to vote for a #PeoplesClause so we keep our rights after #Brexit 
It is vital that Parliament passes Amendment 7 to the #EU Withdrawal Bill, to support sovereignty and respect the will of the people at the last general election. MPs need a genuinely meaningful vote on any #Brexit deal before we leave the EU. #YesTo7
Congratulations to all these good people fighting for Parliament, not a small cabal of self-interested Tory Eurosceptics, to take control of #Brexit@Mcr4EU @Labour4EU @BrexitBin @spaceangel1964 #StopBrexit #FinalSay
This is very important.The European Parliament does not trust the British side will actually do what it says, and will negotiate accordingly. The EU side is right in its analysis.#Brexit 
#brexit All the usual bloody Remoaner bores, out trying to derail brexit again !!! Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry, Dominic Grieve. Labours MPs out as well trying to stop Brexit. Get it through your thick skulls 17 million voted leave. We’re leaving get it.      
The SNP @theSNP will back Dominic Grieve's amendment 7 to #EUWithdrawalBill giving Parliament a proper say on the Brexit deal if he pushes it to a vote tonight. We urge him to do so #Brexit 
After 18 months of denial, everyone now knows what #Brexit really means for the UK: spinning out of control instead of taking back control. #EPlenary @EPPGroup @Europarl_EN

This evening MPs vote on one of the biggest issues of #Brexit - a vote on whether the terms of the final deal is acceptable to Parliament. The Government must not be allowed to drive through a hard Brexit on their own. I'll be voting FOR Amendment 7. 
Thank you @DanielZeichner for supporting the amendment on Single Market Membership yesterday, and good luck with today's more critical vote on a #FinalSay on #Brexit  #YesTo7
Amusing. The language startup @iliniFrench is offering the UK’s #Brexit negotiators free French courses “On ne peut pas avoir le beurre et l’argent du beurre” - you can’t have your cake and eat it“Vous pouvez toujours courir” - you can go whistle
The UK’s vote to leave the EU will have major implications for health and social care in England. See our analysis of the key issues that must remain high on the government’s agenda during #Brexit negotiations:

So, you are trying to assume complete jurisdictional rights for post-#Brexit UK.  You don't get it do you?  We are leaving the #EU behind
MORNING TWITTER! So, if the good people of #Alabama can stick 2 fingers up to Trump, let us follow their example and tell this nasty racist Govt where it can stick its #Brexit! (clue: where the sun don't shine)

The only #brexit SHOCK here is the Daily Express being realistic. 
ANYONE defending #JeremyCorbyn can go fuck right off. He’s ruined the Labour Party, offers such feeble opposition (thus enabling hard right Tories), and - after last night - he’s left us on a path towards #Brexit oblivion. Fuck you Corbyn & all your friends.#StopBrexit
If you're not entirely certain of the significance of #Amendment7 in the context of #Brexit, @Reuters has a clear explanation here:
The key elements of a ‘meaningful’ Parliamentary vote on #Brexit:1. Must come before exit day;2. Parl provided beforehand with comprehensive details of the deal, not simple heads of terms;3. Act of Parl approving terms before the PM signs any agreement. 
It is absolutely vital Parliament reasserts itself in the #Brexit process and does not give the Government a blank cheque. This is Dominic Grieve’s crucial Amendment 7 to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, being voted on later, to ensure Parliament takes back control. 
Everyone has the right to go to work in the morning with the expectation they will come home safe to their families at night #Brexit can’t allow Tories to take away workers’ rights & vital EU health & safety law @TUCnews @unionstogether @Manuel_TSSA @TheProgressives

Roll up, roll up - Sign this petition to Leave the EU immediately.. 71.000 so far, all the EU want to do is punish us with a bad deal, let's get this debated & confirm to MP's its what we voted for.. #Brexit  
Don't trust the UK Tory Govt...the majority of UK citizens don't...it's them aided by a self serving opposition that have brought this country to this #Brexit debacle & now seek to force it through on the basis of 37% of the UK voters. Pin them down in  us.
The Labour leadership as with the Tories have shown their true colours time and again...such a strategic mistake...#Remain is growing & will wreak a terrible revenge on those backing #Brexit. We are witnessing a travesty of democracy. 
The #Labour front bench and scores of MPs have sided with Mrs May's Conservatives again. @UKLabour pretend to be against #Brexit, whilst doing everything possible to achieve Brexit. They shed crocodile tears. 
#Brexit will undoubtedly damage the UK.Engineered to keep right wing Tory and UKIP supporters happy, yet Momentum Labour backs it. Strange times...Time for progressives to back the @LibDems
Even the Daily Express admits #brexit would be a costly, damaging exercise, under ANY scenario: 
The Express, once again, reporting so called “Project Fear”. More evidence of a subtle shift in the pro-#Brexit media? Let’s hope so. #StopBrexit #FinalSay #FinalSayForAll
Brexit SHOCK Daily Express warns its readers UK will be worse off as a result of #BrexitIf only they'd had been saying this earlier! 
Corbyn orders his MPs to duck out, take no view, pass no opinion on major questions around #Brexit@Keir_Starmer attacks the Government record on #Brexit & the economy, but when he's actually called to take action, like all of Labour he hides behind "no comment"
Frame this.#Brexit 
93 MPs voted for the Single Market and for British jobs. Lib Dems, SNP, Soubry, Clarke and 40+ Labour. Where were the Labour front bench? Tories voted against of course. #Brexit #FBPE
Labour Remainers: L'ship wants a hard #BrexitL'ship believes you have nowhere else to go & so will keep forgiving/ignoring their pro Brexit support of GovernmentTalk of "jobs 1st Brexit" is cheapAll that really matters are the Brexit supporting votesWhen will you jump? 
So @UKLabour has failed to vote in favour of a #Brexit amendment that would have kept the door open to the Single Market. They are truly the Tory Brexiteers' lackeys. 
So with yet another #Labstain on Single Market membership, you have to ask, what is the point of these Labour MP's? #Brexit
To every first-time voter who trusted Jeremy Corbyn in June 2017 because you felt betrayed by #Brexit, the betrayal didn't stop there. It won't stop until you accept that Labour isn't a #Remain party and change your vote.
Voting on #WithdrawalBill.  Sad sight of majority of official opposition (with usual honourable exceptions) sitting out an opportunity to keep open the opportunity to remain in Single Market #Brexit

EU readies 'David Davis-proof' #Brexit summit 
Food inflation soars to 4.4% as a result of the pounds collapse against the Euro following #Brexit vote.And remember these increases are forever. Even if inflation falls next year, it will still be on top of these rises.Well done Farage with your £75K index linked EU pension
The referendum Leave option was so vague & hand-waving that Diane James can claim the vote was all about immigration, while Dan Hannan claims anyone who says that is almost certainly a Remainer!No basis or mandate for a huge and complex change. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
We have 650 MPs & 798 peers yet only 40 have viewed the 850 page #Brexit impact analyses in Parliament. Where’s the scrutiny?
Given fractious politics in UK, might a broad commitment to a "deep and special partnership" [EU source: "adjectives are free"] be tempting?It would mask limitations "Canada Dry" deal. It would get May over the line - recall #Brexit has always been about Tory party management/6
For Tim Martin, the ruination of British farmers is a price worth paying for 3.5p off a Wetherspoons meal and 0.5p off the price of a pint.And even those "benefits" are highly doubtful - #Brexit-related inflation has already pushed food prices up steeply.#StopBrexit

#DavidDavis serial mistakes on #brexit reveal a man completely out of his depth:
Good #Brexit discussion w/ 27 ministers. Negotiations in phase 2 will progress only if joint report commitments are reflected in full in withdrawal agreement.Also: thank you @EU2017EE for excellent work- now off to Strasbourg to debate #Brexit w/ #EP
There is "no possibility" that Britain and the EU can conclude a free trade agreement by the time Britain leaves in March 2019, Michel Barner said on Tuesday. - This means MPs will vote on #Brexit without knowing what comes next, unacceptable! 
. @ScotGov absolutely clear that there must be acceptable , agreed amendments to EU Withdrawal Bill and clarity on frameworks before any progress on LCM .  Disappointed that didn’t happen today at JMC (EN) in London but will keep trying. #Brexit 
If the Tories insist on going through with their disastrous #Brexit, then as @The_TUC has made clear, Single Market membership is absolutely vital to ensuring continued prosperity and workers' protections.
Excellent piece by @karla_hill @ClientEarth on why MPs debating the #EUWithdrawalBill today need to hear details from Ministers on @michaelgove's plans for a new, domestic environmental protection regime after #Brexit 
Shocked by statement of @EU_Commission that British people in EU27 lose freedom of movement cos of UK gvt choices. Dear Commission: British people are still EU citizens, you have to represent them and secure their rights after #Brexit like all other EU citizens!

A transitional period, during which the UK will enjoy continued access to the European Single Market, is not an automatism. It will depend on the results of the second round of talks. Read my opinion piece in @PoliticoEurope #Brexit 
1. OLIVER LETWIN: 'The British Ppl voted to leave the EU'..#Brexit is 'certainly secondary to whether we maintain a democracy'ME: 37% of voters in a non-binding vote isn't the Britsh Ppl! & to maintain democracy the Ppl must be given a #FinalSay 2018 with a #StopBrexit option.
Let's face it, you'd never back David Davis to play poker would you? or to do much else for that matter?More seriously this has to be the right move by @guyverhofstadtIt's acting responsibly for all EU citizens (inc. Brits) re #Brexit unlike our own govt.#ExitFromBrexit
Understand latest version of @EUCouncil #Brexit guidelines have added mention of ECJ and set March 2018 for adoption of further guidelines on future partnership with the U.K. Doesn’t appear to be hardening of language on linking phase 1 commitments with phase 2.
My speech in yesterday's debate on a ratification referendum. People must have the final say on #Brexit. 
The consequences of unedifying wordplay at the highest levels of govt #Brexit 
We welcome the Government’s new bill requiring that UK law recognises animals as "sentient beings" after #Brexit. We will work to ensure this law is applied to all animals, whether they are on farms, in our homes, or in the wild. Full statement: 
#brexit Every time turn TV radio on Remoaner Labour bore Chuka Umunna on. Unbelievable the dweeb on everywhere saying same thing everyday nonsense. Newsnight, Skynews, BBC, ITV, Channel 4 News. From the man who bottled it when he had his chance become Labour leader. Go away FFS. 
A democracy worthy of the name must mean voters having a real say over the biggest decisions affecting their lives. That's why we're calling for a ratification referendum giving the people the #FinalSay on the #Brexit deal. And that has to include the option to stay in the EU. 
Thanks to Tory #Brexit inflation is at a 6 year high. This is bad news in the run-up to Christmas with higher food prices and a 3.4% price rise in January for rail commuters.
Democracy is a process not an event. The people must have a Vote on the Deal. #Brexit #FBPE
What an honor: David Davis gets his own amendment in the European Parliament's #Brexit resolution 
Disappointing denial of democracy by @UKLabour - #democracy demands #FinalSayForAll, since 2016 Leave campaign didn't ID type of #Brexit or explain impacts #FinalSay
Inflation's risen almost continously since #Brexit vote. Now clearly outstripping pay increases. I hope we don't hear leavers complaining about this, it's largely result of  their actions. Words turkeys, voting & christmas spring to mind!#exitfrombrexit

So if you are an EU negotiator sat opposite to David Davis, are you going to trust anything he says?#Brexit
If this was a Labour govt. the right-wing press would be tearing it to shreds. But they don’t have the patriotism or honesty to point out the failings of a Conservative govt. and its approach to #Brexit.
I think the Tories may have got confused with their usual catchphrase: ‘Nothing is greed until everything is greed’.#Brexit
.@theresa_may on the #Brexit deal"It is good news for those who voted leave..It is good news for those who voted remain.""We are going to leave in a smooth & orderly way, taking back control of our Borders, Money & Laws.""That is my mission, & it is this governments mission 
Is that true @DanielJHannan? You are lobbying for a hard #Brexit that would hugely benefit a company you receive €1-5k consultancy fees per month from? 
Wouldn’t it be great if 2018 saw the end of the #Trump Presidency and the collapse of #Brexit? It would become my favourite year ever! We, the people of America and Britain can make it happen, it’s up to us, let’s make it happen!
Polish Reject ‘EU OCCUPATION’"Europe is not developing. Eurosocialism is regressing us.”Frustrated young people are struggling to come to terms with rules imposed by Brussels’ unelected elite of bureaucrats & call for immediate #EU withdrawal.#Brexit
Ha! The PM CLAIMS she's SATISFIED *remainers* & *leavers*This pesky 1st phase #Brexit is so VAGUE - people are reading into it whatever they want to !#ConstructiveAmbiguity
The #Brexit campaign deliberately didn't set out what leaving would look like. The people should have the #FinalSay once the facts become clear. #finalsaydebate
The Tories are going on about a CETA+++ trade deal. But in the real world a trade deal requires a hard border in Ireland or the Irish Sea. The EU and Ireland are very unlikely to back down, so it will be Tories vs the DUP. Interesting times ahead. #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
In Westminster taking part in the debate on a #FinalSay on #Brexit - the public should have the right to express a view once the facts are clear 
As MPs debate a petition asking for a #FinalSay on #Brexit, we renew our call for a ratification referendum on the final #BrexitDeal, with the option to stay in the EU. RT if you agree 
PM claimed to House earlier "significant savings" will be made by #Brexit but then couldn't tell me a) a £ amount for them or b) explain how she knows what they will be before she's even reached a deal? Absurd. Guess she won't be putting on a bus...? @Open_Britain
This is best hour or so in Commons @Number10gov has enjoyed since her ill-fated election. She has much stronger support than normal from her own side (!) and opposition pretty feeble. #brexit
Just suggested to @theresa_may in the chamber that she might as well have Labour leadership with her at the #Brexit negotiations, since they seem to agree with her on leaving Single Market and Customs Union, no matter how disastrous that may be.
Ken Clarke - I've never previously known in the days following the British Government entering into a treaty like agreement with 27 friendly governments to be followed by ministers casting doubt on whether we've agreed to anything.  #Brexit #StopBrexit #FBPE
Pleased to hear @theresa_may say courts in UK will pay “due regard” to “relevant” #ECJ case law re #EU citizens rights. This was the wording of my amendment 137 to clause 6 of #EUWithdrawalBill which Tories votes down in face of cross party support #Brexit

I hope next phase of #Brexit talks are not punctuated by "posturing, delays and disarray" - @JeremyCorbyn tells MPs 
Theresa May repeatedly surprises. This time last week she was on the ropes, and there was talk of whether she would be gone by Christmas. Today, in the House of Commons, Mrs May is hailed as the Brexit Boudica by her adoring party. Extraordinary. #Brexit
The days of paying "vast sums" to the EU are coming to an end - PM @Theresa_May briefs MPs on #Brexit deal 
Theresa May begs EU migrants to stay in Britain.Here's an idea dopey, why don't you just cancel the cancerous sore that is #Brexit and let us all get back to living our lives in harmony and peace.
.@Number10gov: implies she agrees with @DavidDavisMP and not @PhilipHammondUK, that we only pay divorce bill of up to £39bn if we get acceptable trade deal and transition #Brexit
In the House of Commons for #Brexit statement. Does the PM think that the job description for Brexit Secretary should include being clever or not? Is the Phase 1 agreement binding (Friday's position), non-binding (yesterday), or 'stronger' than legally binding (today)?
"Our #Brexit secretary has turned Brexit clown. Having juggled with 58 sectoral analyses for months, David Davis made them vanish in a puff of smoke." @MollyMEP

As I was saying earlier much of UK industry doesn't actually want to ditch EU industry regulations. The great "#brexit win" through a "bonfire of regulations" exists mostly in the minds of ex journalist MPs who've never actually worked in industry  
The key elements of a ‘meaningful’ vote on #Brexit which MPs across all parties are demanding:1. Must come before exit day;2. We shld be given comprehensive details of the agreement, not simple heads of terms;3. An Act of Parl approving terms before the PM signs any agreement. 
The #Brexit Withdrawal Bill gives the Government sweeping powers named after Henry VIII – who’s hardly remembered for his rational decision-making. It would hand Parliament to ministers on a silver platter and let them carve up and devour our rights. 
This is fmr Conservative Attorney-General Dominic Grieve’s all important Amendment 7 to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill providing for a ‘meaningful vote’ on #Brexit, which will be debated on Wednesday in the @HouseofCommons.
2/2 Whether on the Irish border or the divorce bill, the @Conservatives #Brexit cabinet are openly at war. I mean this to be helpful to David Davis: can someone please take away his shovel, because it is time he stopped digging.
1/2 Another interview, another car crash from David Davis this morning. He tries to disown The Times report, but given his performance before both the #Brexit committee and his interview on @MarrShow , his acquaintance with the facts is clearly not as deep as it might be.
Why is Henry VIII in Westminster eating a Parliament cake? Well, it’s all do with #Brexit of course… 
Outside parliament with Brits from all walks of life demanding voters get a #FinalSay on if we still want #Brexit or not. 
Well that’s been obvious for a year now.But it’s still pretty galling to hear it from the horse’s mouth!#Brexit 
It makes tragic reading now, but we can’t let these people off the hook. They misled the country, their failure to come clean on the cost of #Brexit should not be forgotten. 
Prime Minister @theresa_may will update MPs on the first stage of #Brexit talks at approximately 3.30pm 
“The fact the EU almost begged Theresa May to make an agreement, I think, shows what a strong position the UK is in, and that we should stick to our guns” @bernardjenkin #bbcdp #brexit

#Leavers - #Brexit is THE con of the century engineered by the #BrexitElite. THEY LIED. There are no unicorns, sunlit uplands or £ for the NHS. Time to stop the madness. Stand with us at the #LondonProtest or #BrusselsProtest 
This by @bbcnickrobinson helps explain why the BBC is so woefully failing to maintain balance between Remainers & Leavers. It's because the referendum is over & the BBC therefore believes it has no duty to maintain balance.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE /1

The Brexit vote was the biggest vote in UK history and all UK politicians can do is spit on voters, tarnish our democracy & betray the country. Instead of working to make Brexit the best it can be & reform the country politicians work against their own people!#Labour #Brexit 
There is clear public support for proper parliamentary scrutiny of #Brexit. Makes it even more important that MPs vote for Amendment 7 to the Withdrawal Bill on Wednesday 
#Brexit doubletalk:Davis Sunday: Irish border assurance not legally enforceableDavis Monday: It is legally enforceable
Rather odd watching #Brexit'ers banging on about how great the UK is. All economic data points to a downturn & our world ranking is slipping, yet they keep pumping out the same old rubbish from sites & sources such as brexit central, westmonster, the express etc.
This from @nemanlostatsea is political dynamite. It seems Tory Govt did a "discrete audit" of competencies "best returned from EU to UK" only to conclude that current balance btwn EU & UK actually works for UK. Its why UK found #brexit negotiations so difficult-theres no benefit 
We know that he was lying, but it's still staggering to watch David Davis lying so blatantly and shamelessly to the Commons. #Brexit is built on lies. #JailTheLeaveLiars #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE

All these new trade deals are hardly ever mentioned in the UK media.However, the EU is the indispensable partner for world trade:#Brexit #BrexitShambles #BrexitNews #BrexitReality
So, after not being able to decide whether the #Brexit impact papers existed or not, @DavidDavisMP can't decide whether the #IrishBorder agreement is binding or not... What an utter disgrace of a politician!
I want a divorce but I still want us to act like we're married and share everything, but we won't live together and I won't have to pay for anything and you can't ask me to do anything anymore, how about that. also I'm going to see other people.     #Brexit

Today's @thetimes cartoon  #Labour #Brexit 
May's capitulation to the ECJ will fracture the nation and create two classes of citizen. The PM is turning a sovereign state into an EU vassal state, writes @JonHolb  #Brexit 
In his #LBC interview David Davis spent nearly as much time laughing as he did talking. I'm beginning to wonder if he's the full shilling. @LBC #Brexit
Very much a strategic mistake. Many believe that post #Brexit we'll be granted some favoured 'friends with benefits' status. This is a false hope. Once in the 'friend zone' there'll be no 'benefits'. TBH we'll be lucky to secure 'friend' status after the #BrexitShambles debacle.
The Rest of the World doesn't care about our motives or internal delusion on #Brexit, only their own interestsIf we get a good deal, they'll complain to the EUWhen we try to sign new deals, they'll push for max advantageNo-one owes the UK a livingBrexit reality
Brits living in other EU countries and EU citizens here not happy with the #Brexit deal which undermines their rights:
Irish PM Leo Varadkar urged to help stop 'offensive and unacceptable' #Brexit.  More than 200 Northern Irish figures tell Leo Varadkar they "should not be forced out of the EU against our democratic will". 
Perfect tweet highlighting jingoistic #brexit blindness-We're the UK-We can get what we want from the EU-We can get what we want from WTO-We can sign FTAs tomorrow-RoW has no agency or agenda & is just waiting for our requests-No-one else would dare play hardball with UK

Don’t want to spoil the party, but could someone remind me why it’s a good idea for #UK to model our future economic relationship with #EU on Canada, which accounts for under 2% of EU trade in goods & is the other side of the Atlantic? #Brexit

Well Done, Mrs May. The terms of Friday’s heralded EU Brexit agreement and its non-binding nature have resulted in a brilliant Christmas fudge which has simultaneously allowed all sides to claim victory. Some feat. #TheresaMay #brexit #csm
The EU, including Ireland, are starting to realise the ‘concessions’ May’s #Brexit government has made are turning out to be very slippery! 
Evil. It makes better sense now that we know what happened. It almost happened in France. It almost happened in the Netherlands. Too bad we were not aware enough and responsive enough to catch and fix it here and the UK #MAGA #Brexit #TrumpRussiaCollusion
Our current trade deal is solid gold, not just gold-plated. We have the best deal of any EU member. We're incredibly foolish to throw it away. #Brexit #StopBrexit
This deep & meaningful relationship our PM seeks from an EU doesn't or has it ever existed pure & simple gobbledygook, enabling her to stall & hold back #Brexit until a General Election to overturn. Backdoor FULL ALIGNMENT is rebranding Brexit as a satellite state not cooperating
FYI: Tomorrow begins a Tory civil war. A fight to the death. Where the nonsense of Legatum and the #Brexit taliban comes crashing into the wall of reality.
Hello pro-European #Labour voters (ie the majority of you): wake up & smell the #Brexit coffee. Supporting Lab = enabling #Tory #HardBrexit

Someone tell Tories/DUP that European Council only deciding on moving to #Brexit Phase 2 next Thursday. Maybe not a good idea to keep telling media you basically don’t intend to honour what you agreed to in Phase 1.
Congratulations, Chris, great first thread! Responses of Canadians to our #Brexit @BIG_UVic conf panel in Ottawa = bemusement that anyone would swap a Single Market gateau for a CETA cracker.
Peter Bone MP - "If it’s clear that there is not going to be a deal, which is actually what I think will happen, we’ll have a clean #Brexit and we’ll spend that £39 billion on the health service and adult social care – as actually we promised." 
The most common -and telling- response to this thread from Brexiters is "well, it's too late now; people voted".There's real fear in that response. There's courage to be drawn from it, for those of us still fighting. There's panic that the tide is turning against #Brexit now. 
#Brexit: 3 shocking things we learned this week - The U.K. doesn't yet know what Brexit means, what economic impact it will have or how to execute it. 
.@MichaelGove said this weekend people can change #Brexit at the next general election, which is in 2022. Thank you Mr Gove, but that will be too late. The only way to change, or as we want, to stop Brexit, is to have a vote before we leave the EU in 2019.

Jason Langrish was brilliant on the BBC Radio 4 news just now. He spelt out the devastating economic reality of #Brexit. Hopefully it will be released as a podcast.
It looks like #Brexit is betrayed & that we’re staying in single market & customs union, by another name, paying the heating money of our pensioners & the school meals of our children forMandy’s pension & are still not in control of our borders or courts.Whats it all about Alfie?
The Tory insistence on an FTA rather than EEA is born of a desire to deregulate. It is pure ideology at work with no relevance to the world as we find it and it is completely intellectually bankrupt.  #Brexit
The Leave option in the referendum was a catch-all phrase which could be all things to all Brexiters, subsuming a hideous mish-mash of incompatible projects, proposals, lies & delusions. It is not an acceptable basis for a huge, complex & disruptive project.#StopBrexit #Brexit

2) it will be clear to most of us that the Unicorn #Brexit promised by Leave (no cost Free Trade deal on our terms, no negative impacts) was always impossible & simply a ruse to get votes.Leavers have to accept that they fell for it to a greater or lesser degree
1) #Brexit & Futility, threadIf there's one thing that we know, it's that no majority voted for the kind of Brexit we're heading for.Some of us can breath a sigh of relief, but it's tinged with frustration - there's no point to this #Brexit, but it's the only one possible
The Tories won't allow a 'disruptive' public sector strike on anything less than a 40% vote, but they claim that Brexit with only 37% is the 'will of the people'.#Brexit - chaos, built on hypocrisy, serving greed. #StopBrexit #FBPE
If @DavidDavisMP thinks the deal struck in Part 1 is "not binding"how does he expect anyone to deal with the UK post-#brexit ?Comments like this makes the UK a pariah state - #dishonest #untrustworthy#StopBrexit + #ToriesOut
If you voted #Leave & you still think #Brexit is a good idea, please think about whose interests the leaders of the two Leave campaigns serve - it's not the interests of the ordinary people who voted Leave. 
Everything you always wanted to know about the #Brexit deal and #Ireland but were afraid to ask:
The best way for the UK to avoid having its European market share cannibalised in trade negotiations is not to have trade negotiations and keep the EEA agreement. We won't get a better deal. Fact.  #Brexit
Confused about para 49 of joint #Brexit report?@hayward_katy says our 3 layered Irish coffee is "entirely unambiguous"
Tory Brexiteer Peter Bone says he expects there will be no proper trade deal and the UK should be ready to say "we're going to come out... we're not going to give you that £39bn and we're going to spend it on the NHS and social care" #Brexit #Paterson
David Davis is a mess on #Marr and shows why the U.K. is having such a problem negotiating a deal. Only fools and horses was meant to be a comedy not a blueprint for #brexit
So tired from fighting #Brexit... I just want my country back!Pls just #stopbrexit now so I can have a good long nap!
Theresa May's #Brexit problems are just beginning. That loud rattling is all the cans that've been kicked down road 
When the British people voted for #Brexit they voted to take back control. They knew exactly what they wanted. The official @vote_leave campaign stuck to the same positive vision throughout. We want control of our laws, our money, our borders & our trade #Marr #GlobalBritain 
In #Brexit Britain "using the word impact doesn't make an impact assessment." Yes Minister stuff from David Davis on #marr. But sadly not very funny.
If you’re not convinced by @DavidDavisMP’s nice distinction between studies assessing impact of #Brexit and Brexit impact assessments then keep watching the judicial review from myself and @JolyonMaugham launched this week. Should provide legal clarity #Marr
Reminder on #marr that leading Leave & Remain politicians during #EUref made clear #brexit would mean leaving Single Market.
The Brexit press and politicians have played the classic trick of accusing Remainers of their own misdeeds. The real 'Project Fear' has been the cynical orchestrated whipping up of fear and hate against the EU, immigrants, refugees & Muslims.#StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit 
"I think that's the right thing" - shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer says UK must stay close to EU's single market after #Brexit  #marr

#Marr follows Neil's spurious interpretation of selective clips warning #Brexit meant leaving SM. Remain focussed on worst case scenario to accentuate danger. Leave's response was "Project Fear; EU'll beg us for a deal; we'll be like Norway only better". That position prevailed.
#marr There are plenty of other #Leave campaigners in #brexit referendum who DID say we should stay in #SingleMarket
To be clear, the Eggheads are available for the next stage of #Brexit negotiations although @EggheadBarry says the last two weeks in February are difficult because of a family commitment #SendInTheEggheads
This is the best example of English arrogance I’ve seen in a long time. I’m a Protestant in NI and this whole #Brexit and @duponline  would make me vote for united  English only care about English - they don’t want NI burden. Why can’t @duponline see that?

100% agree.  When it comes to Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland border in terms of #Brexit, above all peace in Northern Ireland has to come first.
1. Global powers 2 stop spec Brexit deal 4 UKOnce the UK's out of the SM & CU in Mar 2019...no replication of the terms of the current trading relationship or anything close to it & no spec treatmentTory & Labour #Brexit plans crash & burn 
If the inevitable consequence of #Brexit, is "full regulatory alignment" then EEA-Efta is the safest and most intelligent mode of doing it. It's like loading up in safe mode. At least you can get into the machine - and then see what is what. Make your choices from there.
“Let us stand up for the sovereignty of Parliament and the people we were sent here to represent” | statement by @eurelationsappg officers from across the @HouseofCommons in the Observer on the importance of a ‘meaningful vote’ on #Brexit in Parliament  
Pleased to co-sign amendment for meaningful vote in parliament - real chance we can win this next week.  But also need referendum on final #Brexit deal - British public should have the final say 
So when I said @theresa_may climb down Stage1 #Brexit deal would unravel by Sunday, I was right.  #CleverGreekboy#Skypapers #Bbcpapers @LBC @bbc5live #Marr #Bbcsp  #Paterson @JPonpolitics #r4today #Bbcdp
The way May and her cabal simply cancelled #Brexit is amazing. And the way mainstream media colluded to present this betrayal as some 'triumph' is absolutely remarkable. Not one hack had the decency to point out that the result of the EU referendum has been reversed.
In tomorrow's Observer, cross-party MPs @ChukaUmunna @Anna_Soubry @joswinson @CarolineLucas @StephenGethins & @JonathanPlaid call on Parliament to back Amendment 7 to the EU Withdrawal Bill and give MPs a meaningful vote on #Brexit

The EU and Japan deal covers 60% of world GDP and 600m people. This should be a huge deal for the UK. But we can't celebrate it, nor highlight the benefits to UK consumers, because we are losing it as part of f*cking @Conservatives plans to tear us out of the SM/CU. #Brexit

Is it possible that European Council leaders will listen to the confused messaging as to what has been agreed on Brexit, and argue next week that sufficient progress has NOT been made to proceed on to Phase 2 of the talks? #brexit #gove

What is Michael Gove on about?Says voters can change the EU deal if they don’t like it… at a 2021 general election. When it’s too late.If he’s OK with the principle of the voters expressing their view on #Brexit, why not a second referendum in 2019?

There is a reason why there are ‘border counties’ on the island of Ireland. A refusal to accept the reality of a border is a refusal to deal with the consequences of it. #brexit
It's people with views similar to this that's forcing #Scotland into a future it keeps voting against. It really is time to go & leave them to eat their #Brexit in peace. #Referendum2018 #ScotRef
Oh MY FUCKING GOD!!... LISTEN to this ECCONOMIST ex BankofEngland Describe to an American conference BREXIT and it's economic reality... I dare ANYONE to watch and not be utterly terrified and utterly CERTAIN that #Brexit is  #SUICIDalMadness
The referendum was advisory, the Minister for Europe David Lidington used its advisory status as a reason to reject an SNP amendment to the referendum bill (2nd graphic). MPs knew this, but they and the government have pretended otherwise.#StopBrexit #Brexit #LeaveLies #FBPE
It’s not that the UK government couldn’t deliver an effective and complete #Brexit, its that the UK government doesn’t want to. This ‘negotiation’ is a sham, a political farce.

Although uneasy about aspects of the Irish border deal, the DUP believes it has secured a strategic victory in the first round #Brexit talks. But if parts of the text ever enter legislation, their ambiguity & sweeping nature are risks for the DUP.

Look at the body language in this pic from yesterday mornings #Brexit breakfast where the deal was struck. Look at the relaxed body language on the British side and the agitation on the EU side. The EU have conceded a lot, make no mistake.

DUP position becomes more ludicrous. Selling “unfettered access” to “Northern Ireland’s biggest market” as success, when #Brexit by definition means the UK as a whole *loses* “unfettered access” to its biggest market. Totally, totally bonkers.
Hello to everyone out there who is #FBPE . We are stronger together and can bring about a Vote on the Deal and an Exit from #Brexit .
The Government would be wise to remember why 17.4 million people backed #Brexit last year. 
#Brexit #Ireland 1) No hardening of the border 2) Regulatory alignment on the whole island 3) Respect #GoodFridayAgreement in all its parts. However, EP will only give green light if these commitments are fully enforceable.
FYI, #BrexitDeal has now left Britains position effectively unchanged, except they no longer have ANY say in how europe is governed, and every Britain has to pay a 500 GPB towards the divorce bill.  #brexit who could have seen it coming?!

The media are hyping up May’s big #Brexit “achievement”. Let’s be clear, she’s wasted 18 months squabbling with the EU and her Cabinet to agree with pretty much what the EU put on the table at the start. In doing so, she’s left too little time for the trade and transition deal. 
"Nigel speaks the truth""I think Andrea Leadsom should have been Prime Minister & not Theresa May.I don’t think she’s any good.She was a Remainer & it should have been a Brexiteer that should have been the Prime Minister”#Brexit #EU

Businesses will welcome the #BrexitDeal announcement, but the priority now needs to be on agreeing a transition period to provide certainty in the short term and remove the possibility of a ‘cliff-edge’. Read our #Brexit guidance: 
#Brexit key agreements: • UK will pay between £35bn and £39bn to leave EU• EU citizens in UK & UK citizens living within the EU will have their rights to live, work and study protected • 'No hard border' between Northern Ireland & the Republic
Definitely had something in my eye when Leo spoke about birthright of Irish citizens in 6C and assurance of never again being left behind by an Irish government.Any chance of bar of "On the One Road" or am I just being greedy? #Brexit
#Brexit #citizensrights 1)All rights & benefits covered 2) No more"settled status"3)Direct effect in UK law 4)ECJ binding. But withdrawal agreement for EP only if 1)Also for future partners covered 2)One cost-free declaration per family 3)Free movement of UKresidents in whole EU

Doesn't like us now, but I remember when Mick McCarthy gave @DUPleader  her first cap for Ireland. Played out of her skin, she did.#Brexit #BrexitDeal
I suspect the Brextremists will soon regroup and set about trying to block a trade deal with the EU, as that would remove EU leverage over Britain. it would be disastrous for the British people, but I can't see that deterring them. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
So we've taken back control and can set whatever policy we want regarding money, laws, and borders, as long as what we want fully aligns with EU law, which we now have no say in. Great job Boris!#Brexit #BrexitDeal #StopBrexit #FBPE

More expensive fish & chips with #Brexit 
Brexit has confirmed for me (and many more) that the EU is far more organised, logical, fair and effective than Westminster ever was or is ever likely to be. The UK is now totally dysfunctional. Scotland is far better directly within the EU. #Brexit #indyfer2 #IamYES
#OldLabour’s comments regarding the #Brexit deal are hypocritical and ludicrous. REMEMBER: They wanted to secure the rights of #EU nats in the #UK without securing equal rights for UK citizens in the EU. #Betrayal = #Labour

The @Conservatives are trying to sell today's #Brexit agreement as some sort of triumph. 1. UK should have been in this position months ago.2. Theresa May has conceded to #EU on very issues she said she would not.3. Most difficult decisions have been left for second phase.
Of all the commentary around #Brexit today this little nugget is worth genuine consideration - will Dublin Govt now stand up for the rights of citizens in north? 
"The most difficult challenge is still ahead," Donald Tusk said after the #Brexit talks were given the green light to move to the next stage

#Brexit deal reduces risk of crashing out. Good. Amazing of @theresa_may to tie UK leaving #SingleMarket to Irish border. Will last decades
Labour has capitulated its responsibility as official opposition.  It’s clear now, that when it comes to #Brexit, only @theSNP are the REAL opposition.  Not even a mention from Labour of economic cost!

Amazing that the #brexit solution after all this seems basically to be the UK staying in the EU but being allowed to tell people it has left, and they in turn agreeing to nod sympathetically.
'We are picking up the tab and we look like mugs,' Nigel Farage on the #Brexit deal. 
#Brexit - Let' be clear what happened today, the EU has given the UK the green light to start trade talks. That is all, Brexit has not been settled. The most contentious issues in the divorce HAVE NOT been settled, their remain as time bombs waiting go off. (1/3)
'The whole thing is humiliating, we've collapsed on every level,' says Nigel Farage on #Brexit deal. 
We need a deal with the EU that defends jobs, rights & public services. Trade deals like CETA aren't the answer. It’s time politicians put the interests of working people first. #Brexit
Thank you Ireland for saving us from a hard #Brexit &, possibly, #Brexit altogether!

We will only accept a transitional period after #Brexit if we are satisfied with the outcome of the 2nd phase of negotiations. United, the European Union is strong. This is the main lesson of today's result. 2/2
The very word #Brexit has been highjacked, we voted for independence from the European Union not a Brexit of EU sorts.
"New EU27/UK consensus can form good basis for three major #Brexit issues (citizens' rights, Northern Ireland, settling of accounts) to be solved. EP will give its opinion next week with a new resolution that I'll present to the Council. I'm optimistic," @EP_President ↓
The ‘Br’ in #Brexit signifies ‘Britain’ i.e excluding NI. If we were to be included then technically it should’ve been ‘UKexit’. So I guess Theresa May has been telling the truth all along when she’s been saying ‘Brexit means Brexit’

No you didn't. I voted in the 2014 Scottish referendum & #Brexit wasn't more than murmurings from conservative backbenchers at Westminster
I'm just waiting for Brexiters to entirely absorb the sentence “in the absence of agreed solutions, the United Kingdom will maintain full alignment with the rules of the Internal Market and the Customs Union".You really stuck it to those meddling Eurocrats, didn't you.#Brexit
Bernard Jenkin on #BBCRadio4Today: “The Irish Government is being played like a harp by the European Commission.” The insulting, ignorant and embarrassing (for the rest of us) arrogance of the Tory Brexiters. #StopBrexit #FBPE #Brexit
Johnson and Gove both praising the PM and seemingly accepting the £50bn bill, 8 years of "due regard" to the ECJ and possible compliance with customs union regs if no other solution found on the NI border. Quite a shift. #Brexit 
Gina Miller, Alistair Campbell, Tony Blair, Richard Branson, Paloma Faith etc this morning ..... #Brexit 
Guess who are the biggest all-time recipients of European Horizon2020 funds? And guess which universities are now losing ground. Excellent analysis from @higherbaker #brexit 
[Deep breath] No fan of #Brexit, TMay or this gov, but given configuration of forces in HoC and the country, she's done as well as she possibly could have done here.
So, that bit was meant to be easy. Now we move on to what @DavidDavisMP says will be “a cinch” – just 9 months to come up with actual solutions, not fudges, and conclude a #Brexit deal that protects jobs, rights, the environment, and the GFA. What could possibly go wrong? 
#Ireland has so far managed the unwanted #Brexit process with commitment, nerve & skill. Getting Ireland on the agenda a major achievement, forcing the UK to take the border seriously a major achievement- chapeau to all- just keep it up 
I understand why a load of Brits are angry today - esp. Brits living in rest of the EU.But this is ultimately what Brexit means: it means rights people have enjoyed are shredded. It’s shit. That’s why #Brexit is shit.Protecting yourself as well as you can is the only option.
For anyone who has followed closely the EU negotiations with Greece over the last few years, the choreography today in Brussels is eerily familiar. It's like watching a Hitchcock film. Everyone but the victim-to-be knows what's about to happen when she gets in the shower. #Brexit
Progress on #Brexit talks ... but how? #Brexit #StopBrexit #DavidDavis #Brexitshambles #EU #BrexitDeal #FBPE
James, it might be the #Brexit you voted for but it certainly wasn't the one I voted for. And many others like me. #LeaveMeansLeave
Britain’s crack negotiating team were through the first hurdle ...#Brexit 
The whole UK (Eng, Scot, Wales & NI) are leaving the EU (single market & customs union), we are controlling our laws, borders and money. Ongoing EU payments and legal control will ends ,and trade talks are about to begin. This is the #Brexit we voted for.
So where did the EU cave in to UK demands in #Brexit negotiations? “We didn’t insist on them paying the mover bill for EU agencies leaving London”, says chief negotiator #Barnier.
*This issue is the biggest headache for people who need to be mobile for work.*Thx for saying that, Jon. I think it's the first time I've seen that acknowledged by any commentator of note. #Brexit already means, being #British, I'm less likely to be chosen for work assignments.
What makes me so livid is the total waste of resources in connection with #Brexit. Instead of addressing our real problems, all the money and effort is channelled into cushioning this self-inflicted blow. #StopBrexit
Attention Mark Carney: Time to start hiking interest rates...very quickly. #Brexit 
Brexiteers allergic to the ECJ & wanting to take the sovereignty backHow about this "regulatory alignment" ?"UK will be subject to all EU law & supervision, without vote or exemption!"#BREXIT #FBPE
A £50 billion Christmas price tag for less than what we have already.  That takes a really clever kind of stupid Tory Govt to negotiate that one. #brexit 
In very straight terms the UK is straight swapping a porsche 911 for a beige 1998 Ford Mondeo that smells faintly of sick. That's your deal. #Brexit
Having scanned through a number of twitter threads this morning I will be offering my now #expert opinion on the #Brexit deal on Funk FM at 10:15.
Yes that is actually a “world’s best Taoiseach” mug in front of the Irish PM. What a legend #varadkar #brexit 
Now is not the time for gloating. Long roads etc.. and the peace process is just that: a process. The Agreed Island John Hume speaks of requires constant vigilance and understanding #BREXIT
On the 8th day of Christmas my true love sent to me 8 kilos of fudge fresh from the Brussels departure lounge #Brexit
As talks move on to phase 2, remember that the deal we have now IS the best possible deal.MPs must be granted a binding #voteonthedeal ahead of March 2019.The fight to stop #brexit continues.
When Farage is apoplectic you know things can’t all be bad. #Brexit
#Brexit has now reached that part of the process where the UK are still living in the box room and have to listen to the sound of the EU and Northern Ireland riding next door.
I think the UK has been bullied into this bad #Brexit deal by Brussels  
British PM Theresa May spoke of her six #Brexit commitments to Northern Ireland 
Labour MP Dance says support for #Brexit is melting like salt in the rain. Pressure for another referendum will become irresistible in course of 2018.#StopTheMadness #StopBrexit
Quick thoughts on #EU deal; as I predicted red line on #ECJ has gone with continuing jurisdiction in transition period & beyond. Towel thrown in on the money. Detail re border with Ireland still to be worked out but big climbdown by @theresa_may & DUP #brexit
Varadkar oh irish radio saying changes since Monday are ‘stylistic’ and only major new development was paragraph 50. Dublin will be delighted w/no prospect of problems at Holyhead #brexit
"We want to build bridges, not borders" - Irish PM Leo Varadkar says the deal has "achieved all we set out to achieve" #Brexit 
The pound has rallied to a six-month high against the euro after the UK and EU reached a breakthrough deal over #Brexit 
Shout out to the #Brexit negotiator who said this morning ahead of the deal being done : “I couldn’t sleep last night but #Brexitcast kept me company.” Thanks!
We have achieved all we set out to achieve in Phase 1. This is not the end but it is the end of the beginning. The Good Friday Agreement is fully protected & the Common Travel Area will continue. The UK is committed to avoiding a hard border. #Brexit 
Gove on @BBCr4today:  'As a result of leaving the EU, there will be more money for the NHS'. I refer you to forecasts by OECD and @OBR_UK on the dire economic and fiscal damage of #Brexit
This is not a #Brexit deal. This is simply a list of principles @theresa_may has conceded so the EU agreed to TALK about a deal.
Taoiseach offers assurances to Irish citizens in Northern Ireland. “You will never again be left behind by an Irish government.” #Brexit 
Reports of "Breakthrough" over #Brexit common in media today. However analysis of the "deal" suggests nothing has been resolved and major decisions are simply delayed. Further humiliation for May anticipated.
Leo Varadkar delivers a message to the nationalist community, saying: "You will never again be left behind by an Irish government." #Brexit
EU on Monday: NI will receive special status post #BrexitDUP: Unacceptable! We must not be treated any differently than the rest of the UK or we’ll collapse the govtEU this morning: Ok, so you’re cool with the same deal as long as we don’t call it ‘special status’?DUP: 
Disappointed that our purely opportunist opposition to #Brexit has failed to collapse the government, cause chaos and economic catastrophe. But tomorrow’s another day. #HerMajestysLoyalOpposition
So it’s safe to say now, that an independent Scotland will never face a hard border, since it’s it has been avoided between N.Ireland and Ireland. #ScotRef #Brexit @theSNP
Behind Michael Gove's vacuous drivel lies one immutable fact: as the EU has repeatedly stated the UK will have a worse deal outside the EU than it had as a member. #r4today #Brexit
Good news for Scotland and the UK that we can move on to next stage of #Brexit negotiations. As ever @theresa_may puts the national interest first securing a deal that protects the integrity of  UK but acknowledges existing North-South  Irish arrangements
And this is critical. Full credit to @Number10gov for securing this.#Brexit 
Great news on #Brexit from @theresa_may.  It may not be what everyone wants but since it IS happening, we need to all unite together and more be forward as one United Kingdom.#BetterTogether
Is anyone else completely sick of this blanket coverage by media of #Brexit. Meanwhile school teachers asking parents to bring in toilet rolls, GP surgeries closing, A&E overflowing, ambulances struggling to get to patients, rip off privatised rail fares etc etc
Final preparations with Minister @HMcEntee and Tánaiste @simoncoveney ahead of speaking to the press re agreement on #Brexit Phase 1 negotiations. 
May has not left #brexit negotiations in Brussels empty handed.She has:a guarantee of rights for UK citizens in EUan invoice for €50bn, anda box of warm fudge#stopbrexit
I’ve sent #Brexit guidelines for 2nd phase to EU27 leaders. While being satisfied with today's agreement, let's remember that the most difficult challenge still ahead.  Breaking up is hard. But breaking up and building a new relationship is much harder.
This tweet alone says the Remainers are chuffed they have stopped effectively stopped a true #Brexit and laid ground for staying in under different language or ways 
Huge progress towards a successful #Brexit! 
This deal is an important step forward! An intelligent #Brexit deal is in interest of our citizens and companies. #UK is and forever will be our neighbor. But our job is not done yet!
Now available.#brexit. 
Beautiful scene at government buildings for #Brexit presser which is due to start shortly @rtenews
Britain and the European Commission reach deal to move #Brexit talks forward 
"The most difficult challenge is still ahead," says European Council President @eucopresident. "Breaking up is hard, but breaking up and building up a new relation is much harder." #Brexit 
Three takeaways from phase 1 #Brexit "agreement": 1. Kicking the truth down the road. Reconciling Brexiteers and Irish demands still impossible. 2. Face-saving successful, all sides have bought some time. 3. Think this was hard? It will get much harder. #May #Juncker
There will be many many paras negotiated and written about #Brexit, Anglo- Irish relations and Northern Ireland in the months and years to come. All of them will be framed by these five paras agreed this morning. Via @IrishTimes
"We all know breaking up is hard, but breaking up and building a new relationship is harder" - Donald Tusk, European Council President on #Brexit progress

Delighted #Brexit talks are progressing onto 2nd phase. Now we can get on to agreeing our future relationship with the EU
This mornings phase 1 agreement gets a warm welcome from me. PM is representing UK Biz needs & healing dreadful #Brexit divide
I welcome sufficient progress on Phase 1 of #Brexit negotiations, including the key Irish issues. Huge thanks to all involved in the process @campaignforleo @simoncoveney @dfatirl Important that we move to phase 2 & establish future relationships #progress
First #Brexit hurdles taken ...more to come 
I warmly welcome the announcement this morning by UK PM @theresa_may and @EU_Commission President @JunckerEU on #Brexit, as it guarantees that there will be no hard border on island of #Ireland and no disruption to trade post-Brexit
As a friend and admirer of Britain. If this is what you have agreed on, is #Brexit worth it?
DUP leader Arlene Foster says there have been "substantial changes" made to the Irish border paper since Monday #Brexit 
No hard border and the Good Friday Agreement will be upheld - UK PM Theresa May says #Brexit 
A cobbled together fudged deal. Typical May. 10 MP's from Northern Ireland are calling all the shots. A #Brexit breakthrough has been reached

Striking distinction between what Irish Government & DUP are saying in response to the #Brexit  deal. Dublin, categorically: "We have achieved all of our goals".Arlene Foster: "There are still matters we would have liked to see clarified; we ran out of time essentially".
Will read text but listening to Simon Coveney on @RTERadio1 there's far too many ifs and buts in this agreement for me.How can we trust a government who have failed to uphold previous agreements backed by a party who have deliberately undermined those agreements#Brexit
Great news, EU & UK have agreed to move on to second stage of #Brexit negotiations. Pragmatism & flexibility lead to win-win outcomes. #negotiation101
#Brexit She's to Brexit as you're to the NHS I'm afraid
So the past four days were all about this sentence: "In all circumstances, the United Kingdom will continue to ensure the same unfettered access for Northern Ireland's businesses to the whole of the United Kingdom internal market."#DUP #Brexit
BREAKING Nigel Farage aka "Mr Brexit" is not happy. The former @Ukip leader tells me: “The European Court of Justice will be the ultimate arbiter of EU citizens’ rights. This is not acceptable.” #Brexit
I very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead to the next phase of the #Brexit talks on trade and security, and to discuss the positive and ambitious future relationship that is in all of our interests: 
Tánaiste @simoncoveney tells @morningireland ‘we have a good outcome’ #brexit 
Will be interested to see the devil in the detail of this first phase deal by Jean-Claude Juncker Theresa May and David Davis #Brexit - where's the border?
A score draw here on Citizens Rights. EU gets automatic roll over of permanent residence, UK get's its criminal records checks. #Brexit 
#Brexit breakthrough: Theresa May said that the agreement would guarantee the rights of three million EU citizens in the UK "enshrined in UK law and enforced by British courts" 
On the eigth day of christmas my true love sent to me...Eight Maids a Milking...It looks more organised than #Brexit though. 
"It doesn't mean that the UK will stay in the Single Market" says Prime Minister on #Brexit negotiations 
Finally! At last, there is real progress on #Brexit. The @EPPGroup will look closely at the agreement and continue to defend the rights of EU citizens and the interests of #Ireland.
BREAK: Spokesman for Irish PM: "We achieved all our goals in phase 1 of the negotiations, including preserving the CTA, protecting the GFA and, crucially, obtaining a guarantee that there will be no hard border." #Taoiseach #Brexit
May says have guaranteed no hard border in Ireland and integrity of UK too #Brexit
I will be joined by the Tánaiste @simoncoveney and Minister for European Affairs @HMcEntee at a press conference in Govt Bldgs later this morning to discuss the progress made. #Brexit 
.@JunckerEU "All EU27 stand firmly behind #Ireland. EU has made it a priority to protect #GoodFriday agreement and peace process on the island. UK has made commitments to that end." #Brexit 
Welcome news that sufficient progress has been made with EU as reduces risk of catastrophic No Deal #Brexit .  But remains the case that UK cannot secure a better deal than staying in the EU.
"Sufficient progress" has been made in #Brexit talks to move on to the second phase of negotiations, says European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker 
Good news that the trade talks can now begin #Brexit
.@JunckerEU "Citizens first. EU citizens' rights will be protected, especially the right to live, work and study and family reunification." #Brexit 
Painful reading on British delusion and #Brexit negotiations  via @FT
Breakthrough in #Brexit phase 1 talks is super. Great to see badly needed progress well done to @HMcEntee @simoncoveney & all the @dfatirl team
.@JunckerEU @theresa_may "Sufficient progress has been made on the divorce terms." #Brexit 
And here is the link to the joint report #Brexit 
European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker: "I believe we now have the breakthrough we needed." #Brexit

.@DUPleader Arlene Foster says there have been "substantial changes" made to the text after she and Prime Minister Theresa May spoke several times overnight #Brexit 
A deal stitched up overnight between May and the DUP. The DUP represents 35% of Northern Ireland. What about the rest of the community? What about the British Parliament? #Brexit, for the few, not the many.
DUP says all of the UK is coming out of the Customs Union and Single Market. Absolutely not good news this morning. #Brexit, the ruin of Britain.

Theresa May WINS as EU backs down and agrees time-limit on Euro judges.Sources have revealed that Brussels is willing to accept a 10 year sunset clause to end the role of European Court of Justice rulings after #Brexit. #ECJ
Amused to see a paper claiming the EU ‘set in stone’ a Sunday deadline for #Brexit Ireland fix .. Truth: EU deadlines are a moveable feast
#BBCQT has debated #Brexit beyond the extreme.How much time has been devoted to debating number of deaths in UK under #Tory austerity agenda? Are poorer people so worthless that no one cares?
The @LibDems are on the march in council elections across England. Good local campaigns, fears over a disastrous #Brexit and Tories and Labour losing the plot... 
For those watching #bbcqt here are two occasions when @DavidDavisMP gave MPs to understand economic impact assessments existed. Hansard 20.10.16 and @CommonsEUexit 25.10.17  #brexit 
Did the general public (I.e. 90% of population) really understand fully what they were voting for in the #brexit referendum? #bbcqt
Tory Bernard Jenkin defends lack of sectoral analysis of #Brexit impact, saying “what would you base the analysis on? - we don’t know on what terms we’re leaving!”. You base it on a range of scenarios!!!  #bbcqt
It sickens me when hard #Brexit leaders say “oh, I personally never said leaving the EU would mean £350m extra per week for the NHS”. You were more than happy to perpetuate the lie. #bbcqt
Dear gawd, 5 mins in & already we’re being re-fed the con “take back control.” Believe me, they ALL know that this is NOT A GOOD IDEA BATMAN! #brexit

Why “frantic talks” the day before the deadline? May has been the Prime Minister for 18 months (EIGHTEEN MONTHS).Surely the most useless PM ever making a total mess of #Brexit#ToryBrexitShambles
How is it that no #bbcqt audience , ever appears to only have 52% of the population when it comes to #Brexit ,who the hell is seriously chosing these people, we demand access to that information and who's giving you your Agenda ? #bbcquestiontime
EU reveals its true colours: United States of Europe within 8 years. Thank God for #Brexit. 
Hedge funds whose multimillionaire founders backed the campaign to leave the EU will not think twice about abandoning Britain and picking off businesses damaged by #Brexit, a leading investment manager has claimed.

I discovered today that some generally well informed anti-#Brexit #Labour voters were unaware that even in #Leave voting Lab seats, majority of Lab voters chose #Remain (I shared this: ).
WINNER: Coventry named UK City of Culture 2021. The judges were impressed by the optimism of the application which included the belief the UK would still exist in 2021 and that there’d be some money left over for this shit. #Brexit
#Brexit means the breakup of the UK.We need to #ExitFromBrexit
This is sensational: Northern Irish public opinion favours a united Ireland in EU (47.9%) to remaining in the UK outside EU (45.4%). #DUP dont speak for N Ireland & hard #Brexit unionism is undermining UK. Watch this space with big consequences for Scotland. 
Standing with the people of Ireland, north and south against a destructive #Brexit.

After the announcement by former European commission President, Martin Schulz that the EU is to become the United States of Europe by 2025, how would you have voted in the EU referendum had you been armed with this knowledge? Please RT to widen sample. #Brexit

Question for #Leavers. As the UK government didn't know what the consequences of #Brexit would be; and they still don't apparently, how can you claim you made an informed decision when you voted to #Leave the EU?
We're at the point in British Politics where the 2 possible outcomes are:1) the Government made no attempt to assess the impact of #Brexit, and lied about it2) the Government *did* assess & found it's awful, so it's now lying about itGenuinely don't know which is worse

Many Brexiters have a real problem with Germany. They link their self-esteem with the nation. Sadly since beating Germany in 1945, Britain has been declining, so they cling to that victory & rage & fume because Germany has failed to stay crushed & beaten.#StopBrexit #Brexit /1

UK Govt have conducted an impact assessment on gravity foul sewers and lateral drains, but not on UK leaving the EU, the biggest decision the UK will have taken in 50 years. #Brexit is being conducted by a chaotic and incompetent Gov which doesn't care about its economic impact.
My view on the impact assessments scandal is that the Tory Brextremists want their #BrexitTaxHaven regardless of the impact #Brexit might have on the rest of us. So they've very little interest in impact reports or in conducting the negotiations competently.#StopBrexit #FBPE

I often find it useful to look back 1,2, 6 months etc to see how the #brexit situation is shaping up. The direction of travel is so clearly in favour of us calling the whole thing off. David Davis story just another nail in the #brexit coffin.

For months the DUP has been using "72%" to support its #Brexit arguments on trade between NI and Britain - but the party has been unable to substantiate the figure. @irish_news @politicsIN
No serious preparations were made for #Brexit before the 2016 Referendum. And no serious analysis has been done of its consequences since. Wandering into the dark, and hoping for the best, is not a good recipe for success.

Always obvious that the #Brexit fanatics in Parl will bluff & bluster & use every dirty trick in the book to reach March 2019...it's Smoke & Mirrors...no other date matters which is why Labour must get off the fence now & knock the Tory Brexit into touch This is real.#StopBrexit
Why is #Brexit going so badly? Because as all Brexiteers prove it was always about recapturing an impossible past (reconstituted as an imaginary future). Brexit is a reactionary exit from reality. It's a dream And the sleep of reason produces monsters 
I'm on @bbc5live at 10.30pm this evening. Topic is Brexit, how it's shaping up. Norton has biggest order book ever & strong future. #brexit
So #DavidDavis finally admits that Tories have no real #BrexitImpactReports at all! They’re proceeding to negotiate #brexit without knowing its affect on #Britain , its #economy ,  #regions ,#Jobs or anything... 
Truly unbelievable. Whatever one thinks of Brexit, this is unconscionable negligence #brexit 
Just had a bit of a personal epiphany: #Brexit fans hate 'EU law' because they see it as imposed from above when it's actually just all 28 of us agreeing not to screw each other over by having the same laws, the ECJ is just the referee
Imagine any lawyer saying to their client - We know we want to win. But we’ll work out how to win & what winning looks like once we hear the other side’s closing submissions. And no need to look at any evidence, at least, not yet.#Brexit
Green MEP @MollyMEP set to launch LEGAL ACTION against David Davis & @DExEUgov over #Brexit impact assessments, as early as TOMORROW, with @JolyonMaugham of @GoodLawProjectWATCH INTERVIEW: 
EARLIER David Davis #Brexit Dishonesty: he misled Parliament and the country, SO WHY IS HE STILL IN POST? 
The Big Bluff #Brexit 
This is letter DUP had co-signed about #Brexit last year (basically this is the deal that was on offer on Monday).Whatever they agree to in Phase 1, they will renege on if talks go to Phase 2. 
This is David Davis. He's in charge of #Brexit for your Govt. He said he had impact reports on 58 sectors of the economy. Now he says the reports don't exist. David Davis is a liar. He will get away with his lies. Your Govt is a joke #BrexitShambles 
"Today Brexit uncertainty looms over almost every aspect of doing business in the UK. Every day, companies are having to plan for worst while hoping for the best.“ - @drechsler_paul on #Brexit 
"Gerry, it's Leo here. Listen, I know what you mean now." #Brexit
Schrödinger's #Brexit Impact Studies. Or something. I dunno. I give up. 
The #DUP is turning #Brexit into the political death warrant of British unionism in #Ireland
I've said all along, for the past 7 years, that the Tories can say and do what they like because they own the media. This David Davis debacle is the final and damning proof. In normal times, this would be it for them but I think it's too late #brexit
Peter Bone MP - "The fact is that the British people made their decision. We’re coming out of the European Union and the only question is whether there can be an agreement with the European Union as to how that happens." #Brexit 
I would have thought the mere fact we are still going through with #brexit is an obvious hint there are no assessments of its impact on the economy.
For those asking here are two occasions when @DavidDavisMP gave MPs to understand economic impact assessments existed. Hansard 20.10.16 and @CommonsEUexit 25.10.17  #brexit @StephenGethins @theSNP @PeteWishart
I don't think I've been so angry in years. There's only one reason you don't do your due diligence on a project and that's because there are no identifiable benefits and it's not worth doing. Project #Brexit is  a failure and Davis is an utter incompetent. #DavidDavis
It’s reassuring that so many of those getting hysterical over #Trump and #Jerusalem are the same progressive bubble-dwellers who were wrong about him winning the presidency and wrong about #Brexit. The “Palestinian” Arabs have had their chance and blown it. Great day for #Israel.
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "Before Theresa May next goes Brussels, will she apply a new coat of paint to her red lines because I fear on Monday they were beginning to look a little bit pink." #Brexit 
Just imagine how every UK Business leader feels tonight knowing that David Davis has not completed even the most rudimentary investigation into how #Brexit will impact them. These clowns are not fit to serve in government. They have to go.
#Brexit Getting pissed off with all politicians horrendus all of them. 17 million voted leave. FFS stop pussyfooting around get on with BREXIT. You need a backbone, and men balls of steel to get it done. Our politicians got none of that guaranteed. pic.twitter.com/sNeNa0EMdW
David Davis will not face contempt of Parliament charges after #Brexit committee votes 11-8 against.The Brexit committee members include 10 Tories and 1 DUP.
How did we get to a point where we have so many irresponsible idiots in charge? Getting frown lines watching the news today #May #DavidDavis #Brexit #Trump #Jerusalem #c4news
Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital will stir up yet more conflict. But that is just what a cynical scumbag like Trump wants; fear, hate, conflict and violence which will boost support for his thuggish, bullying & abusive form of populism.#StopBrexit #Brexit
People keep saying, ‘Oh, don’t worry, you’ll be ok!’, when we tell them about the situation we EU citizens are in. Would you be re-assured if your future was in the hands of this bunch of devious incompetents? No? I didn’t think so! #InLimbo #brexit 
It's not just post truth politics but post moral post ethical post competence post public interest posts rules post national interest post doing your job post giving a toss #brexit #BrexitImpactReports
Anybody out there wish to tell us why we’re doing this #Brexit thing?Looks totally mental to me.
So Davis - having said there were impact assessments and then not publishing them - is *not* in contempt of Parliament because the IAs didn’t exist and hence couldn’t be published?Seriously?#brexit 
So it now turns out the Government has been misleading the #UK people about the #Brexit impact assessments: they have not carried out the detailed assessments of sectors that @DavidDavisMP said they had. Given this, do you have confidence in this government?Please RT for sample
This is why we must stop #Brexit. Please retweet. 
Oh dear, here's @LeaveEUOfficial calling for real leaders, like Churchill & Thatcher. They've forgotten their history. Let's start with Churchill who advocated a US of Europe & in the early 1960s wanted the UK to join the EEC #StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE /1
‘#Brexit was sold to the nation using a pack of lies,’ writes @Jon_Danzig in his report tonight. ‘And now Brexit is being imposed on the nation using a pack of lies. I nose that. You nose that. And they nose that.’ Please re-Tweet. Link to report: 
I don't think that Theresa May and her Government will survive this. Not carrying out assessments into the impact of #Brexit is one thing. Misleading the people is an entirely different matter. 
Labour MP STRUGGLING for words!Give example of country in Single Market without free movement."Norway...““They have free movement”“Sweden..."“They have free movement”“There is no example, price of membership is free movement isn’t it?#Brexit #EU
You mean there's no assessment of the impact of #brexit on social care???? 
A clean #Brexit means returning* Full control over our own borders so WE can decide whom we let in* The Supreme Court to London, NOT Luxembourg under the ECJ* The power to negotiate our own trade treaties with #EU and beyondAll of that means having to leave the Single Market.
Philip Hammond: “We’ll pay a divorce bill even if you we don’t get a deal” Blatant sabotage! #Brexit
If we have to #Brexit it should be treated like WW2.1. A coalition government of all parties.2. Tories negotiate Brexit3. Labour run the country4. Greens run energy5. SNP/Plaid run independence referendums6. DUP run Natural History Museum7. LibDems run for coffee
Message to @jeremycorbyn: If you aren’t able to challenge the government on #Brexit because you find it a tricky subject, please stand aside and let someone who can take over.
Run that past me again @PhilipHammondUK ... you want to hand over £45,000,000,000 of OUR money to the EU if there's no #Brexit deal? What are they going to do if we don't pay it? Throw us out? Wise up, man. 
Worth a listen: full speech by independent Ulster unionist MP Lady Sylvia Hermon on the Good Friday Agreement and #Brexit, with DUP interjections.
#Libdems were right on #Iraq and we are right on the #Brexit  disaster and chaos. 
Luckily the #EU has done their own impact studies on #Brexit which can be viewed her: 
For the nth time since I started having to write about #Brexit, I have to quote the Bronx sage, Yogi Berra: "If you don't know where you're going, you may end up someplace else". On current evidence, unlikely to be anywhere good.

No way am I going to get behind #Brexit. It is merely a vehicle  to ensure the rich don’t get caught in the EU tax avoidance net. Cannot believe that Freddy Normal hasn’t grasped that yet.#StopBrexit
Just been told that I'm not to be part of European research project on gender & digital world as UK not focus country. Adverse impact of #Brexit on UK research & unis @timeshighered
So the Cabinet never actually discussed ditching Single Market & Customs Union and STILL haven’t discussed future relationship with EU after #Brexit. And if they do discuss it, they’ll not bother with any impact assessments... Hurtling towards the cliff edge, no questions asked!

Has David Davis lied to the Commons on the #Brexit impact assessments? Said they exist in "excruciating detail"; now says they don't exist. John Profumo had the decency to resign after lying to Commons on Christine Keeler in 1963. Different times.

Surely it has to be said that this clip betrays either lying or incompetence on a grotesque scale. There can be no other explanation than these two can there? Care to comment @MLiebreich @MCL1965 @ZacGoldsmith @jonathonporritt? #Brexit
Thing is, I don't want #Brexit. I want it to fall apart. Last few days' events are music to my ears. Every minute of this farce makes thousands "Bregretters".It's supporters of Leave that should be absolutely FURIOUS at the lack of preparation and amateurishness of this gov't.
After David Davis' omnishambles today, we put Philip Hammond through the honesty filter... #Brexit 
#janeygodleyvoiceover #DavidDavis  chewing a sweetie not giving a flying funk about #brexit 
So the #tory shysters either a) have the #BrexitImpactReports and they’re too awful to be released or b) never did them in the first place and been lying to Parliament. Either way, not fit or competent to govern us. #Brexit #ToriesOutForXmas

Groans of disagreement in the House of Commons as DUP's Nigel Dodds tells independent unionist Sylvia Hermon that "many people in Northern Ireland suspect that she is on the side of Dublin" regarding #Brexit talks.
We are calling on the #government to ensure that non-UK #technicians can continue to work in Britain after #Brexit @FT
Fascinating presentation from John Curtice @NatCen @UKandEU Makes clear that the public have lost faith in incompetent Tory handling of #Brexit - shows that the Tories have been found out, only Labour can deliver sensible Brexit, & I believe we should move to EEA EFTA membership

This is #Brexit under the Tories: #PMQs1. No impact assessment on Automotive industry.2. No impact assessment on Aerospace industry.3. No impact assessment on finance sector.4. No impact assessment on manufacturing industry.5. No impact assessment on economic growth.

David Davis is a charlatan and should resign immediately. The levels of deceit during this whole #Brexit mess are an insult to the electorate 
So, blatantly lying to parliament and to the nation for months is okay. Have I got that right @theresa_may? Really? What will it take for you to get a grip of your ministers? Committing murder on live TV? Or would you let that pass too? #DavidDavis #brexitshambles #Brexit
My guess: David Davis told the truth in June, and lied today. The analysis is so damning the government dare not release it. #Brexit
What a tragedy that was - still dealing with the outcome - Lloyd George threatened the Irish delegates with a renewal of, "terrible and immediate war"#brexit 
PM defends DD at #pmqs, saying he’d only ever said there were #Brexit “sectoral analyses” (aka ‘printing some stufff off wikipedia’) and not impact assessments, so he didn’t lie. Shameful abdication of responsibility if no assessments done.
This is as good a summary as any you will see.  So logical next step is to accept the whole #Brexit process should be abandoned or , at the very least, put on hold by indefinite continued membership of the Single Market & Customs Union. 
Why David Davis giving evidence to MPs today was basically Monty Python's cheese shop sketch  #DavidDavis #Brexit 
Here are the e-mail addresses of the #HouseofCommons speaker. Why not let him know what you think of @DavidDavisMP's lies about the #Brexit impact papers? #StopBrexit #ParliamentJohn.bercow.mp@parliament.uk            speakersoffice@parliament.uk
“If we have a problem, would it help if I came over to Brussels with you to sort them out” @PeterBoneUK asks @theresa_may on #Brexit talks #PMQs
#Brexit required hard work and sacrifice. Brits avoid both like the plague, so failure was guaranteed. You’ll survive. You always do. And there’s a Royal wedding to think about.  
Whether you're a leaver or remainer, this should alarm and concern every single person living in the UK. #Brexit #DavidDavis
Irish PM hits out at @DUPleader saying it doesn't represent all off Northern Ireland, doesn't understand why it's being portrayed in London and elsewhere that they do #Brexit

So when @DavidDavisMP said that @theresa_may had read executive summaries, and she didn't deny it, was he lying by commission and TM by omission??@JolyonMaugham @Keir_Starmer @dontbrexitfixit #Brexit#BrexitImpactReports
David Davis told me that the PM had not read the full #Brexit reports only the summaries of the #impactassessments. #PMQs

UK Prime Minister Theresa May heckled as she says "very good progress" made in #Brexit talks #PMQs 
Seriously, the UK government hasn’t done full economic analysis of the impact of #Brexit? They’re either terrified of what it would say, or incompetent. Or both.  
Turns out David Davis and hundreds of DExEU civil servants have been getting dressed, going to work, playing Minecraft all day, then going home again. :-/#Brexit #PMQs
Has #DavidDavis breached the Ministerial Code Of Conduct? You decide...#brexitshambles #impactassessments #Brexit@brexit_sham @acgrayling @RichardDawkins @ProfBrianCox
There have been no #Brexit economic impact assessments.Davis lied to the public, lied to parliament and lied to his boss. If May doesn't sack him and call for a pause to the A50 timetable to assess the impact, her own MPs should call for her resignation.
BREAKING: David Davis unveils his 'excruciatingly detailed' #Brexit #impactassessments

When asked what his red lines were to protect Scotland from a hard #Brexit, David Mundell speaks about "The integrity of the UK". Scotland always comes second to Tories. #voteSNP
Wow - UK Govt had not done a single impact assessments on UK economy of #Brexit- Remember demands 4such assessments on impact of Scottish Indy #ToryLiars&Charlatans
On 1.11.2017 UK Govt said it’d not release anything in impact assessments that “prejudices the negotiations”We now know what that meant: it would show that Davis and DExEU were even more clueless and ill prepared than the EU side actually thought.#Brexit #ImpactAssessments
I try not to swear in tweets, but after revelation that 18mths after #EURef the UK gov't has not assessed impact of #Brexit I am going to let former senior civil servant Sir Richard Mottram speak for me. 
This is how #Brexit Secretary David Davis told MPs the UK government has not carried out an impact assessment of leaving the EU 
Damning post last month by @davidallengreen tracing the history of the #Brexit impact assessments saga June 2016 until June 2017Tl;dr: DExEU has been blagging about all of this for more than a year.
This has been a shambles from start to finish. The referendum was eighteen months ago and yet the Government have no idea what the impact of #Brexit on our economy will be 
Struggling to recall anything in 'Yes, Minister' as ludicrous as what has come out of the mouth of David Davis today and now this goon Greg Hands on Daily Politics. #bbcdp #Brexit
Here's a video of David Davis explicitly mentioning more than 50 #Brexit sectoral analyses. Today, he has said 'no systematic impact assessments' exist. Either misleading public or wholly incompetent. 
First the #Brexit impact assessments were "in excruciating detail", then they didn't exist, then they were shared with MPs and the Scottish Government... now they don't exist again. 
Don't let #Brexit make it worse. Some women's services get 40% of their income from EU funding- and they face losing it. Gvmt must pledge to support refuges, not shut them. Tweet your MP to ask if they'll support #EUWithdrawalBill amends 385 & NC77 if you agree! #FaceHerFuture
Brexit lies laid bare thanks to this transcript from the House of Commons library  #Brexit #DavidDavis
People in charge of #Brexit coming across more and more like school kids who didn't read the book they were given for homework, and couldn't even find a film of it."What was the best bit?""Ooh, probably all of it.""Favourite character?""They were all good weren't they."
If you were a COO or Head of Finance of a multinational company’s UK operations listening to the #Brexit news the last three days… what would you do?
BREAKING: David Davis comes clean to the European Commission and admits that he has no eyes and has been pretending to read all this time. #Brexit 
So there are no #Brexit Impact Assesments! Incompetence or arrogance from David Davis?He has effectively stuck two fingers up at the Committee and lied. He should resign! 
David Davis: “There's nothing...there's no such systematic impact assessments that I'm aware of."Absolutely sickening. This so-called “government” needs to be go asap & there must be consequence for their lies to the public.#Brexit
David Davis has now confirmed that UK Gov has done NO analysis of the impact of #Brexit on a sector by sector basis.  This is appalling. The UK is about to take the single biggest economic decision ever and the UK Gov have not analysed its impact.  A complete dereliction of duty.
BUSTED !Impact assessments #BrexitDavis FINALLY admitted what we ALL suspected.THEY DON'T EXIST !
We’ve reached peak farce.#brexit

I watch the #Brexit developments like it’s a gobsmackingly ludicrous reality show, while fully aware I’m doing so from within the burning house that is America. We are two countries swiftly bleeding out from the most ridiculously avoidable self-inflicted wounds.
David Davis tells Hilary Benn at the #brexit committee that there was 'no formal quantative assessment' undertaken before the cabinet decided to leave the #eu customs union

David Davis: #Brexit impact papers-First they are secret-Then delay handing over-Now they don't exist-Govt will do them laterFarce
Davis just admitted that there are 'NO' #Brexit Impact Papers.. Gov is taking the country for fools.. It's borderline criminal!! #Shameful
Switzerland has Chinese trade deal. Its trade with Lombardy more important. The hard #Brexit case is moonshine. We lose more than we gain
The evidence of @DavidDavisMP to @CommonsEUexit just now re non existence of #brexit #impactassessments would appear to directly contradict what he & other UK Govt ministers have previously told Commons committees. This is pretty serious
So our ministers who are meant to be looking after our best interests, not only lied in parliament but sustained that lie?Are there no standards for public office? Is there no accountability for misleading the public, for telling lies?#Brexit is mocking our democracy
So: 1. A hard #Brexit is incompatible with peace in Ireland2. The DUP is incompatible with a soft Irish border3. The government is unsustainable without the DUP4. May's only remaining option - though she will take a while to get there - is to call an election
So @DavidDavisMP has just told the Brexit Select Committee @CommonsEUexit that no impact assessments exist. I repeat. UK Govt has carried out no impact assessments re economic effects of #Brexit
Davis tells @CommonsEUexit that the papers are 'sectoral analyses' not 'impact assessments' & confirms to @hilarybennmp that #ToryBrexitgovt has in fact undertaken no assessments of impact of #Brexit on the various economic sectors of the British economy. There you have it. 
We are about to start taking evidence from @DavidDavisMP on #Brexit sectoral impact assessments. Watch live 
I had a phone call with the Taoiseach @campaignforleo and assured him that we stand by our Irish friends regarding #Brexit. A hard border within #Ireland is unacceptable.
Kinnock fought 1983 General Election on a manifesto promising to  take the UK out of the EU  without a referendum.He later became a highly paid EU Commissioner and now wants to reverse #Brexit.The man is a hypocrite. 
EU officials have begun referring to the possible #Brexit transition phase as the Full Monty or “Full Monty Minus” (minus because the U.K. won’t have membership of the institutions.)
I sacked three shadow ministers for voting to keep us in the customs union. I am therefore shocked that the Tories don’t want to entertain the option of staying in it. #Brexit
Watch as the Scottish #Brexit Minister absolutely schools this arrogant Tory. 
Rejecting a bespoke deal for the North in #Brexit is not a principled position from DUP. They support devolution and divergence on a whole range of issues. This is about the DUP MPs being on the side of the Tory Right Wing Brexiteers and undermining the GFA. @morningireland
Labour need to come out of hiding and work with others to stop a hard #Brexit.
Theresa Villier has been very quiet of late. Then NI sec of state campaigned on doorsteps w/DUP for #brexit

Shadow Cabinet Brexit Positions in Full Corbyn whipped his MPs to vote against single market and customs union membership – he even sacked rebels on this – now Labour’s Brexit Secretary says it is party policy..Lab & Con in chaos over #Brexit.

Wow, beautiful thread showcasing the many contradictions @RuthDavidsonMSP has spouted about #Brexit.#Whicheverwaythewindblows.She hasn’t got a scooby.  #SNP@BBCScotlandNews
The DUP were invited to several "All Ireland" meetings to deal with #Brexit over the last year and have declined every opportunity. To pretend they've somehow been left out is ridiculous. #tonighttv3
15. Two things remain unclear to date: why was Cambridge Analytica repeatedly offering help to Julian Assange over Russian hacked emails? And how deep do those Russian connections go with #Brexit?
1. The effect of Mercer funding - of both Young Americas Foundation and Young Britons foundation - shows the three pronged strategy of Steve Bannon's influence on both #Brexit and #Trump
There are more EU nationals working in the UK than last year - up 112,000.Scotland's concerns bigger than attracting talented immigrants given that only 3% from EU and rest of the world choose us. That is not the fault of #Brexit

So great to have people like @JolyonMaugham scrutinising the Government over their #Brexit “plans”. He’s trying to provide a much needed big shiny light 
This.There's no actual value in rolling out IDS on Newsnight becausea) he's obsessive &b) he still doesn't get the basics of #BrexitWhat therefore is the value in interviewing him? 
Just two days before last year’s #EUReferendum, @Theresa_May insisted there’d have to be border controls with #Ireland if UK voted for #Brexit. 'Enough is enough,’ writes @Jon_Danzig. 'She has to go.' Read and share his report:

The price of solidarity from EU on #brexit is #pesco Nothing for nothing.
When you May have a slight problem...  #Arlene #Brexit 
The EU has produced a frightening new report arguing for vastly greater centralisation, deeper federalism, and yet further emasculation of the democratic nation state. These people are dangerous and delusional. #Brexit cannot happen fast enough. 
“They make no assessment of the impact […] There is zero assessment of the economic impact. Nothing is redacted because there is nothing to redact.”Agree with #Brexit as a policy or not, but it is impossible to escape the impression it is being done fantastically badly. 
Leave.EU co-founder Richard Tice is a multi-millionaire who specialises in 'distressed debt'.#Brexit should create plenty of that.#disastercapitalism
A furious Iain Duncan Smith tells @bbclaurak on #r4pm: "We need to tell the EU to back off or we will get on with alternative arrangements." On an hourly basis, this #Brexit shambles alternates between tragedy and farce.
Since 2000, the UK has given more than £100billion to Brussels. We are net contributors and have paid far more in than we have received in return. We may indeed leave the EU without a deal. #Brexit 
Westminster incompetents are gonna drag Scotland to #Brexit oblivion along with rUK. Scottish unionIsts need to swallow pride + consider voting Yes in #indyref2. We won't gloat or say we told you so. We'll just work together for a better future for Scotland.
Irish gov. briefing "regulatory alignment", "no regulatory divergence" are the same and means remaining in the customs union/single market, and the Brits agreed. Hope that clears things up.  #Brexit
Corbyn supporters:Every time you wring your hands and say "but what can he do re #Brexit" you prove a little bit more that he's actually a bit useless at everything other than telling friendly crowds things they want to hear.

No Kenny. #Brexit is the most serious political calamity of my adult life, and will have enormous, long lasting negative ramifications. People who could play a part to stop/mitigate it but won’t for party reasons are beyond the pale
This is what pisses me off more than anything about #Brexit - there was NO CONSENSUS on what #VoteLeave actually meant (still isn’t), these options should have been on ballot paper for clarity. UK being pushed off a cliff when the majority was actually for #Remain! #StopBrexit
DUP simply unable to countenance the fact that they were betrayed by London not Dublin? #Brexit

"There's no strategy whatsoever, @theresa_may​ is kidding us on if she's pretending Ireland was ever in the forefront of her mind" says @glasgowcathcart​ as @duponline puts pressure on PM to change #Brexit deal for Northern Ireland. 
Isn't it funny that so many people who have slammed @sinnfeinireland for almost a year for not doing a deal with @duponline are now disgusted by ... the bigoted and reactionary @duponline?#Brexit
1) Brexit: stating the obviousCurrent situation is entirely predictable & in fact was inevitable#Brexit, as championed by the Leave campaign, was always going to be impossible.

Hi all. The #FBPE Follow Back Pro Europe tag is working really well. I have picked up over 800 new followers but I have followed a lot more. Come on guys the clue is in the tag. Please follow back. Lets amplify our voice. #FBPE #StopBrexit #brexit 
Arlene Foster says the #Brexit deal paper was a 'big shock' for the DUP 
#brexit is the definition of "Sunk cost." Cut the losses, apologise, stay in EU, work with other nations to create a better and more understanding world. And pressure USA to join a Superstate in a refined EU model.
PM @theresa_may acceptance of regulatory alignment would mean UK will have to follow EU laws, with no input, no vote, no veto and no membership privileges.  No other country on earth would agree to this charade. PM has failed to achieve what she was elected to deliver. #Brexit 
At last - someone who gets it. As is so often the case, Corbyn's strategy on #Brexit is far smarter than his critics (left, right and centre) realise... 
US economist says that for the first time since the #Brexit vote she's hearing talk of a potential Sterling Crisis in London. If that does happen the Bank of England would have to sharply increase interest rates. Let's hope it doesn't.#StopBrexit #Brexit
#Brexit: Where we are at right now:The UK government squandered £1 billion of taxpayers money to put Arlene Foster in charge of our Brexit negotiations.
Mrs May had one job to do - to get us out of corrupt EU. Unfortunately she has proved, she isn't man enough to stop the charade. #Brexit #brexitshambles
292,316 voters supported the #DUP in June 2017 election. Thats only 36.0% of N Ireland voters & a mere 0.9% of UK voters (32,203,481). The power of the few over the many on #Brexit & more.
Speaking during #Brexit questions, Mr Rees-Mogg said: 
1 in 5 workers in house building are from overseas. In London 56% of the site workforce is non-UK. House builders warn that #Brexit threatens the 300,000 homes target.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
The DUP opposed the Good Friday agreement which was supported by 71% of the NI electorate, and NI voted to remain in EU - where is the mandate? #Brexit
After years of austerity and failing public services through national policy how unjust to lay the blame on immigration and the EU. And how misconceived to hold a referendum under such false and scapegoating circumstances #brexit
Oh please.Earlier on they said they were not shown the text and - between the lines - that pointed the finger at May.Having realised that’s not a good look as they prop up her government, they’re reorientation the finger towards Varadkar.#Brexit

.@GlennBBC. Just wondering if there is any conceivable reason why @RuthDavidsonMSP has not been doorstepped regarding this ongoing #Brexit shambles? You wouldnt let any other MSP set their own media agenda, why her?
Leaving the customs union is a requirement of #Brexit. Independence at the most basic level means becoming a distinct customs entity. Remaining in it is not necessary. Frictionless trade is a feature of regulatory and border cooperation - not an amalgamated customs regime.
UK: Voters want a second referendum about the final Brexit deal (Survation poll). #Brexit

Sinn Fein to hold protests across Northern Ireland calling for designated special status within the EU. #Brexit
Anyway, in the absence of any sensible movement on #Brexit, here’s a picture of a Musk Ox. 
"Theresa May wants to keep the border open in Ireland, while at the same time taking the UK out of the EU with a so-called hard #Brexit. Those two things ultimately contradict," says @jonworth in a DW interview:
The #Brexit effect: - Pound collapses- Investment dries up- Lowest growth in EU- DUP holds the government to ransom- £60bn Brexit bill- National debt risesAnd we've not even left the EU yet."Take back control"?Because of Brexit, Britain is heading out of control.
All expert witnesses to @commonshealth inquiry into #Brexit say continued regulatory alignment essential and continued membership of Single Market & Customs Union preferable.
Here is what some of the Irish media deem reliable spokespersons on Brexit! #BREXIT #Remain
We will not allow a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. We need a clear signal from London on this. #Brexit @EPPGroup
If you watch one thing today, make sure it's this fiery #Brexit exchange between @DavidJonesMP and MSP @Feorlean on @VictoriaLIVE
#Labour saying they want to stay in the Customs Union & Single Market. So uncontrolled borders, unmanaged immigration subordination to the EU Court = a total betrayal of #BREXIT & the #British people. If you want #Brexit, only #UKIP is committed to delivering it! 
Democracy includes the right to campaign to overturn any policy no matter how it was arrived at. If Leavers don't like that, I would invite them to kindly consider moving to one of the many countries where that right is not respected.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
Don’t underestimate the level of political inertia we had to overcome to win #Brexit, and the amount of anger needed to do it. If Brexit is stopped, it will multiply that anger by ten, and it will set the worst precedent imaginable. No democratic vote will ever be safe again.
Brexiteers have been campaigning for DECADES to Leave the EU. @vote_leave and @LeaveEUOfficial spent millions of pounds....And yet none of them checked the basic facts. #Brexit is tower of piffle, pulled out of a fundament of ignorance 
BREAKING: DUP’s Nigel Dodds says DUP will no accept any principles or language that would separate NI from rest of UK #Brexit 
We went to war in Iraq based on lies or the euphemism faulty information which is the exact same thing as why Brexit occurred (see side of bus promises) and yet no one in the media wants to ask Blair what's the difference between why Iraq & why #Brexit . 
#Brexit DUP say they will not tolerate any regulatory divergence with rest of GB. So why have they on abortion and gay marriage? When it suits them they are more Irish than the Irish
Grown adults can act like 5 year olds in their own houses but surely not in the Houses of Parliament?#DavidDavis is responding to #UQs on #Brexit like a petulant, peeved child.#NotInMyName #StopBrexit #citizensrights
The fact that Katie Hopkins is singing he praises of Arlene Foster tells you all you need to know about the DUP. #Brexit
The political impasse could be resolved by MPs virtually overnight. Sane Labour MPs could ditch their soiled nest of communism and form a unity government with the Tories so to expel the DUP and marginalise the Brexit taliban. Then safe for an EEA exit. #Brexit

Absolutely devastating. Keir Starmer summarising how we got to this point & who the authors of this #Brexit mess are. “It would be funny if it weren’t so tragic.” 
Pleased to hear @Keir_Starmer say in the @HouseofCommons just now that @UKLabour believes permanent Single Market and Customs Union membership should be on the table in the #Brexit negotiations. We also rightly object to 29 March 2019 being the fixed exit date @laboursinglemkt
Labour should be careful what it wishes for. Taking over the reigns of #Brexit could be calamitous in the long run. Let Tories self-destruct in the dreadful mess they created
"Don't always trust the @Conservatives​" says @KilclooneyJohn who calls for another general election as @theresa_may reveals that issues remain with EU #Brexit deal. 
In out in out you shake it all about.It's Labour Hokey Cokey as they turn again.Knees bent hands up ra ra ra.You can't trust Labour surrender monkeys on #Brexit. 
Theresa May has installed the DUP Word Wizard to help avoid another day of shambolic Irish border announcements #BREXIT 
Disgraceful!! Pls retweet Irish Government deliberately leaked deal ALREADY REJECTED by @theresa_may in order to destabilise the Government and derail #Brexit negotiations, according to prominent Brexiteer and Conservative backbencher Peter Bone. 
If the @UKLabour frontbench stood up now, & made unequivocally clear that they believe in Single Market & Customs Union membership, then we could save our communities from the worst effects of this #Brexit disaster. Over to you @jeremycorbyn.
Several Labour MPs standing up to say way to solve Irish border issue is to stay in the single market and customs union #brexit
Quite right. Time for a united opposition to this extreme #Brexit. Young people in this country are being betrayed by a generation of politicians failing to stand up for their future. Need leaderships of all opposition parties to step up at this most crucial moment. 
"What an embarrassment" - Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer criticises government over failure to reach #Brexit agreement with EU 
Not one single noise of support for David Davis when he finishes his response to the UQ on the sorry state of #Brexit negotiations.
Excellent to hear @Keir_Starmer say that Single Market and Customs Union should not be taken off table in #Brexit negotiations. Slams David Davis for shambles. @Open_Britain
Martin Schulz: "I refuse to imagine a Europe where lorries and hedge funds are free to cross borders but citizens cannot".Time for Labour members and supporters to stand up and reject right-wing lies about there being an EU immigrant 'problem'.#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE
This is what FM @NicolaSturgeon is saying today on the UK Government’s approach to #Brexit talks. 
.@Keir_Starmer says PM should put option of customs union and single market back on table, because "if price is break up of the united kingdom, the price is too high". #Brexit
I am one of the greatest critics of the Fine Gael government.However I dread to think what position we would be in if Fianna Fáil were taking lead on #Brexit negotiations. The only party in Ireland apart from hard-line unionists to contemplate notion of border controls! 
#Brexit. There is only one way for #TheresaMay to overcome the DUP’s objections: that is regulatory alignment between EU and UK. Or she could admit that #Blair is right, the UK needs a new referendum. @kathrynjohnston #Ireland #NoBrexit  by @Socialnews_IT

The chaos of last 24 hours is not incidental to #Brexit. It is integral to it. Brexit sunders national unity as well as national prosperity.

An interesting comment from Leave.eu last night. #StopBrexit #Brexit 
Caller to #Farage: “I think you’ve caused all this mess. I voted #Brexit, but now I realise implications & I’ve spoken to a lot of people like me who voted Brexit, would vote Remain now knowing what this has caused"#StopBrexit #BrexitShambles
Tories & the #DUP: "We’re all going down on this sinking ship together"Everyone else: "But … but there are lifeboats *right there*"Tories & the DUP: *sets fire to the lifeboats* "NEARER, MY GOD, TO THEEEEEE" #Brexit
Many @UKLabour MPs are taking advantage of the #Brexit chaos to push for membership of the Single Market/Customs Union. Which is fine, but the inescapable logic of that is to remain in the EU. Otherwise we are just a vassal state of the EU without influence.
If there’s a spare £40 billion going, it should be spent in the UK, not handed to Brussels  #Brexit
Typical silence from @David_Cameron as the national calamity he created to appease a tiny minority of Tory right-wingers threatens the Good Friday agreement his predecessors worked so hard to bring about #Brexit
Remaining in the Single Market is what's best for Northern Ireland, read why here:  #Brexit #BridgesNotBorders
Yes, but Ruth Davidson has no power over #brexit. Her Tory MPs do and last night they voted against the Scottish interest. #voteSNP
This is a DUP MP (who preciously said that the border was Dublin’s problem). Feels like NI style ‘negotiating’ being applied to #brexit. Could get v v difficult in that case 
Silver lining in @NicolaSturgeon all-over-the-place remarks on #Brexit is that every time she opens her mouth, her stock as a serious politician falls.
The #UK #Government & @theresa_may should not be giving anymore concessions to the #BADDEAL that the #EU wants to give #BRITAIN! The best option is a #NODEAL & WTO Rules which is the #BESTDEAL for the UK!  #BBC #SKY #BREXIT @Conservatives @CCHQPress @ConHome #ConservativeParty
Makes me wonder: does May actually *not* understand the implications of what she was ready to agree to in Brussels yesterday? And Foster & hardcore Brexiteers did?Having conceded the principle of “regulatory alignment” you’re on the track to quite a lot of alignment.#Brexit 
How to square the #Brexit circle? 1 Stay in Customs Union. 2 Stay in Single Market. Which is almost to say: 3 Stay in the EU.

I sincerely hope Labour has a saleable plan for #Brexit if there is an election in the new year.
Just a reminder. The DUP don’t actually have a veto. The Irish government does. #Brexit
Considering Sinn Fein were the first to come up with the ambitious idea of special status for Northern Ireland it's bizarre that political commentators are only talking to @FineGael Not suprising but still bizarre. #Brexit
Out of interest, is there also an impending Gibraltar Issue still to come in round II of #Brexit talks?
What is embarrassing the #UK is the dreadful Little Englander image being projected to the world by the whole #Brexit fiasco. Not a word in these tweets about the UK: all about @Conservatives. You should be ashamed.
'European Press Reaction,' to #Brexit thread time. It's been a while, always good get some perspective. (Will add more during the day). /1
A polite way of describing this exchange is that it gets heated…@DavidJonesMP & Mike Russell MSP (@Feorlean) lock horns over single market and customs union #Brexit 
Beyond laughable to hear @tconnellyRTE story yesterday in some way being blamed for busting a #Brexit border deal. It was paused, or collapsed, due to political failure. Simples
I see @RuthDavidsonMSP is doing the #Brexit hokey-cokey again.
When you read that over 500 MPs are pro-remain but were forced by party whips to vote for #Brexit or lose their jobs, you have to ask yourself, what part of taking back control, sovereignty and democracy is that?
Our #Remain movement keeps growing! It's not backed by big money or the two main parties. It's formed of 10s of thousands of activists giving their time & energy. It's a huge & growing popular movement of people who care deeply about their country!#StopBrexit #Brexit #FBPE

I’ve made a video about #Brexit with @SofiaBettiza which accidentally looks like a rom-com! 
I note that @LabourRichard hasn't uttered a word on #brexit in the last 24hrs. What we need is some more roadworks to get Scottish politics excited again!
I really wish we’d get a major speech from @jeremycorbyn that says #Brexit must be stopped. I respected the referendum result then but it’s very clear, now, to all but those who are ignorant or who have an ulterior motive (£££), that Brexit is one monumental disaster.

I wonder if Teresa Villiers MP and other #Brexit advocates stand by their claim that pre-Referendum concerns over the Irish border with the UK were ‘scaremongering’?  Is there a pattern here? Did the Brexit advocates get anything right?
Agreed Chuka, but why then leave the EU? #Brexit is on the ropes, public opinion is turning our way, time to build a national movement to fight back.

Brexit: no deal means no deal - if you think you understand Irish politics, you haven't been listening ...  #Brexit. 
#Brexit is walking dead.  It's almost over folks.  
Tory MPs just voted down key #Brexit amendments that would have protected the devolution settlement and stopped the Westminster power grab. Get all the facts on the #EUWithdrawalBill.
Every day we get bombarded with wrongs. We need 2get #ToriesOut as soon as possible.UK is in chaos & Crisis. Chaos with #Brexit ; Crises with #NHS #socialcare #education #housingPeople suffering & dying unnecessarily because Tories chose 2give Tax Breaks 2Billionaires#newsnight
Hilarious comments from the Irish Taoiseach @campaignforleo about the DUP (on 36%) representing a minority in Northern Ireland. His own Fine Gael got less than 26% in the Republic of Ireland. Also Remain campaigning Ulster Unionist Party now support implementing #Brexit #DUP
Fantastic long read on the complexities of life on the Irish border - @NaomiOhReally is one of the few journalists who really nails the problem of NI and #Brexit 
Nick Robinson should check the facts before tweeting. Jeremy Corbyn commented on #Brexit about 2 hrs prior to Nick Robinson's unfair tweet misrepresenting Corbyn. Not the first time Nick Robinson has misrepresented Corbyn. #BBCBias
What a bizarre day - but then we seem to be saying that every day given the chaos of @GovUk and #Brexit... 
@drewhendrySNP gives a tour de force of the 111 powers under threat in the Tory #Brexit Power grab, from farming to pharmaceuticals, state aid to statistics. #EUWithdrawalBill
Don't believe these remoaners who say that #Brexit is an ill-conceived, chaotic mess.Fake news, as my fellow hotelier Trump would put it.They say just the same about Fawlty Towers - which is renowned as the best-run hotel on the English Riviera.
No @jeremycorbyn it provides evidence that #Brexit is a foolish & self-destructive project built on a mountain of lies which will harm the majority of British people, and will undermine all of Labour's plans. A real Labour leader would campaign for it to be stopped.#StopBrexit
In the charming Irish tradition of calling global events by a different name from anyone else, let's not talk about #Brexit any more... Let's call it #TheBremergency
Today’s embarrassing & dangerous #Brexit developments are the inevitable consequence of Theresa May’s £1bn post election bung to the DUP. They were always going to be back for more #pullingthestrings
The #Homelessness crisis is both north and south, similar issues affect us all regardless of the wider political debate. We are united in our vision that everyone on this island should have access to affordable housing. #Brexit #CBLive
Where IS the Tory #Brexit team ?* BoJo - the clown* Fox - the disgraced former Defence Secretary* Double D dilletante Davis.Are they in HIDING ?The Prime Minister is looking very ISOLATED - after being thrown under a bus by the DUP.
A selection of Tuesday's UK front pages #brexit #DUP
I'm no expert on anything. But I feel I could have seen the #DUP position on this coming a mile off. Why didn't the UK government? #Brexit #newsnight
So let me get this straight: May wanted to sell Northern Ireland down the rive and basically derail #Brexit but the #DUP did not let her do it and now Brussels and Remainers are pissed off. British media, that collection of cocksucking traitors, are upset as well. Well done DUP!
Everyone with any sense knows there is no "successful deal" for #Brexit, only degrees of failure.Pretending that Brexit is actually achievable without significant pain makes Labour part of the #Brexit problem 
This is not about nationalism, this is about democracy. As it currently stands, the #EUWithdrawalBill puts the Welsh Government at the mercy of Whitehall Ministers’ - why should we trust a UK Gov that is leading us into a shambolic #Brexit? 
Ex-Brexit Minister David Jones says UK should refuse to have a hard border between Wales and Ireland and to use "technology" to achieve free flow of trade. What planet is he on? Is he planning to go to @pcworld and ask for that off-the-self #Brexit free trading software?
Clearly some plotting underway with Priti Patel, Bernard Jenkin and Edward Leigh in a huddle (and Jacob R-M close by).  Manoeuvring for a No Deal #Brexit ?
#trump & #brexit make humanity look stupid! 
Theresa May on her way to complete the agreement with the EU until she spotted Arlene Foster and the rest of the DUP #Brexit #Newsnight
Brexiters have consistently ignored the vital role of EU membership in peace in Northern Ireland, and for that matter, so have most of our news media.#BrexitBetraysBritain#StopBrexit #Brexit
People in Scotland voted to stay in the #EU. If #Brexit happens, and if NI is able to stay in the #singlemarket, Scotland should be able to as well.
Hmm I wonder what's going through Cameron's mind right now.It was his HUBRIS - his inability to manage his Party - and his purblind arrogance that he would WIN #EuRef that has led to this Govt's INEPT handling of #Brexit
The #Brexit extremists are getting very upset at all the #FBPE tags everywhere they look.  It's almost as if they feel outnumbered and cornered now that the tide has changed so far against them.  Will of the people, isit? 
How would have thought Northern Ireland could prove an intractable political problem.... #brexit
Sometimes I wish there was a hard border around my #Govanhill constituency.If there's one place there shouldn't be freedom of movement for people, it's in that shit hole.#Brexit #indyref2
Conservative MP Bernard Jenkins thinks that Bertie Ahern & Enda "kelly" Kenny were former Taoiseach's of Northern Ireland #brexit 
All you need know @bernardjenkin "enda kelly" Teeshock of northern Ireland #Brexit @SkyNews
Why can’t England leave the EU and give all the rest of us peace?They were the ones that carried the #Brexit vote after allFor it will come to that eventuallyScotland will be independentIreland will unite
1.3million people voted for @SadiqKhan to be Mayor, in a city with a population close to 9million people. You speak for the few not the many. #BREXIT
That most clear-sighted of #Brexit commentators, @fotoole, on today's shenanigans. 
May calls GE to strengthen mandate. Ends up with minority government. Pacts with DUP from NI. NI big pending issue of #brexit phase I talks. May offers EU deal on NI EU would accept. DUP blocks deal. The end?
Tonight on #BREXIT @theddp, Europe Minister @HMcEntee , @DearbhailDibs , unionist activist @JamieBrysonCPNI and more. @PMVTrust and @diarmuidlyng on #homelessness . Solicitor @michaelfinucane and Jason Lester on water protest ruling. AND MORE! #CBLive
Why does Tommie Gorman insist on misrepresenting NI on #rtenews saying SF pulled down NI gov over “Irish Language & other issues”???It was over a blatant DUP corruption scandal. Let’s facts straight please. #Brexit #cblive
Despicable! It seems Theresa May was willing to sell out Northern Ireland for a very bad deal. Good for the DUP for standing up for a full #Brexit for the whole United Kingdom. 
Please watch, Johnson dismissed the negative impact of #Brexit on Northern Ireland. He lied. 
We’re still missing one crucial fact in amongst all the recriminations of today’s deal but then no-deal on the Irish border and #Brexit.* * * * * * *We do not know WHY the DUP behaved the way it did today.* * * * * * *1/7
The future of #Brexit #Britain.  Diminished, in every possible way.  Keep fighting, #Remainers!   #FBPE#DUP #StopBrexit #NorthernIreland #Brexitshambles #EU #IrishBorder #SNP
Please describe the ‘successful’ deal you would negotiate @jeremycorbyn. Otherwise this is just posturing. Do you believe #Brexit is better for Britain than remaining? If you don’t, say so! 
3/4 Even when promised a soft #Brexit with no hard border etc 56% we voted to remain in the EU therefore 56%+ would favour special status
In last week’s Belfast Telegraph #Brexit Poll 78% of people wanted to remain in Customs Union - civic society in the north of Ireland must surely be reaching breaking point with DUP after today?
Hey British journalists, here are a few reasons why Arlene Foster & the DUP DO NOT speak for NI when they say we want a hard #Brexit (1/4)
Someone help me!I don’t understand why we’re walking out on existing worldwide deals so we can “trade globally”Don’t our current trade deals with countries around the globe mean we’re trading globally?Where does our tea come from?#Brexit#brexitshambles
I grew up in North Longford and we regularly “crossed the border” from Ballyconnell into Enniskillen. The armed soldiers leaning their guns on the drivers window as they asked my Dad “what’s your business in the North?” is a memory I’d rather forget. #Brexit
Just been #StandingUpForWales with @WelshLabour colleagues on #Brexit Bill. Why haven't Ministers shown any respect for #Wales and listened to concerns? Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns absent for most of debate too...
To put government's position on #Brexit in perspective, allowing DUP to force a no deal Brexit is no different than if Lib Dems forced no Brexit. DUP is a minority party holding too much power over a weak government concerned more with its survival than stability of the country.
Arlene Foster the great Irish ventriloquist with her dummy the MAYBOT #BREXIT #NorthernIreland
EU: Northern Ireland can have their cake and eat it.DUP: Fuck off we don't like cake, we'll have the same cold porridge as GB. #DUP #Brexit
While we’re at it: like Northern Ireland, Yorkshire wants an open border with our nearest EU neighbour and the right of all Yorkshire folk to apply for EU citizenship. #Brexit 
A #Brexit agreement must take into account the Irish interests.  @Theresa_May has made some progress. But border controls in #Ireland are not an option. Without a commitment on that, no second phase of negotiations will begin.
Ireland Insist #Brexit Negotiations Be Carried Out as Gaeilge.... 
If nothing else, today's bizarre events must foster some respect for Sinn Féin & the sheer dogged patience & tactical nous they have displayed in the decades of talks/negotiations with the DUP! #Brexit #Omnishambles
"Hard Landing"THAT BRITISH GOVERNMENT IRELAND #BREXIT ANALYSIS: A RECAP. 
Ireland, the EU is playing you like a fiddle  #Brexit
Even #TheresaMay knows her days are numbered as PM but it occurs to me that she has the means to stay in office for life: all she has to do is walk away from #Brexit talks. The UK population will love her standing up to Europe…and after all it won’t make any difference! 
"Irregularity"THAT DUP VIEW ON THE #BREXIT DEAL, IN FULL.With thanks to /u/sinnoach for the inspiration for this one!
This is comically off.Even *if* the UK side had briefed there’d have been these statements from Scotland, Wales, London etc., because a different settlement for NI is the only way to give rest of UK its hard #Brexit.This isn’t a briefing or comms issue. 
#SadiqKhan calls for special #Brexit deal for London after he sees that the PM is in trouble!Will no one rid us of this turbulent priest? 
Unionists like to disdainfully refer to the Republic as "Mexico", but it's genuinely hard to figure out if the current #Brexit impasse is a Mexican stand-off or the DUP re-enacting that scene in 'Blazing Saddles' where Sheriff Bart takes himself hostage.
Just in - CCTV footage of Theresa May after #Brexit negotiations earlier today: 
 The #Brexit breakthrough that wasn't
Slight change of plan for tomorrow - now sitting in Manchester airport waiting for flight to Belfast. Celebrating with a grab bag of discos. #Brexit #regulatoryalignment
No #Brexit progress will be good enough if it is based on the Settled status.Instead, we could have a much simpler system such as our Alternative and no one would be left behind, read more : 
The rest of #Europe looks aghast at #TheresaMay confusion & delusion:“Who can deliver a #brexit agreement? Who should we negotiate with?”
#DUP #ArleneFoster @DUPleader: We will not accept any form of regulatory divergence which separates #NorthernIreland economically or politically from the rest of the #UnitedKingdom! GREAT LADY! #BBC #SKY #BREXIT @Conservatives #TORY @CCHQPress @ConHome #ConservativeParty
Wonder how much longer it will be before May realises #Brexit is undeliverable?
"Shambles" doesn't even come close to describing the mess that is #Brexit
#Brexit Can we get some politicians with a backbone sort this Brexit out FFS. Theresa Maybe hopeless  Was a remainer still is. Stop  waving bloody white flag start fighting for .   
#NigelFarage on @LBC The @duponline & @DUPleader were right to scupper the crap #EUdeal that could have seen #NorthernIreland remain in the #SingleMarket & #CustomsUnion  #BBC #SKY #BREXIT @Conservatives #TORY @CCHQPress @ConHome #ConservativeParty #EU #DUP
Has anyone pointed out the irony that Theresa May would have given in on all three EU demands if it wasn’t for a party representing minority of voters in territory that voted remain? #brexit
...And can we also get a round of applause and some appreciation for @theresa_may who is bending over backwards to deliver mission impossible on #Brexit despite some unwarranted criticism. I for one believe she will deliver and somehow get everyone in agreement. 
The Tory party thought #TheresaMay was a "Bloody Difficult Woman"... Until they jumped into bed with the DUP and saw what a Bloody Difficult Woman actually looks like! Well done #ArleneFoster for fucking up #Brexit like no-one else can!#StopBrexit
Almost 100 yrs ago, a minority in Ireland forced the creation of a northern state with a manufactured unionist political majority.Now that unionist political majority is no more it is a minority within a minority attempting to dictate the future for all of Ireland.#Brexit
The DUP, who represent 0.91% of UK voters and 1.54% of UK MPs, just held Brexit, the Prime Minister, cross-border relations and the Good Friday Agreement to ransom.Let that sink in.Seriously, just let that sink in.#Brexit #brexitshambles #DUP #ArleneFoster
Can I just point out that if the DUP dont play ball on #Brexit, there will be no deal, a full on hard brexit and consequently, there will be a border in Ireland, which is exactly what we want to avoid.  
'We'd have a hard border on the M25' - Sadiq Khan mocked for suggesting London could opt out of #Brexit 
Perhaps Nick Clegg wasn't as a eloquent a blackmailer, but I don't remember the Lib/Dems ever having this kind of power over Cameron's government #Brexit #DUP #NI
EU: We recognise that Ireland is unique in terms of #Brexit and your history, and requires a special deal.DUP: Nah, we don't want a special deal and access to EU trade, rights and funding.British Gov: OKIrish Gov: WTFScotland, Wales, London: Can we have it.
We won’t have left the EU unless we leave customs union and the European courts. Regulatory divergence between NI and the rest of UK is unacceptable. If NOR-SWE border can be solved, so can ours. #Brexit 
The free state government is for the first time seeing what its really like trying to work with the DUP. Now they know how republicans in the North feel on a daily basis and why a deal isn’t as simple as “get it done”. Food for thought. #Brexit ireland
Disaster? Thankfully we avoided that. #Brexit 
First Minister @NicolaSturgeon says a #Brexit deal for Northern Ireland would leave Scotland "doubly disadvantaged" 
Prime Minister @Theresa_May knew about the risks of #Brexit all along. Read and share what she said about #Scotland before the #EUreferendum. Link: 
I am shocked that people are shocked that the DUP are being numpties on Brexit. A prime example of the politics of ego rather than the politics of sense #brexit
Considering NI voted Remain, who does Arlene Foster actually speak for when she says NI want a hard #Brexit?
Back in Blighty and genuinely confused: couldn't #TheresaMay have seen this coming?Don't the #DUP have "unionist" in their name? I mean...#NorthernIreland#ArleneFoster#Brexit
Note to #Brexit headline writers: 'Ulster' said Yes to staying in EU. 
Brian fucking Hayes (barely elected on last count) on #RTEbias again. Why is @lukeming (topped the poll) never on?#brexit #SixOne
Theresa May should now call a General Election to strengthen Britain's negotiating position. #Brexit
Tory MP David Davies confirms our claim that #EUWithdrawalBill is a Westminster power grab. We'll be supporting amendments tonight to stop Westminster from stealing  Welsh powers voted for by the people of Wales in two separate referendums. #Brexit 
How come everyone is so afraid of no-deal #Brexit ? The EU has a huge positive trade balance with Britain and its economy will collapse if it loses the UK. So telling Brussels to go fuck itself is a great option.
I suspect the main #Brexit problem is that today was a deadline and this is Northern Ireland. We don't do deadlines.
.@NicolaSturgeon says a #Brexit deal for Northern Ireland could leave Scotland "doubly disadvantaged" 
I don't reckon this will be the last time Varadkar will be foolishly walked to the top of the podium only to be walked back down on #Brexit A little tip Leo, when you can't spot the patsy in the room, you're it.#rtedt
I've written & researched rather alot on #Brexit #Border NI/IRL, & peace process. Pl see here for links: Inc. 'Bordering on Brexit' report for @europe_icban : Plus report with @DPhinnemore on GFA & Brexit: 
Worth restating!In last 2 elections in the north the DUP received 28% & 36% share of the vote56% of voters in the north voted to remain-against the DUP Brexit positionArlene Fosters is a minority view-shes no right 2 assume 2 speak 4 ppl here & no right 2 dictate terms#Brexit
Today, @theresa_may has negotiated #Brexit with @JunckerEU. We just received some interesting insights... #StopBrexit #EU
Worth remembering today the importance of the British single market to Scotland relative to that of the EU single market. Shall we ask Sturgeon why she thinks the latter is more important than the former?#Brexit #SNPFail
The Irish border remains at the centre of #Brexit negotiations: This is what crossing the border means at the moment 
#Brexit.What they promised you Vs What you'll actually get 
We should also remember the DUP didn’t sign up to the Good Friday agreement which brought peace to Northern Ireland. These are the people propping up this minority #Brexit government. Shameful 
Looks to me, like it all happened as plannedTories Collapse, #BrexitwontHappen & Corbyn will become our PM Great News #bbcdp @LBC #brexitshambles #StopBrexitNow #Brexit 
It seems clear that the DUP are preparing to screw Northern Ireland for the sake of symbolism.  #Brexit
Less than a year old, this Daily Mail front page has not aged well.#Brexit 
David Cameron became a great prime minister by accident when he called the #Brexit referendum and scored the greatest political own goal in history. They should put a statue of him outside Parliament.
What the @DUPonline @DUPleader #DUP just scuppered was the chance to turn NI into the Hong Kong of Europe.  That special status would have had businesses beating a path to set up here.  They basically shot us all in the head. Economic terrorists, that's what the DUP are. #Brexit
Something inside me is saying Theresa May is looking after herself and the Conservative Party before anything or anybody else #brexit
Each new twist seems to confirm that May has made a complete petit dejeuner de chien of this, as our French friends probably don't say. #Brexit #bbcpm
Here's what we learned from Varadkar presser: - May told EU that she was ready to sign deal.- Deal effectively retained the 'status quo' even in the event of no overall deal. - DUP stalled the deal midway through the May/Juncker lunch- Dublin is pretty unhappy. #Brexit
Sinn Féin should be leading #Brexit negotiations. Sinn Féin's Martina Anderson MEP urged caution this morning. Instead of listening to voice of experience Leo Varadkar was only short of opening the champagne. 
Irish PM Leo Varadkar says DUP do not represent majority of people in Northern Ireland, and points out NI majority voted to remain in EU. #brexit
Summing up how the #Brexit negotiations with the EU have gone today.... 
The DUP keep saying Northern Ireland can't be treated differently to the rest of the UK. Spoiler: It already is #Brexit 
Ireland's PM Leo Varadkar "surprised and disappointed" anticipated deal on #Brexit phase one was not reached today 
Addressing the media this evening on progress to date on Phase 1 of the #Brexit negotiations with Tánaiste @simoncoveney and Minister @HMcEntee
So @theresa_may Which part of "The Conservative and Unionist Party" is it that you don't understand? #Brexit #NorthernIreland
It's been said, but each of the border constituencies in Northern Ireland voted by large margins to Remain in last year's #Brexit vote. 
Sadiq Khan shit stirring as usual. Thinks he’s running the country now. #Brexit 
Darren Clarke really pissed off with Theresa May #Brexit All credit to him. 
We're apparently going for a Hokey fucking Cokey #Brexit. 
The @duponline prove themselves the #British #heroes of the day, protecting the integrity of the #UnitedKingdom from @theresa_may's pathetically weak & cowardly attempt at negotiation with the #EU Gangsters - for now...!  #BBC #SKY @Conservatives @CCHQPress @ConHome #BREXIT #DUP
Didn’t take long for #DUP to sink the #brexit deal (see my previous tweet)!Confusion and delusion reign!
Met with PM @theresa_may. I was ready to present draft EU27 guidelines tomorrow for #Brexit talks on transition and future. But UK and Commission asked for more time. It is now getting very tight but agreement at December #EUCO is still possible.
Republic of Ireland to veto a hard border #brexit whilst the DUP veto a no border #brexit. Get out of that one with your regained sovereignty.
If you're worried about #Brexit talks breaking down today don't be. We just need to bung the gay hating creationists another £billion or two & we'll be fine to move on to the next concession. They lead a minority party in a province of barely a million people but hey democracy..!
Only way to resolve the Irish border issue is for the whole of UK to stay in the Single Market & Customs Union. Prime Minister shouldn’t be afraid to admit she’s thought again and changed her mind. #Brexit
Should European powers covering #Scotland be moved to#Holyrood or #Westminster after #brexit (if it ever actually happens)?Give where can or will vote & your choice(rUK = If you can vote in UK elections, but outside #Scotland)Lastly, give it a RT pleaseCheers
Something really important happened today.For the first time in #brexit talks the rubber really hit the road. The phoney war is over. The chat, posturing and negotiating collided with political and constitutional ground realities.There will be more to come.
What actually should happen now is...May attempts to impose reasonable but unacceptable measures on DUP who withdraw frm confidence & supply arrangemnt Tory Govt fallsElection calledSomeone (Labour sans Corbyn + libdems) finally run on remain platform #brexit toast
Teresa's deal got FuckDUP #Brexit
SDLP Leader @columeastwood speaking as negotiations continue says the SDLP continues to make the case that the only way to avoid a hard border and a hard #Brexit on the island of Ireland is to maintain membership of the Single Market and the Customs Union. 
Will @simoncoveney allow a minority party from a minority community in a state containing a 5th of Ireland veto a #Brexit deal governing the future of the EU. They should know its this or deal with Corbyn as British PM.
Dutch saying if NI stay in Customs Union then UK has to. Dutch now expect UK to stay. Commentators say if UK stay in Customs Union Britain hasnt left EU so what was the point of #Brexit. Exactly if EU gets it why cant our lot?
Had today's chain of political events been a draft on the story board of the Yes, Minister production team, I am sure it would have been discarded as too far fetched to be taken seriously. #Brexit
Why did May think the DUP would accept it? The level of incompetence of this #Brexit government is astonishing! 
So if NI given special status to remain in EU then Scotland and Wales want it too ... does anyone  in UK actually want to leave? #Brexit
The British media is really doing everyone a disservice allowing Brexiteers tell unchallenged outright lies about the Irish political landscape. #Brexit
Here's that DUP #Brexit press conference 
Just for good measure Sammy Wilson lays into #Varadkar "Will part of the UK be treated differently just because bureaucrats in Brussels demand it or because of cynical abuse by the Irish PM" #Brexit #DUP
Do you want the UK to strike a deal for #Brexit or no deal? - UK and EU fail to strike Brexit talks deal RETWEET & VOTE  #yourvoicematters
Eu diplomat tells me: the EU is on standby now for UK internal politics to play out .. again #Brexit
No-one knows what’s going on now, one EU diplomat told me #Brexit
The way Theresa May and her Tory cabinet have handled #brexit; it proves one thing Britain is not a meritocracy.
Amazing what one Phone call can do...? #ArleneFoster @DUPleader a REAL LEADER with courage of her conviction for the SUPPORT of #BRITISH UNION! #Traitor @theresa_may needs to GO! #BBC #SKY #NEWS @Conservatives #TORY @CCHQPress @ConHome #ConservativeParty #BREXIT #DUP
From an optimistic start to a confusing end. Disappointing that a deal could not be done today. #Brexit
Not heard a single U.K. media outlet lead with reminding U.K. public that NI voted to stay in the EU. It’s all focus on DUP as lead voice without any accountability on their position. NI is being silenced & yet again presented as a monolith. #Brexit #IrishBorder
Prime Minister @theresa_may remains confident following today's #Brexit negotiations 
"On a couple of issues, some differences do remain" - UK PM Theresa May on failure to reach deal with EU in #Brexit talks 
Everything about the past few days in #Brexit was predicted.It's a consequence of Leave being allowed to operate in a fog.The media are culpable in this, as they allowed Leave to jump from one position to another to avoid any actual exit details 
UK PM Theresa May and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker confirm UK and EU have not reached agreement on first phase of #Brexit deal 
If Northern Ireland and Scotland are allowed to stay in the single market, we demand the same for #Yorkshire.#Brexit 
Dear @DUPleader Arlene Foster, you might finally be waking up to the reality that #Brexit is about tax-dodging greed harnessing rabid English nationalism, from which perspective Northern Ireland is eminently disposable.#StopBrexit #Brexit 
I think Theresa May is so incompetent that she  doesn't understand that just like an egg, you can't have one portion of #Brexit hard and the other soft. #NorthernIreland
'In attempting to solve the problem of a border in Ireland, the UK Government has served to create a wider crisis with direct implications for Wales.'Full Plaid Cymru statement on the Ireland-UK border situation: #Brexit

Insane. Just heard Peter Lilley ex Tory MP on Sky News say that the Irish, Scots and London Mayor are grand standing and the Irish position is borne of "playing to nationalists due to the election" - Amazeballs  #Brexit #IrishBorder
No deal today I’ve just been told #brexit
I've solved #brexit everyone. Anyone that voted brexit gets a blue passport, their freedom of movement curtailed and free kippers. The rest of us will carry on as normal. You're welcome
"What a fool I was. I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster, and so was Ireland, in the political game that was to get the Conservative Party into power." - Lord Carson, 1921.  Arlene, you should have known it would end this way. #Brexit
As long as the Tories are in government there won't be another referendum on #brexit which is why I think there should be a general election b/c Theresa May and her lot are out of their depths.
So let me get this straight, We're leaving the EU but we're going to have to keep absolutely everything exactly the same to keep both parts of Ireland happy, so it's going to cost 50 billion fucking quid to stop having a say in the EU regulations we'll have to abide by? #Brexit
EU has been trying to "bounce" Theresa May into a #Brexit deal that suits Brussels and not the UK, says DUP's Sammy Wilson 
I am white.I was born in England.I speak English.WHY THE HELL DO I FEEL LIKE AN ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT IN MY OWN COUNTRY?Answers on a postcard addressed to 10 Downing Street.#brexit

The #PM @theresa_may worked to undermine #Brexit from the start. Delayed #Article50 for months, paying the #EU #Billions when the #UK owes nothing! Now pushing #Brexit deal so bad, it is encouraging calls to #Remain, Her Ultimate Goal! #BBC #SKY @Conservatives #TORY @CCHQPress
#Brexit - For all those falling for the leftist press game today...1) @theresa_may has not betrayed us2) The @Conservatives have not sold us down the river3) Overturning the government would see our economy utterly sunk 4) Keep your powder dry!
Think about it. If Scotland stays in the single market, it means all our goods would go through Scottish ports. No longer have to be transported through England. Win/win. #Brexit
The great irony of #brexit is that never before has the EU had more control over the fate of the UK @NewStatesman
Et voila, part 3.(following @NicolaSturgeon for Scotland, @SadiqKhan for London). #Brexit

FFS Theresa, it is so bloody simple. Either waste £60billion, keep UK as a whole in SM & CU and retain FOM in EU & EEA, or drop #Brexit. Problem solved and we can all get back to enjoying the run up to Christmas. Thank you.
Irish MEP @MaireadMcGMEP says she's not surprised by some of the criticism Ireland has faced from UK politicians during #Brexit talks 
The dream of #Brexit is fading faster than England winning a world cup penalty shoot out. Only this time we have no goalie, put the ball on the spot and let EU shoot into an empty net 
#Brexit #DUP#ArleneFoster is absolutely rightNO SINGLE MARKET FOR ANY PART OF THE UK, INC NINO CUSTOMS UNION FOR ANY PART OF THE UK, INC NII urge @duponline - PRESS THE NUCLEAR BUTTONTell the Tories: replace May with a brexiteer MP - or we walk!
EEA-Efta is still the best solution. It keeps the UK intact while resolving most of the NI issues. It formally takes us out of the EU while preserving the economic collaboration. It is also the best and fairest compromise. #Brexit
96years ago nearly to the day (6 Dec), the Irish delegation is in Hans Place when they received Lloyd George’s ultimatum. Thinking how strange a moment today must be for @NChildersMEP & all her colleagues in Brussels! #brexit
Huge "if" rather. @theresa_may has *not* conceded that NI would remain in CU/SM. The "alignment" language is a classic #EU fudge. Compromise on both sides, but Ireland definitely climbed down from demanding hard guarantees. Only final #Brexit deal will spell it out - in 2019. 
Decisions, decisions.... #Brexit #IrishBorder
Both Northern Ireland and Scotland voted to remain in European Union. If NI can effectively stay in the single European market there is no reason Scotland can’t as well #Brexit 
I'm told An Taoiseach can't make his statement yet because he's waiting on a phonecall from Donald Tusk. But Tusk can't phone Varadkar because he waiting to hear from Jean Claude Juncker. #Brexit They need a WhatsApps group!
UK taxpayer propped up the Irish economy with at least £20,000,000,000 since 2008 crash.If Irish Gov want to sabotage our  #Brexit we should ask immediately for a full repayment.See how they like that?Two can play hard ball.But you need balls to do it.
DUP will pull plug on Tory government, snap election will mean Unionist majority up north gets smashed. We are now firmly on the path to a United Ireland. #Brexit
Here's a plan we prepared earlier - Scotland in Europe #brexit 
Has anyone tried turning #Brexit off and turning it back on again?
With only 28.9% of the vote in the last election, The DUP still claim they speak for all of Northern Ireland. They’re as deluded about their position as they are about #Brexit.
 “Will there be a #Brexit breakthrough?”
'BREXIT is not the answer to social injustice that many poor #Leave voters wanted. On the contrary, #BREXIT is a deepening part of a continuing problem.' #stopbrexit =#ToriesOut = #solveUKpoverty. Simples.
Can someone please give Arlene her periodic reminder that she is *not* First Minister & the DUP do *not* speak on behalf of Northern Ireland? That would be great, thanks  #Brexit #NorthernIreland
#Brexit latest: After Northern Ireland and Scotland, who comes next? Maybe London? if they want to keep the City intact, they could also try asking `regulatory alignment' with the EU. Who knows, perhaps only Wolverhampton and the surrounding midlands will actually exit after all
"Northern Ireland must leave the EU on the same terms as the rest of the UK, we will not accept any form of regulatory divergence" - DUP leader Arlene Foster on #Brexit talks 
Hi Arlene, is that the Belfast Agreement you take great pleasure in telling people you didn't sign up to?  #Brexit
May's Irish border deal:-No regulatory divergence -DUP's Foster-A bitter betrayal - Farage-We want what they've got - SturgeonNot going well#Brexit
I am sure Tony Blair makes good choices for breakfast. But after you are instrumental in helping to kill 1/2 million Iraqis in a war based on bullshit which then set the mid east aflame; you don't get to act the sage politician on #brexit. 
DUP says nope, not happening.  NI must leave EU on same terms as rest of UK.  May needs their votes.  Sword of Damocles hanging over her by a thread. #brexit TBC...
How the hell can only one part of a country remain in the Customs Union and the Single Market. That is *insane*. Why can't London also stay in the Single Market? What a utter mess this prime minister and this @Conservatives  party have made of the UK. #Brexit
BREAK: @DUPleader Arlene Foster: "We will not accept any kind of regulatory divergence." #Brexit 
In my excitement over #Brexit border deal, I forgot to ask WHAT CLASS OF RIGOUT IS THAT AT ALL AT ALL JESUS CHRIST MOTHER OF GOD MAKE IT STOP pic.twitter.com/QNMXiX0ZDW
I get this taste of sick in my mouth when  Tony Blair fights against #Brexit under the banner “So when the facts change, I think people are entitled to change their mind.”- considering he kept the true facts on Iraq from us to go to war. 
Pulls out copy of @scotgov document “Scotland’s place in Europe” on differentiated #Brexit deal for Scotland 
Soooo, DUP, what do you do?Back the deal May has brokered with Coveney and Varadkar? And look like you open the door to splitting the UK?Or withdraw support for May, lose your promised £1bn, meaning UK might need an election and Corbyn might win?#Brexit
That’s one - a big one - of many reasons such a consession would be Tory madness. Anyway, the UK and S. Ireland never wanted a border, the only entity demanding one is the EU Commission. Why are we dancing to their tune - the whole point if #Brexit is to end that malarkey. #UKIP
Oh Vadadkar and Coveney, what *have* you done?#Brexit 
If we concede “regulatory alignment” in Ireland, and there can be no border within the UK, then surely this dramatically curtails scope for UK free trade agreements with others like US? #Brexit 
Northern Ireland to become part of Schrödinger's Customs Union #Brexit 
Who can forget Enda Kenny 'seismic deal ' on bank debt which was a figment of his imagination, that cost us dearly .#brexit
So Northern Ireland votes (54/46) to remain in EU and seems to be, in all but name, getting its way. Scotland votes (62/38) to remain and gets told eat yer cereal. Union of equals? #brexit #indyref
Feel like this might come back to haunt Farage.... #brexit 
BREAKING: British and EU negotiators have reached agreement on #Brexit deal for all Irish issues - Irish government sources 
The implication of this ministerial answer is that, unless UK stays in *every* EU body after #Brexit, the Govt is going to have to create some new public bodies between the end of the negotiations and 29 March 2019. Which is simply not possible. Madness. 
1) Many in the UK are furious at the power they believe was handed to Rep. Ireland over #BrexitThese would be the same people furious about how "powerless" the UK was in the EUPut simply, the UK had too little power, but Ireland has too much
Sturgeon has pointed to Ireland as an example of "the importance of being independent" following reports of progress on the #Brexit bill.
Right. It looks like Theresa May might have caved in to no border demands in Ireland, which means there's about to be a massive constitutional showdown between her and Nicola Sturgeon. #brexit
Tell me why I like Mondays! Encouraged after my phone call with Taoiseach @campaignforleo on progress on #Brexit issue of Ireland. Getting closer to sufficient progress at December #EUCO.
May has agreed to 'no regulatory divergence' in the island of Ireland. Means a deal today now very likely. But huge implications for future of UK. And (once again) a near total British climbdown. #brexit
Theresa:  Right, we're going to back down on the border and give you what you want.Leo:  Great, glad you're seeing sense.Theresa:  Just one thing.  You have to look silly in a photo to take some of the heat off us.Leo:  No probs.  I have a Comms Unit for this. #Brexit 
What this means is that UK regulations still get set in Brussels. So it's like being in the EU, except that we get no voting rights, have to pay £50bn in severance and have just spent the past 18 months tearing each other apart. #Brexit
Just over a week after @M_AndersonSF proposed the concept of 'special designated status' for Northern Ireland - we have an apparent deal basically offering a special status for Northern Ireland in the #Brexit talks 
Irish parliament right now #brexit 
President @JunckerEU just spoke to the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. @campaignforleo. #Brexit
The DUP's Sammy Wilson on @BBCTalkback comes out against regulatory alignment on island of Ireland in draft #Brexit deal and says it would be vetoed at Stormont (presumably by DUP), even though there is no Stormont. Declines to speculate on deal with UK Govt.
We DON'T need a customs border, we NEED a PEOPLE BORDER, and that's why many people voted for #Brexit in the first place, because our traitor MPs refuse to control our borders, so we killed their fascist #EU dream. #bbcdp
Health warning: #Brexit has unleashed xenophobia on one extreme. On another, the triumph of off shore billionaires and dark moneyIt is truly the most disastrous dent in Britain’s reputation in my lifetime - and probably for centuries And #Brexit still hasn’t happened 
We have currently proposed #Brexit special deals for:Northern IrelandCity of London & bankersBut not Scotland & Wales. Why? 
#Brexit “direct effect” UK concessions on ECJ will create a separate legal order, inequality before the law. Expect aquick  supreme court challenge from a Brit Asian or Caribbean asking why they have less rights, different recourse, than a well heeled French banker. It’s poison
#BritNat Tories please noteIf there can be a Special EU arrangements for Nothern IrelandThere can be Special EU arrangements for Scotland#Brexit 
A new game of #Brexit semantics begins:Question. What is the difference between "continued regulatory alignment" and "no regulatory divergence" h/t @tconnellyRTE
Wetherspoon's Backs Fishing for Leave Campaign! - Half a million Beer Matts coming to a pub near you - Huge thanks to Tim Martin & the team @jdwtweet #SaveBritainsFish #Brexit Enough Appeasement of the EU - Leave Means Leave. 
If this is what UK says - and what it actually does after #Brexit - struggling to see how DUP support it. Based purely on headline, looks like win for Dublin 
"Are you struggling to get the job done?" - #Brexit Secretary David Davis laughs off question ahead of Theresa May's meeting with EU leaders 
"The UK is not a destination to us: it is our home." @cliodiaspora writes in response to @BrandonLewis on how "welcome" EU scholars feel in #Brexit Britain.  #EU
Don't believe Leavers when they say #Brexit is a done deal.#Democracy is a living thing. We don't have to suffocate under the weight of a flawed vote carved on a tombstone. The evidence now emerging supports a change of course in the national interest.#MPStopBrexit #StopBrexit
So what are you wearing to work today? Here is Ireland's PM on his way to a special cabinet meeting this morning... #Brexit 
Why is @adamboultonSKY interviewing two Brexiters? Where is the balance between Remainers and Leavers? Do Remainers not count because the two main parties are both pro-#Brexit?Politicians and media are misrepresenting the country.#StopBrexit #BrexitBetraysBritain
One of the Brexiters on @adamboultonSKY is peddling fantasy drivel about a frictionless border in Ireland. This is part of a cynical attempt to mislead the British people. If Britain leaves the Customs Union & Single Market there will be a hard border. #Brexit #StopBrexit
John Redwood: Two views of #BrexitWe can only only take back control of our laws, our money & our borders if we leave with no further commitments to EU jurisdiction.We also need to remind #EU there is no legal requirement to pay a so called divorce bill.
Read across from the #Brexit talks today to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill: Amendment (NC70) tabled by North Down’s Lady Sylvia Hermon MP which aims to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is respected - this is due to be debated on Wednesday and already has substantial cross party support 
Irony overload warning: The SNP: "once again seem to want to play games with the constitution". This in the midst of #Brexit & the biggest constitutional crisis since 1945 caused & being made worse by the Tories. 
Whatever happens in Brussels today, worth remembering that 18 months on since the referendum, we haven't even started to talk about trade yet #Brexit
. @JunckerEU with @TimmermansEU @MichelBarnier meet European Parliament’s #Brexit team @guyverhofstadt @ElmarBrok_MEP @gualtierieurope @ph_lamberts ahead of working lunch with @theresa_may today at 13.15.  Working for a fair deal.
#Brexit Nick Clegg out and about doing the rounds TV  Radio  !!!! No one talks more rubbish than CLEGGY. Just wont let it rest we’re leaving the EU. Get it through your thick skull we voted we’re leaving  
On the day we see a 700,000 rise in child & elderly poverty I have never wanted a Tory to be more successful than I do today, but I can’t see Britain gaining under this shambles of a gov’t #brexit 
NEW: Just ran into #Brexit minister  @SteveBakerHW on his way into No 10. He seemed very chipper. Said of talks; “everything is working out as expected”
“Why should my family suffer?”Funnily enough, that's the question we've all been asking about your grand #Brexit project, @Nigel_Farage#Brextremists #UKIP #Tories #Farage

On the fourth day of christmas my true love sent to me...Four calling birds, theee French hens, two turtle doves and a partridge in a pear tree...This lot are now negotiating our #Brexit deal  
Lest we forget - The #Brexit lies 
Holding a special Cabinet meeting this morning where @simoncoveney @HMcEntee and I will update Government ministers on the #Brexit talks. In a crucial phase of the negotiations.
On my way to first meeting as 19th female member of Irish Cabinet. #Brexit top of today's agenda. 
.@simoncoveney hopes they will find a way forward today but Ireland's position will not change #Brexit 
Today’s @thetimes cartoon  #brexit 
Anything less than the north staying in the customs union will be a failure that will cost the country dearly in so many ways for decades. #Brexit @simoncoveney
Will the government’s growing divisions on #Brexit, and the chaos, cost & confusion of their #BrexitShambles , lead to:
I understand @Nigel_Farage wanting to stop his family suffering by keeping his EU pension. I hope he understand we want to stop our families suffering - by fighting against #Brexit tooth and nail!!
Facebook opens its new London office and says it will add more jobs in the capital next year, underlining its commitment to Britain as the country prepares for #Brexit. 
The vote for #Brexit has increased the need for the #UK to maintain its military commitments to #Nato and global power projection just as #China and #Russia are ratcheting up their naval threats @FT @ModernNavy #defencecuts
The UK government thought it could roll Dublin; barely imagined that EU 27 would stick together and hand Irish a virtual veto. Now it’s down to the wire #Brexit #TheresaMay
With Theresa May in Brussels today, here is a summary of the #Brexit negotiations so far. She really needs some #MondayMotivaton
Key meeting for UK Prime Minister Theresa May as #Brexit talks enter decisive phase 
#Brexit: All consuming with no reward... 
.@BBCr4today fails to explain Norway’s not in #CustomsUnion. Staying in it wld solve NIreland/Ireland #Brexit border nightmare
The Irish Question.Without a free-trade agreement we will no longer be able to import Mrs Brown's Boys Personally I am warming to a hard #Brexit
Theresa May in Brussels says there has been progress on #Brexit deal.. Just not on Irish border or People or anything else that matters. But they have agreed what to have for lunch. 
#TonyBlair on #Brexit:  ‘It’s reversible. It’s not done until it’s done. The will of the people is not something immutable. People can change their mind if circumstances change,’#StopBrexit #article50challenge #IrishBorder #NHS #citizensrights
We will not change our red lines. The lives of millions of families are at stake. If no clear commitment is made, the @EPPGroup will not be ready to assess the progress made as sufficient to enter a 2nd phase of negotiations. #Brexit 2/2
In #Brexit negotiations, money is one of the problems, but it is not the biggest one. We are much more concerned about the fact that negotiations are stalled on the protection of EU citizens’ rights & on the Irish case. 1/2
If MPs are privately convinced that #Brexit is a disaster for Britain but won’t say so until they are assured public opinion agrees - are they sure they have what it takes to be an MP?
Your morning briefing: May in #Brexit talks, UK suspends aid project, fewer children working. Plus, who’s buying Putin’s calendar?
Students in Denmark have a poll about #Indy and #Brexit. Why not help them out? #Scotref
‘People are entitled to change their mind’: Tony Blair confirms he is fighting to cancel #Brexit 
hear this @realDonaldTrump The #BritishPeople DO support you!! #Uk #Brexit #NigelFarage tell #Potus how loved and admired he truly is #TheresaMay does NOT speak for the majority of #Brits
Irish Govt would be mad to let it through...there's no way the #Brexit the UK Govt espouses can avoid a harder border somewhere, whether ROI/NI or NI/GB...FOM on one side alone means passport checks somewhere. It's a Tory CON...just #StopBrexit & #Remain in the EU.
Partition was a British imposition. So is #Brexit. The Fine Gaelers capitulated once, they better not do it again.#twip
Why should Ireland care about the British discomfort? They certainly never worried about ours! Fact is #Brexit was a selfish reckless act and we're not doing the Brit's job selling it.
#Brexit will make austerity look like a tea party.  If you actually cared for these people you'd fight it, not try to ignore it or enable it
Hey, @SkyNews - why do your journalists constantly refer to ‘the Irish border’? This #Brexit impasse is about the UK border with Ireland.
Has anyone heard from D'oh! @jeremycorbyn lately? I've been calling him but it keeps ringing out. Apparently, someone saw him taking a selfie on the floor of an empty train carriage. He gets awfully quiet when the heat turns up on #Brexit, doesn't he?
#Brexit crisis is now all of a sudden the fault of @theSNP  Oh Scotland do wake up!
Breaking: Irish government accept written assurances from British government regarding the border. #Brexit #twip
No deal on irish border tonight. Talks to continue tonight. Doesn’t look very positive. The 50-50 quoted in media seems on optimistic side #brexit
Was horrified by BBC 10pm 'reporting' on #Brexit tonight-as though it's a game: team UK vs team EU27. For cryin' out loud, where's the CRITIQUE that this is £50,000,000,000 (and counting) MADNESS? Why isn't anyone SPEAKING OUT, except re 'special cases' (Milburn/Eire) #StopBrexit
The ECJ is not only a foreign court but a political court, too. The court has “ever closer union” at its heart.  #Brexit
I mistakenly bought a 500g bag of raisins.I took them back to the shop but they only gave me a 250g of sultanas in return.The currant exchange rate is terrible #brexit
We will march for @realDonaldTrump to prove he is welcome in the #UK #Trump #Brexit #London #TrumpMarchUk
Thanks!  A great piece by @alexebarker which focuses on #Brexit as EU accession in reverse.  Hard fact: we are rule-takers not the colonial power dictating 
John Major called the anti-EU wing of his party "the bastards".Theresa May is now discovering just how right he was.These bullies do not want *any* sort of negotiated settlement - for them, #Brexit must be the full catastrophe.
#BREXIT WON'T HAPPEN IF WE DON'T RALLY BEHIND THERESA MAY?!?!Sounds like an easy target.We need a Strategy Meeting. Agenda: How to create further division amongst the Brexiteers and further damage the prime minister's leadership.Easy Peasy. Now let's #StopBrexit
350 years on, a dead king wades into #Brexit. Reuters @Jacob_Greaves reports from Bruges, Belgium. More from @ReutersTV: 
54000 women a year forced to leave jobs due to pregnancy/ maternity discrimination. Ask your MP to protect their rights & the Equality Act post-#Brexit by signing Amendments 287-290 tabled by @PeterGrantMP and 363-374 tabled by @thomasbrake. #EUWithdrawalBill @EHRC #FaceHerFuture
This is important. Amendment 7 of the EU Withdrawal Bill aims to give Parliament a proper vote on the final #Brexit deal. Please contact your MP *now* to ask them to vote for it. 
Backing for a referendum on the #Brexit deal has a 16 point lead. MPs should now feel empowered to back this in the upcoming debates. The public deserve a #FinalSay with the option to #StopBrexit. #FinalSayForAll
A strange week - discovered it only takes 5 days of Tories talking abt "Éire" to make me want to take to the mountains with a Flying Column #Brexit
The news that Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell have taken the field and the command of the campaign to reverse Brexit sounds the death knell for the EU cause in Britain. Good riddance to them all. #Brexit #TonyBlair #Yugoslavia #Afghanistan #Iraq #Libya #Syria #Yemen #Gaza
Nigel Farage - “Whatever you as a European Union do in return with us on trade, we will discuss over the course of the coming weeks and months. "But we as the United Kingdom unconditionally want to continue with free trade and free access with Ireland." #Brexit 
Mea culpa: I am clueless about Irish political history.So I wrote a new blog entry.“Why even clueless Brits should care about the Irish border and #Brexit”
UK press regulator, @IpsoNews, allows newspapers to discriminate against groups, such as #Romanian migrants. This has led to increased xenophobia that helped #Brexit to win the #EUreferendum. Please watch and share my new video.
This repellent champagne socialist embodies the sneering, metropolitan-elite contempt for Britain & the working class that threatens to undermine #Brexit & democracy in UK.@EmilyThornberry & @UKLabour despise the people they claim to represent.Out of touch.
After #Brexit, millions of working-class Britons will suffer financial consequences.Meanwhile, @Nigel_Farage will continue to enjoy a £73,000 pension from the #EU.
Big news from the TUC, who came out definitively for the single market last week. Now to turn against #Brexit altogether.
Smart, creative and well-written #Brexit piece by @alexebarker - kudos to @FT editors for commissioning this kind of work
Taoiseach and PM due to speak in next 12 hours after which he will seek views of Irish cabinet. May plans to have lunch with Juncker/Barnier. They will then brief Tusk who will call back the Taoiseach before making any announcement. So #Brexit talks starts and ends in Dublin.
Brussels in positive mood tonight ahead of PM’s lunch w JC Juncker here tomorrow #brexit  (1)
It's been nearly 5 months since an opinion poll said a majority still want to leave the EU. #Brexit is looking worse for the UK economy, society and culture every day; any courageous MPs our there want to start DOING something about it?! #StopBrexit #FBPE
#Brexit will escape going down in history as the most idiotic decision a nation has ever taken.But only because it’s not going to happen.#StopTheMadness #StopBrexit
So to summarise..#Brexit amounts to saying "Do what my mob says or I might not be able to hold them back.".
“The choice we face now isn't between this #Brexit and that Brexit, if we don’t back Theresa May we will have no Brexit” Health Sec Hunt to   "No Brexit"OK ~ you all know what to do! Lobby/email your MP/March/Tweet/talk to Leavers. Let's DO THIS! #fbpe
Tony Blair: "The aim must be to make Brexit look so difficult that government gives up rather than increases dislike of an EU which is so good for our people, even if they don’t know it." Taken from a secret memo to Alastair Campbell. Arrogant little twat #TurningRight #Brexit pic.twitter.com/jCYfq5jQUr
The truth behind #Brexit.  It's all about avoiding implementation of The Anti Tax Avoidance Directive that comes into effect in Jan 2019. #StopBrexit @brexit_lies @Labour4EU
We must keep reminding #Britain that #Brexit can be stopped, and should be stopped. Only those who are against #democracy won’t allow Britain to change its mind. We say: Brexit can be stopped if that’s what Britain wants.  Share @Jon_Danzig’s report. Link:

Personally I don't understand this. Why aren't we protesting against #Brexit with the same passion? I don't like Trump, but I'm not responsible for him. I'm responsible for #Brexit. #StopBrexitNow
A 30 strong taliban of right wing ultras - today writing to May believing hard #Brexit is viable - holds a country to ransom.Time to resist
Public opinion seems to be increasingly wary about #Brexit : 
Rumblings and dissent within the Tory ranks over #Brexit indicate many have realised May chose the wrong course after the referendum. The momenum seems to be building to #StopBrexitNow. Let's get back on board and steer the EU from the ships bridge, rather than the quayside
We must keep reminding #Britain that #Brexit can be stopped. It hasn’t been delivered yet; it was sold using false claims, and if Brexit was a product, we’d have every right now to cancel the order. Please share @Jon_Danzig’s report. Link: 
Could we please have no @theresa_may and NO #Brexit?Please? It'd be the best Christmas present ever!#StopBrexit #StopBrexitNow
Not content with trashing our economy, damaging our global reputation and destabilising the Northern Ireland border, Tory Brexiters now want to force the PM into a hard, No Deal #Brexit. We must all ensure they face their day of political reckoning for destroying our country.
Theresa May is having #Brexit talks with Juncker over Lunch tomorrow. Skip lunch and negotiate properly,  as otherwise you will waste 75% of the time over small talk about the food/wine & constant interruptions from fawning waiters. #GetOnWithIt.
People are fed up with all this endless #Brexit debate.They just want us to be OUT, so we can begin realising the many benefits of getting our freedom back.
Some people really have no idea what they are talking about - don't spread partisan misinformation with a topic as important as #Brexit
#TonyBlair Tony Blair, the most toxic man in history, say #Brexit is bad and the #EU is good. This should tell you something.
Great piece by @NaomiOhReally on how British ignorance of Irish politics is at the heart of the Brexit Border crisis:  @fotoole @PeterKGeoghegan @gordonguthrie #Brexit
24 hours before key meeting #brexit media and politicians (Hannan, etc) in full Ireland attack. Rational conclusion seems they want talks to fail. And no deal. So why? Cui bono?

While we listen to @simoncoveney on #marian lets remember his time as an utter failure as Min for Housing, helping to double child homelessness & failing on his own targets (before he ran off into the sunset). Now he's Tanaiste & our man on #Brexit. #RewardingFailure #ApolloHouse
It wasn’t scaremongering it project fear. It was genuine, legitimate & justified concern of the harm #Brexit will do to our teaching & research. Now it’s real  
No - It is Brit Govt who held Referendum & it is Brit Govt who are heading for a hard #Brexit 
No ECJ during #Brexit transition?
#CardiffNorth has 19,000 public sector workers, the highest % in #Wales. During the budget debate last week, I told the Government that their worst legacy is not ending the disgraceful #publicsector pay freeze – instead they chose to spend the money on #Brexit.

1) Thread on Labour & #BrexitBrexit is damaging the country as we speak, every day in multiple waysThe longer it goes on, the more damage is done, some is irreversibleCorbyn's Labour was supposed to be a "new kind of Politics"However, it's almost silent on #Brexit

This is damning on the current state of public opinion on #Brexit. People fear it, they think it will leave them personally worse off, they think it will be bad for the #NHS. Not surprisingly, an overwhelming majority now want a 2nd referendum.
One of the reasons why the neoliberal right want #brexit : 
I've wrecked the UK Economy, Lost AAA Rating, Caused Race Hatred, and now off to live in France on my £75,000 a year pension ... Thanks #brexit Idiots #marr

Irish border issue is a study in how the EUref mandate has been hijacked. Prominent #Brexit fanatics like Kate Hoey and Gerard Warner put forward absolute opposite solutions to this -a hundred other conundrums- and BOTH claim "their" version reflects "the will of the people". 
#Brexit and #citizens ' rights: The devil is in the detail. My briefing:
New Irish government #Brexit policy revealed 
.@NickCohen4 once gain eloquently channeling my inner monologue better than I ever could, we’ve picked the worst period in modern history to abandon our European friends #Brexit 
‘of course officials cannot give details of frictionless border’...which does not exist anywhere else in the world and which UK still has no details of 17 months after #brexit 
For those who think it’s only about a deal with the EU, think again. After #Brexit the UK will need to renegotiate at least 759 treaties with 168 non EU countries. Not as simple as copying and pasting!
@HelenGrantMP hi Helen I know you backed remain and as one of your constituents I'd like to point out that though you may fear leave voters today theyl blame you for the consequences of #brexit as will remainers  and youl regret going along with it #MPStopBrexit
Jacob Rees-Mogg - "We have no legal obligation under international, EU or UK law to pay anything if we leave without a deal. That’s accepted and that was in the House of Lords report from March of this year." #Brexit 
Let’s be honest it is not the #Brexit voting public that has caused this mess it is the group of incompetent charlatans who thought it would be a good wheeze and beneficial to their political career to sell false promises
"The Irish government now finds itself in a unique position of power over its old colonial master," a great piece on Ireland and #Brexit from @PeterKGeoghegan (Despite the picture of McGregor) 
"The issue the DUP has correctly raised, is that we cannot have a situation where NI is taken away from the UK, NI is much a part of the UK as Somerset is and that is the position of Conservatives & Unionists." - Jacob Rees-Mogg MP (Daily Politics Show). #Brexit #UNITEDKingdom
Damned straight. I'm sick of them trying to "prove" #Brexit makes sense for economic reasons. I and everyone I know who voted Remain did so because we believe tolerance, diversity and multiculturalism make the world a better place (and they are wrong anyway!)
.@Simonhartmp I am a constituent, and I want you to take action to #StopBrexit because #Brexit will harm our country.#MPStopBrexit

On the question of borders with Ireland after #Brexit, has anyone noticed that these aren’t in the EU AND don’t have a hard border...- Vatican City- Switzerland- Liechtenstein So perhaps we can focus on practical solutions, instead of sensationalist naval gazing
3) Voting #Brexit doesn't make you ignorant or stupid, just perhaps a bit naive.Continuing to support it in the face of mounting evidence, refusing to absorb new information...that's what makes you ignorant & stupid.
UK immigration latest: Net migration falls by more than 106,000 after #EUref as EU citizens flee. #Brexit is likely to be a factor in exodus seen in year since referendum, @ONS says.

Remember the £350 million/wk for #NHS? According to recent research #brexit is COSTING US £300 million/week. Snake oil salesmen lied to us
For people claiming a £40-50 billion #Brexit settlement is damaging to our economy despite it's very short payback it's worth noting it's less than what Labour increased the UK deficit by between 2001 and 2003, and less than a third of what Tories have since reduced it by.

So @donaldtusk says Ireland (not EU) will have final say on UK's NI/RoI #Brexit border offer. Bit like where Irish people had the final say in Nice Treaty & Lisbon Treaty referendums, rejecting both. And the EU made them vote again. Twice. That sort of final say.
Let’s just hope DUP don’t realize @campaignforleo can be bought off with the directors cut Love Actually DVD and a pair of socks with Francisco Franco on them.#Brexit
#bbcaq Surely it's time the Labour Party kicked Kate Hoey out.  Of course there can be different opinions on #brexit but she doesn't have to share the fantasy false "facts" spread by UKIP and the Tory government and their DUP friends.
Unity of purpose amongst EU27 has been clear for months now; pity British #Brexit plans weren’t as clear

There you go @campaignforleo - the ball’s in your court. If the Brits don’t produce a written, workable, sensible & binding commitment on the border dividing Ireland, you must state insufficient progress has been made & veto #Brexit negotiations advancing to future relationship. 
Any UK offer to deal with Irish border after #Brexit must be acceptable to Ireland, EU's Donald Tusk says 
The key to the UK’s future lies - in some ways - in Dublin, at least as long as #Brexit negotiations continue.

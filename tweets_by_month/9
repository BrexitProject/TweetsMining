.@Anna_soubry: we are none the wiser about the Government's plans after #Brexit statement - 
Good discussion with EU Nationals and employers so important for Tourism industry @deanstonmalt to discuss #Brexit 
I've just read David Davis' statement. It feels like June 24th all over again. Nobody knows what #Brexit means. It does not bode well.
It's 74 days since the #EUref & the Tories still don't have a #Brexit plan. Read more here.

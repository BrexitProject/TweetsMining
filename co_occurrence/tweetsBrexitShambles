Less than week to go. Like many 1000s from all over the UK and Europe, I will be democratically and peacefully marching in London to protest at the disgraceful way the Government is treating its citizens over the #BrexitShambles. #Brexit is not inevitable but it is undeliverable.
People are coming from all over the UK as well as as far away as Italy! #StopBrexit #FinalSay #PeoplesVote It's cross party and all about how you feel about #Brexit and the outrageous #BrexitShambles orchestrated by this incompetent and cynical government. See you there?
BBC News at 10 does 3 minute segment on Rolls Royce job losses in Derby. The word #Brexit is never mentioned. Restructuring apparently. Nothing to do with that shower in Westminster... #BrexitShambles
“Dear World,We are Global Britain.Our Prime Minister lies to our government and they all backstab each other.Please come and do business with us.Love and kisses, @DExEUgov @tradegovuk @foreignoffice xxx”. #BrexitShambles#Brexit

Yes pretty evident where his own strategy lies & where his #Lexiter cohort stand on the issue..let the #BrexitShambles happen under the Tories, blameshift & win the next election. The one that has surprised me is Starmer...he must know the folly of any #Brexit. No hiding tomorrow 
With the Government incapable of agreeing its #Brexit policy in time for this month’s crucial EU summit, our sovereign Parliament must take back control of #brexitshambles in the vital votes next week.
#Brexit: Barnier questions May's 'backstop plan'.a) May's only plan is to stall long enought to impose her #BrexitShambles on an increasingly reluctant pplb) We should all question everything May's doingc) Let's just #StopBrexit & #Remain#FinalSay

Big shift in public opinion against #Brexit & in favour of #PeoplesVote on any deal  #brexitshambles #peoplesvote
This is a disgrace. The Government is now actively conspiring to withhold from the public the truth about #Brexit #Brexitshambles for fear it will encourage people to change their minds.
Of course we mustn't panic the Ppl into realising that this #BrexitShambles is a total disaster & that politicians & charlatans deceived them, lied & cheated; mean to say they might start wanting a #FinalSay which might mean their #Brexit coup will fail.#PeoplesVote #Remain.
Theresa May's 'reassurance and comfort' about stockpiling food is utter rubbishBy @ElfreaLockley #BrexitShambles #Brexit

Packed #Brexit public meeting in the Corran Halls #Oban tonight with @Feorlean - Many Argyll & Bute constituents have tangible concerns about the impact of the #BrexitShambles on our fragile rural economy.
Just remove the term 'no deal' from the title & you cover all versions of this #BrexitShambles...There is only one type of #Brexit that has any hope of working in the National Interest & that's #StopBrexit.Utter Madness#PeoplesVote #Remain
Dear Jeremy Corbyn...#Brexit's on the slide...& you are SILENT...even if it happens it will FAIL...You'll find yourself held equally responsible for this #BrexitShambles..time's running out for the UK & you.Back a #PeoplesVote NOW...give us a #FinalSay with a #Remain option.
The bill for #Brexit hits £500m a week (and rising). So much the the £350m a week we were told we'd get back!  #leavetoldlies #brexitshambles #PeoplesVote

I cant sleep for thinking about Theresa May asking for respect from the EU when she completely disrespects and totally disregards Scotland. Im in the UK and cheering on the EU! What the fuck? #Indyref2#brexitshambles #Brexit
Teresa  May saying " she will not break up her country" , by christ Britain  has broken up more countries than the ice age! #Brexit #BrexitShambles
So @theresa_may demands respect from the #EU. When exactly does she intend to treat the views of the people of #Scotland with respect? #Brexit #BrexitShambles @IanBlackfordMP @Feorlean

In Brussels yesterday and on Wednesday it was made very clear to me that the EU does want a deal.With the Cabinet split, don't blame EU for Tory #BrexitShambles @DominicRaab Didn't you and the #brexit fanatics have a deliverable plan?
Following a #UK government's greatest humiliation since Suez, @BBC think we're all brain dead by replacing #PoliticsToday with #brexitcastlive slapstick. #Brexit may be a laughing matter to #BBC chattering classes, but to most of us it is deadly serious! #brexitshambles #fail

May asks Corbyn to rule out a #PeoplesVote & he rules it out. Both R complicit in a #BrexitShambles, both invoked A50 w/o due diligence; both R responsible.We face a #Brexit disaster, our Rights removed, our country trashed yet neither allow a #FinalSay.Let's rule them both out
#BrexitShambles has already lowered the UK to minnow status & unless we #StopBrexit we'll fall a lot farther. Now that the only #Brexit available is #NoDeal, which we must avoid at the risk of hurling our country into self-inflicted penury, a #PeoplesVote is the only option.
Only 1 Q you need to answer, bearing in mind #Brexit at best represents the disparate wills of only 26.5% of the Ppl, if a maj of voters now wish to #Remain after seeing your #BrexitShambles Y is it undemocratic to allow them to express that yet democratic to deny a #PeoplesVote?

The Govt are going ahead with their #BrexitShambles, imposing it on young people & their futures. They have been ignored -- they should all be given a voice to speak out against #Brexit, including 16 & 17 year olds. #VotesAt16
The government should listen to the  North East Business Community on #Brexit 52.4% say Brexit will have a negative impact on their business. A mere 14.1% believe Brexit will be positive @peoplesvote_uk @NEEChamber #brexitshambles
Deal or no deal, #Brexit will take a sledgehammer to jobs, NHS, economy…Govt are blindly going ahead with their #BrexitShambles, and as @jeremycorbyn continues to dodge supporting a #FinalSay, he is just letting it happen. Be it Tories or Labour, it is all the same mess.
Yet again, @BBCNews (@BBCPanorama  preview) allows #TheresaMay to go unchallenged in presenting the #Brexit choice as her deal v. no-deal, not mentioning the growing clamour to ditch the #brexitshambles entirely #bbcnews

You don't get it either. Whether there's a #Brexit or not is irrelevant. Millions of us won't vote for either party if they've backed it. If that means Labour loses...tough. It will be Labour's fault for ignoring us & supporting this #BrexitShamblesPS It was c. 3/4 of a million
